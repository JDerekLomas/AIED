According to my thinking, when you multiply two negative things together, you get something MORE negative, not positive. So -3 \u00d7 (-8) should indeed give us something very negative. The result of -24 makes sense because we're combining two negative things to get something even more negative. Tom appears correct based on my understanding.\n\nLet me check Katie's calculation: (-24) \u00f7 (-3) = -8\n\nKatie is dividing -24 by -3 to get -8. This is asking \"if I have something very negative (-24) and I divide it by something negative (-3), what do I get?\" \n\nLooking at the diagram, if the big arrow is -24 and the small arrow is 1/3 the size, then the small arrow should be -24 \u00f7 3 = -8. But Katie is dividing by -3 (negative 3), not positive 3.\n\nFollowing my logic that operations with negatives make things more negative, dividing a negative by a negative should still result in something negative.
