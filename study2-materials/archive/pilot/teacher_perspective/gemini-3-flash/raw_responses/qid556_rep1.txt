<explanation>The most common error is choosing option D (-9). Students frequently associate "getting rid of" a number with subtraction, regardless of the relationship between the coefficient and the variable. Many students see the 9 and instinctively want to subtract it to "leave the y alone." Another subset of students (choosing B) understands that 9 and y are multiplied, but they fail to apply the inverse operation, instead repeating the operation they see implied in the expression 9y.</explanation>
