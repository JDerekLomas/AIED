<explanation>The primary reason students answer incorrectly is 'left-to-right' processing. Despite being taught BIDMAS/BODMAS, many students instinctively treat mathematics as a language read from left to right. Option A (1+2) is the most common error because it is the first operation encountered. Even students who remember the acronym often struggle with the 'B' (Brackets), mistakenly believing the bracket must be 'expanded' or 'removed' by multiplying (Option B) before looking at what is inside it. By Year 11, while most understand the priority of brackets, a significant minority still default to linear calculation under time pressure or when they see 'easy' numbers like 1+2 at the start.</explanation>
