<explanation>Students frequently struggle with the 'directed numbers' aspect of quadratic factorisation. While many can identify that 3 and 2 are the required factors of 6, they often mix up the signs. Option D is the most common error because students correctly identify that one sign must be positive and one negative to achieve -6, but they incorrectly assign the positive sign to the larger magnitude (3) instead of the negative, resulting in +x instead of -x. Option B is also a common pitfall for those who forget that two negatives must multiply to a positive.</explanation>
