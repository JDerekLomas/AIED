<explanation>This question is high-level as it requires both the recall of the sphere volume formula and the ability to rearrange a complex formula involving a fraction, Pi, and a cube root. Most Year 7 and 8 students will not have encountered the sphere formula yet. The most common error is option A, where students identify the correct components (4, 3, Pi, and cube root) but fail to apply inverse operations correctly, often multiplying by the numerator and dividing by the denominator of the coefficient. Many students also struggle with the visual 'look' of the formula, choosing A because it resembles the original volume formula structure more closely than the correct rearrangement.</explanation>
