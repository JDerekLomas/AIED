<explanation>The most common error is processing the calculation from left to right, ignoring the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students often calculate 4 + 12 = 16, then 16 ÷ 4 = 4 (Option D). Even students who remember the acronym often struggle with the "brackets first" rule when a division precedes the bracket, or they incorrectly prioritize the addition at the start because it appears first reading left-to-right. Option A (10) is another common error where students handle the brackets correctly but then add before dividing (4+12=16, 16/2=8, 8+2=10 or similar variations), but the pure left-to-right "reading" error is the most prevalent in secondary school diagnostic testing.</explanation>
