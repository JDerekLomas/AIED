<explanation>The most common error is failing to correctly multiply two negative numbers. Students often correctly multiply -3 by m to get -3m, but then see the minus sign in (m-2) and simply 'bring it down', or they wrongly apply the rule that 'a minus and a minus make a minus'. This leads them to Option B (-3m - 6). A smaller cohort of students may struggle with the initial term or forget to multiply the second term entirely, but the sign error on the constant term remains the most persistent misconception across all secondary year groups, even among higher-tier GCSE students.</explanation>
