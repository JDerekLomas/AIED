<explanation>The most common error is failing to recognize that multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive. Students frequently correctly multiply -5 by m to get -5m, but then simply 'bring down' the minus sign from the bracket or calculate -5 multiplied by 7 as -35, leading to option B. A secondary error is forgetting to multiply the second term entirely, but in a multiple-choice format, the sign error on the constant term is the dominant pitfall across all Key Stages.</explanation>
