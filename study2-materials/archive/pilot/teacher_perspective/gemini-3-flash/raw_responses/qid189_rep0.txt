<explanation>The primary misconception is a failure to apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly. Students often read the expression from left to right, performing the subtraction before the multiplication: (1 - 3) * 15 = -2 * 15 = -30 (Option D). Additionally, many students struggle with directed numbers; those who do multiply first (3 * 15 = 45) often calculate 45 - 1 = 44 or 1 - 45 = 46 (Option B) due to confusion with negative number arithmetic rules. Year 7 and 8 students frequently haven't mastered the formal 'u_n' notation, leading to higher error rates.</explanation>
