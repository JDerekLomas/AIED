<explanation>The most common error stems from a rigid, literal interpretation of the BIDMAS/BODMAS acronym. Students often believe that 'Addition' must always come before 'Subtraction' because 'A' precedes 'S' in the mnemonic. Consequently, they calculate Tom's left side as (3+2)-1 = 4, but incorrectly calculate his right side as 3-(1+2) = 0, leading them to believe Tom is wrong. While they usually recognise Katie is correct due to the commutativity of addition and the priority of multiplication, their misunderstanding of the equal priority of addition and subtraction leads them to select Option B.</explanation>
