<explanation>The most common error is the 'add across' misconception, where students treat the numerators and denominators as independent whole numbers (3+1=4 and 5+4=9), leading to answer A. This is a persistent intuitive error that often resurfaces even after the correct common denominator method has been taught. Students choosing B are likely confusing addition with multiplication rules, while those choosing C often find the correct denominator (20) but fail to scale the numerators correctly, often just adding the original numerators (3+4=7 or 3+1=4 then adding 3 more).</explanation>
