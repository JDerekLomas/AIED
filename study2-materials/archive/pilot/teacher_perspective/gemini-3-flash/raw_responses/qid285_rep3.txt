<explanation>Students struggle with the multi-step nature of this rearrangement. The most common error (Option A) stems from two specific misconceptions: firstly, the 'same operation' error where students see a square and think they must square the other side to 'balance' it, rather than taking the square root (inverse). Secondly, students often fail to recognize that 'r' is multiplying the omega term, leading them to either ignore it or incorrectly combine it. Option D is also a frequent distractor for higher-tier students who know to square root but apply the operation before the division, failing to understand the correct order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) in reverse when rearranging.</explanation>
