<explanation>The most common error in early algebra is the 'additive misconception' where students see numbers and variables and simply add them all together regardless of their position relative to the equals sign. In this specific case, students look at $x+4=2x+2$ and instinctively combine the terms ($1x+2x=3x$ and $4+2=6$) to get $3x=6$ (Option D). They fail to recognise that to 'move' a term to the other side of the equation, they must use the inverse operation. Even students who understand the concrete representation (the cups and counters) often revert to simple arithmetic addition when translating it into abstract algebraic notation.</explanation>
