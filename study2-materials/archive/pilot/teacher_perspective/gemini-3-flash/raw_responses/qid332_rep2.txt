<explanation>The most common error is selecting 'Both' (Option C). Students frequently misunderstand the distributive property of multiplication when applied to an entire equation. They correctly identify that Tom has added 5 to both sides (inverse of -5), but they wrongly believe Katie's method is also valid because they see "multiply by 3" as the inverse of "divide by 3". They fail to realise that if you multiply by 3, you must multiply *every* term, including the -5, making the correct line x - 15 = 36. This 'partial multiplication' is one of the most persistent algebraic misconceptions in KS3 and KS4.</explanation>
