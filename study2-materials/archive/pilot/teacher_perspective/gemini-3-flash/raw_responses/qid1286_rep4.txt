<explanation>This question is highly challenging as it combines three distinct skills: recall of the sphere volume formula, rearranging an equation with fractional coefficients, and handling powers/roots. 

Year 7 and 8 students will almost all fail because they have likely not been taught the sphere volume formula or the cube root function. 

In Years 9-11, the most common error is selecting Option A. This happens because students often struggle with the "inverse" nature of rearranging; they see the 4/3 and pi in the formula and simply multiply them by V rather than dividing. Option B is also a common distractor for students who correctly divide by pi but fail to correctly invert the 4/3 fraction (multiplying by 4 and dividing by 3 instead of vice versa). Option D represents a failure to understand that the cube root must apply to the entire expression, not just the V.</explanation>
