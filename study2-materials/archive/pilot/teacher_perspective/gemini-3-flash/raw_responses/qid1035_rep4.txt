<explanation>The most frequent error is Option B, where students correctly distribute the negative to the first term but fail to recognize the 'double negative' for the second term. Many students view the minus sign in front of the bracket as a instruction to simply 'make the expression negative' rather than a multiplication by -1. Even higher-ability students often make a 'slippage' error here, correctly identifying that the first term is -2 but then simply 'bringing down' the original -3p without applying the distributive property to it. Option A is also common among younger students who ignore the leading negative sign entirely.</explanation>
