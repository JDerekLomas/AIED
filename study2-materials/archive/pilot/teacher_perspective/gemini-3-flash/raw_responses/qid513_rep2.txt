<explanation>The primary misconception here is the "operation matching" error. In Step 1, students see a minus 4 and instinctively subtract 4 from 15 (getting 11) rather than adding it. In Step 2, they see a 2p (multiplication) and instinctively multiply 11 by 2 (getting 22) rather than dividing. Many students find Isaac's logic "consistent" because he is using the numbers present in the equation, leading them to choose Option C (Both steps are correct). They mistake the performance of an operation for the performance of the *correct* inverse operation. Even higher-ability students can fall into this trap if they are rushing and not checking their solutions by substitution.</explanation>
