<explanation>The most common error is failing to distribute the negative sign to the second term within the brackets. Students often treat the negative sign as a prefix that only applies to the first term (resulting in -2) but then simply "bring down" the -3p. This is compounded by the "invisible 1" misconception, where students don't recognise the leading minus as -1 multiplied by the bracket. Option B is the classic distractor for students who understand the first term changes sign but forget the 'negative times a negative equals a positive' rule for the second term.</explanation>
