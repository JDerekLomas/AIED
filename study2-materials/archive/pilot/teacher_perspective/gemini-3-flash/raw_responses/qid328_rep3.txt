<explanation>The most common error is Option B (3/12), where students apply the "add across" strategy—simply adding the numerators (2+1) and the denominators (9+3). This stems from a lack of understanding that fractions represent parts of a whole and require a common denominator to be combined. Option C is also a common distractor for students who recognise they need a common denominator but fail to adjust the numerator of 1/3 accordingly, simply adding the existing numerators over the larger denominator.</explanation>
