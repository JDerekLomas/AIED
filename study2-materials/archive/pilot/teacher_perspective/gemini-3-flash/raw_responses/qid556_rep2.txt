<explanation>The most common error is choosing D (-9) because students often associate the removal of a number with subtraction, regardless of the operation connecting it to the variable. They see a 9 and want it gone, so they "take it away." Additionally, many students struggle to recognise that 9y represents 9 multiplied by y, leading them to misidentify the inverse operation required. In Year 7 and 8, the confusion between coefficient-variable relationship and additive relationships is particularly prevalent.</explanation>
