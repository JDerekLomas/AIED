<explanation>The most common error is option A, where students see the numbers 3 and 12 and instinctively perform a division (12 ÷ 3) without considering the structure of the equation or the fact that the 12 is in the denominator. This stems from a "number bond" reflex where students look for a "nice" integer relationship. Option C is also common among lower-ability students who simply multiply 3 by 12 but ignore the fraction. The specific misconception of using the same operation (multiplying by 3 because they see a 3) leading to 3/12 (1/4) is a classic error in fractional equations.</explanation>
