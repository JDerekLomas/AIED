<explanation>The primary error is the 'Left-to-Right' bias. Students often read mathematical expressions like a sentence, leading them to select Option A (0.5 ÷ 0.2) because it is the first operation encountered. Even students who remember the BIDMAS/BODMAS acronym often struggle with nested brackets; they see the outer brackets and then immediately revert to scanning left-to-right within them, overlooking the innermost set of parentheses. Additionally, the presence of decimals increases the 'cognitive load', making students more likely to fall back on intuitive left-to-right processing rather than systematic rule application.</explanation>
