<explanation>The primary misconception is the "Left-to-Right" error. Students calculate 12 ÷ 2 = 6, then add 1 to get 7, and finally multiply by 2 to get 14 (Option C). This is particularly common because the calculation flows naturally across the page. Another significant error is Option A (9), where students correctly divide first, but then perform the addition before the multiplication (6 + 1 = 7, then 7 x 2 = 14 is common, but some do 12 ÷ 2 = 6 and 1 + 2 = 3, then 6 + 3 = 9). Despite BIDMAS/BODMAS being taught early in Year 7, the visual pull of the operations in sequence often overrides the formal rules, especially under time pressure or in non-calculator contexts.</explanation>
