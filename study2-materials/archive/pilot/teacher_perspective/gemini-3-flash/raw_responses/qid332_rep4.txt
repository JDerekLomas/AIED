<explanation>The most common error is selecting 'Both' (C) because students often believe they can multiply by the denominator (3) to 'get rid of the fraction' without applying that multiplication to every term in the equation. Katie's error—multiplying the x/3 and the 12 by 3, but forgetting to multiply the -5—is a classic 'malrule' in algebra. Students see the 36 and think she has correctly balanced the equation, failing to realise that to maintain equality, the -5 must also become -15. Younger students or lower-attaining KS4 students often prioritise 'clearing the fraction' as a first step but lack the conceptual understanding of distributive property required to do it correctly.</explanation>
