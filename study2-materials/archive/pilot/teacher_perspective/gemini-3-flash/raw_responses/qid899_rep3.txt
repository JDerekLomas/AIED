<explanation>The most prevalent misconception is the 'Left-to-Right' bias. Many students view mathematics as a literal language to be read from left to right, leading them to choose 10 - 8 (Option B) as the first step. Even students who can recite 'BIDMAS' often fail to apply it when the subtraction appears at the start of the expression. Additionally, a smaller cohort of students may choose Option A (7 + 6) because they mistakenly believe Addition must always come before Subtraction due to the 'A' appearing before 'S' in the acronym, or because they find addition 'easier' to process first. By Year 11, while most understand the rule, a significant minority still revert to left-to-right processing under time pressure or if they haven't mastered the hierarchy of operations.</explanation>
