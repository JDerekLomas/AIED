<explanation>The primary misconception is two-fold. First, students often believe that squaring a negative number results in a negative value (e.g., thinking (-2)² is -4), leading them to choose C or D because they expect the result to be negative and thus a counter-example. Second, many students have a weak grasp of 'decimal arithmetic' compared to integers; they fail to recognise that squaring a number between 0 and 1 (like 0.5) results in a smaller value (0.25), which when doubled (0.5) and subtracted by 1, yields a negative result. Option C is the most common distractor because the presence of the negative sign "looks" like it should produce a negative output to a student with shaky BIDMAS and directed number skills.</explanation>
