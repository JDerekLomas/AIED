<explanation>The most common error in expanding double brackets with two negatives is the sign of the constant term. Students often correctly calculate -5m and -7m to get -12m, but then fail to apply the 'negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive' rule for the final term (-5 * -7). Option D is the classic distractor here. Lower year groups (Year 7 and 8) often haven't been introduced to quadratic expansion yet, leading to very high error rates, while Year 11 students still frequently make this 'slip' under exam pressure or due to weak foundational knowledge of directed numbers.</explanation>
