<explanation>The most common error (leading to answer D) is the failure to use inverse operations when moving terms across the equals sign. Students often 'collect' the terms by simply adding them regardless of the sign. For example, they might calculate 20t + 5t = 25t and 10 - 5 = 5, leading to 25t = 5, and thus t = 1/5. Another frequent error is answer A, where students subtract 5t from 20t to get 15t, but then subtract 10 from 10 (incorrectly moving the 10) or incorrectly handle the -5, resulting in an expression that they believe equates to zero. Lower ability students also struggle with the concept of 'variables on both sides', often trying to solve it as a one-step or two-step equation by ignoring one of the 't' terms entirely.</explanation>
