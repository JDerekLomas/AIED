<explanation>The primary error is the 'Left-to-Right' misconception. Students treat mathematics as a language read from left to right, ignoring the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). 

1. Students choosing Option C (5.5) perform: 3+6=9, then 9÷2=4.5, then 4.5+1=5.5. This is the most common error across all year groups.
2. Students choosing Option D (5) often add the outer numbers first or perform 6÷(2+1) then add 3.
3. Students choosing Option B (3) may perform (3+6) ÷ (2+1).

Even in Year 11, under exam pressure, many students revert to left-to-right processing if they haven't internalised that division holds a higher priority than addition.</explanation>
