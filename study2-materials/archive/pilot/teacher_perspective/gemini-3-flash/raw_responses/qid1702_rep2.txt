<explanation>Students struggle with two-step substitution involving decimals and negative coefficients. The most common error is failing to use the inverse operation correctly. When students substitute y = 0.5, they get 10x - 3 = 30. Instead of adding 3 to get 33, many will subtract 3 (getting 27) and then divide by 10 to get 2.7 (Option D). Others will struggle with the 6 * 0.5 calculation itself or the negative sign, leading to various arithmetic slips. Option A (4.25) often comes from students incorrectly trying to solve 10x - 6 = 30 + 0.5 or similar structural errors.</explanation>
