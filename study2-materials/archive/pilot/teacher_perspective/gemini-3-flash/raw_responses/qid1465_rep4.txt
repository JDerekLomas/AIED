<explanation>The most common error is processing the expression strictly from left to right (3 - 5 = -2; -2 + 4 = 2; 2 * 2 = 4), which leads to answer B. This happens because students often view the equals sign as a prompt to calculate "as they go" rather than looking at the expression as a whole structure. Even students who remember the BIDMAS/BODMAS acronym often fail to apply it when the multiplication is at the end of the string. Additionally, some students may arrive at C or D if they struggle with negative number arithmetic (e.g., calculating 3 - 5 as 2 or -2 and then making further sign errors), but the left-to-right procedural error remains the dominant misconception across all age groups.</explanation>
