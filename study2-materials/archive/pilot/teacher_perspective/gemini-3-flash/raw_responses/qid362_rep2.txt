<explanation>The most common error is the "coefficient grab," where students assume the gradient is simply the coefficient of x (Option B) without rearranging the equation into the form y = mx + c. Among higher-ability students who know they must rearrange, many fail to use inverse operations correctly; they often move the 4x term without changing its sign (leading to Option D) or forget to divide the x-coefficient by the y-coefficient (leading to Option A). Year 7 and 8 students perform poorly here as they haven't typically mastered linear graphs or complex algebraic manipulation.</explanation>
