<explanation>The most common error is the 'coefficient grab', where students assume the gradient is simply the coefficient of x (4) regardless of the equation's format. For those who do attempt to rearrange into y=mx+c, the misconception mentioned in the prompt often manifests as failing to use inverse operations (e.g., subtracting 4x rather than dividing, or vice versa) and failing to divide the entire expression by 3. Option B is the most frequent 'low-effort' wrong answer, while D is the most common 'high-effort' error where students divide by 3 but forget to subtract 4x first.</explanation>
