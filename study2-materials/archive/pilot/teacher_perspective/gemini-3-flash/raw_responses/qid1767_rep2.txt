<explanation>The most common error is the "matching" misconception (Option D). Students often see the minus sign in the expression 'x - 7' and believe they must 'minus 7' to move it or solve it. They fail to understand that to isolate the variable, they must apply the inverse operation to 'undo' the subtraction. This is particularly prevalent in Year 7 and 8 as they transition from informal 'flowchart' methods to formal algebraic balancing. Some lower-ability students in older years may also select D because they associate the sign they see with the action they must take, rather than the balancing principle.</explanation>
