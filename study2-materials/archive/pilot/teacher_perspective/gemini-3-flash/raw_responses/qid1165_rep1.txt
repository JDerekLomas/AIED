<explanation>The primary error is the 'negative times a negative' rule. Many students incorrectly believe that two negatives multiplied together result in a more 'powerful' negative (D). Younger students (Year 7/8) often confuse multiplication rules with addition rules, leading them to pick A (-10) or C (-6) by attempting to combine the numbers rather than multiply. By Year 10 and 11, while they know they should multiply, a significant number still default to -16 under exam pressure or due to weak foundational fluency with directed numbers.</explanation>
