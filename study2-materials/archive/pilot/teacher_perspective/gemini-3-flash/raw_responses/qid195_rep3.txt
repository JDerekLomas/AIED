<explanation>The most common error (leading to C) is failing to use inverse operations correctly. Students often see the 'divide by 2' and 'minus 3' and instinctively apply them to the 1/8 using the same operation rather than the inverse—calculating (1/8 ÷ 2) + 3 to get 1/16 + 3. Another significant group will choose A by correctly multiplying by 2 to get 1/4, but then mistakenly multiplying by 3 or adding 3 incorrectly due to poor fraction arithmetic. Year 7 and 8 students frequently struggle with the fractional result, often trying to 'clear' the denominator of 8 incorrectly across the whole equation.</explanation>
