<explanation>The most prevalent misconception in fraction addition is the 'additive strategy', where students treat the numerator and denominator as independent whole numbers. Option A (4/9) is the result of adding the numerators (3+1) and the denominators (5+4). Even for students who remember they need a common denominator, many will forget to adjust the numerators accordingly, leading to errors. In lower sets (Year 10/11), this remains a persistent "pothole" even after years of intervention, as the intuitive appeal of adding across is very strong under exam pressure.</explanation>
