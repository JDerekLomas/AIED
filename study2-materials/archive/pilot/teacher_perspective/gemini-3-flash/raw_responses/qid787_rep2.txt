<explanation>Students frequently struggle with the 'inverse operation' concept when signs are negative. They see the -3 and -5 and assume that 'moving' one to the other side simply involves combining the numbers (3 and 5) to make 8, without considering that they must add 5 or add 3 to both sides. Jo has subtracted 3 from -5 (getting -8) and Paul has subtracted 5 from -3 (getting -8). Because both Jo and Paul have arrived at the same numerical value (8), many students believe both methods are valid 'shortcuts', failing to recognise that neither has applied the inverse operation correctly.</explanation>
