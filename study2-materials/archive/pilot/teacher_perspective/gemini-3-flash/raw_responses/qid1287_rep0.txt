<explanation>The most common error in early algebra is 'operation confusion'. Students often see the numbers in an equation and instinctively combine them using addition rather than the inverse operation. In this specific question, students look at the terms \(x + 4 = 2x + 2\) and simply add all the coefficients/constants together: \(1x + 2x = 3x\) and \(4 + 2 = 6\), leading them to \(3x = 6\) (Option D). They fail to understand that to 'move' a term across the equals sign, they must subtract it from both sides. Option C is also a common 'half-way' error where they correctly handle one side but add the other.</explanation>
