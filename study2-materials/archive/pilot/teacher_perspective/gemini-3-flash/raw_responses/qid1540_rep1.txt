<explanation>The most common error stems from the calculation of (-1)^2. Many students believe this is -1. When they then calculate -2(-1), they often get -2 (Option A) or correctly get +2 but combine it with their initial -1. However, the most frequent "trap" for lower-attaining students is the calculation (-1)^2 - 2(-1) + 1 resulting in -1 - 2 + 1 = -2 or, more commonly, seeing the "1" and "-1" and "2" and simply guessing 0 (Option D) because they struggle with the double negative in the middle term. Even high-achieving Year 11s frequently make the "negative squared is negative" error when using a calculator without brackets or performing mental arithmetic.</explanation>
