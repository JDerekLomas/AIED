<explanation>The most common error is a failure to apply the correct Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students see "1 - 3n" and perform the subtraction first: (1 - 3) = -2, then multiply by 15 to get -30 (Option D), or more commonly, they treat the expression as (1 - 3) * 15 which leads to errors, but the specific distractor C (-14) is highly attractive because students calculate 1 - 3(15) but process it as (1 - 3) = -2, then -2 + 15 or similar arithmetic slips. However, Option C specifically targets the "left-to-right" error where a student might calculate 1 - 3 = -2, and then multiply by 7 or simply miscalculate the product. In many cases, students also struggle with the negative result, often choosing -46 (Option B) by calculating 3 * 15 = 45 and then doing 1 - 45 but mentally subtracting 1 from 45 and keeping the sign, or adding 1 to 45 and making it negative. Option C is the classic 'left-to-right' trap where they subtract before multiplying.</explanation>
