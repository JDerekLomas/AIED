<explanation>The most common error in this specific question stems from students applying the same operation as seen in the expression rather than the inverse operation. For option D, students see '+1' and '2x' and proceed to add 1 to the boundaries (-3+1=-2, 7+1=8) and then multiply by 2 (-2*2=-4, 8*2=16), or similar variations of forward-operation processing. Many students also struggle with the "double-sided" nature of the inequality, often only performing the operation on one side or becoming confused by the negative integer (-3). Option B is a common distractor for those who subtract 1 correctly but forget to divide by 2, while Option C often results from students dividing by 2 before subtracting 1.</explanation>
