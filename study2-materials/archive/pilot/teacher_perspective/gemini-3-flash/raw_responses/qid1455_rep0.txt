<explanation>The most common error is selecting Option A because it follows the chronological order of the sentence (the "left-to-right" reading bias). Students often fail to recognize that in algebraic notation, addition must be grouped with brackets if it is to be performed before multiplication. Many students also struggle with the distributive property and incorrectly assume 4n+5 (Option B) represents the same sequence, failing to realize the 5 must also be multiplied by 4. Option A is particularly 'sticky' because it looks exactly like the sentence structure, and students often ignore BIDMAS/order of operations when translating from English to Algebra.</explanation>
