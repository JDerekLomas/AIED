<explanation>The most common error stems from the calculation of (-1)². Students often use their calculators or mental models incorrectly, leading to -1 instead of 1. When they then calculate -2(-1), many struggle with the double negative, either getting -2 or simply 2. 

Specifically, many students perform: -1 - 2(1) + 1 = -2 (Option A), or they incorrectly process the signs to get -1 + 2 - 1 = 0 (Option D). Option D is particularly common because students often "feel" that quadratic sequences involving 1 and -1 should result in zero. The specific misconception of (-1)² = -1 is one of the most persistent errors in GCSE mathematics, often reinforced by incorrect input into scientific calculators without using brackets.</explanation>
