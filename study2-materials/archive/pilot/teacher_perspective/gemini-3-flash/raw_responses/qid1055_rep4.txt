<explanation>The most common error is the 'add across' misconception, where students treat the numerators and denominators as independent whole numbers (3+1=4 and 5+4=9), leading to option A. This is a deeply rooted intuitive error. Option B is a secondary error where students find the correct common denominator (20) but fail to adjust the numerators, simply adding 3+1. Option C is a 'sign' error where students might subtract the numerators after finding a common denominator (though less common here). Even at GCSE (Year 11), a significant minority of students revert to these basic errors under time pressure or if they have not mastered the concept of equivalent fractions.</explanation>
