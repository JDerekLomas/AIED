<explanation>The primary misconception lies in Tom's statement. Many students are taught BIDMAS/BODMAS too rigidly and believe that Addition (A) must always come before Subtraction (S) because 'A' precedes 'S' in the acronym. Consequently, they calculate Tom's left side as (3+2)-1=4 and the right side as 3-(1+2)=0, leading them to believe Tom is incorrect. Furthermore, some students struggle with the commutative property when a subtraction sign is involved, failing to see the minus sign as 'belonging' to the 1. Katie's statement is more frequently identified as correct because it involves the commutativity of addition, which is more intuitive.</explanation>
