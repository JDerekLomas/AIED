<explanation>The primary reason for the high failure rate is the "rules of signs" misconception. Many students have a superficial understanding of negative number arithmetic; they see the numbers 3, 8, and 24 and correctly identify the relationship between the magnitudes, but fail to apply the rule that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive. 

Specifically, Option C is the most common distractor because students often focus on the "fact family" (3, 8, 24) and assume that because the diagram involves negative directions, the calculation must be "all negatives." They often misremember the rule as "a negative and a negative makes a negative" (confusing addition rules with multiplication). Furthermore, the visual representation of the arrows pointing left reinforces the idea that every number in the calculation must be negative, leading them to believe both Tom and Katie have correctly represented the visual "negative" context, despite the mathematical impossibility of their statements.</explanation>
