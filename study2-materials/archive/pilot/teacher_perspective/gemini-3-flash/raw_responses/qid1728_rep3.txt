<explanation>The primary error is a failure to apply the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students typically read the expression from left to right, performing the subtraction first: (3/4 - 1/4) = 2/4 (or 1/2). They then multiply this result by 1/5, leading to 2/20, which simplifies to 1/10 (Option B). This is a classic "procedural over-reliance" where the visual layout of the question dictates the steps rather than mathematical priority rules. Younger students also struggle with the fractional arithmetic itself, but the lure of the "easy" subtraction (3/4 - 1/4) makes Option B the overwhelming distractor across all age groups.</explanation>
