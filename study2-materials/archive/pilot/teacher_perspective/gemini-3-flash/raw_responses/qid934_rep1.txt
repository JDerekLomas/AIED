<explanation>The most frequent error occurs because students struggle with equations where the variable they are solving for (y) has a coefficient. When x=0, the equation becomes 2y=10. Many students see the 2 and the 10 and instinctively perform the operation 2 * 10 = 20 (Option A) rather than the inverse operation (10 / 2 = 5). This is a classic 'operation pairing' error. Additionally, some students may confuse the variables and substitute x=0 correctly but then subtract 2 from 10 to get 8, or divide 10 by 4 if they ignore the y-coefficient entirely. Younger students (Year 7-8) often haven't mastered implicit multiplication (2y meaning 2 times y) in the context of a two-variable linear equation.</explanation>
