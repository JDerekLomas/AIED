<explanation>The most common error is the fundamental misconception that "a negative and a negative make a negative." Students often see the numbers 3, 8, and 24 and, because the diagram shows arrows pointing left (negative direction), they assume all values in the calculation must be negative. Many students choose C because both calculations "look" numerically correct if they ignore the sign rules, or they believe that because the total result is -24, the components must be -3 and -8. They often confuse the rules for adding negatives (where -3 + -8 = -11) with the rules for multiplying them. Even higher-ability students often rush and fail to verify the sign of the product/quotient, assuming that if the diagram represents a negative total, the multiplication must equal that negative total.</explanation>
