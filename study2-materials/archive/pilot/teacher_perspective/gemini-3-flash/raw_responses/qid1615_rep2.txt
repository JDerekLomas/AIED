<explanation>The most common error is choosing option B because it follows the linear left-to-right flow of the sentence ("take away six" then "divide by three"). Students often translate word problems into algebra by writing symbols in the exact order they appear, failing to recognise that standard BIDMAS/BODMAS rules would apply to that notation, which would require the division to happen before the subtraction. Option D is a secondary distractor for those who confuse the structure of two-step equations, while option C is often chosen by students who confuse the inverse operation needed to solve the equation with the expression needed to represent it.</explanation>
