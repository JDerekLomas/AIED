<explanation>The most common error is the 'left-to-right' misconception, where students ignore the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). They calculate 18 ÷ 2 = 9, then 9 + 2 = 11, and finally 11 × 2 = 22 (Answer C). Another common error is performing the addition before the multiplication (9 + 4 = 13 is correct, but some might do 18 ÷ 4), though the left-to-right processing remains the dominant intuitive mistake for students who haven't yet internalised that multiplication takes precedence over addition.</explanation>
