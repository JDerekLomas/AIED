<explanation>The most common error stems from a rigid, literal interpretation of BIDMAS/BODMAS. Many students believe that because 'A' (Addition) comes before 'S' (Subtraction) in the acronym, addition must always be performed first. Consequently, they calculate Tom's left side as (3+2)-1=4 and the right side as 3-(1+2)=0, leading them to believe Tom is wrong. Furthermore, students often struggle with the Commutative Property when it involves subtraction, failing to see the minus sign as being attached to the 1. While Katie's example is a straightforward application of the commutative property of addition, the perceived 'rule' about addition coming before subtraction in Tom's case is a persistent misconception that lasts well into Key Stage 4.</explanation>
