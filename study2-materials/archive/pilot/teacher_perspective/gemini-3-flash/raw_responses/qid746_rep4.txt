<explanation>The most common error is following the operations strictly from left to right (4+12=16, then 16/4=4), leading to Option D, or more commonly, ignoring the brackets' priority over the division but keeping the addition first (4+12=16, then 16/2+2=10), leading to Option A. Option A is particularly common because students often remember BIDMAS/BODMAS but incorrectly believe Addition (A) comes before Subtraction (S) or that they should just work left-to-right once they've started. However, the specific "left-to-right" trap in this question (4+12=16, 16/4=4) is a very strong distractor for lower-ability students who ignore the hierarchy of operations entirely.</explanation>
