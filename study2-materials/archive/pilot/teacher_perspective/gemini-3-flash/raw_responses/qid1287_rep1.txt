<explanation>The most common error is the "additive misconception" where students see the numbers 4 and 2 and the variables x and 2x and simply add them together (4+2=6 and x+2x=3x) rather than performing the inverse operation to maintain the balance of the equation. Students often struggle to transition from the visual representation of "taking away" from both sides to the abstract algebraic manipulation. Answer D is particularly attractive to lower-attaining students because it combines all elements of the equation into a simplified (but incorrect) statement, satisfying a desire to "close" the expression.</explanation>
