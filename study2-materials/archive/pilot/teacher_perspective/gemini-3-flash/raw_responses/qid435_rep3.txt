<explanation>The primary hurdle here is the combination of BIDMAS/order of operations with directed numbers. 

Option B is the correct answer because it requires calculating (-4) x 2 = -8, then performing -28 - (-8), which becomes -28 + 8 = -20. Students frequently fail here by either calculating -28 - 4 first (ignoring BIDMAS) or struggling with the 'subtracting a negative' rule.

However, Option C is the most common distractor. Many students believe (-5)² is -25 because they associate the negative sign with the result of the squaring action, or their calculator usage (without brackets) has reinforced this error. They then calculate -25 + 5 = -20. 

Option A is often avoided as it looks "too busy", and Option D is frequently discounted because students correctly identify that a negative divided by a negative is a positive, making the result (21 + 1 = 22) clearly too high.</explanation>
