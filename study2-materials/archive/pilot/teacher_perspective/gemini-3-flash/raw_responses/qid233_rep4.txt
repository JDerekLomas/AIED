<explanation>The most common error is Option A, which stems from a 'left-to-right' processing bias. Students often see '2 ÷ 3' and immediately write it as a fraction (2/3), then append the rest of the expression (+ ab), ignoring the brackets that dictate the '2' must be divided by the entire sum. Even for those who understand the fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol, many struggle with the transition from linear BIDMAS notation to the verticality of algebraic fractions. Option D is also a common 'trap' for younger students who don't yet realise that 'correct algebraic convention' requires the removal of the multiplication sign.</explanation>
