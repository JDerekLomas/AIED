<explanation>The most common error is the 'Left-to-Right' misconception, where students ignore the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and simply process the numbers as they appear. This leads them to calculate 8 - 7 = 1, then 1 + 10 = 11, and finally 11 * 3 = 33 (Option D). Another common error involves students correctly identifying that multiplication comes first (10 * 3 = 30) but then incorrectly processing the subtraction and addition, often thinking 'Addition comes before Subtraction' in the acronym, leading them to do 7 + 30 = 37, then 8 - 37 = -29 (Option C), or 8 - (7 + 30) = -29. However, the simple linear calculation (Option D) remains the most prevalent mistake across all key stages.</explanation>
