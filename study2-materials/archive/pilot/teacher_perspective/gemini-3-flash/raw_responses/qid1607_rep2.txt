<explanation>The most common error is the 'operation mimicry' misconception. In Step 2, students see a '+1' and, instead of applying the inverse operation (subtracting 1), they instinctively add 1 to 60 because they are focused on the number 1 and the plus sign. This leads them to conclude that both steps are correct (Option C). Younger students in Years 7 and 8 often struggle with the 'balancing' concept of equations, while older students in Year 11 still make this mistake under time pressure or due to poor algebraic fluency, failing to check their solution by substituting $k=61$ back into the original equation.</explanation>
