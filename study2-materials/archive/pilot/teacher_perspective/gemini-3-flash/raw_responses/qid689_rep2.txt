<explanation>The most common error is answer C (p=2). Students instinctively divide the larger number by the smaller number (10 ÷ 5) because they are uncomfortable with the variable being in the denominator. They often misinterpret the structure as 10 = p ÷ 5 or simply see '10' and '5' and perform the easiest division possible. Answer B (p=50) is also common among students who recognize they need to multiply but apply it to the wrong side (10 * 5). The correct answer (0.5) requires a two-step manipulation or the recognition that 5 divided by a number smaller than itself is required to result in a larger number, which is a significant conceptual hurdle for many KS3 and lower-attaining KS4 students.</explanation>
