<explanation>The most common error (Option D) stems from the 'additive' misconception where students treat the numerators and denominators as independent whole numbers, adding 7+1 to get 8 and 10+4 to get 14. Even for students who understand the need for a common denominator, many will fail to convert the mixed numbers correctly or will make arithmetic slips when converting 99/20 back into a mixed number. Option A is a common 'half-way' error where students find the correct improper fraction but fail to follow the instruction to leave the answer as a mixed number.</explanation>
