<explanation>The most common error in early algebra is the 'additive misconception'. Students often see the numbers in the equation (1, 4, 2, 2) and simply add them together (1+2=3 and 4+2=6) to reach 3x=6, rather than applying inverse operations. Option D is particularly attractive because it correctly identifies the initial setup but then falls into this additive trap. Many Year 7 and 8 students struggle to bridge the gap between the concrete visual representation (removing a cup from both sides) and the abstract manipulation of symbols, often reverting to combining all terms if they lack a firm grasp of the 'balance' method.</explanation>
