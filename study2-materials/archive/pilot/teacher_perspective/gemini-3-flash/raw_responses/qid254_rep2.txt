<explanation>The most pervasive misconception here is that the number zero 'doesn't count' when calculating the mean. Students frequently divide by 4 (Option C) because they only count the non-zero digits, failing to understand that zero is a data point that affects the denominator. Regarding the specific misconception mentioned in the prompt (Order of Operations), many students would also select Option B if they were thinking of the steps sequentially but fail to recognise that without brackets, the division only applies to the 7. However, in my experience, the 'ignoring zero' error (Option C) is the most dominant mistake across all year groups for this specific set of numbers.</explanation>
