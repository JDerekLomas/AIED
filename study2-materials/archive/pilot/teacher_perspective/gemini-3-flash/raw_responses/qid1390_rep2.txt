<explanation>The primary error is a failure to apply the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students typically read the expression from left to right, performing the addition first: 1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6. They then multiply this result by 1/3, leading to 5/18 (Option B). This error is compounded by the fact that addition of fractions is cognitively more demanding than multiplication; once they have successfully navigated the "hard part" (finding a common denominator for the addition), they feel a false sense of security and proceed linearly. Option C is also common among students who add both the numerators and denominators across the entire expression.</explanation>
