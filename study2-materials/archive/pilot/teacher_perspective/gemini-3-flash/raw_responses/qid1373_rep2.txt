<explanation>The most prevalent error is a failure to correctly apply the rules of directed numbers, specifically when multiplying a negative coefficient by a negative constant inside the bracket. Students frequently see the minus sign in front of the 2 and simply 'bring it down', resulting in -3m - 6 (Option B). Some students also struggle with the distribution of the negative sign to the first term, or mistakenly believe that the negative outside 'cancels' both signs to become positive (Option A). Even at GCSE level, this remains one of the most common 'slip' errors under exam pressure.</explanation>
