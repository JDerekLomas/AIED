<explanation>The primary misconception is a misunderstanding of the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Many students believe that brackets simply 'go around the middle' or they prioritize the subtraction/addition because they appear first when reading left-to-right. 

Option A is the most common distractor because students often calculate 6+4=10, then 10/2=5, then 16-5=11 (incorrect answer) OR they mistakenly think 16-10=6, then 6/2=3. 

Another significant group of students will choose B or C because they don't actually calculate the result; they assume brackets are needed for the first two terms or the last two terms by default. Option D is frequently missed because students struggle to see that the entire string (16-6+4) must be evaluated as 14 before the division occurs to reach the target of 7.</explanation>
