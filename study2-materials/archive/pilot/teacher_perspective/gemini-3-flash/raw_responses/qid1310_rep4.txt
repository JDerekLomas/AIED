<explanation>The most common error is the 'Left-to-Right' bias. Students often see the outermost brackets and immediately look for the first operation appearing on the left-hand side within those brackets (0.5 ÷ 0.2), ignoring the hierarchy of the nested inner parentheses. Additionally, many students struggle with the visual complexity of multiple brackets and default to reading the expression like a sentence. Some may also choose D if they over-rely on the 'Multiplication comes before Division' mnemonic (MD in BIDMAS), though A remains the dominant error due to the positioning of the division sign at the start of the expression.</explanation>
