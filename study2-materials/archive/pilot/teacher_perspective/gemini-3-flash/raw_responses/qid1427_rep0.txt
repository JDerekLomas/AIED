<explanation>The most common error is the 'matching' misconception, where students see the number +7 in the equation and assume they must perform that same operation (+7) to 'deal' with it. Many students at the start of Key Stage 3 view the operation sign as a label for the number rather than an instruction to be reversed. They often confuse the goal of 'getting x on its own' with simply repeating the digits they see. Even in higher year groups, under exam pressure, students frequently forget to use the inverse operation and instead 'move' the number while keeping its sign the same.</explanation>
