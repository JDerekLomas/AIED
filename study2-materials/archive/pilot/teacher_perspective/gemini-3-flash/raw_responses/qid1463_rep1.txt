<explanation>The most common error is failing to correctly square a negative number. Students often input -3² into a non-scientific calculator or think "negative squared stays negative," leading them to -9. Even those who know 3 squared is 9 often forget that (-3) * (-3) = +9. Year 7 and 8 percentages are near 100% as the quadratic formula is not typically introduced until Year 9 or 10 in the UK curriculum, so they would be guessing or applying basic arithmetic incorrectly. In Year 11, despite familiarity with the formula, this remains a "classic" error that persists even among higher-tier students.</explanation>
