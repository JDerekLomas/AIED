<explanation>The most common error is failing to correctly square a negative number. Students often input -3² into a non-scientific calculator or think "negative three squared is negative nine" because they don't apply brackets: (-3)² = 9. Year 7 and 8 students will almost all get this wrong as they haven't encountered the quadratic formula, while Year 10 and 11 students frequently fall into the trap of writing -9 instead of 9 when substituting 'b' into the discriminant part of the formula. Option D is the most common distractor because it reflects the sign error while maintaining the correct numerical value.</explanation>
