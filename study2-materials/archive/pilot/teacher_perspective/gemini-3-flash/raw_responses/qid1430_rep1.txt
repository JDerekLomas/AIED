<explanation>The most common error is choosing option D (3/14). This stems from the intuitive but incorrect 'add across' strategy, where students apply the rules of integer addition to both the numerators and the denominators. Even students who have been taught the correct method often revert to this 'path of least resistance' when they lack conceptual understanding of the denominator as the 'size' or 'name' of the parts. Option B is a rarer error associated with confusing addition with multiplication rules.</explanation>
