<explanation>The most common error is the 'Left-to-Right' bias. Students often scan the expression like a sentence and assume the first operation they encounter (0.5 ÷ 0.2) must be the starting point, despite the nested brackets. Younger students in Year 7 and 8 often struggle with the 'inner-most bracket' rule, while older students (Year 10-11) who get this wrong often do so because the presence of decimals increases the cognitive load, causing them to revert to more primitive heuristics rather than applying BIDMAS/BODMAS systematically. Option D is also a common distractor for those who believe multiplication always takes priority over everything else.</explanation>
