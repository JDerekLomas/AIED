<explanation>The primary hurdle here is the combination of decimals and BIDMAS/BODMAS. Many students struggle with the 'left-to-right' bias, assuming that subtraction should be performed first because it appears first in the expression. This leads them to believe Tom is wrong. Furthermore, students often find division by a larger decimal (0.2 ÷ 0.3) counter-intuitive, leading them to gravitate towards Katie's suggestion (Option B) because they mistakenly believe the order can be swapped to make the numbers 'fit' better, or they confuse the commutative property of addition/multiplication with subtraction/division. Option D is also a common trap for students who overcomplicate the decimal division and assume neither can be right.</explanation>
