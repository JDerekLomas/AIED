<explanation>The primary error is the 'negative times a negative' rule. Many students correctly multiply -5 and m to get -5m, but then fail to process the second multiplication correctly. They either see the minus sign in front of the 7 as a separator rather than an operator attached to the number, or they possess the common misconception that 'a negative and a negative make a negative'. Option B is the most common distractor because students remember to multiply the numbers but fail to flip the sign, often subconsciously thinking that because the bracket contains a minus, the answer should also contain a minus.</explanation>
