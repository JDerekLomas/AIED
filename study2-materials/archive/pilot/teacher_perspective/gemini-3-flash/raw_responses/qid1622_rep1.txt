<explanation>The most common error (leading to D) is the 'multiplication' misconception where students see the 2y and the 6 and multiply them together because they are adjacent to the equals sign, or they substitute x=0 correctly to get 2y=6 but then perform 6 * 2 instead of 6 / 2. Option B is also a high-frequency distractor for students who simply see the constant '2' in the equation and assume that is the value, or confuse the x and y intercepts. At Year 7 and 8, many students struggle with the formal substitution into an implicit linear equation (ax + by = c) compared to the more standard y = mx + c format.</explanation>
