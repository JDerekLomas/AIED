<explanation>The most common error is the 'Left-to-Right' misconception (Option B). Students often view mathematics as a narrative that must be read from left to right, ignoring the hierarchical rules of BIDMAS/BODMAS. Even students who can recite the acronym often fail to apply it when the subtraction appears at the start of the expression. A smaller subset of students choose Option A due to a literal interpretation of BIDMAS where 'Addition' (A) comes before 'Subtraction' (S), leading them to group the end of the expression first.</explanation>
