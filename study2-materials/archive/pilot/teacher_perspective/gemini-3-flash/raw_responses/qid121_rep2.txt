<explanation>The most common error is identifying the coefficient of x as the gradient without first rearranging the equation into the form y = mx + c. Students in Year 7 and 8 often haven't encountered linear graphs in this implicit form. Even for older students, the "surface level" pattern matching leads them to choose 5 (Option A). Those who do attempt to rearrange often fail to correctly apply inverse operations, forgetting to subtract 5x or failing to divide the entire expression by 3. Option C is a very common distractor for students who know they need to divide by 3 but forget the sign change when moving the 5x term across the equals sign.</explanation>
