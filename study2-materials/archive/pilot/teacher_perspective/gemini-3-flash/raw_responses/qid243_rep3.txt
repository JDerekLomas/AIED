<explanation>The most common error stems from students using the same operation rather than the inverse, or failing to manage negative numbers correctly. 

Option B is the most common distractor because students often "combine" terms without inverse operations: they see the 3n and 4n and think "4 - 3 = 1", and see the 2 and -5 and think "2 - 5 = -3" or simply ignore the signs to get 1. 

Additionally, many students struggle when the variable ends up on the right-hand side (7 ≥ n). They often reflexively flip the inequality sign to "make it look right" (n ≥ 7, Option D) without understanding that changing the side of the variable requires a logical reversal of the inequality. Year 7 and 8 students often haven't been introduced to inequalities yet, leading to near-total incorrectness, while older students still trip up on the multi-step nature of having variables on both sides.</explanation>
