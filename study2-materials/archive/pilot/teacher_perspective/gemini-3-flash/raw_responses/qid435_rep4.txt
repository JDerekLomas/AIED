<explanation>The primary error stems from a failure to correctly apply BIDMAS/order of operations in conjunction with negative number rules. 

In Option A, students often calculate 2 x (-2) = -4 correctly, but then struggle with the subtraction of a product. They may calculate (-4) x 4 = -16, but then fail to resolve -4 - (-16) as -4 + 16 = 12. Many students will simply see the numbers 4 and 16 and "force" a -20 by adding them, ignoring the signs.

In the correct answer B, the common error is calculating -28 - (-8) as -36. Students often see "minus a minus" and mistakenly apply the multiplication rule (two negatives make a positive) to the addition/subtraction part, or conversely, they see the two minus signs and simply add the absolute values, keeping the sign negative.

Option C is a common trap where students believe (-5)^2 is -25, leading them to -25 + 5 = -20. This misconception (squaring a negative results in a negative) is extremely persistent even at GCSE level.</explanation>
