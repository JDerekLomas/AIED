<explanation>The primary misconception is the "Left-to-Right" bias, where students assume operations should be performed in the order they appear. Many students will struggle to reverse-engineer the BIDMAS/BODMAS rules. Option A is the most common distractor because students often mistakenly believe that brackets are only needed to 'group' the middle terms, or they calculate 16-10=6, then 6/2=3 (failing to reach 7 but choosing it because it 'looks' like a standard bracket placement). Option B is also popular as students often feel the need to 'protect' the first subtraction, even though it doesn't change the result of the original expression. The correct answer D requires students to understand that the division must apply to the entire preceding sum, which contradicts their instinct to divide only the nearest number.</explanation>
