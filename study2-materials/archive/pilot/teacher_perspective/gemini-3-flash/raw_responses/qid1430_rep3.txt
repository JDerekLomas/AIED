<explanation>The most common error is Option D (3/14), which stems from the 'add everything' misconception. Students often apply the logic of integer addition to both the numerator and the denominator, failing to understand that the denominator represents the size or 'name' of the parts rather than a quantity to be summed. Even in older year groups, this error resurfaces under exam pressure or when students confuse the rules for adding fractions with the rules for multiplying them.</explanation>
