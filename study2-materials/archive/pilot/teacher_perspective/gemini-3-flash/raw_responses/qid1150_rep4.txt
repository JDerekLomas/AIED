<explanation>The most common error (Option B) stems from students incorrectly applying the inverse operation for the division. Instead of multiplying by r, they divide by r, likely due to a confusion with the formula for acceleration or a general weakness in manipulating fractions. Option A is also common among students who recognize the multiplication but fail to square root, or square the wrong term. In Year 7 and 8, many students will not have encountered formal rearrangement involving squares, leading to high failure rates and guesswork.</explanation>
