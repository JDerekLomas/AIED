<explanation>The most common error is failing to use the inverse operation when dealing with negative results. Students substitute k=8 to get 2j - 8 = -10. Instead of adding 8 to both sides (inverse), they 'see' the -10 and the -8 and intuitively subtract 8 from 10 or add the magnitudes incorrectly, leading them to 2j = 18 (j=9) or 2j = 2 (j=1). Answer B (j=9) is particularly common because students often ignore the negative signs entirely or perform 10 + 8 = 18 and then divide by 2. This specific question tests the intersection of substitution, two-step equations, and directed number arithmetic, which is a 'perfect storm' for student errors.</explanation>
