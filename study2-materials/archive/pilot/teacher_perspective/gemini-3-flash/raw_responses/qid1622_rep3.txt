<explanation>The most common error (leading to D) is a failure to understand the inverse operation required when a variable is zero. Students see 3x + 2y = 6, substitute x=0 to get 2y = 6, but then multiply by 2 instead of dividing (2 * 6 = 12). Another significant group chooses B because they see the '2' in front of the y and assume that must be the value, or they confuse the x and y intercepts. Younger students often struggle with the concept of an equation in this format (Ax + By = C) compared to the standard y = mx + c, leading to random guessing or simply adding the coefficients.</explanation>
