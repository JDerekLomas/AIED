<explanation>The most common error is choosing C (-81). Students often correctly calculate 3^4 = 81 but fail to apply the rules of signs for even powers, or they are misled by how calculators handle -3^4 without brackets. Option D (-12) is a common "low-ability" error where students multiply the base by the index (k * 4). Even at GCSE level (Year 11), many students instinctively feel that a negative input must result in a negative output, especially under exam pressure.</explanation>
