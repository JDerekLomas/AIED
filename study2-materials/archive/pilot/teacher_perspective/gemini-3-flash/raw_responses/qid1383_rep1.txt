<explanation>The most common error is C (-81), caused by students correctly calculating 3 to the power of 4 but incorrectly applying the negative sign. Many students believe that if the input is negative, the output must be negative, or they fail to realise that an even power results in a positive product because the negatives 'pair up'. Additionally, a significant number of lower-ability students (particularly in Year 7 and 8) will choose B or D (12 or -12) due to the persistent misconception that an exponent means 'multiply by the base'. Even at GCSE level (Year 11), many students are tripped up by this if they use a calculator incorrectly, entering -3^4 instead of (-3)^4.</explanation>
