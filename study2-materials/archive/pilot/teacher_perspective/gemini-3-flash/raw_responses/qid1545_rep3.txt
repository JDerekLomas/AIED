<explanation>The most common error is the 'left-to-right' misconception, where students ignore BIDMAS/order of operations. For the left side, they calculate 8+12 first to get 20, then divide by 4 to get 5. Since the right side also equals 5 (due to the brackets forcing the addition first), they conclude both sides are equal and choose C. Even students who know the acronym often fail to apply it when the addition comes first in the string, as the visual flow of the numbers '8+12' is very tempting.</explanation>
