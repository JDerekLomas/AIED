<explanation>This question is significantly more difficult than a standard negative numbers task because the answer is non-integer. Many students will instinctively choose C (-8/6) because they see a negative in the question and a negative in the result, leading them to believe the missing value must also be negative. This stems from a weak grasp of the "negative multiplied by a positive equals a negative" rule versus "negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive." Furthermore, students often struggle with the algebraic structure of "a * x = b", frequently confusing the order of division (calculating 6/8 instead of 8/6), making A and B attractive distractors for those who don't understand that the multiplier must be greater than 1 to increase the magnitude from 6 to 8.</explanation>
