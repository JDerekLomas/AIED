<explanation>The primary error is a failure to follow the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Many students read the expression from left to right, performing (3 * 0.3) first to get 0.9, and then squaring that result to get 0.81 (Answer A). Another common error involves decimal place value; students who correctly identify that they must square 0.3 first often calculate 0.3 * 0.3 as 0.9 rather than 0.09, leading them to 3 * 0.9 = 2.7 (Answer D). Lower-ability students may also multiply 0.3 by 2 instead of squaring it, then multiply by 3, leading to 1.8 (Answer C). The presence of decimals significantly increases the error rate compared to integer-based substitution.</explanation>
