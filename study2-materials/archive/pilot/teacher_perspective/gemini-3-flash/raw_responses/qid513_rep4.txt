<explanation>Students frequently confuse inverse operations with the operations already present in the equation. In Step 1, students see '- 4' and instinctively subtract 4 from 15 (getting 11) rather than adding it. In Step 2, they see '2p' (multiplication) and instinctively multiply 11 by 2 (getting 22) rather than dividing. Those who select 'C' are often students who follow the "do the same thing to both sides" rule in theory but apply the visible operation rather than the inverse. This is a classic "procedural fluency" error where the student recognizes the structure of two-step equations but lacks the conceptual understanding of 'undoing' operations.</explanation>
