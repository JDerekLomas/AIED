<explanation>Students frequently struggle with the 'order of operations' in reverse when solving equations. Tom's error is a classic 'floating' mistake where students add 6 to the 10 but fail to realise the 6 is part of the numerator and bound by the division. Katie's error is the specific misconception mentioned: she sees a division by 2 and performs a division by 2 on the right-hand side (10 ÷ 2 = 5) instead of the inverse multiplication. Many students will see both '10 + 6' and '10 ÷ 2' as plausible 'next steps' because they recognize the numbers involved but lack the procedural fluency to identify that both have applied the wrong inverse or applied it to the wrong part of the expression.</explanation>
