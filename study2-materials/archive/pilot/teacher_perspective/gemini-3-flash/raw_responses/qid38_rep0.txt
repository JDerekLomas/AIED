<explanation>The most common error (leading to Option B) is the classic "add the tops, add the bottoms" misconception, where students perform (3+4) / (2x+x). Even students who understand they need a common denominator often struggle with algebraic fractions; many will correctly identify that they need to change 4/x into 8/2x, but then erroneously add the denominators to get 11/4x (not an option here) or simply revert to adding the original denominators. Option D is also a common "half-way" error where students add the numerators but keep the "largest" looking denominator without scaling the second fraction.</explanation>
