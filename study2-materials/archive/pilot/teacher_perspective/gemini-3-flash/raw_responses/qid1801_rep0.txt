<explanation>The most common error (Option A) stems from students applying the same operation as the constant in the inequality rather than the inverse. Instead of subtracting 1 from both sides, they add 1 (-5 + 1 = -4, but often miscalculated or ignored in favour of 5 + 1 = 6 or 10), and then instead of dividing by 2, they multiply by 2. Students often find the 'three-sided' nature of double inequalities overwhelming, leading them to focus only on the right-hand side or lose track of negative number arithmetic. Option C is a common 'guess' for students who correctly subtract 1 but then struggle with -6 divided by 2, often intuitively gravitating toward symmetrical answers.</explanation>
