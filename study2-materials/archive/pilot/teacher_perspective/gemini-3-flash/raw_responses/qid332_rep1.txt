<explanation>The most common error is selecting 'Both', driven by a fundamental misunderstanding of the distributive property when multiplying an equation. Students often believe they can 'multiply by the denominator' (3) to get rid of the fraction without realizing they must multiply every term in the equation, including the -5. Katie's error (failing to multiply the -5 by 3) is a classic 'partial operation' mistake. Many students see Katie's step as a valid 'short cut' or simply fail to recognize that the -5 is a separate term. Tom's method of adding 5 first is the standard procedure, but students who lack confidence in the order of operations for inverse functions frequently think both approaches are mathematically sound alternatives.</explanation>
