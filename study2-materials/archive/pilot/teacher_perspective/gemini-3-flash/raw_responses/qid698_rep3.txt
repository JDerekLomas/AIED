<explanation>The most common error is choosing Option C (2/9). This stems from two major misconceptions: first, students often intuitively feel they should 'add' the probabilities because they see two events, leading them to add the numerators (1+1) and the denominators (4+5). This 'adding across' is a classic fraction misconception. Second, students frequently confuse the 'AND' rule (multiplication) with the 'OR' rule (addition) in probability. Option A (1/9) is also a common distractor for those who add the denominators but keep the numerator as 1. Only higher-ability students consistently remember to multiply the independent probabilities (1/4 × 1/5).</explanation>
