<explanation>The most prevalent error is the "Freshman's Dream," where students simply square the individual terms inside the bracket (x^2 and (-4)^2), completely omitting the middle term (-8x) produced by the distributive law. While the specific misconception noted is about the sign of the constant (Option D), in practice, the majority of students across all year groups fail to recognise that (x-4)^2 must be written as (x-4)(x-4). Option B is the most common distractor because it feels "logical" to a novice learner. Option D is chosen by students who remember the middle term but struggle with directed number rules, specifically believing that -4 multiplied by -4 equals -16.</explanation>
