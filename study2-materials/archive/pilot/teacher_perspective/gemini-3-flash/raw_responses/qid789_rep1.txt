<explanation>The high incorrect rate is driven by two distinct hurdles. First, the primary misconception (Option A) where students add both numerators and denominators (3+5/10+10). However, in my experience, the 'simplest form' instruction is the most common pitfall for those who actually understand the addition rule. Many students successfully reach 8/10 (Option B) but stop there, either forgetting to simplify or lacking the fluency to divide both numbers by 2. Option B is frequently the most chosen distractor because it feels 'finished' to a student who has just performed the addition correctly.</explanation>
