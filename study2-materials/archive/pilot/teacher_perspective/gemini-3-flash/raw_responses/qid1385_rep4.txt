<explanation>The most common error is the 'add across' misconception, where students treat numerators and denominators as independent whole numbers (1+1+2+3=7 and 3+4+3+4=14), leading to Option B. Even students who understand common denominators often struggle with the multi-step nature of this problem; they may find 7/12 for the first two terms and stop, or fail to simplify 24/12 or (1 + 1) to the integer 2. Option B remains the dominant distractor for lower-attaining students across all year groups.</explanation>
