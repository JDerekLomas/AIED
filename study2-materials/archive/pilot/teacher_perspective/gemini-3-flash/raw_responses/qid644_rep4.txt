<explanation>The primary error is the sign. Many students (Option B) correctly identify the numerical multiplication (1 x 4 = 4) but default to the "negative wins" rule, incorrectly applying addition logic or simply forgetting that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive. Options C and D represent an additive misconception where students add the digits (1 and 4) instead of multiplying them, which is a common error when students are overwhelmed by the algebra and revert to basic arithmetic operations.</explanation>
