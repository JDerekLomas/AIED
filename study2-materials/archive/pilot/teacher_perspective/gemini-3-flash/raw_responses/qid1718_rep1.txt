<explanation>The most pervasive error is 'squaring the parts', where students simply square the x and square the 3, completely omitting the middle term (-6x). This makes Option B the most common distractor across all age groups. Option A specifically targets the misconception mentioned in the prompt (incorrectly signed constant), but in my experience, the failure to recognise that a binomial squared produces a trinomial is the more dominant structural error. Even high-attaining Year 11s under exam pressure frequently default to Option B or C due to 'fossilised' misconceptions from their first introduction to algebra.</explanation>
