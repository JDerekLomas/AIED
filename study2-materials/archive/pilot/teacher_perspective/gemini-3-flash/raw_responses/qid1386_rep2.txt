<explanation>The most common error is the 'add everything' approach (Option C), where students apply the logic of integer addition to both the numerator and the denominator. Even students who understand numeric fractions often revert to this when variables are introduced. Option D is a frequent 'distractor' for students who confuse addition rules with multiplication rules. In Year 7, many students haven't encountered algebraic fractions, leading to very high error rates, while Year 11 students still make 'silly' slips under pressure by over-complicating the common denominator (Option A) or reverting to basic misconceptions.</explanation>
