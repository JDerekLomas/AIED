<explanation>The primary misconception is the 'left-to-right' bias. Many students instinctively read a mathematical expression like a sentence and assume the operations should be performed in the order they appear. Option C (8-7) is the most common error because '8-7' is a very simple 'friendly' calculation that students want to resolve immediately. Furthermore, many students remember the BIDMAS/BODMAS acronym but mistakenly believe that Indices (I/O) come after Division/Multiplication, or they simply forget that Indices take priority over all four basic operations. In Year 7 and 8, the presence of a fraction or division sign often triggers a rush to calculate the subtraction first to 'simplify' the numbers before dealing with the harder division.</explanation>
