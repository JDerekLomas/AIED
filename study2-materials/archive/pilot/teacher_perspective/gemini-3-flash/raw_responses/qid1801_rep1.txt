<explanation>The most common error (Option A) stems from students applying the same operation as seen in the expression rather than the inverse. They see '+1' and add 1 to both ends (-5+1 = -4, 5+1 = 6), then see '2x' and multiply by 2 (-4*2 = -8, 6*2 = 12), leading to values near those in Option A. Option C is also common as students often forget to apply the operation to both sides of the inequality, or struggle with directed number arithmetic (e.g., -6 divided by 2). In Year 7 and 8, the concept of a double-ended inequality is rarely taught, leading to high failure rates based on lack of exposure alone.</explanation>
