<explanation>The most common error is the 'add-across' misconception, where students treat the numerator and denominator as independent whole numbers. Even though the denominators are common (the easiest form of fraction addition), a significant number of students instinctively calculate 2+1=3 and 7+7=14, leading to answer D. This error often persists into Key Stage 4 for lower-attaining students who rely on rote-learned procedures rather than a conceptual understanding of 'parts of a whole'.</explanation>
