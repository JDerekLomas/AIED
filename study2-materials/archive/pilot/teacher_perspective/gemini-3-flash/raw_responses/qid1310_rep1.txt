<explanation>The most common error is the "left-to-right" bias. Students often scan the expression and pick the first operation they see inside the outer brackets (0.5 ÷ 0.2), ignoring the hierarchy of nested brackets. Even those who remember BIDMAS/BODMAS often struggle when brackets are nested, failing to identify that they must resolve the innermost set first. Additionally, the presence of decimals adds a cognitive load that often causes students to revert to more primitive "left-to-right" processing strategies rather than applying formal order of operations rules.</explanation>
