<explanation>The primary misconception is the 'Left-to-Right' trap. Many students ignore BIDMAS/BODMAS rules when decimals are involved because the cognitive load of the numbers distracts them from the structure of the expression. Students choosing B (Katie) often believe that the subtraction should happen first because it appears first on the left, leading them to think the expression is equivalent to (0.1 - 0.2) ÷ 0.3. When they see Katie's version, they mistakenly think it's a valid rearrangement. A significant number of students also choose D because they are intimidated by the recurring decimal result of 0.2 ÷ 0.3 and assume the equivalence must be false due to the 'messiness' of the calculation.</explanation>
