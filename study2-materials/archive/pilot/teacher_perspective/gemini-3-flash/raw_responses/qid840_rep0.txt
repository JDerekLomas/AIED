<explanation>The most common error is choosing 'Both' (C). Students frequently apply the operation seen in the equation rather than its inverse. For Tom's working, they see the '5' and the '40' and perform 40 ÷ 5 = 8, erroneously believing they have 'moved' the 5. For Katie's working, they correctly identify that 40 ÷ 8 = 5. Because both 8 and 5 are factors of 40, the numbers 'feel' correct to a student with weak algebraic fluency. Year 7 and 8 students struggle significantly with the fractional notation, often treating the numerator and denominator as isolated integers rather than a single term.</explanation>
