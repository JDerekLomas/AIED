<explanation>The most prevalent error is the failure to correctly multiply two negative integers. Students frequently correctly multiply -3 by m to get -3m, but then simply 'bring down' the subtraction sign or fail to recognise that -3 multiplied by -2 results in a positive 6. This leads them to Option B (-3m - 6). Younger students or those with weaker algebraic foundations may also ignore the negative sign outside the bracket entirely, leading to Options A or C. Even at Year 11, under exam pressure, the "negative times a negative equals a positive" rule is one of the most common 'slip' errors made by students across all ability ranges.</explanation>
