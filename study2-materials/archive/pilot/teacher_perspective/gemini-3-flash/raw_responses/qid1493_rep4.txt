<explanation>The most common error is choosing C (8-7) because students read the expression from left to right, ignoring the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Even students who know the acronym often struggle when indices are involved, as they are less practiced than basic four-operations priority. Younger students frequently believe that subtraction must come first simply because it appears first in the string. Furthermore, the "7 ÷ 6" part looks "hard" because it results in a fraction/decimal, leading students to subconsciously avoid it by performing the "easier" 8-7 first.</explanation>
