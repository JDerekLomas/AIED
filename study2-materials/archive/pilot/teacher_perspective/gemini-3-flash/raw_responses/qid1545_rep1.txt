<explanation>The primary misconception is the failure to apply BIDMAS/BODMAS rules to the left-hand expression. Students often read mathematics from left to right like a sentence, leading them to calculate 8 + 12 = 20, then 20 ÷ 4 = 5. Because the right-hand side explicitly uses brackets to force this same calculation (8 + 12) ÷ 4 = 5, students conclude that both sides are equal (Option C). Even those who recognize the symbols often default to 'left-to-right' processing under pressure, overlooking that division takes precedence over addition on the left side (8 + 3 = 11).</explanation>
