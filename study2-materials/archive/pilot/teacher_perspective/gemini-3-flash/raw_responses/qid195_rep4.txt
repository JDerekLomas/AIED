<explanation>The most common error (leading to C) is the 'same operation' misconception where students see the 2 and the 8 and multiply them to get 16, or see the subtraction of 3 and add it incorrectly to the denominator. Specifically, many students will multiply both sides by 1/2 instead of 2, or perform (1/8)/2 to get 1/16, then add 3. Another common error is Option A, where students multiply the 8 by the 2 but then add 3 to the numerator before dividing, or incorrectly cross-multiply. Option B is a 'number bond' distraction where students see 1/8 and 2 and try to make the numbers 'fit' a simple integer solution.</explanation>
