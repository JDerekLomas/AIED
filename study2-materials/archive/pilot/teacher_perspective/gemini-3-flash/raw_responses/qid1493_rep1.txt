<explanation>The primary misconception is the 'left-to-right' bias, where students instinctively process numbers as they read them, leading them to choose 8-7 first (Option C). Furthermore, many students rely on the BIDMAS/BODMAS acronym but struggle with the 'I' or 'O' (Indices/Orders). They often prioritize the operations they find easiest or most familiar (subtraction) over those they find more complex (powers). Even higher-ability students often make a 'reflex' error here because the calculation 8-7 is so tempting and simple, leading them to bypass their formal knowledge of operator precedence.</explanation>
