<explanation>The most common error is the sign. Many students correctly identify that 8 x 2 = 16, but they struggle with the 'negative multiplied by a negative' rule, leading them to choose -16 (Option D). In Year 7 and 8, students often confuse the rules for addition and multiplication (thinking 'two negatives make a bigger negative'). Option A (-10) is also a significant distractor for younger students who mistakenly add the terms (-8 - 2) instead of multiplying them as required by the bracket expansion process.</explanation>
