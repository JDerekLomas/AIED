<explanation>The most common error is choosing Option A (-3 and -8). This stems from a persistent misconception where students associate the negative sign in the question with negative signs in the factors. Many students over-generalise the rule "a negative and a negative make a..." and mistakenly apply the logic of addition (where two negatives sum to a negative) to multiplication. Additionally, some students simply see the numbers 3 and 8, recognise the product is 24, and ignore the sign rules entirely. Option C is a common distractor for lower-ability students who confuse 'product' with 'sum'.</explanation>
