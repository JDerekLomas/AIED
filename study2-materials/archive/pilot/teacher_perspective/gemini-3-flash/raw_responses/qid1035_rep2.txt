<explanation>The most common error is failing to distribute the negative sign to the second term inside the bracket. Students often treat the '-' outside as simply belonging to the 2, resulting in -2, but then they just 'bring down' the -3p without change. This is driven by two factors: first, the 'invisible 1' (treating the expression as -1 multiplied by the bracket) is a concept many struggle with; second, even those who recognize the multiplication often default to the 'sign in the middle stays the same' heuristic, especially under time pressure. Option B is the classic 'partial expansion' error.</explanation>
