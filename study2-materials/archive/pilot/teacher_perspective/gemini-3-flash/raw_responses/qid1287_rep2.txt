<explanation>The most common error (distractor D) stems from the "additive misconception." When students see "x + 4" and "2x + 2", they often instinctively add the coefficients and constants (1+2 and 4+2) to get 3x = 6, rather than applying the inverse operation to maintain the balance of the equation. Year 7 and 8 students struggle particularly with the abstract nature of "moving" terms across the equals sign, often defaulting to simple addition of all visible numbers. Even at KS4, under pressure, many students fail to recognise that the visual representation of "removing" an item from both sides requires subtraction, leading them to choose D or C.</explanation>
