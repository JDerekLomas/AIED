<explanation>The most frequent error is Option A (y=2). Students often see the numbers 3 and 5 and intuitively perform the operation 5 - 3 = 2, ignoring the negative sign attached to the y. They treat the equation as if it were y - 3 = 5 or simply 3 + y = 5. Another significant group chooses Option C (y=8) by incorrectly applying the inverse operation, thinking they must add 3 to 5 because they see a subtraction sign, even though the 3 is positive. The presence of the negative variable coefficient is a classic "threshold concept" that many students struggle with right up until their GCSE exams.</explanation>
