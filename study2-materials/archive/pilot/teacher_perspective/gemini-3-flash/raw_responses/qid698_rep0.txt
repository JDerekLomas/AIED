<explanation>The most common error is the 'additive' misconception. Students often see two events and instinctively want to add the probabilities (1/4 + 1/5). However, even when they attempt to add, a significant number of students apply the common fraction misconception of adding both the numerators and the denominators (1+1)/(4+5), leading them to answer C (2/9). Answer A is also a common distraction for those who add the denominators but keep a numerator of 1. Many students struggle to distinguish between when to add and when to multiply in probability; they see 'two' spinners and 'two' 1s, which reinforces the urge to have '2' in the numerator.</explanation>
