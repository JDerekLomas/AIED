<explanation>The most common error here is the 'moving' misconception, where students believe that to move a number to the other side of the equals sign, they simply perform the operation indicated by the sign already attached to it, rather than the inverse. Students see '-3' and think they should subtract 3 from the other side (Jo's error: -5 - 3 = -8), or they see '-5' and think they should subtract 5 from the other side (Paul's error: -3 - 5 = -8). Because both Jo and Paul have followed a consistent (though incorrect) logic of 'matching' the sign rather than 'inverting' it, a high percentage of students will conclude that both are correct (Answer C). Even higher-ability students often rush this and fail to check the balance of the equation.</explanation>
