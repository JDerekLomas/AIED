<explanation>The most common error stems from the "same operation" misconception identified in the prompt, leading students to Answer B (3n + 4n = 7n and 2 - 5 = -3, or more commonly, subtracting 2 from -5 to get -7, then dividing by 7). However, in my experience, the presence of the inequality sign and variables on both sides adds significant cognitive load. Many students will subtract 3n from 4n to get 'n' on the right, but then subtract 5 from 2 (getting -3) or add 2 to 5 but forget to flip the sign if they divide by a negative. Answer B is the 'trap' for those performing 4n-3n and 2-5, while Answer D is the most common error for those who solve it correctly as 7 ≥ n but instinctively write the letter first without flipping the inequality symbol.</explanation>
