<explanation>The primary error for most students is managing the signs of the factors. While the misconception identified in the prompt (multiplying two negatives to get a negative) leads students to option B, the most common error in my experience is failing to correctly balance the sum of the linear terms. Students often find the factors 3 and 2 but struggle with which should be negative to result in -x. Option D is the most frequent mistake because students see the negative sign in the expression and associate it with the smaller number, or simply lose track of the directed number addition (-3 + 2 vs +3 - 2). In Year 7 and 8, the high incorrect percentage is due to quadratic factorisation not being part of the standard curriculum for most, leading to pure guesswork.</explanation>
