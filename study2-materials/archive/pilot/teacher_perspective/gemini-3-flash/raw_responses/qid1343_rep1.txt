<explanation>The primary misconception is the "left-to-right" bias, where students ignore the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students calculating left-to-right will do 12 ÷ 2 = 6, then 6 + 1 = 7, and finally 7 × 2 = 14, leading them to answer C. Another common error is answer A, where students correctly divide first (6) and then add (6 + 1 = 7) but fail to multiply correctly or perform the addition before the final multiplication. Answer B (3) usually results from students adding first (2 + 1 = 3), then dividing 12 by 3 (4), and then... losing their way. In my experience, even high-ability Year 11s can slip up on this under time pressure if they don't actively pause to identify the operators first.</explanation>
