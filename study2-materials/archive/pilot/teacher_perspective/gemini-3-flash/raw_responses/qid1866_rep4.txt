<explanation>The most common error is a "left-to-right" bias where students ignore the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students calculate 8 - 7 = 1, then 1 + 10 = 11, and finally 11 * 3 = 33 (Option D). Another common error is adding before subtracting (8 - 17) due to the 'A' appearing before 'S' in the acronym, leading to negative results. However, the simple linear processing of the expression is the dominant mistake seen in UK classrooms at Key Stage 3 and 4.</explanation>
