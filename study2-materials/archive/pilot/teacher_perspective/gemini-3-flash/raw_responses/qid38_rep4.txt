<explanation>The most common error is answer B, where students apply the "add across" strategy for both numerators and denominators (3+4=7 and 2x+x=3x). This stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of equivalent fractions and the need for a common denominator. Even students who recognize they need a common denominator often choose D, failing to multiply the numerator of the second fraction by 2 when converting 4/x to 8/2x. Year 7 and 8 students rarely encounter algebraic fractions, so their failure rate is near-total, often treating 'x' as a unit or ignoring it entirely.</explanation>
