<explanation>The most common error in fraction addition is the 'add everything' strategy, where students add the numerators (1+2=3) and the denominators (5+5=10), leading to answer D. While many students correctly handle the whole numbers, the instinct to treat the denominator as a standard number to be summed is a deep-seated misconception. Additionally, some students may choose B; while mathematically equivalent, it fails to meet the 'mixed number' instruction, representing a failure to read the final constraint of the question.</explanation>
