<explanation>The primary misconception lies in Tom's statement. Many students are taught BIDMAS/BODMAS as a rigid hierarchy where Addition (A) must always come before Subtraction (S). Consequently, they incorrectly believe that in the expression 3-1+2, they must calculate 1+2 first, leading them to think 3-1+2 equals 0, whereas 3+2-1 equals 4. They fail to recognise that addition and subtraction have equal priority and should be processed left-to-right (or by treating the sign as attached to the number). Katie's statement is more frequently identified as correct because the commutative property of addition is more intuitive, even when a multiplication term is involved.</explanation>
