<explanation>The most common error is the 'Left-to-Right' misconception. Students often ignore the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and simply calculate 8 + 12 = 20, then 20 ÷ 4 = 5 for the left-hand side. Because the right-hand side also equals 5 (due to the brackets forcing that same calculation), they conclude the two sides are equal (Answer C). Even students who remember the acronym 'BIDMAS' often fail to apply it when the addition comes first in the string, as the visual pull of '8 + 12' being a 'nice' number is very strong.</explanation>
