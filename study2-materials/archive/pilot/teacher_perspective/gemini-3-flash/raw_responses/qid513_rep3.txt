<explanation>The primary misconception here is 'operation confusion' where students apply the operation shown in the equation rather than the inverse. In Step 1, students see the minus sign and subtract 4 from 15 (getting 11) instead of adding it. In Step 2, they see the implicit multiplication in 2p and multiply 11 by 2 (getting 22) instead of dividing. Many students will select C (Both steps are correct) because they follow the same incorrect logic Isaac used, essentially 'doing what it says' rather than 'undoing' the operations. This is particularly prevalent in younger years before the concept of 'balancing' or 'inverse operations' is fully cemented.</explanation>
