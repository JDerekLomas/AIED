<explanation>Students frequently struggle with the order of operations (BIDMAS) and the squaring of negative numbers. The most common misconception is that squaring a negative number results in a negative value (e.g., believing (-2)^2 is -4). Consequently, many students will select C or D, believing they result in negative totals (2 * -4 - 1 = -9). Furthermore, many students instinctively avoid the decimal option (B) because they find fraction/decimal arithmetic more cognitively demanding, or they assume that a negative input is the only way to achieve a negative output. They often fail to recognise that squaring a value between -1 and 1 results in a smaller magnitude, which in this case allows the subtraction of 1 to result in a negative value.</explanation>
