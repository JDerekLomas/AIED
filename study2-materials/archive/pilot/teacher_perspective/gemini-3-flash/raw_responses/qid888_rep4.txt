<explanation>The most common error in expanding double brackets involves the signs of the constant term. Students frequently apply the rule for addition (a negative plus a negative is a negative) to the multiplication step, leading them to believe that -5 multiplied by -7 is -35. This makes Option D the most popular distractor. Option A is also common among students who struggle with directed number arithmetic when summing the middle terms (-5 and -7), often resulting in -2 instead of -12. In Year 7 and 8, many students will not have been introduced to quadratic expansion, leading to very high error rates.</explanation>
