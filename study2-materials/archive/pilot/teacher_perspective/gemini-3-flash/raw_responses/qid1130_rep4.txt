<explanation>The correct equation is 10x + 30 = 180, leading to 10x = 150 and x = 15. The most common error (Option D) occurs when students fail to use inverse operations correctly. Instead of subtracting 30 from 180, they add it (180 + 30 = 210), then divide by 10 to get 21. Younger students often struggle to form the initial equation or fail to combine the constant terms (-12 + 42) correctly, often arriving at Option B by dividing 180 by the sum of the coefficients (180/10 + 12 - 42 logic). Option D specifically targets the misconception of using the same operation rather than the inverse when moving terms across the equals sign.</explanation>
