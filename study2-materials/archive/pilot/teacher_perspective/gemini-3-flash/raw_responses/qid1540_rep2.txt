<explanation>The primary error stems from the calculation of (-1)². Students frequently calculate this as -1 rather than 1. When combined with the subsequent term -2(-1), which they often process as -2, they arrive at -1 - 2 + 1 = -2 (Option A). However, the most common "distractor" logic for mid-ability students is thinking the negatives simply 'cancel out' to zero or making a sign error in the middle term: (-1)² - 2(-1) + 1 becomes 1 - 2 + 1 = 0. Option D is a very common trap for students who struggle with the double negative in the linear term. Year 7 and 8 students struggle immensely here as they have rarely encountered quadratic substitution with negatives.</explanation>
