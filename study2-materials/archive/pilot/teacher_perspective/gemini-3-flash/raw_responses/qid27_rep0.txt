<explanation>The primary error is the handling of the double negative. Many students correctly substitute to get 10 - 2(-2) but then calculate 10 - 4 = 6 (Option B), failing to recognize that subtracting a negative or multiplying -2 by -2 results in a positive. Another common error is Option A (-12), where students calculate 10 - 2 and then multiply by -2, or Option D (32), where students concatenate the digits rather than multiplying (10 - 2-2 becoming 10 - (-22)). Even at GCSE level, the "negative times a negative" rule remains one of the most persistent points of failure under exam pressure.</explanation>
