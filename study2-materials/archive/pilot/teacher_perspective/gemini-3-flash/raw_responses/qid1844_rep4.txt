<explanation>While the question specifically targets the negative multiplication misconception (leading to D), my experience shows that the most frequent error for this specific format is actually Distractor B. Students often confuse the y-intercept with the x-intercepts (roots). They see the 8 and 6 and immediately associate them with where the graph crosses the axes, often forgetting to swap the signs or distinguish between the x and y axes. Among higher-ability students who know to expand the brackets to find the constant 'c', the most common error is indeed D, caused by the 'sign error' of multiplying -8 and -6 to get -48. Year 7 and 8 students score very low here as they haven't typically covered quadratic expansion or the properties of parabolas.</explanation>
