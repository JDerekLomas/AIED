<explanation>Students frequently struggle with the 'inverse operation' principle when terms are on opposite sides of the equals sign. In Jo's case, students see a -3 and a -5 and intuitively 'combine' them to make -8 without considering that moving a term across the equals sign requires the opposite operation (+3 or +5). In Paul's case, they often think they are 'moving' the -5 to join the -3, but they simply add the numbers together (-5 and -3) to get -8, failing to realize that adding 5 to both sides would result in +2. Option C is the most common error because both Jo and Paul's logic "looks" like correct arithmetic (-3 - 5 = -8), and students often prioritize the arithmetic over the algebraic rules of equality.</explanation>
