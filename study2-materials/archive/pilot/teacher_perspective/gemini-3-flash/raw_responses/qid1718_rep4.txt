<explanation>The most pervasive error is the 'freshman's dream' misconception, where students simply square the individual terms inside the bracket (x^2 and -3^2), leading to B or C. This happens because they fail to recognise that squaring a binomial requires expanding double brackets. Among those who do attempt to expand fully, many struggle with the directed number rule that -3 multiplied by -3 equals positive 9, leading them to choose A. Year 7 and 8 students often haven't been formally introduced to binomial expansion, hence the very high error rates.</explanation>
