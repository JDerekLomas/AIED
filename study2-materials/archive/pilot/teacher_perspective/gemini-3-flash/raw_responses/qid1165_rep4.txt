<explanation>The primary error is the 'negative times a negative' rule. Many students correctly identify that 8 x 2 is 16, but their intuition often tells them that since both numbers are negative, the result must also be negative (Option D). In lower years (7-8), students frequently confuse the rules for addition and multiplication, leading them to Option A (-10) by adding the terms. Even in Year 11, under exam pressure, the 'sign error' remains the most persistent mistake in algebraic expansion.</explanation>
