<explanation>The most common error is the BIDMAS/Order of Operations misconception where students work strictly from left to right. They calculate 2 x 3 first to get 6, and then square the result (6²) to get 36 (Option C). A secondary error is Option B, where students multiply the base by the exponent (3 x 2 = 6) and then multiply by the leading 2, or simply calculate 2 x 3 x 2. Even at GCSE level (Year 11), a significant minority of students under pressure revert to left-to-right processing or fail to recognise the exponent's priority over multiplication.</explanation>
