<explanation>The most common error is the 'operation mimicry' misconception. In Step 2, students see a '+1' and, instead of applying the inverse operation (subtracting 1), they instinctively add 1 to 60 because they see an addition sign. This is particularly prevalent in younger years where students are still transitioning from 'filling in the box' arithmetic to formal algebraic manipulation. Many students will also struggle to identify the error because Step 1 is correct; they assume that if the first step is right, the logical progression to 61 must also be correct without checking the inverse. Option C is the most common distractor because students often lack the 'checking' habit to substitute k=61 back into the original equation.</explanation>
