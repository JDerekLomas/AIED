<explanation>The most prevalent misconception in fraction addition is 'additive thinking' across both numerators and denominators. Students frequently add the whole numbers (2+2=4) and then simply add the numerators (7+1=8) and denominators (10+4=14), leading them directly to option D. Even higher-ability students often default to this when working under time pressure or if they haven't mastered common denominators. Option A represents students who converted to improper fractions correctly but failed to convert back to a mixed number as requested, while Option C represents a failure to find a common denominator followed by a multiplication of the denominators.</explanation>
