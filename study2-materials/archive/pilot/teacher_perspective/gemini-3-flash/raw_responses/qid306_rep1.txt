<explanation>The primary misconception is the 'Left-to-Right' bias, where students simply process numbers as they read them. In Problem P, students correctly identify 4-5 as the first step (moving left to right), but they apply this same logic to Problem Q, ignoring the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule that multiplication takes precedence over addition. Additionally, a significant minority of students choose D because they have been taught 'Addition comes before Subtraction' in the BIDMAS acronym (A before S), leading them to incorrectly believe they must do 5+6 first in Problem P, even though addition and subtraction have equal priority.</explanation>
