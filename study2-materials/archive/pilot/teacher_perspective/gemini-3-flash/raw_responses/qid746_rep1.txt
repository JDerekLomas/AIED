<explanation>The most common error is a 'left-to-right' processing bias, ignoring the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students get answer D (4) by calculating 4+12=16, then 16÷(2+2) which is 16÷4=4. Even students who remember 'Brackets first' often mistakenly think they must then work strictly left-to-right with the remaining values. Answer A (10) is another common error where students do 4+12=16, 16÷2=8, then 8+2=10, completely ignoring both the brackets and the order of operations.</explanation>
