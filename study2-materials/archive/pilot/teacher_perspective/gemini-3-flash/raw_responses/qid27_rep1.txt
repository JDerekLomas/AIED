<explanation>The primary hurdle is the 'double negative'. Students frequently calculate 2 * -2 = -4, but then fail to correctly subtract that negative from 10, often simplifying 10 - 4 to get 6 (Option B). Some students also struggle with the invisible multiplication between the coefficient and the variable, leading them to see '2-2' or '22', but the sign error is the most persistent across all key stages. Even high-achieving Year 11s often default to 10 - 4 in a high-pressure exam environment.</explanation>
