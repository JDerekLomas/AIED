<explanation>The most common error is the 'coefficient grab'—students assume the gradient is simply the number in front of x (4), ignoring the need to rearrange into y = mx + c. Among higher-ability students who know they must rearrange, the misconception tested (using the same operation instead of the inverse) leads them to answer D (4/3) because they fail to subtract 4x, or A (-4) because they subtract 4x but forget to divide by 3. Option B remains the most frequent error across the general population due to a fundamental misunderstanding of implicit vs explicit forms.</explanation>
