<explanation>The primary error is a failure to apply the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students typically read the expression from left to right, adding 1/3 and 1/2 first to get 5/6, and then multiplying by 1/3 to get 5/18 (Option B). This is a 'double-threat' question because it combines a structural misconception (order of operations) with fractional arithmetic. Even students who remember BIDMAS often struggle with the mechanics of adding fractions with different denominators, leading them to gravitate towards the simpler left-to-right calculation. Option C is also a common distractor for those who add the numerators and denominators across the whole expression.</explanation>
