<explanation>Students struggle with the multi-step rearrangement required to convert the equation into the form y = mx + c. The most common error is failing to handle the negative sign when moving the 5x term. Many students correctly identify that they must divide by 3, but they either ignore the subtraction step entirely (leading to answer A) or perform the subtraction but forget the negative sign in the final gradient (leading to answer C). Answer C is particularly common among higher-ability students who know the 'short cut' (a/b) but forget the sign change involved in the inverse operation.</explanation>
