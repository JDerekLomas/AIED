<explanation>The most common error in expanding double brackets involves the signs, specifically the constant term. Students often correctly identify that -5 and -7 sum to -12 (for the 'm' coefficient), but they frequently default to the misconception that "a negative and a negative make a negative" when multiplying, leading them to choose -35 instead of +35. Option D is the classic "sign error" trap. Option A is also common for students who struggle with directed number addition (calculating -5 + 7 or 5 - 7 instead of -5 - 7). In Year 7, most students haven't been formally introduced to quadratic expansion, hence the very high predicted failure rate.</explanation>
