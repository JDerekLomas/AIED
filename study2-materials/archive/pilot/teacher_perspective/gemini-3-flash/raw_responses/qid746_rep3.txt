<explanation>The most common error is processing the calculation strictly from left to right: (4 + 12) = 16, then 16 ÷ 4 = 4. Students often ignore BIDMAS/order of operations when the addition appears first. Another common mistake is Option A (10), where students correctly calculate the brackets but then add before dividing (4 + 12 = 16, 16 ÷ 4 = 4 is common, but some do 12 ÷ 2 = 6, then 4 + 6 = 10, ignoring brackets). However, the 'left-to-right' compulsion remains the dominant misconception in UK secondary classrooms.</explanation>
