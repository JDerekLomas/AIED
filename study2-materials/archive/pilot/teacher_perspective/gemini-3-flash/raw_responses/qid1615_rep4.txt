<explanation>The most common error is choosing option B because it follows the linear "left-to-right" reading of the sentence. Students often translate "I take away six" as "- 6" and "then divide by three" as "÷ 3" without considering that BIDMAS/order of operations requires a vinculum (fraction bar) or brackets to ensure the subtraction happens first. Option D is the second most common error, representing a failure to group the 'n-6' before dividing. Even higher-ability students often struggle with the formal algebraic representation of multi-step word problems, defaulting to a calculator-style input sequence.</explanation>
