<explanation>The primary issue is the 'left-to-right' processing bias. Many students read algebraic expressions like a sentence. Because '3 +' appears first, they assume the addition must be performed before the multiplication of 'a' and 'b'. Option C is the most common distractor because it follows the physical sequence of the expression (3, then a, then b). Additionally, students often struggle with the invisible multiplication sign between variables, sometimes confusing 'ab' with 'a + b' (Option B), but the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) remains the most significant hurdle here.</explanation>
