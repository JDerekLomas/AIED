<explanation>The most common error is the 'left-to-right' misconception, where students ignore the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). They calculate 12 ÷ 2 = 6, then 6 + 1 = 7, and finally 7 × 2 = 14 (Option C). Another common error is Option A (9), where students correctly divide first but then add before multiplying (6 + 1 = 7, then 7 + 2 = 9), often due to a misunderstanding that Addition comes before Multiplication because 'A' comes before 'M' in the acronym. Even in Year 11, under exam pressure, many students revert to intuitive left-to-right processing if they aren't explicitly prompted to check for order of operations.</explanation>
