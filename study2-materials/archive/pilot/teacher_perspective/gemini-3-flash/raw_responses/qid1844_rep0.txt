<explanation>The most common error is answer B, where students confuse the y-intercept with the x-intercepts (roots). Even students who understand that the y-intercept occurs when x=0 often struggle with the 'double negative' multiplication (-8 * -6), leading them to choose D. In Year 7 and 8, the concept of quadratic forms is largely unfamiliar, so most students would simply guess or try to add the numbers (Option A). By Year 11, the confusion between roots and intercepts remains the most persistent hurdle.</explanation>
