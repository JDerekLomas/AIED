<explanation>The most common error is choosing 'Both' (C) because students frequently confuse the operation required to 'move' a number. For Tom's working, many students see the 5 and the 40 and instinctively divide (40 ÷ 5 = 8) rather than performing the inverse operation of multiplication. They recognize that 5 and 40 have a functional relationship involving 8, which makes Tom's answer look 'mathematically plausible' to a struggling student. Katie's working is more frequently identified as correct because dividing both sides by 8 is a standard first step, though some students still struggle with 40 ÷ 8. The high failure rate in younger years is due to the 'illusion of simplicity' in Tom's incorrect step.</explanation>
