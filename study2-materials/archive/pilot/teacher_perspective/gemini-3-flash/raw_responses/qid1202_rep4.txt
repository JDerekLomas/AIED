<explanation>The most common error is choosing A (y=2) because students see the numbers 3 and 5 and perform a simple subtraction (5 - 3) without accounting for the negative sign attached to the y. This is a classic 'directed number' misconception combined with a procedural error in solving equations. Students often think "what do I add to 3 to get 5?" or simply ignore the minus sign. Option C (y=8) is also frequent as students see the minus sign and instinctively perform the inverse operation (addition) on the constants (5 + 3) while ignoring the fact that the 3 is positive.</explanation>
