<explanation>The most common error (leading to C) is the 'same operation' misconception where students see the divide by 2 and multiply by 8, or see the subtract 3 and add it to the denominator. Specifically, many students will multiply the 1/8 by 2 to get 2/16 (or 1/8 / 2 = 1/16) and then add 3, but incorrectly handle the fraction addition or mistakenly multiply the denominator by 2 instead of the numerator. Option A is also common for those who cross-multiply incorrectly (8t - 24 = 26). The jump from algebraic manipulation to fractional arithmetic is where most students at KS3 and lower-tier KS4 stumble.</explanation>
