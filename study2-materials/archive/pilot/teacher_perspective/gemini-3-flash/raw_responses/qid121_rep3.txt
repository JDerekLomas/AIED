<explanation>Students frequently assume the gradient is simply the coefficient of x (m) regardless of the equation's format, leading many to choose A (5). For those who recognize the need to rearrange into y=mx+c, two main errors occur: failing to divide the x-coefficient by the y-coefficient (leading to A or B) or, as specifically noted in the misconception, failing to use the inverse operation when moving 5x to the other side. This results in C (5/3) instead of the correct negative value D. In my experience, even high-ability Year 11s under pressure often default to 'the number in front of x'.</explanation>
