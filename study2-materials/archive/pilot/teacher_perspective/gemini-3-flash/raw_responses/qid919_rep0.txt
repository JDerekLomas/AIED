<explanation>The most common error is a failure to apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly. Students often read the expression from left to right, calculating (3 times 0.3) first to get 0.9, and then squaring that result to get 0.81 (Option A). This is a deep-seated misconception where the coefficient is bundled with the base before the exponent is applied. Another significant group of students will choose Option D (2.7) because they correctly square 0.3 to get 0.09 but then struggle with the decimal multiplication (3 times 0.09), often misplacing the decimal point as if they were doing 3 times 0.9. Option C (1.8) is common among lower-ability students who multiply the base by the exponent (0.3 times 2) and then multiply by 3.</explanation>
