<explanation>The most common error is answer D (3/14), which stems from the 'additive' misconception where students apply the rules of integer addition to both the numerator and the denominator. Even though these fractions have a common denominator, many students (particularly lower-attaining ones) default to a procedural "add across" strategy. Answer B is a rarer error associated with multiplication confusion, while A is a simple processing error. By Year 11, most students have mastered common denominators, but under exam pressure, a small percentage still revert to the intuitive error of adding the bottom numbers.</explanation>
