<explanation>The most common error (leading to D) is the 'multiplication' misconception: students see the 2 and 6 and think "2 times 6 is 12" or "3 times 4 is 12", failing to substitute x=0 into the equation correctly. Even when substituting x=0, many students struggle with the resulting equation 2y=6; while some perform the inverse correctly to get 3 (Option A), a significant number of lower-ability students see the numbers 2 and 6 and perform a 'bond' error or use the wrong operation. Option B is a common 'distractor' where students simply pick the coefficient of y or the value of x from the next column. Year 7 and 8 students often haven't mastered equations with two variables or the formal substitution required for linear graphs.</explanation>
