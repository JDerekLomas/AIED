<explanation>The most frequent error is Option A (y=2). Students often perform a "subtraction by instinct" when they see 3 and 5, calculating 5 - 3 = 2 without accounting for the negative sign attached to the y. They essentially solve 3 + y = 5 or simply find the difference between the two constants. Option C (y=8) is also a common pitfall for students who try to "move" the 3 to the other side and add it (3 + 5), ignoring the fact that 3 is positive. The presence of the negative coefficient (-1y) is a classic threshold concept that students struggle with until they are confident with formal algebraic manipulation.</explanation>
