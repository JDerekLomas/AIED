<explanation>The most common error is choosing Option A (p = 1/4). Students often see the numbers 3 and 12 and instinctively perform the operation 12 ÷ 3 because they are used to the answer being a 'nicer' integer or a simpler fraction. This stems from a failure to apply the formal inverse operation (dividing both sides by 3). Instead of calculating (1/12) ÷ 3, they treat the 3 and 12 as independent integers. Option C is also common among lower-attaining students who ignore the fraction entirely and simply calculate 12 ÷ 3 = 4.</explanation>
