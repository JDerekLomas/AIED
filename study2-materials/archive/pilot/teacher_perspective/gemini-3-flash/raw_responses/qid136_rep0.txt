<explanation>The primary misconception is the 'matching signs' error. Many students (particularly in Year 7 and 8) associate a negative answer with needing negative numbers in the calculation, leading them to choose Option A because both numbers have minus signs. They often confuse the rules for addition (where a negative plus a negative is a negative) with the rules for multiplication. Option C is a common distractor for students who confuse 'product' with 'sum', while Option D attracts those with weak mental arithmetic. Even at GCSE (Year 10/11), a significant minority of students still reflexively choose A under time pressure due to an insecure grasp of directed number rules.</explanation>
