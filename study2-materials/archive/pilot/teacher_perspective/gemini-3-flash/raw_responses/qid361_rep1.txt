<explanation>The most common error is choosing 'C' (Both) because students read the mathematical expressions left-to-right, mirroring the chronological order of the word problem. Many students fail to recognise that in Paul's expression, BIDMAS/Order of Operations dictates that the multiplication by 7 would happen *before* the addition of 4, whereas the word problem requires the addition to happen first. Students often view the brackets in Paul's expression as "sufficient" to show the sequence, failing to realise that the final '+ 4' sits outside the reach of the multiplier 7. Younger students also struggle with the fractional notation in Jo's correct expression, often thinking it only applies to the (n-5) rather than seeing the structure of the entire operation chain.</explanation>
