<explanation>This question is high-level as it requires both the recall of the sphere volume formula (V = 4/3πr³) and the ability to rearrange a complex formula involving fractions, pi, and powers. 

In Year 7 and 8, the vast majority will fail because they haven't encountered the formula or cube roots. In Year 10 and 11, the most common error is failing to use inverse operations correctly. Option A is the most common distractor because students often "move" the 4/3 and π across the equals sign without reciprocating the fraction or dividing, effectively just grouping all known terms together. Option B is also a common pitfall where students correctly divide by π but fail to correctly invert the 4/3 fraction. The sheer density of symbols in the options often leads to "visual guessing" where students pick the option that contains all the correct components of the formula regardless of their algebraic position.</explanation>
