<explanation>The primary hurdle here is the 'Left-to-Right' bias. Many students instinctively read mathematical expressions like a sentence, performing 0.1 - 0.2 first. Because this results in a negative number (-0.1), students often feel they have made a mistake or that the order must be different. Katie's suggestion (B) is a highly attractive distractor because it 'fixes' the problem of starting with a smaller number, leading students to believe that subtraction and division are commutative or that the order should be rearranged to avoid negatives. Furthermore, the presence of decimals adds a layer of cognitive load that makes students more likely to abandon formal BIDMAS/BODMAS rules in favour of intuitive (but incorrect) processing.</explanation>
