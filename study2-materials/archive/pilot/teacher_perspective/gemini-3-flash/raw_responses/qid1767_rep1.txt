<explanation>The most common error is choosing Option D (-7). Students often exhibit 'operation matching' where they see a minus sign in the expression (x - 7) and instinctively believe they must subtract 7 to 'deal with' it. This stems from a failure to understand the concept of inverse operations to isolate the variable. In younger year groups, students often view the equals sign as a 'do something' button rather than a balance, leading them to repeat the operation shown. Even in higher year groups, under exam pressure, students frequently make this sign error by 'moving' the 7 without changing its sign.</explanation>
