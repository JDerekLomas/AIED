<explanation>The most common error is a failure to correctly square a negative number and handle the subsequent subtraction of a negative. Students often calculate (-1)² as -1. This leads them to -1 - 2(-1) + 1. Even if they correctly identify -2(-1) as +2, they end up with -1 + 2 + 1 = 2 (Option C). However, the most frequent path to error is evaluating the expression as -1 - 2 + 1, which results in -2 (Option A), or misinterpreting the signs entirely to reach 0 (Option D). Specifically, students often type -1² into a basic calculator without brackets, yielding -1, or mentally process "1 squared is 1, so -1 squared is -1". Option D is highly attractive to students who struggle with the double negative in -2x, calculating it as (-1)^2 - 2(1) + 1 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0.</explanation>
