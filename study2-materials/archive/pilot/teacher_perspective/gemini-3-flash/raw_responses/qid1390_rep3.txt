<explanation>The primary error is a failure to apply the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students typically read the expression from left to right, performing the addition (1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6) before the multiplication (5/6 * 1/3 = 5/18), leading to option B. This is compounded by the fact that many students are less confident with fractions and focus so much on finding common denominators for the addition that they forget the hierarchy of operations entirely. Even higher-ability students often default to left-to-right processing when fractions are involved because of the increased cognitive load.</explanation>
