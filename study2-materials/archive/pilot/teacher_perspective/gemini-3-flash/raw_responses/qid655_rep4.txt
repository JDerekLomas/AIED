<explanation>This question is exceptionally difficult for students because it combines three high-error domains: negative number arithmetic, fractional quotients, and algebraic thinking. 

The most common error is C. Students correctly identify that the missing value must be positive to result in a negative product (-6 × + = -8), but then they fall into the "larger number divided by smaller number" trap. Because 8 is larger than 6, they intuitively reach for 8/6, but then apply a "negative and a negative must stay negative" logic or simply misapply the sign rules. 

Option A is also a frequent distractor for students who perform the operation 6/8 because they are used to the smaller number being the numerator in lower-school fractions. Even at Year 11, many students struggle to see the equation as -8 ÷ -6, and those who do often simplify the signs incorrectly or flip the fraction.</explanation>
