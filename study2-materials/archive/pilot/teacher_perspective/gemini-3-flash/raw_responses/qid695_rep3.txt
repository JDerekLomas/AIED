<explanation>The most common error is the 'Left-to-Right' misconception (Option C). Students often process the expression as a linear string: 18 ÷ 2 = 9, then 9 + 2 = 11, and finally 11 × 2 = 22. Despite learning BIDMAS/BODMAS, many students treat it as a suggestion rather than a rigid hierarchy, especially when the addition appears before the multiplication in the string. Option A (3) is also common among students who correctly identify the priority of 2x2 but then add it to 2 before dividing 18 by the result. Option D (12) occurs when students perform the division and addition first (11) then mistakenly add the final 1 rather than multiplying.</explanation>
