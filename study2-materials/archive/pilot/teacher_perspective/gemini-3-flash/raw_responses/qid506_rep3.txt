<explanation>The most common error is students performing the operation they see (multiplication/division involving 3 and 12) rather than applying the inverse operation to both sides. Many students see the '3' and the '12' and instinctively divide 12 by 3 to get 4, leading them to answer A (1/4) or C (4). Option A is particularly seductive because it "looks" like a fraction problem solved correctly. Students often struggle with the concept that dividing a fraction by an integer results in a smaller fraction (multiplying the denominator), frequently trying to "simplify" the 3 and 12 instead.</explanation>
