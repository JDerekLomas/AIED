<explanation>The most pervasive misconception here is the 'Zero Property' in statistics; many students across all key stages believe that zero 'doesn't count' when calculating a mean, leading them to divide by 4 (Option C). Furthermore, Option B is a classic 'calculator syntax' error where students fail to apply BIDMAS/PEMDAS, incorrectly assuming the division only applies to the final number. Even high-attaining students often rush and select C because they mentally discount the 0 as having no value, forgetting it is a valid data point that affects the denominator.</explanation>
