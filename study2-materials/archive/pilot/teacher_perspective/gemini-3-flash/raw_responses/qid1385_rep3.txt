<explanation>The most common error in fraction addition is the 'freshman's dream'—simply adding all numerators (1+1+2+3=7) and all denominators (3+4+3+4=14), leading to answer B. Even though this question is designed to be easy if students group the thirds and quarters to make 1 + 1 = 2, lower-ability students often default to a procedural 'add across' method when they see multiple terms. Answer A is a common distractor for those who try to find a common denominator but only add the first two terms or make a calculation error, while D represents those who found the common denominator of 12 but struggled with the final simplification to an integer.</explanation>
