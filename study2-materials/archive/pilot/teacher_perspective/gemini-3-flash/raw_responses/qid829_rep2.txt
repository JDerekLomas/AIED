<explanation>The most common error is a failure to correctly apply directed number rules, specifically when multiplying two negative constants. Students often correctly identify that -3 and -2 sum to -5 (the linear term), but then incorrectly calculate -3 multiplied by -2 as -6 (Option D). This is a persistent 'fluency' error where students associate the negative signs in the bracket with a negative result in the constant term. Option B is also a common distractor for students who struggle with the addition of negative numbers (calculating -3 + 2 or similar).</explanation>
