<explanation>The most common error in this specific question arises from students performing the same operation as seen in the expression rather than the inverse operation (the misconception explicitly tested). For option D, students see '+1' and add 1 to both sides (-3 + 1 = -2, 7 + 1 = 8), and then see '2x' and multiply by 2 (-2 * 2 = -4, 8 * 2 = 16), leading them to a result similar to D. Additionally, many students struggle with the 'double-ended' nature of the inequality, often only applying operations to the right-hand side. Option B is also a common distractor for students who correctly subtract 1 but then fail to divide by 2 correctly, or vice versa.</explanation>
