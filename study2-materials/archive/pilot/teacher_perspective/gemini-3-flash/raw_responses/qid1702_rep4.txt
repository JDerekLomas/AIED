<explanation>Students struggle with this question due to a combination of multi-step algebraic manipulation and the presence of a decimal. 

The most common error (Option D: 2.7) comes from students incorrectly handling the subtraction of 6y. They substitute y=0.5 to get 3, but then perform 30 - 3 = 27, followed by 27 / 10 = 2.7. This demonstrates the misconception of using the same operation (subtraction) rather than the inverse (addition) when moving the term across the equals sign. 

Option A (4.25) is another common error where students confuse the variables or make sign errors when rearranging. Year 7 and 8 students often find this exceptionally difficult as they have rarely encountered linear equations where the subject isn't already isolated or where they have to work backwards from a y-value to an x-value using decimals.</explanation>
