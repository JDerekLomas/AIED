<explanation>The most common error is the 'commutative misconception' where students see the numbers 10 and 5 and automatically perform the operation 10 ÷ 5 because it results in an integer. Students often struggle when the unknown is the denominator; they tend to 'swap' the numerator and the result, or simply ignore the structure of the fraction and multiply (leading to B) or divide the larger by the smaller (leading to C). In my experience, even high-achieving Year 11s can default to p=2 under time pressure because they read the equation as 'something involving 10 and 5 that looks like division'.</explanation>
