<explanation>The most common error is a failure to correctly apply the rules of directed numbers, specifically that a negative multiplied by a negative results in a positive. Many students instinctively see two minus signs and believe the result must remain negative (Option B). Additionally, lower-ability students or those in younger year groups often default to addition rather than multiplication when they see two integers, leading them to choose Option D (-7) or even Option A (+7) due to confusion between the operations required for expanding brackets versus simplifying expressions.</explanation>
