<explanation>The most common error (leading to answer A) is a lack of understanding of the relationship between variables in an implicit equation. Many students see 2y=10 and, rather than dividing by 2, they multiply (using the same operation rather than the inverse) to get 20. Others may simply see the 2 and 10 and perform 2*10. Additionally, lower-ability students often struggle when x=0; they may ignore the 4x term entirely but fail to correctly solve the remaining one-step equation. Answer D (2.5) is also a common distractor for students who perform 10 divided by 4, confusing the coefficients of x and y.</explanation>
