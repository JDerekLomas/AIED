<explanation>The most common error is the 'add across' misconception (Option B), where students treat the numerators and denominators as independent integers (2+1=3 and 9+3=12). This is a persistent 'intuitive' error that resurfaces when students are under pressure or have weak conceptual understanding of common denominators. Option C is also a common 'half-way' error where students change the denominator of the second fraction to 9 but forget to scale the numerator, resulting in 2/9 + 1/9.</explanation>
