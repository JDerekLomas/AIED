<explanation>The primary error is a failure to apply the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students typically read the question from left to right, performing the subtraction first (3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 or 1/2) and then multiplying the result by 1/5, leading to 1/10 (Option B). This is a very persistent misconception because students often view fractions as "one thing" and the horizontal layout of the expression encourages a linear approach. Even older students who know the rules of BIDMAS often "switch off" when fractions are involved, prioritising the easier operation (subtraction of fractions with common denominators) over the correct mathematical hierarchy.</explanation>
