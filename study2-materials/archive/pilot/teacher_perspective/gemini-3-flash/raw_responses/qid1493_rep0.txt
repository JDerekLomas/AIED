<explanation>The primary misconception is the 'left-to-right' bias, where students instinctively process the numbers in the order they read them. Many students prioritize the subtraction (8-7) because it results in a 'friendly' number (1), making the subsequent calculation seem easier. Additionally, while most students memorise the BIDMAS/BODMAS acronym, many struggle to identify that 'Indices' (the power of 3) must take precedence over both division and subtraction, often viewing the exponent as a secondary attachment to the 6 rather than the first operation to be evaluated.</explanation>
