<explanation>The most common error is choosing C because students identify the roots as -5 and 1 and correctly recall that the signs in the brackets are 'opposite' to the roots (giving x+5 and x-1). However, they often fail to check the orientation (the 'n' shape) or the expansion of the leading term. Students frequently overlook the fact that a negative quadratic must have a -x² term; in option A, (1-x)(x+5) expands to -x² - 4x + 5, whereas C expands to +x². Younger students (Year 7-8) often haven't covered quadratics and will guess based on the numbers seen on the axes, while Year 10-11 students often rush and miss the inverted nature of the curve.</explanation>
