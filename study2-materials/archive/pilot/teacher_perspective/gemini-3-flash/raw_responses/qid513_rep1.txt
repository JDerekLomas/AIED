<explanation>Students frequently confuse inverse operations with the operations already present in the equation. In Step 1, Isaac subtracts 4 from 15 (getting 11) because he sees a minus sign, rather than adding 4 to 'undo' the subtraction. In Step 2, he multiplies 11 by 2 (getting 22) because he sees a coefficient of 2, rather than dividing. Students often select 'Both steps are correct' (C) because Isaac's arithmetic is correct (15-4 is 11, and 11x2 is 22), and they fail to recognise that the logic of the algebraic manipulation is fundamentally flawed. They focus on the calculation rather than the inverse process.</explanation>
