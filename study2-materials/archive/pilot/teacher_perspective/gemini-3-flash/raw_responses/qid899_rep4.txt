<explanation>The most prevalent misconception is the 'left-to-right' bias, where students treat mathematics like reading a sentence. Option B (10-8) is the most frequent error because it is the first operation encountered. Additionally, many students who have memorised the BIDMAS/BODMAS acronym still struggle with the hierarchy of operations when subtraction appears before multiplication in a string, or they mistakenly believe they must perform Addition (7+6) before Subtraction because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym.</explanation>
