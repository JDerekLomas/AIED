<explanation>The most common error is a sign mistake. Many students correctly identify that 4 multiplied by 3 is 12, but they struggle with the directed number aspect. Students often remember the rule 'a minus and a minus make a plus' for addition/subtraction but misapply it, or conversely, they feel that because both terms are negative, the result 'must' be negative. Option B (-12) is the most frequent distractor due to this sign confusion. Option D (-7) is also common among lower-ability students who add the numbers (-4 - 3) instead of multiplying them, despite the context of expanding brackets.</explanation>
