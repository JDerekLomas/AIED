<explanation>The primary misconception here is a failure to apply the correct order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students frequently see "1 - 3n" and perform the subtraction first: (1 - 3) = -2, then multiply by 15 to get -30 (Option D). Even higher-ability students often fall into this "left-to-right" trap when the variable follows a subtraction sign. Additionally, some students struggle with directed numbers; those who do multiply first (3 * 15 = 45) often calculate "1 - 45" as -46 (Option B) by incorrectly counting backwards or conflating rules for adding/subtracting negatives.</explanation>
