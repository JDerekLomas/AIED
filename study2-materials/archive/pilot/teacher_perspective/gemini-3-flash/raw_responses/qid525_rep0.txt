<explanation>The most common error (Option D) stems from the 'add across' misconception, where students correctly add the whole numbers (2+2=4) but then treat the numerators and denominators as independent integers (7+1=8 and 10+4=14). This is a deeply rooted intuitive error. Option A is also a common 'correct value' distractor where students convert to improper fractions but fail to convert back to the requested mixed number format, or make a calculation error in the process. Higher-ability students often fail on the final instruction to provide a mixed number, while lower-ability students fail on the common denominator requirement.</explanation>
