<explanation>The primary reason for the high failure rate is the "rules of signs" misconception. Many students have a fragile understanding of negative number arithmetic; they see the numbers 3, 8, and 24 and focus on the fact that the diagram shows "negative" movement. Consequently, they believe that since the total is -24, any calculation involving these numbers must result in -24. Option C is the most common distractor because students often misremember the rule as "a negative and a negative make a negative," or they apply the logic that "if the arrows point left, everything must be negative." They fail to recognize that -3 x -8 actually equals +24, and -24 divided by -3 equals +8. The visual representation of the arrows often reinforces the error because it pushes them to justify the negative result shown in the diagram rather than checking the arithmetic rules.</explanation>
