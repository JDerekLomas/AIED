<explanation>The most common error is the "commutative misconception" where students believe division can be performed in any order. When they see the numbers 10 and 5, they instinctively perform 10 ÷ 5 = 2 rather than 5 ÷ 10 = 0.5. Students find equations where the unknown is the divisor (denominator) significantly harder than when it is the dividend. Many will also choose B (50) by incorrectly applying the inverse operation, multiplying the two visible numbers (10 * 5) regardless of their position in the fraction. Even higher-ability students often rush and select p=2 because it "feels" like a more natural whole-number result.</explanation>
