<explanation>The most common error occurs when students fail to apply inverse operations correctly to fractions. Instead of multiplying by 2 to isolate the numerator (t-3), many students see the 2 and the 8 and instinctively divide 1/8 by 2 (resulting in 1/16) or multiply the denominator 8 by 2 (also 1/16). This leads to t - 3 = 1/16, and subsequently t = 3 1/16 (Option C). Another common error is Option A, where students correctly multiply by 2 to get 2/8 (1/4) but then subtract 3 instead of adding it, or Option B, where students cross-multiply incorrectly or simply guess based on seeing familiar numbers like 1, 2, 3, and 8.</explanation>
