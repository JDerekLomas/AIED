<explanation>The most prevalent error is the 'bigger number divided by smaller number' reflex. Students often correctly identify the need to divide, but instinctively calculate 20 ÷ 5 rather than 5 ÷ 20 because they are more comfortable with integer results. Additionally, many students struggle with the final step of isolating 't' when the coefficient is larger than the constant, leading them to Option B. Options C and D are less common but attract students who confuse the additive inverse (moving -5 to become +5) with sign changes during division.</explanation>
