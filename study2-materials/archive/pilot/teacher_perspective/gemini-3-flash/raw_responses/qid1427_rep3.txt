<explanation>The most common error is the 'matching' misconception, where students see the number 7 in the expression and assume the operation must also involve 'adding 7' because they see a plus sign. They fail to understand the principle of the inverse operation required to isolate the variable. In Year 7, many students are still transitioning from 'trial and improvement' or 'number machine' thinking to formal algebraic manipulation. By Year 11, while most have mastered one-step equations, a small percentage still succumb to 'operation matching' under time pressure or due to weak foundational fluency.</explanation>
