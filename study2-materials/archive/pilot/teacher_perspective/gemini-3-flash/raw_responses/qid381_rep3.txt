<explanation>The most common error is failing to correctly invert the fraction 1/2. Many students see the '2' and assume it should remain in the denominator when moved to the other side of the equation, leading them to Option C (h = A/2b). This is often due to a "moving things" mental model rather than a "performing inverse operations" model. Option A is also a common distractor for lower-ability students who simply swap the subject (h) with the area (A) without performing any algebraic manipulation. Year 7 and 8 students struggle significantly as they are often only just being introduced to formal rearrangement, whereas Year 11 students still trip up on this under pressure if they rely on 'formula triangles' rather than algebraic principles.</explanation>
