<explanation>The primary error is the 'negative times a negative' rule. Many students successfully multiply the first term (-5 * m = -5m) but then see the minus sign in front of the 7 and conclude that because there is a minus in the question, there must be a minus in the answer (-5 * -7 = -35). Option B is a classic 'distractor' because it feels 'consistent' to a student who hasn't fully internalised the sign change. In younger years (7 and 8), many students also struggle with the distributive property itself, often forgetting to multiply the second term entirely, though the options provided here specifically target the sign error.</explanation>
