<explanation>The primary misconception is the 'left-to-right' bias. Many students believe that operations should be performed in the order they appear, regardless of BIDMAS/BODMAS rules. Option B is the most common distractor because it reinforces the natural reading order (16-6=10, then 10+4=14, then 14/2=7). Students often fail to re-evaluate the entire expression once brackets are added; they see (16-6) and assume the rest follows sequentially. Option A is also a common pitfall for students who over-correct for BIDMAS by trying to 'group' the middle addition first, resulting in 16 - (10/2) = 11.</explanation>
