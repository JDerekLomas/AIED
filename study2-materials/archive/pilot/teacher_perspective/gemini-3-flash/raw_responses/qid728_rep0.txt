<explanation>The primary misconception is the "Left-to-Right" bias, where students assume operations should be performed in the order they appear. Many students will choose A because they see 16 minus 'something' and want to reduce the 16 significantly to get to 7; they often calculate 16 - 10 = 6, then 6 ÷ 2 = 3, and then get confused or 'force' the math to fit. However, the most persistent error is failing to apply BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly when brackets are involved. Students often struggle with the fact that D requires them to perform 16-6+4 (which is 14) before the division. Many students also mistakenly believe that addition must always come before subtraction because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym, leading them to calculate 6+4 first in any expression containing those terms.</explanation>
