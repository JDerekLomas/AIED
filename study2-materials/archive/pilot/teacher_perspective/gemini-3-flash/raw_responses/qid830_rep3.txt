<explanation>The primary hurdle is the multi-step nature of the substitution combined with decimals. After substituting x=0.3 to get 0.6 + 3y = 12, students subtract 0.6 to get 3y = 11.4. The most common error (Option C) occurs during the final division: students see 11.4 ÷ 3 and, rather than performing the inverse correctly, they often 'bridge' the decimal incorrectly or add 0.6 to 12 instead of subtracting. However, the specific misconception identified (using the same operation) often leads students to calculate 12 + 0.6 = 12.6, then 12.6 ÷ 3 = 4.2. Additionally, many students struggle with the arithmetic of 11.4 ÷ 3, often defaulting to 4.1 or 3.9 through poor mental estimation or rounding errors.</explanation>
