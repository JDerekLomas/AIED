<explanation>The most pervasive error in secondary algebra is the 'Freshman's Dream' or linear expansion error, where students simply square the two terms inside the bracket (x² and (-4)²), leading them to option B. While the specific misconception noted in the prompt involves the sign of the constant (Option D), in practice, the majority of students fail to recognise that (x-4)² means (x-4)(x-4) and requires a middle term (-8x). Among higher-tier students who do attempt the full FOIL/grid method, Option D is a common 'slip' caused by the belief that a negative multiplied by a negative stays negative, or simply misapplying the rules of directed numbers under the pressure of a multi-step expansion.</explanation>
