<explanation>Students frequently struggle with inverse operations and the priority of operations in equations. Tom's error is "moving" the -6 by adding it to the 10 before dealing with the denominator, which is a common mistake when students don't understand that the entire numerator is grouped. Katie's error is performing the same operation (division) rather than the inverse (multiplication) to remove the 2. Many students will see both "logical-looking" manipulations and assume both are valid methods, leading them to choose C. Even higher-ability students often rush and fail to notice that Katie divided 10 by 2 instead of multiplying.</explanation>
