<explanation>This is a high-level question requiring three distinct skills: recall of the sphere volume formula, the ability to rearrange an equation with a fractional coefficient, and handling a cube root. Year 7 and 8 students will almost all fail as they likely haven't encountered the formula or complex rearrangement. The most common error is choice A, where students multiply by the existing coefficients (4 and pi) rather than dividing by them (the inverse operation). Choice B is also common as students often fail to correctly "flip" the 4/3 fraction when moving it to the other side of the equation.</explanation>
