<explanation>The most common error is the 'add across' misconception (Option C), where students simply add the numerators (3+2=5) and the denominators (5+7=12). This is an incredibly persistent intuitive error because it follows the logic of integer addition and multiplication of fractions. Option A represents a subtraction error or a 'cross-multiplication' mistake where one product is subtracted from the other (21-10=11), while Option D often occurs when students find the correct common denominator but fail to adjust the numerators correctly, or simply multiply the denominators but add the original numerators.</explanation>
