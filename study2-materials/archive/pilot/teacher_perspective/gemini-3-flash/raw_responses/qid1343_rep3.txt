<explanation>The most common error is calculating strictly from left to right (12 ÷ 2 = 6, then 6 + 1 = 7, then 7 × 2 = 14), leading to answer C. This stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students often view the order of operations as a set of rules used only when specifically prompted, rather than a universal law of mathematics. Even those who remember the acronym often struggle with the "Addition vs Multiplication" hierarchy, mistakenly believing they should process the string as it is written. Answer A (9) is another common distractor where students do the division and addition correctly but fail to multiply the result by 2 properly, or perform (12 ÷ 2) + (1 + 2) incorrectly.</explanation>
