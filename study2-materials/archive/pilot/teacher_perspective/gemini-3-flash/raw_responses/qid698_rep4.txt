<explanation>The most common error is the 'additive' misconception. Students often see two events and instinctively add the probabilities (1/4 + 1/5) rather than multiplying them. Even when they correctly identify the operation as addition, a secondary misconception occurs where they add both numerators and denominators (1+1)/(4+5), leading to 2/9 (Option C). Some students may also choose A (1/9) by incorrectly adding the denominators but keeping the numerator as 1. The concept of independent events and the 'AND' rule (multiplication) is one of the most persistent hurdles in KS3 and KS4 probability.</explanation>
