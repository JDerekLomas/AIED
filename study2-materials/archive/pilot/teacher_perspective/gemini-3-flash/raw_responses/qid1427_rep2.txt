<explanation>The most common error is the 'matching' misconception, where students see the number 7 and the plus sign in the expression (x + 7) and instinctively select '+7' as the operation. These students have not yet internalised the concept of 'inverse operations' or 'balancing' an equation. They focus on the components they see rather than the process required to isolate the variable. In Year 7, many students are still transitioning from arithmetic thinking to algebraic thinking, leading to a high error rate. By Year 11, while most have mastered one-step equations, a small percentage still make this 'reflex' error under time pressure or due to weak foundational understanding.</explanation>
