<explanation>The primary misconception is a rigid adherence to reading calculations from left to right, leading students to select A. In Problem P, many students correctly identify that addition and subtraction have equal priority and work left-to-right. However, in Problem Q, the "left-to-right" habit often overrides the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule for multiplication. Interestingly, a significant minority choose D because they see 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym (BIDMAS), incorrectly believing they must add 5+6 before subtracting in Problem P, but the pull of the left-to-right reading direction usually makes A the most frequent error.</explanation>
