<explanation>The most common error stems from a failure to follow the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students frequently multiply 3 by 0.3 first to get 0.9, and then square the result to get 0.81 (Answer A). This is a classic "left-to-right" processing error. Additionally, students often struggle with squaring decimals; many may correctly identify that they should square 0.3 first but calculate it as 0.9 rather than 0.09, leading them to 3 * 0.9 = 2.7 (Answer D). Lower ability students or younger cohorts often mistake the coefficient for an addition or simply multiply all numbers seen (3 * 0.3 * 2), though the BIDMAS error remains the dominant misconception across all levels.</explanation>
