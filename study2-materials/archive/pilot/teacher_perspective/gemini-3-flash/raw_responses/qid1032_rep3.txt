<explanation>The most common error is the "left-to-right" misconception (Option A), where students ignore the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and simply perform 5 + 4 = 9, then 9 × 3 = 27. Despite being taught the priority of multiplication over addition from Year 7, many students revert to reading the expression like a sentence, especially under time pressure or when they view the symbols as a simple sequence of instructions. Option C is a secondary error where students add first then multiply by both numbers, and Option D is usually a calculation slip.</explanation>
