<explanation>The most common error is choosing D (-7) because students often focus on the sign currently visible in the expression (the minus sign) rather than the inverse operation required to isolate the variable. This is a classic 'matching' misconception where students repeat the operation they see. Younger students or lower-attaining students often view the '7' and the '-' as separate entities and believe they are 'moving' the 7 by repeating the subtraction. Additionally, some students may choose B or C if they have a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between subtraction and its inverse, but D remains the dominant distractor across all year groups.</explanation>
