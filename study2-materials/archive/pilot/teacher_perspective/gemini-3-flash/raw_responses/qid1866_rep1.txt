<explanation>The most common error is a "left-to-right" processing bias, where students ignore the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Students calculate 8 - 7 = 1, then 1 + 10 = 11, and finally 11 * 3 = 33 (Answer D). Another common error is misinterpreting the addition/subtraction priority; some students believe addition must always come before subtraction because 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS, leading to 8 - (7 + 30) = -29 (Answer C), though this is less frequent than the simple linear calculation. Answer A (36) occurs if they add 7 and 10 first, then subtract from 8, then multiply, showing a total lack of hierarchy.</explanation>
