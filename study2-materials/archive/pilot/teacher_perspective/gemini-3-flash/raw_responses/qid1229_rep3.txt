<explanation>This is a classic "calculator logic" vs "human intuition" trap. Most students believe that squaring a negative number always results in a positive answer. They fail to realise that calculators follow BIDMAS/BODMAS strictly: the indices (power of 2) are applied to the 6 first, and the negation (multiplication by -1) happens second. Consequently, students overwhelmingly choose 36 (Option C), assuming the negative is "inside" the square. Even higher-ability Year 11s frequently fall for this when substituting values into quadratic formulas if they haven't been taught the 'brackets for negatives' rule on their Casio or TI handsets.</explanation>
