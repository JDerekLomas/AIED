<explanation>While the stated misconception focuses on priority order (which leads students to choice C), in my experience, the most common error in a multiple-choice format for this specific question is actually Option D. Students often struggle with the 'direction' of the vinculum, mistakenly placing the divisor on top, or they simply pick the most 'algebraic looking' fraction without checking the numerator/denominator placement. Option C is a very strong distractor for Year 7 and 8 students who fail to see the brackets as a grouping mechanism, leading them to divide first and then add 4. By Year 11, most errors are down to simple 'flipped fraction' mistakes (Option D) under time pressure.</explanation>
