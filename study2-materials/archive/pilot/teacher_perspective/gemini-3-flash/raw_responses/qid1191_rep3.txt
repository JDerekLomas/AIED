<explanation>The most common error in this specific multi-step equation is failing to use inverse operations correctly when moving terms across the equals sign. Students frequently add 5 to 20 to get 25t, or add 5 to 10 to get 15. Specifically, the distraction of answer D (t = 1/5) often arises because students perform the subtraction 20 - 5 = 15 and 10 - 5 = 5, then mistakenly divide the smaller number by the larger (5/25 or 5/15) due to a common misconception that you always divide the smaller number by the larger one, or they simply lose track of the signs when "collecting" like terms.</explanation>
