<explanation>The primary error is the failure to apply the 'negative multiplied by a negative equals a positive' rule. Students frequently default to D (-16) because they see the negative signs and assume the product must remain negative. Option A (-10) is a common secondary error where students add the numbers instead of multiplying, a classic 'operation mix-up' when expanding brackets. Year 7 and 8 students often struggle more because they are less fluent with the distributive law and directed number rules simultaneously. Even at Year 11, under exam pressure, the 'sign error' remains the most persistent mistake in algebraic manipulation.</explanation>
