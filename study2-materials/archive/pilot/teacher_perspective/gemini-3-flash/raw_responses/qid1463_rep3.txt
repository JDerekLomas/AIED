<explanation>The primary error here is the handling of the square of a negative number. When substituting b = -3 into b², students frequently type -3² into a non-scientific calculator or think "3 squared is 9, so -3 squared is -9". They fail to recognise that (-3) * (-3) = +9. Year 7 and 8 students score near 100% incorrect because the quadratic formula is not part of their curriculum, so they would be guessing blindly. By Year 11, while the formula is familiar, the "negative squared" trap remains one of the most persistent errors in GCSE Higher and Foundation tiers alike.</explanation>
