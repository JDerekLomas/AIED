<explanation>The most common error is choosing Option B, where students confuse the y-intercept with the x-intercepts (roots). Even if they correctly identify that a y-intercept occurs when x=0, many students reflexively look at the numbers inside the brackets and change the signs, which is the procedure for finding roots. Among those who do attempt to multiply -8 and -6, a significant number will select Option D due to the common misconception that 'a negative and a negative make a negative' (confusing addition rules with multiplication rules), or Option A by simply adding the constants (-8 - 6 = -14).</explanation>
