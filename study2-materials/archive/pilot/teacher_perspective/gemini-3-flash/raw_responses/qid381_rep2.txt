<explanation>The most common error is failing to correctly invert the fraction 1/2. Many students see the '2' and assume that because it is associated with the variables on the right, it should remain in the denominator when moved (Option C). They struggle with the concept that multiplying by 1/2 is equivalent to dividing by 2, and therefore requires multiplying by 2 to isolate the variable. Option A is also a common 'guess' for students who simply swap letters around without performing algebraic operations. By Year 11, while many have mastered one-step equations, multi-step rearrangements involving fractions still pose a significant challenge for Foundation tier students.</explanation>
