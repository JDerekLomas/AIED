<explanation>The primary error is the 'negative times a negative' rule. Many students successfully multiply the first term (-5 * m = -5m) but then see the minus sign in front of the 7 and simply 'bring it down' or mistakenly believe that a negative multiplied by a negative stays negative because the numbers are getting 'more negative'. Option B is the classic distractor for this misconception. A smaller cohort of students may also struggle with the sign of the first term (Option A) or forget to multiply the second term entirely, though the latter isn't explicitly provided as a distractor here.</explanation>
