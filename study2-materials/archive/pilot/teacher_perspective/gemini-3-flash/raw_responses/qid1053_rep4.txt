<explanation>The primary error is sign management within the brackets. Students often correctly identify the factor pair of 3 and 2, but struggle to assign the negative sign to the correct integer to ensure the sum is -1. Answer D is the most common error because students often associate the negative sign in the expression (-x) with the smaller number or simply miscalculate 3 - 2 instead of -3 + 2. Answer B is also a frequent distractor for those who believe that a negative middle term requires both signs in the brackets to be negative, forgetting that the constant term (-6) requires one of each sign.</explanation>
