<explanation>The most common error is performing the operations strictly from left to right (3 - 5 = -2, then -2 + 4 = 2, then 2 * 2 = 4), which leads to answer B. This happens because students often view the expression as a story to be read rather than applying BIDMAS/BODMAS rules. Additionally, even students who remember the acronym often struggle with the 'Addition' and 'Subtraction' priority, incorrectly believing addition must always come before subtraction (leading to 3 - 9 = -6, though not an option here) or simply ignoring the hierarchy when multiplication is placed at the end of the string. Option B is a classic "trap" for students who haven't internalised that multiplication must be prioritised regardless of its position.</explanation>
