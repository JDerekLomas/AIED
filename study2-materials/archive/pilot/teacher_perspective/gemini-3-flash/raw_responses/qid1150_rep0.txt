<explanation>The most common error (Option B) stems from students incorrectly applying the inverse operation for the division by 'r'. Instead of multiplying by 'r' to clear the fraction, they divide by 'r' again (or move it to the denominator of the other side). Students often struggle with the hierarchy of operations in rearranging; they may correctly identify that a square root is needed but apply it before correctly isolating the v^2 term. Option A is also a frequent error where students square the other side instead of square rooting, showing a fundamental misunderstanding of inverse operations.</explanation>
