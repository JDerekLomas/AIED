<explanation>The primary hurdle is the cognitive load of combining two difficult topics: fraction reciprocals and directed numbers. Most students correctly identify that they need the reciprocal (4/3) to reach a magnitude of 1, but they fall into the 'sign trap'. Option B is the most common distractor because students often associate a negative result (-1) with needing a negative sign in the calculation, forgetting that a negative multiplied by a negative yields a positive. Year 7 and 8 students struggle significantly with the concept of an algebraic 'missing value' in fractional form, often guessing C or D simply because the numbers look familiar.</explanation>
