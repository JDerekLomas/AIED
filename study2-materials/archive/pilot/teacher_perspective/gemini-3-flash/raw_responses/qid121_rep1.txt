<explanation>The most common error (Option A) stems from the "coefficient of x" misconception, where students identify the gradient simply as the number in front of x without rearranging to the form y=mx+c. Option C is the second most common error, where students correctly realize they must divide by 3 but fail to subtract 5x, or they incorrectly perform the inverse operation. Year 7 and 8 students struggle significantly as they often have not mastered linear graphs or the algebraic manipulation required to isolate y. Even at Year 11, under exam pressure, many students forget the negative sign during the transposition of the 5x term.</explanation>
