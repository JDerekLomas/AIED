<explanation>The most common error is option A (y=2). Students often see the numbers 3 and 5 and intuitively perform the operation 5 - 3 = 2, ignoring the negative sign attached to the y. They struggle with equations where the variable is being subtracted. Another common error is option C (y=8), where students see the minus sign and decide to 'do the opposite' by adding 3 and 5, failing to understand that the 3 is a positive term. The specific structure 'a - x = b' is a notorious 'threshold' concept that many students do not master until higher-level GCSE study.</explanation>
