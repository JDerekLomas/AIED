<explanation>The primary issue is the 'left-to-right' processing bias. Students often read algebraic expressions like a sentence, leading them to Option C (adding 3 to a first). This is exacerbated by a weak understanding of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically within an algebraic context, where the absence of a multiplication sign makes the priority of 'ab' less visually obvious than if it were written as 'a x b'. Option B is a common error for students who confuse 'ab' with 'a + b'.</explanation>
