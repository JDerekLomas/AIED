<explanation>The primary error for most students is managing the signs. While students might correctly identify the factors of 6 as 3 and 2, they often struggle to ensure the sum of these factors equals -1. Option D is a very common trap because students see the negative sign in the expression and associate it with the smaller number, or they simply fail to check the expansion of the middle term. Option B is also a frequent choice for students who believe that 'two negatives make a negative' when adding, or who incorrectly recall the rule that the signs in the brackets must match the signs in the quadratic.</explanation>
