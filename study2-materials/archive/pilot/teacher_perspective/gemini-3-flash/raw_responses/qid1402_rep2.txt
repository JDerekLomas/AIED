<explanation>The primary issue is 'left-to-right' processing. Many students read algebraic expressions like a sentence, leading them to Option C (3 + a, then multiply by b). This is compounded by a weak understanding of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically within an algebraic context, where the absence of a multiplication sign makes the priority of 'ab' less visible to the novice learner. Option B is a common error for students who confuse 'ab' with 'a+b'.</explanation>
