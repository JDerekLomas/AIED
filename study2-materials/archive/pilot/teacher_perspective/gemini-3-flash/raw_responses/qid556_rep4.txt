<explanation>The most common error is choosing D (-9) because students see the number 9 and instinctively want to 'take it away' to leave y on its own. They often confuse the additive inverse with the multiplicative inverse. Younger students in Year 7 and 8 frequently struggle to recognize that 9y represents a multiplicative relationship (9 multiplied by y), and therefore they fail to apply the division operation required to isolate the variable. Even in higher year groups, under exam pressure, students often default to 'moving the 9 and changing the sign' incorrectly.</explanation>
