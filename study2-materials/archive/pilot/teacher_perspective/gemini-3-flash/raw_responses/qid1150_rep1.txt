<explanation>The most common error is failing to correctly identify the inverse operation for division. Many students see the 'r' on the bottom and instinctively divide the other side by it rather than multiplying, leading to Option B. Additionally, younger students often struggle with the order of operations in reverse, sometimes attempting to square root before isolating the variable, or confusing the square root symbol with the division process itself. Option A is common among students who confuse squaring with square-rooting.</explanation>
