<explanation>This is one of the most persistent misconceptions in secondary mathematics. Most students believe that squaring a negative number always results in a positive answer because "a minus times a minus is a plus." They fail to understand how a scientific calculator processes the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). The calculator treats -6² as -(6²), applying the index before the negation. Students almost universally choose C (36) because they mentally group the negative sign with the 6, effectively calculating (-6)². Even high-achieving Year 11 students frequently fall into this trap unless they have been explicitly taught how the calculator logic differs from their mental grouping.</explanation>
