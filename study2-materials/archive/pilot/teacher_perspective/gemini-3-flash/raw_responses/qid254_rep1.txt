<explanation>The most pervasive misconception here is that the number zero 'doesn't count' when calculating the mean. Students frequently divide by 4 (Option C) because they only count the non-zero digits, failing to understand that zero is a data point that contributes to the count (n) even if it doesn't change the sum. Additionally, Option B is a common 'calculator error' trap; students who type the sequence into a basic calculator without using brackets or pressing equals before dividing will fall victim to BIDMAS/Order of Operations, where only the 7 is divided by 5. Option A is the correct representation, though many students find the omission of '0' in the numerator confusing, even though it is mathematically valid.</explanation>
