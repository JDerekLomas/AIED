<explanation>The most common error is choosing C because students identify the roots as -5 and 1 and correctly recall that the signs in the brackets are 'opposite' to the roots (x+5 and x-1). However, they often overlook the 'n' shape of the graph, which indicates a negative x² coefficient. Option C expands to a positive quadratic. Students who choose A must recognise that (1-x) is equivalent to -(x-1), providing the necessary reflection. Year 7 and 8 students score very high on incorrect answers as quadratics are generally not introduced until late Year 9 or Year 10 in the UK curriculum.</explanation>
