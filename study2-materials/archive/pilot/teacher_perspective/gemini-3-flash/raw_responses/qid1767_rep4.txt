<explanation>The most common error is choosing Option D (-7) due to a "matching" misconception. Students frequently see the -7 in the expression 'x - 7' and believe they must subtract 7 to "get rid" of it, rather than applying the inverse operation (+7) to isolate the variable. This is often exacerbated by a lack of understanding of the zero-pair principle (that -7 + 7 = 0). Younger students in Year 7 and 8 are particularly prone to this as they are just transitioning from informal 'flowchart' methods to formal algebraic manipulation. Even at GCSE (Years 10 and 11), under exam pressure, students often default to 'moving' the number without changing the sign.</explanation>
