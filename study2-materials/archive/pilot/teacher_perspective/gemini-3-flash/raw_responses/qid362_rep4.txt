<explanation>The primary misconception is the "coefficient of x" rule. Students often memorize that the gradient is the number in front of x without first rearranging the equation into the form y = mx + c. Year 7 and 8 students will almost universally guess 4 (Option B) or -4 (Option A) because they haven't mastered multi-step algebraic manipulation. Higher-tier students often fail to perform the inverse operation correctly; they may subtract 4x but then fail to divide by 3, or they divide by 3 but forget to change the sign of the 4x term when moving it to the other side of the equals sign. Option D is a very common distractor for students who understand the division by 3 but fail the sign change (the inverse operation error mentioned in the prompt).</explanation>
