<explanation>The primary error is a failure to follow the correct order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Many students read the expression $3x^2$ from left to right, leading them to calculate $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$ (Option A). This is a very common misconception where students assume the coefficient is part of the base being squared. 

Another significant group of students will choose Option D (2.7) because they correctly square the 0.3 to get 0.09 but then make a place value error when multiplying by 3, or they simply calculate $3 \times 0.3 \times 3$. Option C (1.8) is often chosen by students who confuse squaring with multiplying by 2 ($3 \times 0.3 \times 2$). Dealing with decimals less than 1 significantly increases the cognitive load and error rate across all year groups.</explanation>
