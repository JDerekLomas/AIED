<explanation>The most common error (leading to C) is failing to use inverse operations. Students see the 'divide by 2' and 'minus 3' and instinctively perform those operations on the 1/8 (calculating 1/8 ÷ 2 = 1/16, then 1/16 + 3 = 3 1/16). Another significant group will pick A by cross-multiplying incorrectly or performing 8 ÷ 2 then adding 3. Option B is often chosen by students who try to 'guess and check' with whole numbers or incorrectly subtract 1/8 from 2. The fraction on the right-hand side significantly increases the cognitive load, causing students to abandon formal algebraic steps in favour of intuitive, often incorrect, arithmetic.</explanation>
