<explanation>The most common error is choosing Option A (+7). Students often exhibit 'operation matching' where they see the symbol in the expression (+7) and instinctively repeat it rather than applying the inverse operation. In Year 7, many students are still transitioning from 'fill-in-the-blank' arithmetic to formal algebraic manipulation; they often focus on the number 7 itself rather than the balance of the equation. As they progress through Key Stage 3, the concept of 'undoing' an operation becomes more ingrained, but even at GCSE level, under exam pressure, a significant minority of students will still make this sign-reversal error or confuse the process with 'moving' the number to the other side without changing its sign.</explanation>
