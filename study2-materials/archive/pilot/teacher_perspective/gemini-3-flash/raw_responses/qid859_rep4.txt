<explanation>The most common error is the failure to use inverse operations correctly when 'moving' terms across the equals sign. For option A, students often subtract 6d from 12d to get 6d, but then mistakenly add 3 to -3 (getting 0) or simply see the two 3s on either side and assume they cancel out to zero. Another common error is option D, where students correctly get 6d = 6 but then perform 6 ÷ 18 or 2 ÷ 6 due to a 'smaller number divided by larger number' instinct, or they subtract the 6s instead of dividing. Option A remains the dominant distractor because students often struggle with the directed number aspect of -3 and +3 combined with the balancing method.</explanation>
