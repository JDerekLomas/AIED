<explanation>The most common error (Option D) stems from students using the same operation rather than the inverse. They add 9 to 39 to get 48, then divide by 3 to get 16, and finally square root to get 4. This is a classic 'procedural fluency' error where students recognise they need to move numbers across the equals sign but forget to flip the operation. Additionally, many students in lower year groups (Y7-8) will struggle with the order of operations in reverse (SAMDOB/REVERSE BIDMAS) or simply haven't been introduced to solving equations with squared terms yet, leading to high failure rates early on. Option A is another common pitfall where students subtract 9 correctly (30) but then subtract the 3 instead of dividing (27), then rounding or guessing.</explanation>
