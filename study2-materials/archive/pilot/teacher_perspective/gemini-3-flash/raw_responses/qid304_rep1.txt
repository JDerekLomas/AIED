<explanation>The most common error is the 'Left-to-Right' bias. Despite being taught BIDMAS/BODMAS, many students instinctively treat a horizontal number sentence like a sentence of text, performing operations as they encounter them. Option A (1+2) is the most common distractor because it is the first operation on the left. Even students who remember the acronym often fail to apply it when the addition looks 'easier' than the directed number calculation inside the brackets. Option B is also a common error for those who vaguely remember that multiplication is 'important' but forget that brackets take absolute precedence.</explanation>
