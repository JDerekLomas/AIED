<explanation>The most common error (Option D) stems from students using the same operation rather than the inverse. Instead of subtracting 9, they add 9 to get 48, then divide by 3 to get 16, and finally square root to get 4. This is a classic procedural error where students see '+9' and instinctively add it to the other side. Year 7 and 8 students struggle significantly as they are often unfamiliar with solving equations involving squares and may also choose Option A by incorrectly dividing before subtracting (39/3 = 13, 13+12 = 25, sqrt = 5). Higher ability students occasionally miss the negative root, but since all options provide both roots, the primary distractor is the order and nature of operations.</explanation>
