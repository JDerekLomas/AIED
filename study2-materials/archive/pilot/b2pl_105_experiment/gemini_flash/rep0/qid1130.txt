To solve this problem, a student must set up the equation $4x + (2x - 12) + (4x + 42) = 180$.
Simplifying this leads to $10x + 30 = 180$, which results in $10x = 150$, so $x = 15$.

**Analysis of the Question:**
*   **Difficulty:** This is a mid-tier geometry problem. The algebra involves collecting like terms with both positive and negative constants, which is a common friction point.
*   **The "Trap":** Option B ($12.6^\circ$) comes from forgetting that the angles sum to 180 and instead using 126 (perhaps a calculation error or partial sum). Option C ($33^\circ$) is a common error where students subtract 30 from 360 instead of 180. Option D ($21^\circ$) occurs if a student adds all constants instead of subtracting 12 ($10x + 54 = 180 \Rightarrow 10x = 126 \Rightarrow x = 12.6$, or other sign errors like $10x - 30 = 180 \Rightarrow 10x = 210 \Rightarrow x = 21$).
*   **Student Behavior:** Below-basic students often struggle to form the initial equation or confuse "sum of angles in a triangle" with 90 or 360. Proficient students usually handle the $+42 - 12$ well, but the $10x$ can occasionally lead to arithmetic slips.
