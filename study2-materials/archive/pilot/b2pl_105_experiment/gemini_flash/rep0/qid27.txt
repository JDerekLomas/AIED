This question is a classic "sign error" trap that focuses on the multiplication of two negative numbers within a substitution context. 

The primary hurdle is the term $-2d$. When $d = -2$, students must navigate the calculation $10 - 2(-2)$. The most common error for lower-ability students is failing to recognize the "double negative," leading them to calculate $10 - 4 = 6$ (Option B). Some students will perform $10 + 2 = 12$ and then apply the negative sign to the result to get -12 (Option A), or simply follow the string of numbers $10 - 2 - 2$ incorrectly. Option D is a rarer error where students treat $2d$ as $2$ followed by the digit $-2$ (concatenation), though this is less common at secondary level.

**Ability Level Breakdown:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students struggle with the order of operations and negative numbers. Many will subtract before multiplying or simply combine the digits. Option B is very attractive here as $10 - 4$.
*   **Basic:** These students know to substitute, but often calculate $2 \times -2 = -4$ and then see the expression as $10 - 4$ rather than $10 - (-4)$.
*   **Proficient:** Most students at this level recognize the double negative but a significant minority will still make a "slippery" sign error under pressure.
*   **Advanced:** These students have internalized that a negative times a negative is a positive and will handle the substitution of $-2$ into $-2d$ fluently.
