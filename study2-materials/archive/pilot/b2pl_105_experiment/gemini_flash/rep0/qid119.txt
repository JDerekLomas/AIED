As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common student pitfalls regarding directed numbers and visual representations of arithmetic.

**Analysis of the Question:**
*   **The Trap:** This question is designed to catch students who have a surface-level memory of "rules" for negative numbers (e.g., "a negative times a negative is a positive") but fail to apply them to a specific context. 
*   **Tom's error:** He identifies the movement left (negative) and the scale factor (3), but his calculation results in a negative product: $-3 \times -8 = -24$. Mathematically, a negative times a negative must be positive 24. Therefore, Tom's calculation is technically incorrect.
*   **Katie's error:** Similarly, her division $-24 \div -3$ should result in positive 8, but she writes $-8$.
*   **Student Behavior:** "Below Basic" and "Basic" students often look only at the numbers in the diagram (24, 3, 8) and the direction (left/negative). They see that $3 \times 8 = 24$ and everything is pointing left, so they assume any calculation using those numbers and minus signs is "correct" for the diagram, leading them to choose **C**. 
*   **Advanced students** will spot that while the diagram implies certain relationships, both written equations are mathematically false statements (violating the sign rules), leading them to **D**.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=55% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=65% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=45% D=45%
advanced: A=2% B=2% C=11% D=85%
