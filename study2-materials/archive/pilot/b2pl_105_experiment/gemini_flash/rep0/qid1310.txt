As an experienced UK maths teacher, here is my evaluation of this question.

**Analysis:**
This question tests the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). The presence of nested brackets is the primary hurdle.
- **Option B (Correct):** Students must recognise that the innermost parentheses take priority.
- **Option A:** This is a "Left to Right" error. Students who know brackets come first but ignore the hierarchy *within* the nested brackets often start at the beginning of the inner expression.
- **Option C:** This is a visual "proximity" error. Students sometimes see the $0.4$ and $0.3$ next to each other and assume subtraction follows addition, or they ignore the bracket structure entirely.
- **Option D:** This is for students who think multiplication always comes first or simply look at the end of the calculation.

What makes this question relatively straightforward for higher-ability students is that the innermost bracket $(0.2 + 0.4)$ is very clearly defined. However, the presence of decimals often lowers the confidence of lower-ability students, leading them to guess or default to a simple left-to-right approach.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=35% B=30% C=20% D=15%
basic: A=25% B=55% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=85% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=97% C=1% D=0%
