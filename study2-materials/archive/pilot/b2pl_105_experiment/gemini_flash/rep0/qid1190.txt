This question is a classic test of how students handle negative integers when solving a one-step linear equation. While the operation is simple (subtracting 10 from both sides), the presence of the negative on the left-hand side creates a significant cognitive load for lower-ability students.

The most common error is predicted to be **A ($p=5$)**. Students see the numbers 10 and 5 and intuitively subtract the smaller from the larger, or they incorrectly "combine" the terms as $10 - 5$. **Option D ($p=15$)** attracts students who know they need to perform an operation but apply it incorrectly to the magnitudes (calculating $10+5$) or have a sign error during the inverse operation.

**Advanced** students will see the "$-5 - 10$" immediately. **Proficient** students might pause but usually arrive at $-15$ unless they make a "silly" arithmetic slip. **Basic** and **Below Basic** students often struggle with the number line, often moving in the wrong direction from $-5$.

basic: A=25% B=5% C=55% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=2% C=80% D=8%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=95% D=2%
