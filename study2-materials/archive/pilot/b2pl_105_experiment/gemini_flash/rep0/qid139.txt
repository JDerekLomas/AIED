In this question, students are being asked for the specific step of multiplying the constants in a binomial expansion: $(-4) \times (-3)$. 

The primary pitfalls here are the confusion between **multiplication and addition** (leading to 7) and the **rules for signed numbers** (leading to -12). For "below basic" students, the presence of two negative signs often triggers an "adding negatives" response. "Basic" level students often know they must multiply (getting 12) but frequently forget that a negative times a negative equals a positive. "Proficient" students usually have the negative rules down but can occasionally lapse into addition if they are rushing. "Advanced" students will find this trivial.

Comparison with other expansion questions: Because the question explicitly points to the terms, students don't have to worry about the $10p^2$ or the middle terms, making it much simpler than a full expansion but more focused on specific integer arithmetic.

below_basic: A=15% B=30% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=35% C=50% D=10%
proficient: A=2% B=8% C=88% D=2%
advanced: A=0% B=1% C=99% D=0%
