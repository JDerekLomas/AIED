This question addresses a classic stumbling block in early algebra: solving equations where the variable is subtracted (negative coefficient). While the setup suggests a complex "simultaneous equations" context, the actual task is a simple one-step linear equation. 

The most common error is **Option A ($y=2$)**, driven by "operation reversal" or "sign blindness," where students see the 3 and 5 and instinctively subtract 3 from 5 without accounting for the negative sign attached to the $y$. **Option C ($y=8$)** occurs when students treat the subtraction as an addition ($3+y=5$ then becomes $3+5$).

**Difficulty Analysis:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will see "3" and "5" and pick 2 because $5-3=2$, completely ignoring the structure of the equation.
*   **Basic:** Students often attempt to "move" the 3 to the other side but fail to manage the remaining $-y$, leading them to $y=2$.
*   **Proficient:** Most should handle the negative $y$ correctly, though "silly mistakes" under pressure often lead back to Option A.
*   **Advanced:** This is a trivial one-step problem for this cohort; errors will be negligible.
