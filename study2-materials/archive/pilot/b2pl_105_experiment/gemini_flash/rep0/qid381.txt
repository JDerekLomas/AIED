As an experienced teacher, I’ve found that changing the subject of a formula involving fractions is a significant hurdle. 

The biggest "trap" in this specific question is the movement of the $1/2$. Students with lower confidence often don't know whether to multiply by 2 or divide by 2. This leads many to Option C, as they simply "move" the 2 to the other side underneath the division line without performing the inverse operation. Option A is a common "symbol shuffling" error where students believe they can just swap the subject letter with any letter from the right-hand side.

Here is the predicted performance breakdown:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=35% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=40% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=3% D=1%
