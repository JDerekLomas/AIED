This question tests the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). 

The correct process is: 
1. Brackets: $(2 + 2) = 4$
2. Division: $12 \div 4 = 3$
3. Addition: $4 + 3 = 7$ (Option B)

**Common Errors:**
*   **Left-to-Right (Ignore BIDMAS):** $4+12=16$, then $16 \div 4 = 4$ (Option D).
*   **Addition before Division (The most common error):** Students do brackets correctly $(4)$, then add the leading $4$ to the $12$ to get $16$, then divide by $4$.
*   **Inside Brackets then first Addition:** $(2+2)=4$, then $4+12 = 16$, then $16 \div 4 = 4$.
*   **Miscalculating the division/brackets:** Choosing 10 or 12 through various combinations of adding everything or multiplying parts.

This specific question is a classic "trap" because the numbers $4+12 \div 4$ are very tempting to calculate as $(4+12) \div 4$. Many lower-ability students will follow a linear left-to-right path or instinctively perform the addition they see first.
