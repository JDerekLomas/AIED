This question is a classic test of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). The primary tension is between squaring the 3 first ($2 \times 9 = 18$) and multiplying before squaring ($(2 \times 3)^2 = 36$). There is also the common misconception where students multiply the base by the exponent ($3^2 \approx 6$) leading to $2 \times 6 = 12$.

For this specific question, the numbers are small and "friendly," which often encourages students to work left-to-right instinctively. While "Proficient" students generally remember the rule for indices, "Basic" level students frequently default to linear processing or the multiplication misconception.
