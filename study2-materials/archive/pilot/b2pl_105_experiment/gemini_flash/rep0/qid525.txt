This question tests the addition of mixed numbers with different denominators. 

The primary "trap" for lower-ability students is **Option D**, which represents the most common misconception in fraction addition: adding the numerators and adding the denominators ($7+1=8$ and $10+4=14$). 

**Option A** is the correct numerical value but in the "wrong" format (improper fraction instead of the requested mixed number). This often catches out **proficient** students who perform the calculation by converting to improper fractions first and forget to convert back, or simply fail to read the specific instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number."

**Option C** is a calculation error involving an incorrect common denominator (often $10 \times 4 = 40$ but with errors in numerator conversion).

**Option B** is the correct answer ($4 \frac{14+5}{20}$).

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=10% B=25% C=15% D=50%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=25% B=65% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=5% B=93% C=1% D=1%
