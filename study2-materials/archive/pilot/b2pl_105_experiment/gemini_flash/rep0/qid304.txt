This question specifically tests the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). While students are taught that Brackets come first, this specific question is designed to catch those who default to "left-to-right" processing or those who misidentify the terms involved in the multiplication.

The presence of the bracket $(3-4)$ is a very strong visual cue. Even for "Basic" level students, the mnemonic "Brackets first" is one of the most well-remembered rules in school mathematics. However, the "Below Basic" group often ignores the brackets entirely and simply reads left-to-right, making Option A a very popular distractor. Option B attracts students who know multiplication is important but forget that brackets take priority over the operation outside them.

Because the question asks *what* to do first rather than to find the final result (which involves negative numbers), it is significantly easier than a calculation question, leading to high success rates at the Proficient and Advanced levels.

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=30% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=65% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=3% C=90% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%
