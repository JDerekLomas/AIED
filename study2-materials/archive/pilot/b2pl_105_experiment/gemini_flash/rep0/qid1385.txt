As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question by looking at the specific numbers provided. While adding four fractions usually triggers a "lowest common multiple" approach (leading to $\frac{24}{12}$), the commutative property here is the "shortcut" trap. 

Lower-ability students often default to "add the tops, add the bottoms" (leading to Option B). Middle-ability students often find a common denominator of 12 but often make a computational error when summing the four numerators or failing to simplify at the end. Higher-ability students will spot that $\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = 1$ and $\frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = 1$, making $1+1=2$ almost instantaneous.

The numbers here are "friendly," which actually pushes more students toward the correct answer than if the numerators were all 1.
