This is a classic Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) question. 

The correct calculation is $(12 \div 2) + (1 \times 2) = 6 + 2 = 8$.

**Key Misconceptions:**
1. **Left-to-Right Processing (The most common error):** Many students simply work from left to right: $12 \div 2 = 6$, then $6 + 1 = 7$, then $7 \times 2 = 14$ (Option C).
2. **Incorrect Order of BIDMAS/Addition before Multiplication:** Some students follow the "A before M" in the acronym literally, or perform the middle operation first because it "looks" central: $12 \div (2 + 1) \times 2 = 12 \div 3 \times 2 = 8$. (This happens to lead to the correct answer by fluke in some structures, but here it often leads to $12 \div 6 = 2$ if they group the end).
3. **Subtraction/Division errors:** Some students might get 3 if they misinterpret the 12 divided by 6 logic.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **D (8)** is the correct answer.
*   **C (14)** is the strongest distractor, representing the common "Left-to-Right" linear calculation error.
*   **A (9)** represents students who might calculate $6 + 1 \times 2$ but add the 1 to the 6 first ($7 \times 2 = 14$) or do $12 \div 2 = 6$ and then $6+3$ through a variety of minor arithmetic slips.
*   **B (3)** is a "guess" or a result of deep confusion with the terms (e.g., $12 \div (2+1+1)$).

In a UK classroom setting, "basic" students almost reflexively work left-to-right on these problems.
