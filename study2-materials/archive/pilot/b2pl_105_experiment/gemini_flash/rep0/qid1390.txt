This question is a classic test of **order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)** combined with fraction arithmetic.

The common pitfall here is performing the addition before the multiplication ($ \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{6}$, then $\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{18}$). Option B is the primary "distractor" for students who work from left to right. Option C targets those who struggle with fraction addition (adding numerators and denominators) even after prioritizing correctly, while Option A is the correct result ($\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$).

**Below Basic:** These students often ignore order of operations entirely and struggle with common denominators. They are likely to add straight across for the first part $(\frac{2}{5})$ and then multiply $(\frac{2}{15})$, but since that isn't an option, they often gravitate toward B (left-to-right calculation) or D.
**Basic:** These students often remember "multiply before add," but frequently make errors in finding common denominators. However, the pull of the left-to-right calculation (Option B) is extremely strong at this level.
**Proficient:** These students generally know BIDMAS but can still be lured into "Calculation B" if they are rushing. Most will successfully find the common denominator of 6.
**Advanced:** These students will identify the trap immediately and perform the multiplication first.

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=35% B=40% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=20% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
