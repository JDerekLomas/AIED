To solve $\frac{x-6}{2}=10$:
- **Tom's logic:** To get $\frac{x}{2}=16$, he has added 6 to both sides. However, he only added it to the numerator's term and the RHS. Because the 6 is part of a fraction with a denominator of 2, adding 6 to the numerator is not the same as adding 6 to the whole expression. To isolate $\frac{x}{2}$, one would have to add $\frac{6}{2}$ (or 3) to both sides. **Tom is incorrect.**
- **Katie's logic:** To get $x-6=5$, she has attempted to multiply by 2 to clear the fraction but has incorrectly divided the RHS by 2 instead. **Katie is incorrect.**

**Teaching Analysis:**
This is a high-distraction question. At lower ability levels, students often "pick a person" because they assume at least one must be right. Tom’s error is a very common "partial operation" misconception where students ignore the vinculum (fraction bar) acting as a grouping symbol. Katie’s error is a simple computational mistake (dividing by 2 instead of multiplying), which catches students who know the "step" but perform the inverse incorrectly. 

The "Neither" option (D) is statistically the hardest for students to pick in "Who is correct?" questions, as they feel compelled to validate one of the methods.
