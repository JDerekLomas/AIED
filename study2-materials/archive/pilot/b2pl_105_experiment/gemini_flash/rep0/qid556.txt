In this question, students are being tested on their understanding of inverse operations within the context of linear equations. Specifically, it tests whether they recognise that $9y$ implies "9 multiplied by $y$" and that the inverse operation required to isolate $y$ is division by 9.

This question is relatively straightforward for students who understand basic algebraic notation, but it contains a very common trap for those at the "below basic" and "basic" levels. Students who see $9y$ and then just $y$ often perceive the 9 as being "removed." Without a solid grasp of coefficient notation, they frequently default to subtraction (Option D) because they see 9 being "taken away" from the left-hand side. Option A is a rarer mistake, usually resulting from a complete confusion of inverse operations. Option B is chosen by students who correctly identify that the relationship is multiplication but fail to provide the *inverse* operation needed to solve the equation.

As the ability level increases, the jump from $9y$ to $y$ is a very standard "reflex" move, leading to high scores among proficient and advanced students.

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=35% D=40%
basic: A=5% B=15% C=60% D=20%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=88% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=97% D=1%
