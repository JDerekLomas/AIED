To predict student performance on this question, we must look at how students handle fractions, decimals, and negative numbers in the context of BIDMAS (Order of Operations) and squaring.

The question tests the ability to identify a case where $2n^2 - 1 \leq 0$.
A) $2(9/16) - 1 = 18/16 - 1 = 0.125$ (Positive, not a counter-example)
B) $2(0.25) - 1 = 0.5 - 1 = -0.5$ (**Correct**, Negative)
C) $2(4) - 1 = 7$ (Positive, common error for students who think squaring a negative makes a negative)
D) $2(1) - 1 = 1$ (Positive)

The biggest challenge here is that many students struggle to mentally calculate $0.5^2$. They often think $0.5^2 = 1$, or they expect the negative numbers (C and D) to be the "trick" answers because they have a misconception that squaring a negative stays negative. Many "below basic" students will guess C or D because negative inputs look like more likely candidates for producing negative outputs.

"Proficient" students will successfully navigate the BIDMAS but might struggle with the fraction in A or the decimal in B. "Advanced" students will quickly identify that $|n|$ must be less than $\sqrt{0.5}$ (approx $0.707$) for the expression to be negative.

below_basic: A=15% B=25% C=35% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=40% C=25% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=70% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=5% B=92% C=2% D=1%
