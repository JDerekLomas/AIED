This question tests the addition of fractions with unequal denominators, specifically where one denominator is a multiple of the other.

The primary distractor here is **Option B ($\frac{3}{12}$)**, which represents the "add the numerators, add the denominators" misconception ($2+1=3$ and $9+3=12$). This is a classic error for students who lack a conceptual understanding of fraction operations.

**Option C ($\frac{3}{9}$)** is a common "mid-way" error where a student remembers they need a common denominator (choosing 9) but forgets to adjust the numerator of the second fraction ($2+1$ over $9$).

**Option D ($\frac{1}{6}$)** is less likely but usually represents a student attempting to subtract or failing to find a common denominator correctly, perhaps confusing the operation with multiplication then simplifying incorrectly.

Because $3$ goes into $9$ so neatly, proficient students will find this very straightforward. However, the simplicity of the numbers often encourages basic students to "default" to the simplest (but incorrect) rule of adding straight across.
