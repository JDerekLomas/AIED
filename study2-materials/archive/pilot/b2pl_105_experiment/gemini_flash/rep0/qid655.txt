This question is significantly more challenging than a standard directed numbers problem because it results in a non-integer fraction. This triggers several friction points for students:

1.  **The "Big Divided by Small" Trap:** Many students have a deep-seated belief that you must divide the larger number by the smaller number ($8 \div 6$).
2.  **Inverse Operations:** Students know they need to divide to find the missing factor, but frequently rearrange the equation incorrectly as $x = -6 / -8$ (leading to $6/8$).
3.  **Sign Rules:** While most students know "negative times positive is negative," the cognitive load of dealing with fractions often causes them to lose track of the signs.
4.  **Non-Simplification:** Since the options aren't simplified (e.g., $4/3$ or $1.33$), students are forced to look for the raw ratio, which helps some but confuses those looking for a "clean" answer.

In this specific case, **D** is the correct answer. The most common error is **A**, driven by the "top-heavy" phobia or incorrect division order, followed by **C**, where students correctly identify the ratio but fail to account for the fact that a negative multiplied by a *positive* is required to keep the product negative.
