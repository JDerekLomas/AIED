This question is a classic "traps and technicalities" problem. It tests two distinct things: the treatment of zero in a data set and the correct use of mathematical notation (order of operations).

**Option A** is the mathematically correct method ($15 \div 5 = 3$). Even though the $0$ is omitted from the numerator, adding it wouldn't change the sum, but it must be counted in the denominator.
**Option B** is a BODMAS trap. Without brackets, this calculation would be $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + (7 \div 5)$, which equals $9.4$. Students who use scientific calculators poorly often make this mistake.
**Option C** represents the common "ignore the zero entirely" misconception, where students divide by the count of non-zero digits.
**Option D** is a distractor for students who believe that because the "$+0$" isn't explicitly written in A, it's technically incorrect (even though the value is identical).

**Performance Analysis:**
- **Below Basic:** These students often ignore zero completely (Option C) or struggle with the concept of the mean altogether.
- **Basic:** This group often identifies that they need to divide by 5, but many will fall for the BODMAS trap of Option B if they are used to typing strings into a calculator, or they might think the missing "0" in Option A makes it "incomplete," leading them to D.
- **Proficient:** Most will recognise that A is correct. Some may overthink the formal notation and choose D because the zero isn't visible in the sum.
- **Advanced:** These students will instantly recognise A as the only expression that evaluates to the correct mean, identifying that $x + 0 = x$.

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=75% B=10% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=2% C=1% D=2%
