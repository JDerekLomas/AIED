This question tests the ability to solve a basic two-step linear equation. While it appears straightforward, the primary pitfall is the direction of the final division ($5 \div 20$ versus $20 \div 5$). In my experience, students who struggle with mental arithmetic or who work too quickly often default to "large number divided by small number."

The presence of negative options (C and D) serves to catch those who make sign errors when rearranging ($20t = -5$ instead of $20t = 5$), but for a simple "equals zero" equation, the division error (Option B) is usually the most common distractor for lower-ability students.

**below_basic:** A=30% B=45% C=15% D=10%
**basic:** A=55% B=30% C=10% D=5%
**proficient:** A=85% B=10% C=3% D=2%
**advanced:** A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
