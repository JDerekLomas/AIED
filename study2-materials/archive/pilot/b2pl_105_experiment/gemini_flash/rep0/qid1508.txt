This order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) question is a classic "trap" because it contains an addition before the division AND an addition after the division. 

Students with **below basic** ability often work strictly left-to-right: $3 + 6 = 9$, $9 \div 2 = 4.5$, $4.5 + 1 = 5.5$. This makes **C** a very popular distractor for this group. 

Students with **basic** ability often remember they should divide first ($6 \div 2 = 3$), but they frequently make a "lapse" in the final step. Some might add the 3 and 1 first to get 4, then do $6 \div 4$, but most will correctly get $3 + 3 + 1$. However, a significant portion of this group mistakenly adds the first two numbers ($3+6$) and the last two ($2+1$) before trying to divide, leading to $9 \div 3 = 3$ (**B**).

Students at the **proficient** level usually know the rule $6 \div 2 = 3$ and then $3 + 3 + 1 = 7$. The main error here is the "left-to-right" instinct or miscalculating the simple addition at the end.

**Advanced** students almost always navigate this correctly, as the numbers are small and the structure is standard.

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=25% C=20% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
