To predict how UK students (typically GCSE level) would perform on this inequality, we have to look at the multi-step nature of the "three-sided" inequality.

**Analysis:**
1.  **Step 1: Subtracting 1.** This is the first hurdle. Many students subtract 1 from the 5 but add it to the -5, or vice versa. Correct: $-6 < 2x < 4$.
2.  **Step 2: Dividing by 2.** This is usually the easiest step. Correct: $-3 < x < 2$.
3.  **The "Trap" (Option C):** Many students incorrectly perform the first step as $-4 < 2x < 4$ by mistakenly adding 1 to -5. This leads to $-2 < x < 2$. This is a very common "low-level" mistake.
4.  **Option A:** Reflects a student who multiplies by 2 and then adds 1 (reversing the operations but applying them incorrectly).
5.  **Option D:** Often selected by students who subtract 1 from -5 to get -6, but then accidentally divide by 2 wrongly or confuse the sign on the other side.

The most likely distractor for a proficient student who makes a hasty error is Option C.
