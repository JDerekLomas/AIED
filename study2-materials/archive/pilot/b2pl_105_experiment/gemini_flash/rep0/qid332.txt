This question is a classic test of "order of operations" in reverse when solving linear equations. 

**Tom's method** follows the standard "isolate the term" approach: adding 5 to both sides ($12 + 5 = 17$). Most students find this intuitive as it deals with the constant first.

**Katie's method** is a common trap. Students often think they can multiply by the denominator (3) at any time. However, to correctly multiply by 3, they must multiply *every* term. Katie has multiplied $\frac{x}{3}$ and $12$, but failed to multiply the $-5$. Her line should have been $x - 15 = 36$.

**Analysis of student performance:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will see "36" and think "3 times 12 is 36, that looks right," leading them to choose **C** or **B**. They struggle to identify the specific error in distributive property.
*   **Basic:** These students usually know how to solve the equation themselves using Tom's method. However, they are susceptible to "verification bias"—seeing Katie's "36" and assuming she did something correct that they simply didn't think of.
*   **Proficient:** These students recognize that Katie didn't multiply the 5. They are confident in Tom but can spot the specific algebraic error in Katie's logic.
*   **Advanced:** Almost all will correctly identify that only Tom followed the rules of equality.
