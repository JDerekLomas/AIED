This question tests three specific algebraic conventions: writing division as a fraction, removing the multiplication sign in $ab$, and the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS).

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **The Trap (Option A):** This is the most common error for students with a weak understanding of algebraic structure. They see $2 \div 3$ and write $\frac{2}{3}$, failing to realise that the parentheses force the entire $(3 + ab)$ to be the denominator.
*   **The Notation (Option D):** While mathematically equivalent to C, the prompt asks for the "correct algebraic convention." Students often know they should "get rid of the $\times$ sign," which leads them toward C.
*   **The Complexity (Option B):** This acts as a distractor for students who over-complicate factorization or assume that brackets in the question must imply a certain structure in the result.
*   **Proficient/Advanced:** These students easily recognise that the division bar acts as a grouping symbol for everything in the brackets. Option C is the standard way to write this.
