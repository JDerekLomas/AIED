This question tests two distinct concepts: index notation (powers) and the rules for multiplying negative numbers. 

The most significant distractor here is **C (-81)**. Students often use calculators incorrectly by typing $-3^4$ without brackets, or they intuitively believe that "a negative number raised to a power stays negative." The distractors **B** and **D** target the common "multiplication instead of exponentiation" error ($3 \times 4$).

At the **Below Basic** level, many students treat $k^4$ as $k \times 4$. At the **Basic** level, the calculation $3^4 = 81$ is usually mastered, but the sign rule for even powers remains a high-frequency "coin flip" error. Even **Proficient** students frequently succumb to the "negative base, negative result" trap when under exam pressure. Only **Advanced** students consistently recall that an even index results in a positive value.
