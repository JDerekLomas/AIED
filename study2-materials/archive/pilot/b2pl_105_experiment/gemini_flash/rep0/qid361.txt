This question tests a student's ability to translate a multi-step word problem into algebraic notation, specifically focusing on the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS) and the use of brackets.

**Jo's expression** is mathematically correct. She has correctly nested the subtraction ($n-5$), used the fraction bar for the division, added 4, and used large brackets to ensure the entire previous result is multiplied by 7.

**Paul's expression** is incorrect because of the final step. By writing $7((n-5) \div 8) + 4$, he has only multiplied the result of the division by 7, leaving the $+4$ outside the influence of the multiplication. According to the worded instructions, the multiplication by 7 happens "finally," meaning it must apply to the result of the addition.

**Common Pitfalls:**
*   **Below Basic/Basic:** Students often read expressions left-to-right without considering operator precedence. They might think Paul is correct because his expression "follows the story" linearly.
*   **Proficient:** Many students recognize Jo's use of the fraction bar as "proper maths" but may be fooled into thinking Paul’s version is a valid alternative notation, failing to notice that his $+4$ is outside the outer brackets.
*   **Advanced:** These students will carefully check the distribution of the 7 and realize Paul’s expression lacks the necessary brackets for the final step.
