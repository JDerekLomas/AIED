This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem. While mathematically straightforward, it is a high-error problem for students below the "Advanced" level.

The most common error in the UK curriculum for this specific structure is the **"division by habit"** error. Students see the numbers 10 and 5 and instinctively calculate $10 \div 5 = 2$ without considering the algebraic structure ($p = 5 \div 10$). Option C is the most attractive distractor for students who recognize they need to divide but do so in the "easiest" order. Option B ($p=50$) attracts those who have a weak grasp of inverse operations and multiply the two visible numbers.

The specific numbers ($10$ and $5$) make this harder than if the equation were $2 = 6/p$, because $10/5$ is a "cleaner" integer result than $5/10$, leading more students toward the trap of $p=2$.
