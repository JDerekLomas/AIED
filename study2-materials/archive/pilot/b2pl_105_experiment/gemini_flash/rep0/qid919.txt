This question tests three distinct skills: substitution, the order of operations (BIDMAS), and calculations with decimals. 

The primary "trap" is the order of operations. Many students will multiply $3$ by $0.3$ first to get $0.9$, and then square $0.9$ to get $0.81$ (Option A). Another significant cohort will perform the calculation in the correct order ($0.3^2 = 0.09$) but then struggle with decimal place value when multiplying $0.09 \times 3$, often arriving at $0.27$ (Option B) if they are careful, or $2.7$ (Option D) if they lose track of the decimal point. Option C represents a common error where $0.3^2$ is calculated as $0.3 \times 2 = 0.6$, and then $0.6 \times 3 = 1.8$.

While this looks like a simple substitution, the combination of a coefficient, a power, and a decimal under $1.0$ makes it very difficult for mid-to-low ability students.
