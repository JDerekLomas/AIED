To predict how students will respond to this question, we must look at the specific numbers used. The presence of the denominator 2 and the final term 1/8 creates a very high likelihood of students making arithmetic errors involving fractions or incorrectly applying the inverse operation of multiplication.

**A) $t = 6\frac{1}{4}$ (The "multiply everything by 2 then add 3" error)**
This is a sophisticated error where students correctly identify the steps but fail to apply them to the fraction $\frac{1}{8}$. Instead of calculating $(\frac{1}{8} \times 2) + 3$, they might think $2 \div \frac{1}{8} = 16$ then subtract or add, or apply the $\times 2$ incorrectly to the 8 in the denominator (turning it into 16).

**B) $t = 1$ (The "intuitive/visual" error)**
Many students at the "basic" level try to make the equation "look" right. They see 2 and 8 and think the relationship is 4. They might perform $4 - 3 = 1$ to try and find a value for $t$.

**C) $t = 3\frac{1}{16}$ (The "multiplication by denominator" error)**
This is the most common mistake for "basic/proficient" students. They know they need to "get rid" of the 2, but instead of multiplying $\frac{1}{8}$ by 2 to get $\frac{2}{8}$ or $\frac{1}{4}$, they multiply the denominators ($8 \times 2$) to get $t - 3 = \frac{1}{16}$.

**D) $t = 3\frac{1}{4}$ (The correct answer)**
$\frac{t-3}{2} = \frac{1}{8} \Rightarrow t - 3 = \frac{2}{8} \Rightarrow t - 3 = \frac{1}{4} \Rightarrow t = 3 + \frac{1}{4}$.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=15% B=45% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=20% B=20% C=40% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=25% D=60%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=5% D=92%
