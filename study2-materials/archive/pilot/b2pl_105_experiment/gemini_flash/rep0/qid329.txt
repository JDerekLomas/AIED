This question tests two specific skills: knowledge of BIDMAS/BODMAS (Order of Operations) and the property of commutativity in subtraction. 

The complexity here isn't the calculation (which is not required) but the use of decimals. For many "Below Basic" students, the presence of decimals triggers a "cognitive overload" that makes them guess or assume the question is harder than it is. However, the core of the question is whether the division should be done first (Tom) and whether subtraction is commutative (Katie).

Tom's statement is a fundamental application of BIDMAS (Division before Subtraction). Katie’s statement is a common misconception where students believe they can swap the order of terms in a subtraction. 

The likely distribution reflects that proficient students recognize the BIDMAS rule immediately, while lower-ability students often fall for "left-to-right" processing or confuse the "freedom" of commutative addition/multiplication with subtraction.
