This question tests the ability to translate a multi-step word problem into an algebraic equation, specifically focusing on the use of brackets to show order of operations.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
The "trap" in this question is the linear phrasing. A student reading left-to-right without considering BIDMAS (Order of Operations) will likely pick **Option A**, as it follows the word order: $n$, then $+5$, then $\times 4$. **Option B** is a common "algebraic default" for students who associate multiplication with the coefficient but forget that the addition happened first. **Option C** is a rare error for students who confuse "multiply by four" with "power of four," though it occurs less frequently at this level.

**Option D** requires the student to understand that the result of the addition must be grouped (using brackets) before the multiplication is applied.

*   **Below Basic:** Often pick A because it matches the word order of the sentence perfectly.
*   **Basic:** Might recognise that $4$ should be in front of the $n$, but fail to realise the 5 is also being multiplied, leading to B.
*   **Proficient:** Usually recognise the need for brackets to ensure the "add five" happens first.
*   **Advanced:** Rarely make a mistake here unless they misread the question.

below_basic: A=50% B=25% C=10% D=15%
basic: A=35% B=25% C=5% D=35%
proficient: A=15% B=10% C=2% D=73%
advanced: A=3% B=2% C=0% D=95%
