This question focuses on the "last" part of the FOIL method (or the final cell in a grid method). The primary challenge for students here is the sign rule: multiplying a negative by a negative.

**Analysis of the Question:**
*   **A (+4):** This is the correct answer. The student correctly identifies the operation as multiplication and remembers that $-1 \times -4 = +4$.
*   **B (-4):** A very common error. Students know to multiply $1 \times 4$, but they either think a negative and a negative stay negative, or they only apply the negative sign once.
*   **C (+5):** A "distractor" for students who perform the wrong operation. They see -1 and -4 and "add" them to get 5 (ignoring the signs or incorrectly processing the addition), or they think about the magnitude of addition.
*   **D (-5):** A major trap. Students often see $(-1) - 4$ and treat it as a linear calculation rather than multiplication, leading to $-5$. This is the most common error for lower-ability students who confuse the rules of adding/subtracting directed numbers with the rules for multiplying them.

**Student Performance Predictions:**
At the **below_basic** level, the confusion between addition and multiplication rules is high; many see $-1$ and $-4$ and intuitively jump to $-5$. At the **basic** level, students know to multiply but often fail the sign rule, leading to $-4$. **Proficient** students usually remember that "two minuses make a plus," and **advanced** students will almost all identify this correctly.

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=10% D=45%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=80% B=12% C=3% D=5%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
