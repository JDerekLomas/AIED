This is one of the most fundamental questions in the secondary maths curriculum, testing the basic concept of adding fractions with common denominators. Because the denominators are already the same, there is no need for conversion, making this an "entry-level" fractions question.

The primary distractor for students struggling with the concept is **Option D**, which represents the "add across" error (adding both numerators and denominators: $2+1=3$ and $7+7=14$). **Option B** is a less common error usually associated with a confusion between addition and multiplication rules.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

**below_basic: A=5% B=10% C=45% D=40%**
Students at this level often treat a fraction as two independent numbers. While many will intuitively know $2+1=3$, nearly half will succumb to the temptation to add the $7+7$ to create $14$.

**basic: A=2% B=3% C=80% D=15%**
By this level, the rule "keep the denominator the same" is usually becoming well-rehearsed. Most students will get this right, though some will still slip into the "add across" habit under pressure.

**proficient: A=0% B=1% C=96% D=3%**
These students have mastered basic arithmetic operations. The only errors here would be due to extreme haste or a momentary lapse in concentration.

**advanced: A=0% B=0% C=99% D=1%**
This is a trivial question for an advanced student. The 1% accounts for "silly mistakes" where a student might overthink and treat it as a multiplication problem by accident.
