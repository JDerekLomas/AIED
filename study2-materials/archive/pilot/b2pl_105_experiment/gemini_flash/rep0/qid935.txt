This question tests a student's ability to substitute a known value into a linear equation and solve for the remaining variable. While the context mentions "simultaneous equations," the task is purely algebraic substitution.

The primary difficulty lies in handling the directed numbers (negative results) and the subtraction of the constant. A common error here is the "sign change" mistake when moving $-8$ to the other side of the equation: students often add 8 to $-10$ to get $-2$, but some will mistakenly subtract 8 from $-10$ to get $-18$, or perform the calculation $10 - 8$ and ignore the negative sign.

**Choice A ($j=1$):** Results from $2j - 8 = -10 \rightarrow 2j = 2$. Students ignore the negative on the 10.
**Choice B ($j=9$):** Results from $2j + 8 = 10$ or similar misinterpretations of the signs.
**Choice C ($j=-9$):** Results from $2j - 8 = -10 \rightarrow 2j = -18$ (subtracting 8 instead of adding it). This is the most common procedural error.
**Choice D ($j=-1$):** The correct answer ($2j - 8 = -10 \rightarrow 2j = -2 \rightarrow j = -1$).
