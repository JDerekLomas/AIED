This question tests a student's understanding of the fundamental "inverse operations" concept required to solve linear equations. 

The structure of the question is quite direct because the equals sign is followed by ellipses (...) rather than numbers, which forces the student to focus entirely on the transformation of the $x$ term. The visual of moving from $x + 7$ to $x$ is one of the most common early algebra skills taught in UK classrooms.

**Analysis of Ability Levels:**
*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the direction of the operation. Many believe that if there is a $+7$, you must "do" a $+7$. Others may guess $\times 7$ because they associate algebra with multiplication.
*   **Basic:** At this level, students are generally familiar with "doing the opposite." However, some may still impulsively choose $A$ because they see the plus sign in the expression and don't correctly interpret the transition arrow.
*   **Proficient:** These students have internalized that to "get $x$ by itself," they must undo the addition. The mistake rate here is very low, usually only due to misreading the question.
*   **Advanced:** This is a trivial question for an advanced student. Error rates are near zero, barring a rare "slip of the pen."
