In this question, students must substitute $x = 0$ into the linear equation $3x + 2y = 6$ and solve for $y$. 

The common error for "below basic" students is to either misidentify the coefficient to be used or confuse the constants. Option B (2) is a very common distractor because students see the number $2$ next to the $y$ and assume that's the answer, or they confuse $x$ and $y$ and look at the coefficient of $x$. Option D (12) represents a "calculation" where students might multiply $6$ and $2$. However, because $x=0$ is the simplest substitution, even lower-ability students often find their way to $2y = 6$. The most common error is dividing by the wrong number or thinking the answer is the $x$-coefficient (3).

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=45% B=25% C=10% D=20%
basic: A=70% B=15% C=10% D=5%
proficient: A=92% B=4% C=3% D=1%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
