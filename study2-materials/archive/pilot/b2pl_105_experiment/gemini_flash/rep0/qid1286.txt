This question tests a student's ability to rearrange a formula involving a cube root, specifically the formula for the volume of a sphere: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.

While many students memorise the formula, the difficulty here lies in the algebraic manipulation. 
1. **The common error (Option B):** Students often multiply by the $4$ and divide by the $3$, or fail to recognise that $4\pi$ acts as a single coefficient in the numerator.
2. **The "Upside Down" error (Option A):** Students frequently invert the fraction incorrectly when moving it to the other side of the equation ($V \times \frac{4}{3}$ instead of $V \div \frac{4}{3}$).
3. **The Radical error (Option D):** Weak students may apply the cube root only to the $V$ or fail to understand that the entire expression must be under the radical.

This is a "high-demand" foundation or "medium-demand" higher tier GCSE question. Proficient students usually navigate the "multiply by 3, divide by $4\pi$" steps correctly, whereas lower-ability students struggle with the reciprocal of $\frac{4}{3}$.
