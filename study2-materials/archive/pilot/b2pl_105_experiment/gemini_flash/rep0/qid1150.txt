In this GCSE-level rearrangement question, the two primary hurdles are the division by $r$ and the square on the $v$. For lower-ability students, the most common error is failing to apply the inverse operation correctly—either by multiplying by the wrong variable or by incorrectly handling the square root. 

Option B is a classic "order of operations" trap; students often apply the square root before multiplying by $r$, leading to $v = \sqrt{F/r}$. Option D is a rarer algebraic slip where the root is applied only to the $F$ and not the $r$. Option A reflects a total confusion regarding inverse operations (squaring $F$ instead of rooting the result).

Here is the predicted performance breakdown:

proficient: A=5% B=15% C=75% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=96% D=1%
