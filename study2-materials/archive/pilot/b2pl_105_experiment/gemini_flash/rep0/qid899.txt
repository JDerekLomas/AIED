This question is a classic test of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). While it looks straightforward, the visual layout heavily encourages a left-to-right processing error, which is the most common pitfall in lower secondary mathematics.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **B (10-8):** This is the most popular choice for students with "below basic" skills because it follows the natural reading order (left-to-right).
*   **A (7+6):** This attracts students who remember there is a "rule" about the order but have it scrambled in their heads, often thinking Addition comes before Subtraction/Multiplication in some contexts, or simply picking the right-most operation.
*   **D:** Rarely chosen by students who have had any exposure to BIDMAS, but often picked by those who believe maths is "subjective" or based on how you read the line.
*   **C (The correct answer):** Requires the student to consciously suppress the urge to calculate $10-8$ and instead identify the priority of Multiplication over Addition and Subtraction.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=15% B=60% C=20% D=5%
basic: A=10% B=35% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=83% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=98% D=0%
