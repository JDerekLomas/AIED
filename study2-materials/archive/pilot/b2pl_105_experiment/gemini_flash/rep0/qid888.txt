This question is a standard test of quadratic expansion focusing on the multiplication of two negative terms. While "FOIL" or the "Grid Method" are commonly taught, the specific difficulty here lies in the directed number arithmetic, specifically $(-5) \times (-7)$ and $(-5) + (-7)$.

**A (m² - 2m - 35)** is a common "difference" error. Students at the below_basic level often look for the difference between 5 and 7 to get the middle term, and frequently get the final sign wrong.
**B (m² - 12m + 35)** is the correct answer. 
**C (m² + 12m + 35)** tests the misconception that "two negatives make a positive" applies to the addition/summing of the middle term as well as the multiplication of the constants.
**D (m² - 12m - 35)** is the most common error across all levels. Students correctly identify the sum (-12), but falter on the product, thinking that because the numbers in the brackets are negative, the final result must be negative.

The "double negative" for the final term is the primary differentiator between basic and proficient students.

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=25% D=30%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=10% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=5% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=1% D=3%
