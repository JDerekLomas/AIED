As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as one that tests the inverse operation of multiplication, specifically when dealing with fractions. 

The most common trap here is Option A ($p = \frac{1}{4}$), which occurs when students confuse multiplying by 3 with dividing by 3, or simply try to "combine" 3 and 12 via division ($12 \div 3 = 4$). Option C ($p=4$) is for students who completely ignore the fraction structure or mistakenly perform $3 \times \frac{1}{12}$ and then reciprocal it. Option B is the correct answer ($\frac{1}{12} \div 3 = \frac{1}{12} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{36}$). 

Many "basic" and "below basic" students find the fraction $\frac{1}{12}$ intimidating and will default to a whole number relationship ($12 \div 3$), making A a very strong distractor.

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=35% B=40% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%
