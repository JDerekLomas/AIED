This question specifically tests the distribution of a negative multiplier over a bracket containing a subtraction. It is a classic "sign error" trap.

The most common error for students at the **below_basic** and **basic** levels is forgetting that "a negative times a negative is a positive" when multiplying $-3$ by $-2$. These students often correctly multiply the first term but fail on the second. 

Option B is the "most popular" distractor because it applies the $-3$ but keeps the negative sign from the bracket. Option A is a common error for students who ignore the negative on the 3 entirely, while Option C is relatively rare as it requires multiple conflicting errors.

**Analysis of the Specific Question:**
*   **The Trap:** Multiplying $-3 \times -2$.
*   **Ease factor:** The numbers (3, 2, 6) are very simple, meaning errors are almost entirely conceptual (signs) rather than arithmetic.
*   **Discrimination:** This is an excellent discriminator between those who mechanically expand and those who understand the rules of directed numbers.

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=40% C=5% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=15% C=2% D=78%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=0% D=97%
