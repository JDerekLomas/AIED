As an experienced teacher, I evaluate this question by looking at the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and the understanding of inverse operations. 

**Key Insights:**
1.  **The Priority Trap (Option A):** This is the most common error for students who read left-to-right rather than following BIDMAS. They see $x^2 + 5$ and assume the $+5$ happens before the squaring because they read the symbols linearly.
2.  **The "Square vs. Divide by 2" Error (Option D):** A very persistent misconception where students treat $x^2$ as $2x$. This is common even among middle-ability students when they are rushed or working under pressure.
3.  **The Core Skill (Option C):** This requires the student to correctly identify that $x$ is squared first, then 5 is added, and then correctly reverse both the order and the operations (Subtract 5, then Square Root).

**Student Performance Breakdown:**

*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the "inverse" concept or the order of operations. Many will pick **A** because it matches the linear reading of the equation, or **D** because they frequently confuse powers with coefficients.
*   **Basic:** Students at this level generally understand that you have to "do the opposite," but they frequently make the order of operations error. Option **A** will be a very strong distractor for them. 
*   **Proficient:** These students usually recognize BIDMAS. They will see that $x$ is squared before the $5$ is added, meaning the reverse must involve subtracting $5$ first. The main risk here is a lapse in concentration leading to Option **D**.
*   **Advanced:** These students should find this straightforward. They will systematically check the operations and the inverse. Only a tiny fraction would make a "silly mistake" or misread the diagrams.
