To predict the performance on this question, we must analyze the specific numbers involved: $\frac{3}{5} + \frac{2}{7}$.

1.  **The "Add Across" Trap (Option C):** $3+2=5$ and $5+7=12$, leading to $\frac{5}{12}$. This is the classic misconception for adding fractions. Because the denominators are small prime numbers, this is a very attractive "low effort" trap for Below Basic and Basic students.
2.  **The Subtraction Error (Option A):** $\frac{3}{5} - \frac{2}{7} = \frac{21-10}{35} = \frac{11}{35}$. Students often misread the operation in "pyramid" style questions or lose track of the required process halfway through.
3.  **The Incorrect Common Denominator (Option D):** $\frac{5}{35}$. This occurs if a student finds the correct denominator ($35$) but simply adds the original numerators ($3+2=5$).
4.  **The Correct Calculation (Option B):** $\frac{21}{35} + \frac{10}{35} = \frac{31}{35}$.

The difficulty here is medium; while the numbers are prime (making the common denominator easy to find), the transition from $3/5$ to $21/35$ requires a multi-step process that many middle-ability students slip up on.
