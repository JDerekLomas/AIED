This question specifically targets the "last" part of the FOIL expansion (multiplying the constants). The main difficulty here is not the algebra itself, but the manipulation of negative numbers and the confusion between adding and multiplying.

**A (–10)** is a very common "low-ability" error where students see the two numbers and simply add them (-8 - 2 = -10), forgetting that brackets imply multiplication. 
**B (+16)** is the correct answer. 
**C (–6)** is less common but happens when students try to find the difference or struggle with the number line. 
**D (–16)** is the most common "mid-ability" error. These students know to multiply (8 × 2 = 16) but mistakenly believe that "a negative and a negative make a negative" or simply forget to apply the sign rule.

In my experience, even proficient students occasionally slip up on the double negative sign in the heat of a full expansion, but when isolated like this, they usually perform better.

below_basic: A=45% B=20% C=10% D=25%
basic: A=25% B=45% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=75% C=2% D=13%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
