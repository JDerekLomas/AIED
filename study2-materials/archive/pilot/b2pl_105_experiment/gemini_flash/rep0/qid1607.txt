In this question, Step 1 is correct (multiplying both sides by 4), but Step 2 is incorrect. To isolate $k$, Isaac should have subtracted 1 from 60 ($k=59$), but instead, he added 1 ($60+1=61$). This is a very common "inverse operation" error seen in UK classrooms, where students see the $+1$ and reflexively add 1 to the other side instead of subtracting it.

**Why this question is tricky:**
1. **The Step 1 Hurdle:** Below-basic students often struggle with equations where the variable is on the right or in a fraction. Many will think Step 1 is wrong because they don't recognise the multiplication of $15 \times 4$.
2. **The "Check" Trap:** Proficient students are much better at spotting the Step 2 error. However, a significant portion of basic-level students will see "$61 = k$" and think "that looks like a sensible number" without actually checking the inverse operation or substituting it back into the original equation ($62/4 \neq 15$).
3. **The Step 2 Slip:** This is the primary distractor. Many students will agree with Step 1 but fail to notice that Step 2 used addition instead of subtraction.
