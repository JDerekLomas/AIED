This question tests a student's ability to substitute a value into a linear $n$th term formula. While the substitution is straightforward ($1 - 3 \times 15$), the presence of the negative coefficient and the order of operations presents specific hurdles.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A ($1 - 45 = -44$):** The correct answer.
*   **B (Calculation error):** Common for students who subtract $1$ from $45$ and then mistakenly "add" the $1$ to the magnitude, or think $1 - 45 = -46$.
*   **C ($3 \times 5 - 1$ or similar reversal):** Misreading the formula as $3n - 1$ would lead to $44$, but here students often perform $1 - 15$ or ignore the 3 and just do $1 - 14$. 
*   **D ($1 - 3 - 15$ or ignoring the $n$):** Some students treat the $n$ as a term to be subtracted rather than a multiplier, or simply guess based on the $3 \times 10$ relationship.

**Why this is tricky:**
Students often struggle with $1 - 3n$ because they instinctively want to do $3n - 1$. The most common error is the "off-by-one" error or a sign error during the subtraction across zero.
