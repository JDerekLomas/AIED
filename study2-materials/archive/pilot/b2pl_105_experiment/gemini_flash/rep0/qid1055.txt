To solve this problem, we need to add the two fractions at the bottom: $\frac{3}{5} + \frac{1}{4}$.
The common denominator is 20. 
$\frac{3}{5}$ becomes $\frac{12}{20}$ and $\frac{1}{4}$ becomes $\frac{5}{20}$.
$\frac{12}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{17}{20}$ (Option D).

**Analysis for UK Students:**
*   **The "Add Across" Trap (A):** Adding the numerators ($3+1=4$) and denominators ($5+4=9$) to get $\frac{4}{9}$ is the most common misconception in fraction addition. For "below basic" students, this is the intuitive "go-to" method.
*   **The Common Denominator Only (B):** Some students know they need a common denominator (20) and add the original numerators ($3+1=4$) without scaling them. This leads to $\frac{4}{20}$.
*   **The Single-Scaling Error (C):** Students who correctly find the denominator of 20 but only correctly scale one numerator (e.g., $3+4=7$ or $5+2=7$) or confuse addition with other rules might land on $\frac{7}{20}$.
*   **Proficiency Level:** This is a standard Grade 4/5 (GCSE) question. By the "Proficient" level, most students can execute the routine of finding a common denominator, though arithmetic slips still occur.
