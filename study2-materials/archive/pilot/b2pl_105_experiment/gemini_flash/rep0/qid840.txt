As a UK maths teacher, I analyze this question as a test of "fluency in rearranging" versus "memorised procedures."

**Analysis:**
The question presents two valid but non-standard next steps. 
1. **Tom's step ($8x = 8$):** This occurs if you divide both sides by 5. However, the most common student error here is to *multiply* by 5 to clear the fraction. If a student sees $40 \div 5$, they might get 8, but most "below basic" students will associate $40$ and $5$ with multiplication ($200$) or mistake the operation entirely.
2. **Katie's step ($x/5 = 5$):** This occurs if you divide both sides by 8. Again, students are conditioned to "multiply by 5 first." Dividing by 8 first is mathematically sound ($40 \div 8 = 5$) but cognitively "uncomfortable" for students used to a fixed order of operations in solving equations.

The trap here is **D**. Many students at lower and middle tiers believe there is only *one* correct next step (usually $8x = 200$). Because neither Tom nor Katie followed the "standard" first step of multiplying by 5 to get 200, many students will conclude both are wrong.

**Predicted Percentages:**

below_basic: A=15% B=15% C=10% D=60%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=20% D=45%
proficient: A=15% B=10% C=55% D=20%
advanced: A=5% B=2% C=90% D=3%
