This question is a subtle test of the **Commutative Property** and its interaction with the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). 

**Tom's statement** tests the common misconception that addition *must* come before subtraction. While $3+(2-1) = 4$ and $(3+2)-1 = 4$, many lower-ability students believe subtraction cannot be moved. However, because he has correctly moved the $-1$ as a single term ($3 - 1 + 2 = 4$), he is correct.
**Katie's statement** tests the commutativity of addition across a product. Since $3 + (2 \times 1) = 5$ and $(2 \times 1) + 3 = 5$, she is also correct.

The primary "trap" for students is Tom's statement. Students who follow "AS" in BIDMAS rigidly without understanding that addition and subtraction have equal priority often believe you cannot reorder them in this way.
