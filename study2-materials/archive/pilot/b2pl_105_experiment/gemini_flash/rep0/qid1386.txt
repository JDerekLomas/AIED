As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as being on the simpler side of algebraic fractions because the denominators are already common ($x$). 

The most common error in adding fractions for **lower ability** students is adding both the numerators and the denominators (leading to C). **Middle ability** students sometimes over-complicate the process by applying the "cross-multiplication" method used for different denominators ($\frac{2x+3x}{x^2}$), which leads to option A. Option D is the classic "operation confusion" where students multiply the terms instead of adding them.

However, because the common denominator is already present, a significant majority of students—even at lower levels—will recognize this follows the same rule as $\frac{2}{7} + \frac{3}{7}$.
