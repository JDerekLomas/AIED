This question is a standard quadratic expansion that specifically tests the ability to manipulate directed numbers (negative signs). 

The primary "trap" is the multiplication of two negatives for the constant term ($(-5) \times (-7) = +35$), which distinguishes between options B and D. The second hurdle is the summation of the middle terms ($-5m - 7m = -12m$), which distinguishes between B and C. Option A represents a classic "difference" error where the student subtracts 5 from 7 rather than adding them or maintaining the negative direction.

Because both signs are negative, it is significantly harder for "basic" students than $(m+5)(m+7)$ or $(m+5)(m-7)$, where they can rely on intuitive subtraction.

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=50% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=96% C=1% D=2%
