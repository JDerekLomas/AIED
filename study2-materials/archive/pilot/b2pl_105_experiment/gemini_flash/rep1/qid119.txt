In this question, students are being tested on their ability to relate a visual number line model to signed integer multiplication and division. 

The diagram shows a total displacement of $-24$ (an arrow pointing left). Underneath, a smaller arrow shows one-third of that displacement (pointing left, which would be $-8$). 

**The Key Issues:**
1. **Tom's Calculation:** $(-3) \times (-8) = +24$. Tom has written that it equals $-24$. Even if he identifies the values correctly from the diagram, his arithmetic is wrong (negative $\times$ negative = positive).
2. **Katie's Calculation:** $(-24) \div (-3) = +8$. Katie has written that it equals $-8$. Again, the signs in the division result are incorrect.
3. **The Diagram Interpretation:** Many students will see the numbers 3, 8, and 24 and assume the calculations are "correct" because the numbers match the visual representation (3 lots of 8 is 24), ignoring the laws of directed numbers.

**Student Behaviour:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will choose C because "3 times 8 is 24" and "24 divided by 3 is 8". They often ignore signs entirely.
*   **Basic:** They might notice the negative signs but lack the confidence to perform the multiplication/division of signs correctly. They often lean towards C or B because they want someone to be right.
*   **Proficient:** These students usually spot that the arithmetic results ($+24$ and $+8$) don't match what is written on the page ($-24$ and $-8$). However, a few might get confused by the visual and think Katie is correct if they misinterpret the direction.
*   **Advanced:** These students will quickly verify the rules of signs: $(-)(-) = (+)$. Since both Tom and Katie have $(-)(-) = (-)$, they will correctly identify that both are wrong.

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=45% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=25% C=35% D=25%
proficient: A=10% B=15% C=15% D=60%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=5% D=90%
