As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question by looking at the specific numbers provided. While adding four fractions often triggers a search for a lowest common multiple (LCM) of 12, this specific question is a "fluency and number sense" trap. 

Students who look at the big picture will pair the thirds $(1/3 + 2/3 = 1)$ and the quarters $(1/4 + 3/4 = 1)$ to get $1 + 1 = 2$ almost instantly. However, struggling students often revert to procedural "rules" without looking at the numbers.

**A (7/12):** This is a very common "partial work" error. A student adds $1/3 + 1/4$ correctly using a common denominator and then simply stops, perhaps overwhelmed by the four terms.
**B (7/14):** The classic "add across" error ($1+1+2+3$ over $3+4+3+4$). This is the go-to for below-basic students.
**C (2):** The correct answer. Proficient students see the pairs.
**D (28/12):** This represents a student who found a common denominator of 12 for all terms ($4/12 + 3/12 + 8/12 + 9/12$) but made a calculation error in the numerator or didn't know how to simplify $24/12$.

below_basic: A=20% B=60% C=15% D=5%
basic: A=25% B=20% C=40% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=80% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=0% C=97% D=1%
