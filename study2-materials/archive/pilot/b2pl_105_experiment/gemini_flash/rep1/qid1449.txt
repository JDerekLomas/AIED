This question tests two distinct concepts: **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)** and **Directed Numbers (negative integers)**.

The "classic" mistake here is to read the expression from left to right: $(-4 + -5) \times 3 = -9 \times 3 = -27$. This mistake is extremely common because it follows the natural flow of reading and ignores the priority of multiplication over addition. 

*   **Option B (-27)** is the primary distractor for students who ignore the order of operations.
*   **Option A (27)** attracts students who make the left-to-right error and also struggle with negative signs (e.g., thinking a negative times a negative is positive, or simply losing the sign).
*   **Option C (-11)** is the result of students who correctly apply BIDMAS but fail the multiplication of directed numbers (e.g., $-4 + (-5 \times 3)$ becoming $-4 + 15 = 11$ or similar sign errors).
*   **Option D (-19)** is the correct answer: $-4 + (-15) = -19$.

Historically, the left-to-right error (Option B) is highly persistent even among proficient students, especially when presented in this horizontal linear format.
