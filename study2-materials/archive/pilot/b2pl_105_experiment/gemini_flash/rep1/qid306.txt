This question is a classic test of the "Order of Operations" (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and specifically targets the most persistent misconception in primary and secondary mathematics: the belief that Addition (A) must always be performed before Subtraction (S).

In **Problem P**, many students are taught the acronym BIDMAS and take the "A" before "S" literally, leading them to believe $5+6$ must be done first (Option D). In reality, Addition and Subtraction have equal priority and are performed left-to-right. Therefore, $4-5$ is the correct first step.

In **Problem Q**, the rule is clearer: Multiplication (M) takes absolute priority over Addition (A). Students who simply work left-to-right will incorrectly choose $4+5$.

**Analysis of the choices:**
*   **Option B (Correct):** Follows left-to-right for P and priority for Q.
*   **Option D (The "BIDMAS Trap"):** Students who follow the acronym letters strictly (A before S) but understand multiplication priority.
*   **Option A:** Students who blindly work left-to-right regardless of operators.
*   **Option C:** Students who follow the acronym strictly (A before S) AND work left-to-right on Q (very rare combination).

The jump from "Proficient" to "Advanced" is defined by the student's ability to overcome the "Addition before Subtraction" myth.
