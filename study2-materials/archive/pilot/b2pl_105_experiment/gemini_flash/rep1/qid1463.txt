To predict student performance, we must look at the specific trap in this question: the evaluation of $b^2$ when $b$ is negative. 

The term in the triangle represents $b^2$. In this equation, $b = -3$.
Students frequently make the calculator-induced or mental error of thinking $(-3)^2 = -9$, or simply forgetting to square the negative sign. 

- **Below Basic** students often struggle with the formula itself and might try to combine $b$ and $a$ or simply guess. Some will pick 9 by accident, but many will be drawn to -9 or -6 (thinking $2b$).
- **Basic** students often know the formula but are the most likely to fall for the "negative squared is negative" trap. $D$ is a very "attractive distractor" for this cohort.
- **Proficient** students generally know $(-3)^2 = 9$, but under exam pressure, a significant minority will still tick -9 because they see the $-3$ in the equation and don't process the squaring of the negative correctly.
- **Advanced** students will see this as a trivial application of $b^2$ and almost all will correctly choose $C$.

**Why this is hard:** The substitution of a negative value into $b^2$ is the single most common point of failure when using the quadratic formula.

below_basic: A=15% B=20% C=25% D=40%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=45% D=35%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=75% D=15%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=96% D=2%
