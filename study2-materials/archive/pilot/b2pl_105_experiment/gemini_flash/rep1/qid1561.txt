This question tests the ability to solve a basic two-step linear equation. While the steps are theoretically simple, the order of division often creates a significant hurdle for lower-ability students.

**Analysis of Difficulty:**
The primary "trap" here is the common misconception that in a division, you must always divide the larger number by the smaller number. Many students at the **Below Basic** and **Basic** levels will look at $20$ and $5$ and instinctively conclude the answer is $4$. 

*   **Option B ($t=4$):** This is the most common error, caused by calculating $20 \div 5$ instead of $5 \div 20$.
*   **Option C/D:** These track sign errors. Students may mistakenly think that moving $-5$ across the equals sign keeps it negative, or they may become confused when dividing a smaller number by a larger one and assume a negative result is required.

**Student Performance Predictions:**

below_basic: A=25% B=45% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=45% B=35% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
