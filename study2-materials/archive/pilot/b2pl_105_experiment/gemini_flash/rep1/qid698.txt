As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question based on common student behaviours when dealing with independent events and probability.

The core difficulty here lies in the confusion between the **Product Rule** (multiplying probabilities) and the **Addition Rule** (adding denominators or probabilities). Students often struggle with the distinction between "and" and "or."

*   **The most common error (A)** comes from adding the number of outcomes ($4 + 5 = 9$) and placing "1" as the numerator. 
*   **The second most common error (C)** comes from adding the outcomes to get a denominator of $9$ and then counting the two "1"s as the numerator ($\frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{9}$ or simply counting the faces).
*   **Option D** is a "halfway" error where students correctly identify the total space ($4 \times 5 = 20$) but fail to realise there is only one way to get $(1, 1)$, instead adding the two "1"s.

Here is the predicted distribution of answers:

below_basic: A=40% B=15% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=45% C=15% D=15%
proficient: A=10% B=75% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%
