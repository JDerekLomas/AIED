This quadratic factorisation task is a classic "sign-management" problem. The coefficient of the middle term is $-1$ and the constant is $-6$. 

Students at the **below_basic** level often struggle with the multiplication of negative numbers. They frequently pick Option C because $3 + 2 = 5$ (close to 1 or 6) or simply because they prefer positive signs. They often ignore the negative signs in the original expression entirely.

At the **basic** level, students know they need factors of 6 that subtract to make 1, but they have a "50/50" chance of getting the signs the wrong way round. Option D is a very common distractor here, as students see the minus sign in the question and assume the larger number shouldn't be the negative one, or they simply get the sum $+3 - 2 = +1$ confused with the required $-1$.

**Proficient** students usually perform the mental check $(x-3)(x+2) \rightarrow -3x + 2x = -x$ correctly, but a small percentage will still make a clerical error. **Advanced** students will see the answer almost instantly.

The main "trap" here is the similarity between $A$ and $D$. Unlike some questions where the numbers don't trigger the error, $x^2 - x - 6$ is the "perfect" difficulty level for this topic because both $3-2$ and $2-3$ feel plausible to a struggling student.

below_basic: A=30% B=20% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=5% D=40%
proficient: A=80% B=2% C=1% D=17%
advanced: A=97% B=1% C=0% D=2%
