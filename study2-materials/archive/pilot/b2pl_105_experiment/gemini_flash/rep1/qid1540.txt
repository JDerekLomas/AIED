Substituting $x = -1$ into a quadratic is a classic "filter" question in the UK curriculum. The primary challenge is not the algebra itself, but the squaring of a negative number. Many students will mistakenly calculate $(-1)^2$ as $-1$ instead of $1$, particularly when using a non-scientific calculator or mental arithmetic without brackets.

In this specific equation, $y = x^2 - 2x + 1$:
- Students who handle negatives correctly get $1 - (-2) + 1 = 4$ (Option B).
- Students who think $(-1)^2 = -1$ will calculate $-1 - (-2) + 1 = 2$ (Option C).
- Students who think $(-1)^2 = -1$ AND fail the double negative for $-2x$ will calculate $-1 - 2 + 1 = -2$ (Option A).
- Option D (0) is often chosen by students who conflate the $x$ and $y$ intercepts or simply mismanage the signs to cancel everything out.

**Predicting performance:**
Below basic students struggle significantly with the $-2x$ term when $x$ is negative. Proficient students usually manage the $x^2$ correctly but can still trip up on the $-2(-1)$ double negative. Advanced students will almost certainly get this correct.
