This question tests the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). In the UK, students are taught that multiplication ($10 \times 3 = 30$) must be performed before addition and subtraction.

The "trap" in this question lies in the common misconception involving the "AS" (Addition/Subtraction) part of BIDMAS. Many students believe addition must be performed before subtraction because 'A' comes before 'S'. This would lead to calculating $(8 - (7 + 30))$ or even $(8-7+30)$ but with a mistake in sequence. 

Specifically:
- **Option B (31)** is the correct answer: $8 - 7 + 30 = 1 + 30 = 31$.
- **Option D (33)** comes from calculating $8 - (7 + 30)$ incorrectly or performing the multiplication first, then trying to add $7$ to $8$ and subtract.
- **Option A (36)** comes from ignoring BIDMAS entirely and working left-to-right: $8 - 7 = 1$, then $1 + 10 = 11$, then $11 \times 3 = 33$ (though here it specifically leads to 36 if a student does $8-7=1$, $1+10=11...$ wait, the left-to-right logic is actually $1+10=11$, $11 \times 3 = 33$). Actually, $33$ is often the result of the left-to-right error. $36$ is often a random "close enough" guess or a specific calculation error.

Lower ability students frequently work strictly left-to-right, making D very popular. Mid-level students often remember the multiplication rule but struggle with the "Addition vs Subtraction" left-to-right priority.
