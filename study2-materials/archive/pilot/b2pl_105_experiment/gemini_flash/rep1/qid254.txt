This question is a classic test of two distinct mathematical hurdles: the role of the number zero in averages and the correct notation for the order of operations (BIDMAS).

Many students intuitively believe that because adding zero doesn't change the sum, it shouldn't be "counted" in the divisor. This leads to the popular distraction of dividing by 4. However, the most subtle trap here is Option B. In a classroom setting, many students write calculations in a single line on their calculators. Without brackets, $0+1+3+4+7 \div 5$ yields $9.4$ because of the order of operations (only the 7 is divided). 

While A is the correct mathematical representation, a significant number of "below basic" and "basic" students will gravitate towards C because they "ignore" the zero, or D if they are hyper-focused on seeing the $+0$ explicitly written in the numerator.

**Predictive breakdown:**

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=50% B=15% C=25% D=10%
proficient: A=75% B=10% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=92% B=3% C=3% D=2%
