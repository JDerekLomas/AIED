In this BIDMAS/BODMAS question, students must navigate a subtraction, an addition, and a division. This specific problem is tricky because the default order of operations (left to right for addition/subtraction) results in $12$. To get $7$, the student must perform the addition before the subtraction, making Option A the correct answer: $16 - (10) \div 2 \rightarrow 16 - 5 = 11$ (incorrect) vs $16 - 10 \div 2$ which isn't the goal. Wait, let's re-calculate:

*   **Target is 7.**
*   A: $16 - (10) \div 2 = 16 - 5 = 11$
*   B: $(10) + 2 = 12$
*   C: $16 - 6 + 2 = 12$
*   D: $(16 - 6 + 4) \div 2 = 14 \div 2 = 7$. **Correct.**

**Analysis:**
The most common error for **Basic** students is Option B or C because they naturally want to work left-to-right or think the brackets "belong" at the start. Option D is actually quite accessible because the division by $2$ at the end is a very "satisfying" way to reach a small prime number like $7$. However, **Below Basic** students often struggle with the fact that brackets can encompass three terms (as in D). They often default to "the first two numbers" (Option B).

The complexity here isn't the division, it's the length of the expression inside the brackets in Option D.

below_basic: A=20% B=40% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=15% B=25% C=15% D=45%
proficient: A=5% B=10% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=1% D=97%
