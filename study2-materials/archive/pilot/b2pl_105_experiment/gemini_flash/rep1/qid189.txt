This question tests a student's ability to substitute a value into an $n$th term formula. While the substitution is straightforward ($1 - 3 \times 15$), the presence of a negative term and the "1 minus" structure provides significant friction for lower-ability students.

**Breakdown of choices:**
*   **A (-44):** The correct answer ($1 - 45 = -44$).
*   **B (-46):** A common directional error when working with negative numbers (thinking $45 + 1$ or moving the wrong way on the number line from $-45$).
*   **C (-14):** A calculation error where the student performs $(1-3) \times 15$, or handles the 1 and 3 incorrectly before multiplying.
*   **D (-30):** Usually chosen by students who ignore the "$1-$" and simply calculate $-3 \times 15$ incorrectly or think the sequence is related to $2n$ or $15 \times 2$.

**Complexity Analysis:**
The difficulty here isn't the algebra, but the integer arithmetic. Basic and Below Basic students frequently struggle with the "small number minus larger number" calculation ($1 - 45$). Many will instinctively do $45 - 1$ and then realize it must be negative, but a significant portion will make a "one-off" error or subtract in the wrong order mentally.

below_basic: A=35% B=25% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=60% B=20% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=3% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
