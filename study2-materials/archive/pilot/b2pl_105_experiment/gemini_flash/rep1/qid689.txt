This question is a classic "variable in the denominator" problem, which is a notorious stumbling block for UK students (typically KS3 and GCSE Foundation). 

The primary trap here is the visual intuition that $10 \div 5 = 2$. Students with lower confidence in algebraic manipulation often ignore the structure of the equation and perform the most "obvious" division with the two numbers present. Option C ($p=2$) is the most common distractor because it satisfies the calculation $10/5$, rather than the algebraic requirement. 

Option B ($p=50$) catches students who realize multiplication is involved but multiply the numbers $(10 \times 5)$ rather than isolating $p$ correctly. Option A ($0.5$) is the correct answer, but it feels counter-intuitive to lower-ability students because the result is smaller than the numbers in the question.
