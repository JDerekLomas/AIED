This linear equation is a classic "directionality" trap. While it tests basic algebraic manipulation, it triggers two primary misconceptions: the **division order error** (dividing 12 by 3 instead of 3 by 12) and the **sign error** (forgetting to change the sign when moving the constant to the other side).

In this specific case, the numbers $12$ and $3$ are highly likely to trigger the "division order" error because $12 \div 3 = 4$ is a more "natural" integer result for lower-ability students than the fraction $3/12$. Students at the lower end often default to "large number divided by small number."

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A ($-\frac{1}{4}$):** Caught by the correct division order but a sign error.
*   **B ($4$):** Caught by the division order error ($12 \div 3$) and usually a sign error that cancels out (thinking $12d = -3$ then $d = -4$, then losing the minus).
*   **C ($-4$):** Caught by the division order error ($12 \div 3$) and correctly moving the 3 over to get a positive, then somehow ending up with a negative (or vice-versa).
*   **D ($\frac{1}{4}$):** The correct answer.
