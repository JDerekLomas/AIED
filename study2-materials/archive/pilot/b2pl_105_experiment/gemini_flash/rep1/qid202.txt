As an experienced teacher, I evaluate this specific question as being on the "easier" end of adding mixed numbers because it does not require finding a common denominator (both are 5ths) and does not involve "bridging" or regrouping (the sum of the fractions $1/5 + 2/5$ is less than 1).

The primary challenges here are the instructional constraint ("Leave your answer as a mixed number") and the classic fraction misconception of adding the denominators.

*   **Option A** is the correct mixed number.
*   **Option B** is numerically correct ($18/5$) but is an improper fraction, violating the specific instruction to provide a mixed number. Higher-ability students rarely miss this, but basic-level students often convert to improper fractions to add and forget to convert back.
*   **Option C** is a "double error": adding the numerators and denominators while ignoring the whole numbers ($3/10$) and then perhaps multiplying the whole numbers or miscalculating.
*   **Option D** is the most common misconception: adding the whole numbers correctly ($2+1=3$) and the numerators correctly ($1+2=3$), but adding the denominators ($5+5=10$).

The straightforward nature of the numbers (no carrying required) means that proficient and advanced students will find this very simple, while lower-ability students will likely split between the correct answer and the denominator-adding trap.

below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=65% B=10% C=5% D=20%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=97% B=2% C=0% D=1%
