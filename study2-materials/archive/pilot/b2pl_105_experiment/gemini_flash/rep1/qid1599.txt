This question tests a student's ability to translate division into fraction notation, specifically dealing with a bracketed expression as a denominator. 

The main hurdle here is identifying that the bracketed expression $(h+4)$ must stay together as a single entity under the fraction bar. 
- **Option D** is the most common conceptual error (reversing the dividend and divisor).
- **Option C** is a classic notation error where students forget that the vinculum (fraction bar) acts as a grouping symbol for the entire expression.
- **Option B** is a distractor for students who lack confidence and think the numerator needs to "match" the complexity of the denominator.

This specific question is relatively straightforward for "Proficient" students because the bracket in the prompt clearly demarcates the denominator. Without the brackets, i.e., $c \div h + 4$, the question would be significantly more difficult (BIDMAS/BODMAS error), but here the structure strongly guides the student toward the correct visual arrangement.
