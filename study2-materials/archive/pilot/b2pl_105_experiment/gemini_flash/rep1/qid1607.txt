In this question, the student is asked to evaluate a two-step algebraic process. Step 1 is correct ($15 \times 4 = 60$). Step 2 contains a very common "inverse operation" error: to isolate $k$, Isaac should subtract 1 from 60, but instead, he adds 1.

For **below-basic** students, many struggle to recognize the multiplication in Step 1 or fail to spot the sign error in Step 2, often leading them to guess C because the numbers "look" right. **Basic** students usually understand Step 1 but are highly susceptible to the "doing the same thing to both sides" error in Step 2 (thinking $+1$ balances the $+1$ already there). **Proficient** students are usually the most likely to select A, as they can check the logic of each step independently. **Advanced** students rarely miss this, though a tiny percentage might misread the question as asking for the final answer rather than evaluating the steps.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=50% D=15%
basic: A=45% B=10% C=40% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=3% C=10% D=2%
advanced: A=97% B=1% C=1% D=1%
