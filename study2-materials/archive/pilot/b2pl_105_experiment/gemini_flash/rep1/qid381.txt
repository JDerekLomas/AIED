In this question, the presence of the fraction $\frac{1}{2}$ is the primary hurdle. Students who struggle with rearranging formulae often find "un-doing" a fraction counter-intuitive. 

A common error is Option C, where students move both the $2$ and the $b$ to the denominator together without realizing that "dividing by a half" is equivalent to "multiplying by 2." Option A is a "formula soup" error where students simply swap variables around without algebraic logic. Option D acts as a distractor for those who get stuck on the fraction and lose confidence.

The "Proficient" group (Grade 5/6) generally handles one-step rearrangements well but can still be tripped up by the reciprocal nature of the $2$.
