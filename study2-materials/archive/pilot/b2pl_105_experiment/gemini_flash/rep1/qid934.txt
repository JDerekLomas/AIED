As an experienced teacher, I’ve found that the primary challenge of this question isn't the difficulty of the arithmetic, but the **structure of the equation**. 

Most UK students at GCSE level are accustomed to tables of values for equations in the form $y = mx + c$. When presented with an implicit form ($4x + 2y = 10$), "Below Basic" and "Basic" students often try to perform a single operation rather than a multi-step substitution.

**Common Traps for this specific question:**
1.  **C (5):** This is the most common answer. Students see $x=0$, ignore the $4x$ term, and simply look at $2y = 10$, correctly solving it. However, many students get here by simply ignoring the $x$ entirely and dividing the constant by the coefficient of $y$.
2.  **A (20):** Students who think they need to multiply $4 \times 5$ or confuse the relationship.
3.  **D (2.5):** Students who divide 10 by 4 instead of by 2, or who confuse the $x$ and $y$ coefficients.
4.  **B (3):** Often a "distractor" for students who try to mentally solve for $x=1$ instead of $x=0$.

The value $x=0$ actually makes this question easier than if $x$ were any other number, as it "hides" the $4x$ term. Therefore, even proficient students will find this relatively straightforward compared to finding the value for $x=1$.
