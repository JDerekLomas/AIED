In this question, students are being asked to link a visual representation (cups and counters) to an algebraic process. 

The image clearly shows the balance method in action:
1. **Step 1:** $x + 4 = 2x + 2$
2. **Step 2:** One cup has been removed from both sides, leaving $4 = x + 2$.
3. **Step 3:** Two counters have been removed from both sides, leaving $2 = x$ (or $x = 2$).

**The Difficulty & Distractors:**
*   **The correct answer (A)** identifies the starting equation and jumps to the final result, which is consistent with the final step of the diagram.
*   **The most common error (C and D)** involves students "simplifying" the first equation incorrectly by adding all the terms together on one side (e.g., $x + 2x$ becomes $3x$, and $4+2$ becomes $6$). 
*   **Advanced students** will recognize the logical progression and notice that only A matches the numerical solution shown in Step 3 ($x=2$).
*   **Lower ability students** often struggle with the "equals" sign and tend to "collect everything" into a single expression, leading them heavily toward D.

Here is the predicted distribution:
