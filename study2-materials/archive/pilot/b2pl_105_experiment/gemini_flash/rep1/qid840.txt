As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on common classroom observations and student performance on algebraic manipulation.

**Analysis:**
This question is a subtle trap. Many students believe they "know" how to solve equations but perform "partial operations" or incorrect divisions.
1.  **Tom's logic:** He has likely divided both sides by 5 (incorrectly thinking $40 \div 5 = 8$) or multiplied by 5 but forgot to multiply the right side ($8x = 40 \times 5 = 200$, not 8). Tom's error is common for those who confuse inverse operations.
2.  **Katie's logic:** She has divided both sides by 8. $8x \div 8 = x$, and $40 \div 8 = 5$. This is mathematically sound.
3.  **The Trap:** Many students at the "basic" or "below basic" level see the numbers 8, 5, and 40 and instinctively feel that $8 \times 5 = 40$, which makes Tom's $8x = 8$ look "right" to a glancing eye because of the factor family. Students often pick "Both" because they assume there are always two ways to solve a problem in these types of questions.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=15% D=5%
advanced: A=2% B=95% C=2% D=1%
