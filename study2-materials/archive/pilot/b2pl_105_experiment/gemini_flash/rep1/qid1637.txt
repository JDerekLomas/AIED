To predict the performance on this question, we must look at the specific steps required:
1.  **Subtract 1 from all three parts:** $-3 - 1 < 2x < 7 - 1 \Rightarrow -4 < 2x < 6$.
2.  **Divide by 2:** $-2 < x < 3$.

**Analysis of Errors:**
*   **The "One-Sider" Error:** Students often apply the operation to the right side but forget the left. If they only do $7-1=6$ and $6 \div 2 = 3$, they look for an inequality ending in $<3$, which keeps A and B in play.
*   **Addition instead of Subtraction:** Option D $(-5 < x < 15)$ comes from adding 1 and then multiplying by 2 (doing the inverse of the operations incorrectly).
*   **The Divide-then-Subtract Error (B):** Some students might try to divide by 2 first but fail to divide the $+1$. If they do $(-3 + 1)/2 = -1$ or simply subtract $1$ only from the middle and then do some faulty division, B is a common "guessed" boundary. 
*   **The Halving Error (C):** Students see the numbers 3, 2, 1, 7 and try to manipulate them into decimals, often by dividing the 1 and the 5.

This is a standard multi-step inequality. Lower-ability students struggle with the three-part nature of the expression. Proficient students usually handle the "do it to all sides" rule well, while Advanced students find this trivial.
