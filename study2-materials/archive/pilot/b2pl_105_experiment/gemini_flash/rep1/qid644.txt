As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've analyzed this specific question on expanding brackets. 

This question targets a very specific stage of the FOIL/Grid method: the "Last" terms. The primary "traps" here are the sign rule (negative multiplied by a negative) and the operation confusion (adding instead of multiplying). Because the numbers are small (1 and 4), the confusion between multiplication ($1 \times 4 = 4$) and addition ($1 + 4 = 5$) is a classic "Basic" level error. Students at lower levels frequently forget that "expanding" always implies multiplication, or they struggle to handle two negative signs simultaneously.

Here is my prediction of the performance across ability levels:

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=45% B=20% C=10% D=25%
proficient: A=80% B=10% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=0% D=1%
