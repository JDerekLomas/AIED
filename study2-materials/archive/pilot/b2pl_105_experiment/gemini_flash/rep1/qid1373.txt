This question is a classic diagnostic for directed numbers (negatives) combined with algebraic expansion. The specific difficulty here lies in the second term: multiplying $-3$ by $-2$. 

While $m \times -3$ is usually handled correctly (resulting in $-3m$), the transition to $+6$ is where the majority of errors occur. Option B is the most common "distractor" because students remember to multiply the numbers ($3 \times 2 = 6$) but either forget to multiply the signs or assume the sign inside the bracket stays the same. Options A and C attract students who struggle with the very first term or lose the negative sign entirely.

For **below_basic** students, the negative sign is often ignored entirely or handled inconsistently, leading to a near-even spread among the distractors. **Basic** students often get the $-3m$ correct but consistently fail the $-3 \times -2$ part. **Proficient** students usually navigate this well but can still make a "slip" under time pressure. **Advanced** students should find this trivial.

below_basic: A=20% B=35% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=15% C=5% D=75%
advanced: A=1% B=4% C=0% D=95%
