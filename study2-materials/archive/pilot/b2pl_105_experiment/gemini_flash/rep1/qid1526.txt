To predict the performance on this question, we must analyze the specific fractions: $\frac{3}{5}$ and $\frac{2}{7}$.

**Key factors:**
1.  **The "Add across" error (C):** The most common mistake in fraction addition is adding the numerators ($3+2=5$) and denominators ($5+7=12$). Option C ($5/12$) is the "classic" distractor for low-ability students.
2.  **The subtraction error (A):** Students who know they need a common denominator (35) but use subtraction instead of addition ($21-10=11$ instead of $21+10=31$) will choose A. 
3.  **Partial method (D):** Students who find the common denominator but only add the original numerators ($3+2=5$) will choose D.
4.  **The Correct Path (B):** Requires multiplying to a common denominator ($\frac{21}{35} + \frac{10}{35} = \frac{31}{35}$). 

Lower-ability students (Below Basic) are highly likely to go for Option C because it requires the least cognitive effort. Mid-ability (Basic/Proficient) students will recognise the need for 35 as a denominator but often make errors in cross-multiplication or operation choice.

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=60% D=10%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=30% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0% D=1%
