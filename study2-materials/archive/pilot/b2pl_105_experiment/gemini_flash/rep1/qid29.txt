This linear inequality is a classic discriminator for students at GCSE level. The primary hurdle is the combination of variable manipulation and directed numbers. 

**Analysis:**
1. **The Variable Placement:** Unlike many basic examples, $n$ appears on both sides. Most students prefer to move the smaller number of $n$s ($2n$) to the right to keep the coefficient positive ($3n - 2n = n$), resulting in $10 \leq n$.
2. **The Major Distractor (Option C):** Students who subtract $3n$ from both sides get $-n + 3 \leq -7$. This leads to $-n \leq -10$. A common error here is failing to flip the inequality sign when dividing by $-1$, resulting in $n \leq 10$. Even students who keep the $n$ on the right side sometimes mentally flip the inequality sign because they are accustomed to seeing $n$ on the left, leading them to pick C.
3. **The Addition Error (Option A):** Students who subtract $3$ from both sides correctly but then "collect" the terms incorrectly (e.g., $3 - 7 = -4$ and then dividing by something or miscounting) or simply subtracting $3n - 2n = n$ and then $3-5=2$ might end up with A.
4. **Direct Arithmetic (Option D):** Students who incorrectly subtract $7$ from $3$ rather than adding $7$ to $3$.

**Predicted Statistics:**

below_basic: A=20% B=25% C=45% D=10%
*Lower ability students struggle with the inequality sign direction. They often treat it like an equals sign and pick C because "n being smaller than a positive 10" looks more "natural" to them than a greater-than relationship.*

basic: A=10% B=45% C=35% D=10%
*These students can do the algebra but frequently forget to flip the sign if they move the variables to the left, or they get confused when the variable ends up on the right (10 $\leq$ n).*

proficient: A=5% B=75% C=15% D=5%
*Proficient students usually handle directed numbers well and have been taught the trick of moving $n$ to the side where it will be positive. C remains a trap for those who work too quickly.*

advanced: A=1% B=95% C=3% D=1%
*High-achievers rarely make mistakes on linear inequalities unless they make a very hasty mental arithmetic slip.*
