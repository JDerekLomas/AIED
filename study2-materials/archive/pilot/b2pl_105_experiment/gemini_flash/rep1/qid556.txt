In this question, students must identify the inverse operation used to transition from $9y$ to $y$. This is a foundational algebraic concept. 

The most common error in this specific context is students choosing subtraction (D) because they see the "9" being removed and instinctively think "take away 9," a mistake very common at the below-basic and basic levels. Option A ($+9$) is rarely chosen except as a random guess. Option B ($\times 9$) is a common error for students who associate the presence of a 9 with multiplication but fail to realise they need the *inverse* operation to solve the equation.

However, because this is a standard "one-step" identification, the success rate is generally high for students who have begun formal algebra. The "star" notation is intuitive enough that it doesn't add much cognitive load.

below_basic: A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=15% C=65% D=15%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=88% D=5%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=97% D=1%
