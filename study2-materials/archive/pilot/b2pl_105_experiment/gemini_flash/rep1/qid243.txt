To predict student performance on this question, we must look at the specific mechanics of the inequality $3n + 2 \geq 4n - 5$.

The most common "safe" route for students is to move $3n$ to the right to keep the $n$ coefficient positive, resulting in $7 \geq n$ (Option C). However, the standard "left-hand side" habit leads many to subtract $4n$ from $3n$, resulting in $-n + 2 \geq -5 \rightarrow -n \geq -7$. This triggers the classic "inequality flip" trap. Students who forget to flip the sign when dividing by $-1$ will arrive at $n \geq 7$ (Option D).

Option B is a common arithmetic error where students subtract 2 from -5 but treat the -5 as 5 (i.e., $5-2=3, 3n-4n=-1n \rightarrow -n=3$). Option A is a basic sign error ($2 + (-5) = -3$).

**Key challenges for this specific question:**
1. **The Negative $n$ coefficient:** This is the primary separator between "proficient" and "advanced" students.
2. **The "Variable on the Right" format:** Students often struggle to read $7 \geq n$ as "n is less than or equal to 7".
3. **Subtraction with negatives:** The $-5 - 2$ or $2 - (-5)$ step is a frequent source of basic arithmetic slips.
