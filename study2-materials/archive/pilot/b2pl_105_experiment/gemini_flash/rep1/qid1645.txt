As an experienced teacher, here is my analysis of this question:

The primary challenge here is the multi-step nature of the rearrangement. The steps are: subtract 9 ($3p^2 = 30$), divide by 3 ($p^2 = 10$), and then take the square root. 

**Key Distractors:**
*   **Option B** is the correct mathematical path ($p = \pm\sqrt{10}$).
*   **Option C** is a common "error of convenience." Students who get to $3p^2 = 30$ might mistakenly see "3" and "30" and subconsciously lean towards the number 10, then divide by 5 or do mental arithmetic errors to arrive at 2. However, more likely, they subtract 3 then divide by 9, or perform other common inverse operation errors.
*   **Option D** ($p = \pm4$) is the result of subtracting 9 to get 30, but then miscalculating the division or thinking $30/3$ is roughly something they can square root into an integer.
*   **Option A** is a "variable trap." It uses $n$ instead of $p$, and $5^2$ is 25, which doesn't fit the equation, but it tests students who aren't looking at the variable name or the numbers closely.

This specific question is harder than usual because the result is an irrational number ($\sqrt{10}$). Many lower-ability students assume a GCSE-style "solve" question must result in an integer. When they see $p^2 = 10$, they often assume they've made a mistake and "force" the answer to a nearby integer like 3 or 4.
