As an experienced UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as a test of the **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)** within an algebraic context. 

The primary difficulty here is not the algebra itself, but the linguistic interpretation of the operations. Students who struggle with the hierarchy of operations often read expressions from left to right. Therefore, a student might see "$3 + a$" first and assume that addition happens before the multiplication. 

**Option A** is the correct interpretation.
**Option B** is a common mistake for students who don't recognise that $ab$ implies multiplication, or who confuse $ab$ with $a+b$.
**Option C** is the classic "left-to-right" error, where students perform the addition $3+a$ before multiplying by $b$.
**Option D** is less common but appeals to students who apply the addition to the term closest to the '+' sign ($3+b$) and then apply the variable $a$.

At the **Below Basic** level, many students find $ab$ confusing and frequently default to reading left-to-right, making C very attractive. At **Proficient** and **Advanced** levels, the convention that multiplication precedes addition is well-drilled, making this a relatively high-success question.

below_basic: A=35% B=20% C=35% D=10%
basic: A=65% B=10% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=88% B=2% C=8% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
