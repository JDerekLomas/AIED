In this question, the presence of the minus sign at the start of the expression acts as a "magnet" for lower-ability students, who naturally want to read and calculate from left to right. However, the inclusion of an exponent ($6^3$) often flags "BIDMAS/BODMAS" in the minds of middle-ability students more effectively than a standard multiplication would.

The most common error for Basic and Below Basic students will be choosing "8-7" because it is the first operation encountered. Option B is less likely to be chosen because the division $7 \div 6$ looks "messy" to a student, discouraging them from picking it. Option A will be correctly identified by anyone who has internalized that Indices (Exponents) come before Division and Subtraction.

below_basic: A=30% B=15% C=50% D=5%
basic: A=55% B=10% C=30% D=5%
proficient: A=85% B=5% C=8% D=2%
advanced: A=98% B=1% C=1% D=0%
