This is a classic "squared bracket" question that serves as a primary litmus test for algebraic fluency in UK classrooms (typically Years 9-11). 

The primary hurdle here is the "freshman's dream" misconception—the tendency to simply square the individual terms ($x^2$ and $3^2$) while forgetting the middle term generated by the distributive law (FOIL). For students who do remember the middle term, the second hurdle is the directed number rule: $(-3) \times (-3) = +9$. 

**Breakdown of choices:**
*   **B & C:** These represent the most common error: failing to expand the bracket as $(x-3)(x-3)$. 
*   **A:** This catches students who understand the middle term ($x \times -3 \times 2 = -6x$) but fail the final step of multiplying two negatives.
*   **D:** The correct answer.

Here is the predicted performance across ability levels:
