This question tests the ability to translate compound worded operations into formal algebraic notation, specifically focusing on the correct use of grouping (order of operations).

The primary trap here is the difference between A and B. Students often translate "left to right" without considering BIDMAS/fractional notation. "Take away six and then divide" implies $(n-6)$ happens first. Option B is a common literal translation that ignores the order of operations, as $n - 6 \div 3$ would technically mean $n - 2$. Option D is a reversal of the steps, and Option C confuses the inverse operation.

**Below Basic:** Students at this level often translate words to symbols linearly. They are very likely to choose B because it follows the exact sequence of the sentence ("n", "minus 6", "divide 3") without understanding that the vinculum in option A acts as a grouping symbol.
**Basic:** These students are starting to recognise fractional notation but are still highly susceptible to the linear trap of B or the "inverse operation" confusion in C (thinking they need to do the opposite to solve it immediately).
**Proficient:** Most students here understand that "the result" implies a bracket or a fraction bar covering the whole expression. However, a small percentage will still lapse into the linear reading of B.
**Advanced:** These students recognise the structure immediately and understand that A is the only mathematically correct representation of the described sequence.

below_basic: A=25% B=45% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
proficient: A=75% B=15% C=5% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=3% C=1% D=1%
