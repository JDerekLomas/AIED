As an experienced teacher, I’ve seen this specific type of question many times. On the surface, it tests expanding brackets, but it is actually a pure "negative numbers" diagnostic question.

The core difficulty here is not the algebra (the arrows explicitly tell them which terms to multiply); it is the "double negative" rule. 
*   **Option A (-10)** is the most common error for students with weak arithmetic foundations, as they add $-8$ and $-2$ instead of multiplying them.
*   **Option C (-6)** is for students who confuse addition and subtraction rules ($ -8 + 2$).
*   **Option D (-16)** is the most dangerous trap for mid-range students: they know $8 \times 2 = 16$, and they have a lingering misconception that "a negative in the question means a negative in the answer," failing to apply the "negative times a negative equals a positive" rule.

**Performance Prediction:**

**below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=15% D=25%**
*At this level, students often ignore the instruction to "multiply" and simply perform an additive operation on the two numbers they see. A is a very high-probability distractor here.*

**basic: A=25% B=35% C=5% D=35%**
*Students here know they should multiply, but the "sign rule" is inconsistent. Many will pick -16 because it "feels" like a negative problem.*

**proficient: A=10% B=70% C=2% D=18%**
*Most students at this level have the $(- ) \times (-) = (+)$ rule drilled into them. The main source of error is rushing and seeing the two minus signs and defaulting to a negative result.*

**advanced: A=2% B=95% C=1% D=2%**
*High-ability students will find this trivial. The only errors here would be from extreme carelessness.*
