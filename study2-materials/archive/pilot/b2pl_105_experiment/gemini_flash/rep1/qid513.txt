This question tests a student's ability to identify errors in the algebraic manipulation of a two-step equation. 

**Analysis of the Steps:**
*   **Step 1:** $15 = 2p - 4$ becomes $11 = 2p$. This is a classic "inverse operation" error. To move $-4$, Isaac should have added $4$ to both sides ($15 + 4 = 19$). Instead, he subtracted 4 from 15 ($15 - 4 = 11$). This is a very common mistake for lower-ability students.
*   **Step 2:** $11 = 2p$ becomes $22 = p$. Again, an inverse operation error. To isolate $p$, he should have divided by 2 ($11 \div 2 = 5.5$). Instead, he multiplied 11 by 2.

**Teacher's Perspective:**
Lower-ability students (Below Basic/Basic) often associate specific words or layouts with "doing the opposite" but get the direction wrong. They see a "$- 4$" and a "$15$" and instinctively reach for $11$ without processing the balance of the equation. However, because both steps are so fundamentally flawed, many students in the "Proficient" category will easily spot that neither looks like the algebra they have been taught. The "trap" here is that Step 2 follows a logical (though incorrect) doubling, which might lead some students to think Step 2 is correct in isolation, though the question asks which steps are correct mathematically.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=25% B=20% C=15% D=40%
basic: A=20% B=15% C=10% D=55%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=5% D=80%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=1% D=96%
