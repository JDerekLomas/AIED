As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as a medium-difficulty rearrangement task typical of Higher Tier GCSE or early A-Level (Physics/Maths).

The main hurdle here is the order of operations in reverse. Students must first divide by $r$ and then take the square root. The most common error is forgetting to "divide first," followed by confusion over whether the square root covers the whole fraction or just the numerator.

**Analysis of distractions:**
*   **A ($r F^2$):** A "random" manipulation seen in students who don't understand inverse operations and just swap symbols.
*   **C ($\sqrt{r F}$):** A very common mistake where students assume multiplication is the only relationship or forget how to isolate the squared term.
*   **D ($\frac{\sqrt{F}}{r}$):** The classic "incomplete root" or "wrong order" error where students square root before dividing or fail to extend the radical.

**Predicted Performance:**

basic: A=10% B=45% C=25% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=75% C=10% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=2% D=2%
