In this question, students are required to substitute $x=0$ into the linear equation $3x + 2y = 6$. While the equation is not in the "standard" $y = mx + c$ form, the substitution $x=0$ is generally the easiest point to find as it eliminates the $x$ term entirely, leaving $2y = 6$.

The primary distractors are:
- **B (2):** Students who confuse the coefficient of $x$ (3) with the answer, or solve $3y = 6$.
- **C (1.5):** Students who try to divide 6 by 4 (total terms) or subtract 3 and 2 incorrectly.
- **D (12):** Students who add the coefficients ($3+2+6$) or make a basic calculation error.

Because $x=0$ is such a common starting point in table-of-values questions, even middle-ability students tend to handle this specific cell well, even if they would struggle with $x=1$ (which results in a fraction).
