This question tests the reciprocal property of fractions and the rules for multiplying signed numbers. The common pitfalls here are failing to account for the negative sign required to make the product positive 1, or confusing the reciprocal with the original fraction.

*   **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with fractions and negatives simultaneously. Many will pick A (the reciprocal) but forget the sign, or pick C because they see the "opposite" of the original fraction.
*   **Basic:** Students at this level usually know that a fraction multiplied by its reciprocal equals 1. However, many will forget that negative $\times$ negative = positive. They will likely see the $-1$ and instinctively choose A because it results in $-\frac{12}{12}=-1$. This is a very common "trap" for this specific question because the target product is $-1$, not $+1$.
*   **Proficient:** These students generally navigate the negative signs well. They will check the calculation: $(-\frac{3}{4}) \times (\frac{4}{3}) = -1$. They are less likely to choose B because they will recognize that two negatives would result in a positive 1.
*   **Advanced:** These students will solve this almost instantly, performing the mental check and correctly identifying that a positive reciprocal is required to maintain the negative sign in the product.
