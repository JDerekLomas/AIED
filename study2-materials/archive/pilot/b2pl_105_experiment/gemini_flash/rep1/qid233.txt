This question tests three distinct skills: understanding that the fraction bar represents division, the convention of omitting the multiplication symbol ($ab$), and the priority of operations (BIDMAS) within algebraic notation.

**Analysis for the Teacher:**
*   **The Trap (A):** Students with a weak grasp of "brackets first" or the "fraction bar as a grouping symbol" often see $2 \div 3$ as one isolated chunk and $+ ab$ as another. Option A is a common error for those who don't realize the entire denominator must be below the line.
*   **The Distractor (D):** This tests the definition of "algebraic convention." While mathematically equivalent to C, the inclusion of the $\times$ sign violates standard notation. Students often pick this if they are hesitant about $ab$ meaning $a \times b$.
*   **The Conceptual Error (B):** This targets students who overcomplicate the expression or incorrectly apply the distributive law (trying to factorise when there is no common factor).
*   **Success (C):** The correct answer requires recognising $ab$ is the same as $a \times b$ and that the division symbol applies to the entire parenthetical expression.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student performance:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=10% C=45% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=95% D=3%
