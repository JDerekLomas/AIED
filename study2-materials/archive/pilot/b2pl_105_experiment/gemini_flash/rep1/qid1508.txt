This question tests the standard Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). The correct procedure is to perform the division ($6 \div 2 = 3$) first, then addition from left to right ($3 + 3 + 1 = 7$).

The primary distractor here is the "linear" error, where students simply work from left to right ($3+6=9$; $9 \div 2=4.5$; $4.5+1=5.5$). Another common error is "Addition before Division," where students group the addition terms first (either $3+6$ or $2+1$) before dividing. This specific question is slightly "easier" than some order of operation problems because the correct answer (7) is a whole number, whereas the most common misconception (5.5) involves a decimal, which often makes students pause and rethink.

However, many students still cling to left-to-right processing, and a subset of lower-ability students will add the final $2+1$ first, leading to $9 \div 3 = 3$.
