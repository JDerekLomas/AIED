This question is a classic "sign error" trap that focuses on the final step of solving an equation. While the context is simultaneous equations, the task is a simple one-step linear equation.

The primary difficulty here is the negative coefficient of $y$. Students at lower ability levels often perform "subtraction by instinct" ($5 - 3 = 2$) or "addition by instinct" ($5 + 3 = 8$), completely ignoring the operational sign attached to the $y$. 

*   **Option A ($y=2$)** is the most common distractor. Students see the 3 and the 5 and assume the difference is 2, failing to check if $3 - 2$ actually equals 5.
*   **Option C ($y=8$)** appeals to students who move the 3 to the other side but incorrectly add it, or who think "3 plus what equals 5, oh wait, it must be more because of the minus sign."
*   **Option B** is correct, but requires the student to handle the negative sign correctly, either by adding $y$ to the right and subtracting 5 from the left, or by subtracting 3 and then dividing by -1.
