This question is a classic test of three distinct skills: identifying roots from intercepts, understanding the distributive property of signs, and recognising the orientation (shape) of a quadratic graph.

The graph has roots at $x = -5$ and $x = 1$. This implies factors of $(x + 5)$ and $(x - 1)$. Crucially, the parabola is an $n$-shape (negative quadratic), meaning the coefficient of $x^2$ must be negative. 

Many students at lower ability levels correctly identify that 1 and 5 are involved but struggle with the signs inside the brackets. **Option C** is the most common "trap" for mid-level students; they see the roots $1$ and $-5$ and correctly identify $(x-1)(x+5)$ as the factors, but fail to notice that this equation would produce a $u$-shaped (positive) graph. **Option A** is the correct answer because $(1-x)$ is equivalent to $-(x-1)$, which provides the necessary negative $x^2$ term while maintaining the root at $x=1$.
