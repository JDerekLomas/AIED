This question specifically tests the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). While it seems straightforward, it contains a classic "left-to-right" trap and an "addition before subtraction" trap (caused by the acronym itself).

For this specific question, the presence of the multiplication sign in the middle is a strong visual cue for many. However, "Below Basic" students almost exclusively read left-to-right. "Basic" level students often remember the BIDMAS acronym but mistakenly believe Addition must come before Subtraction (affecting the final calculation, though this question only asks for the *first* step). The most common error for students who know a rule exists but haven't mastered it is following the linear order of the expression.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **C (Correct):** Multiplication takes precedence.
*   **B (Left-to-right):** The most common error for students who don't apply BIDMAS.
*   **A (End-loading):** Often chosen by students who think Addition always comes before Subtraction because 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym.
*   **D (Misconception):** Rarely chosen except by those guessing.

The simplicity of the numbers (8, 7, 6, 10) means the arithmetic doesn't distract from the logic, making the "order of operations" the sole barrier.

below_basic: A=15% B=60% C=20% D=5%
basic: A=20% B=25% C=50% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=88% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=97% D=1%
