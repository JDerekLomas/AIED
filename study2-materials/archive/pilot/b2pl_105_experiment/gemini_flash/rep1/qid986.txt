As a UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question by looking at the specific algebraic manipulations involved. 

The equation is $\frac{x-6}{2}=10$.
*   **Tom's logic:** He adds 6 to both sides first. However, the $-6$ is part of the numerator. To do this correctly, one would have to add $6$ to $10$, but because the $6$ is divided by $2$, the term is effectively $-3$. Tom has correctly identified the inverse operation (addition) but failed to account for the grouping of the fraction bar. This is a very common "mid-level" error.
*   **Katie's logic:** She tries to multiply by $2$ to clear the denominator. However, she has divided the $10$ by $2$ to get $5$ instead of multiplying it to get $20$. This is a classic "operation confusion" error.

**Student Behavior Analysis:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will see "Only Tom" as correct because adding 6 to 10 to get 16 "feels" like a standard first step in solving equations. They often ignore the denominator entirely.
*   **Basic/Proficient:** These students often know they need to "undo" the divide by 2 first. Katie looks right to them because she removed the fraction, but many won't spot that she divided 10 by 2 instead of multiplying. 
*   **Advanced:** These students will recognise that Tom's next line should be $x-6=20$ or $\frac{x}{2} - 3 = 10 \rightarrow \frac{x}{2} = 13$. They will see both are incorrect.

The "trap" here is that both students perform an operation that looks "maths-y" but apply it incorrectly to the RHS.

below_basic: A=45% B=25% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=35% B=30% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=20% B=20% C=10% D=50%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=2% D=88%
