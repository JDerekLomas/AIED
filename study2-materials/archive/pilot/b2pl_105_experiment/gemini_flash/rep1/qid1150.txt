In this rearrangement question, the two steps involved are multiplication and finding the square root. For many UK students (KS4/GCSE), the most common error in this specific algebraic structure is correctly identifying which operation comes first or failing to apply the square root to the entire product. 

Option B is a common "blind" manipulation error where students move $r$ to the denominator instead of the numerator. Option D represents a misunderstanding of how the square root interacts with the product. Option C is the correct rearrangement. This is a standard question found in Foundation (Higher tier) or early Higher tier papers; it is generally considered a "standard" difficulty level because there are no negative signs or complex fractions.
