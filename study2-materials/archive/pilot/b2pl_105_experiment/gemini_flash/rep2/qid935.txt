This question tests a student's ability to substitute a known value into a linear equation and solve for a variable involving negative numbers. 

The primary difficulty here isn't the simultaneous equation context (which is a distractor), but the manipulation of the negative sign in $2j - 8 = -10$. Students often struggle with "adding 8" to "-10", with many mistakenly arriving at $-18$ or $+18$ (leading to $j = -9$ or $j = 9$). Option D ($j = -1$) is the correct answer. Option A ($j=1$) is a common error for students who ignore the negative signs entirely.
