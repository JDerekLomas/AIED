This question is a classic test of three distinct skills: identifying roots from intercepts, understanding the distributive property of the negative sign in factored form, and identifying the shape (concavity) of a quadratic.

The potential for error here is high because the "standard" way students are taught to write roots at $(-5, 0)$ and $(1, 0)$ is $(x+5)(x-1)$. However, this yields a positive $x^2$ (a U-shape). To get the negative $n$-shape, the sign of one bracket must be reversed. Option A accomplishes this by writing $(1-x)$ instead of $(x-1)$. Many students will gravitate towards C or D because they look like the "standard" formulaic way of writing roots.

**below_basic:** Students at this level often struggle with the sign change between coordinates and factors. They might see "1" and "5" and pick D simply because the numbers appear without considering the negative sign on the -5. They often ignore the "n-shape" entirely.

**basic:** These students know that $-5$ means $(x+5)$ must be a factor, which usually narrows it down to A or C. However, they frequently overlook the orientation (negative $x^2$) or assume that because the graph is negative, the signs inside the brackets should be negative, leading them to C.

**proficient:** These students check the roots and the shape. They will identify that $(x+5)$ and $(x-1)$ are the standard factors, but notice the graph is an $n$-shape. They are capable of realizing that $(1-x)$ is the same as $-(x-1)$, making A the correct choice. Some may still fall for the visual "neatness" of C.

**advanced:** These students will quickly verify the roots ($x=1, x=-5$) and check the $x^2$ coefficient by expanding mentally: $-x \times x = -x^2$. They are unlikely to be tricked by the unconventional ordering in Option A.

below_basic: A=15% B=25% C=30% D=30%
basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=70% B=5% C=20% D=5%
advanced: A=95% B=1% C=3% D=1%
