This question tests three distinct skills: understanding that the fraction bar represents division, the convention of omitting the multiplication symbol ($ab$ instead of $a \times b$), and the order of operations (BIDMAS) within an expression.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **Option A:** This is the most common error for students who read left-to-right or misunderstand the scope of the division bar. They apply the division only to the first term ($2/3$) and then add the product.
*   **Option B:** This captures students who are trying to apply a "look" of algebra (using parentheses) but completely misunderstand the distributive law or the relationship between the terms.
*   **Option D:** This is technically correct in terms of order of operations, but the question asks for the "correct algebraic convention," which requires the removal of the $\times$ sign. This catches students who understand the structure but haven't mastered notation.

**Student Performance Predictions:**
*   **Below Basic:** Many will be drawn to A because it "looks" like the left-to-right order they are used to in basic arithmetic.
*   **Basic:** Students at this level often know that $ab$ is preferred over $a \times b$, but they struggle with the hierarchy of the denominator. They may fluctuate between C and D, or choose A if they are weak on BIDMAS.
*   **Proficient:** These students generally understand that everything after the $\div$ symbol in a bracketed expression must go into the denominator. The main hurdle here is choosing between C and D; most will correctly identify that omitting the $\times$ is the "standard convention."
*   **Advanced:** These students will identify C almost instantly, recognizing the structural equivalence.

below_basic: A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%
basic: A=25% B=10% C=45% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=75% D=10%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=95% D=2%
