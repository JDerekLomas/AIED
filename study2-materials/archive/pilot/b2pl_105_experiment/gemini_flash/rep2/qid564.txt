This specific question is a classic "sign error" trap. While expanding brackets is a fundamental skill, the combination of a negative multiplier and a negative term inside the bracket significantly increases the cognitive load for students.

**Breakdown of expected errors:**
*   **The Sign Error (Option B):** This is the most common mistake. Students successfully multiply -5 and $m$ to get $-5m$, and 5 and 7 to get 35, but they carry the minus sign from the bracket across without considering the negative multiplier (effectively doing $-5 \times 7$ instead of $-5 \times -7$).
*   **The Dropped Negative (Option D):** These students often "ignore" the leading negative or believe that the first term in an expansion should be positive by default.
*   **The Inverse Error (Option A):** This is rarer but seen in students who believe that multiplying a negative by a negative results in a positive, applying it incorrectly to both terms.
