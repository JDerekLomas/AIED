As an experienced UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question on quadratic graphs. 

**Analysis:**
The primary "trap" in this question is the confusion between $y$-intercepts and $x$-intercepts (roots). Students at the **below_basic** level often see the numbers -8 and -6 and mistakenly assume the intercepts are related to addition ($ -8 + -6 = -14$) or simply list the numbers with signs flipped, confusing them with the $x$-axis roots (Option B). 

Students at the **basic** level generally know that $y$-intercepts occur when $x=0$ and require multiplication (FOIL/expanding), but often struggle with the multiplication of two negative signs. **Option D** is a significant distractor here; students see the two negative signs in the brackets and instinctively feel the result should stay negative, or they perform the calculation $(-8) \times (-6)$ incorrectly. 

**Proficient** and **Advanced** students typically find this straightforward, though "silly mistakes" with negative numbers still occur occasionally at the proficient level.

Here is the predicted percentage distribution:

below_basic: A=25% B=35% C=15% D=25%
basic: A=10% B=20% C=40% D=30%
proficient: A=2% B=8% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=0% B=2% C=96% D=2%
