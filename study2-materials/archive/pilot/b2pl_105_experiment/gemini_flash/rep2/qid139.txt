As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've observed that this specific question targets a very common "clash" of rules in expanding brackets: the difference between multiplying and adding directed numbers.

**Key factors for this question:**
1. **The Operation:** The arrows indicate the final part of FOIL/expanding (Lasts). Students often mix up multiplication and addition rules here. 
2. **The "7" Trap:** $4 + 3 = 7$ is the most common error for students who revert to addition or are thinking about the middle term of the quadratic.
3. **The Sign:** $(-4) \times (-3)$ results in a positive. Many students remember "two minuses make a plus" but a significant number of basic/below-basic students will incorrectly decide it stays negative because "it's more negative."
4. **Distraction:** Option B ($ -12 $) is the primary trap for those who know to multiply but forget the sign rule. Option A ($ +7 $) is for those who add and apply the sign rule incorrectly.

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=25% B=25% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=30% C=45% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=15% C=75% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=4% C=94% D=1%
