As an experienced UK maths teacher, I’ve seen thousands of students tackle independent probability questions like this.

The difficulty in this specific question lies in whether students apply the **addition rule** or the **multiplication rule**.
*   **The Trap (A and C):** Students often see two spinners and instinctively add the total number of outcomes ($4 + 5 = 9$) to form the denominator. If they add the "1s" ($1 + 1 = 2$), they get **C**; if they just think about one success over the new sum, they get **A**.
*   **The Partial Understanding (D):** Students who correctly identify that there are 20 outcomes ($4 \times 5$) but mistakenly "add" the successful outcomes because they see two "1s" will choose $2/20$.
*   **The Correct Logic (B):** Multiplying the probabilities ($1/4 \times 1/5$) leads to $1/20$.

Because the numbers are small and the spinners are distinct, the "summing" misconception (Option A and C) is very common among students working at the lower end of the GCSE scale.

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%
proficient: A=5% B=85% C=2% D=8%
advanced: A=1% B=98% C=0% D=1%
