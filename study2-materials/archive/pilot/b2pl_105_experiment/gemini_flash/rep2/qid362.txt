This question specifically tests the ability to rearrange a linear equation from the form $ax + by = c$ into the gradient-intercept form $y = mx + c$. 

The common pitfalls here are:
1.  **Coefficient identification:** Simply looking at the number in front of $x$ without rearranging (leading to A or B).
2.  **Sign errors:** Moving the $4x$ term across the equals sign without changing the sign (leading to D).
3.  **Division errors:** Forgetting to divide the entire term by the coefficient of $y$.

For "below basic" students, the most common reflex is to simply pick the coefficient of $x$ as it appears in the equation. For "proficient" students, the move from $4x$ to $-4x$ is usually handled, but the division by 3 is where the errors occur. "Advanced" students almost always get this correct, though a small minority might make a sign slip during the division.

below_basic: A=20% B=45% C=15% D=20%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=30% D=30%
proficient: A=10% B=5% C=65% D=20%
advanced: A=2% B=1% C=94% D=3%
