This question is a classic test of "inverse operations." It specifically targets a common misunderstanding in Step 1 (incorrectly subtracting 4 from 15 instead of adding it) and Step 2 (incorrectly multiplying by 2 instead of dividing by 2).

The reason this question is particularly effective at catching students is that Step 2 "compensates" for the mistake in Step 1 in a way that feels logically consistent to a struggling student (if they think $2p$ means "half of $p$" or if they simply always perform the opposite operation of what they should). However, since Step 1 is the most common mistake (sign error when moving terms), option D is usually chosen by students who can solve it correctly themselves, while B or C are chosen by those with procedural confusion.

**Student Ability Levels Breakdown:**

*   **Below Basic:** Often struggle with basic two-step equations. They are likely to see "$-4$" and think they need to subtract it from 15 (leading to 11). They also frequently confuse whether to multiply or divide $2p$. Many will guess C because "it looks like math was done."
*   **Basic:** Usually familiar with the term "change the side, change the sign," but prone to applying it backward. They often see the 11 and think Step 1 is fine, but might spot the error in Step 2.
*   **Proficient:** These students generally know that $15 + 4 = 19$. They will immediately spot that Step 1 is incorrect. Most will correctly identify that both steps are wrong, though some might second-guess themselves and pick B if they think "Step 2" follows correctly from the *previous* incorrect line (which it doesn't).
*   **Advanced:** Will solve the equation mentally in seconds ($p = 9.5$), see that neither step matches their logic, and confidently choose D.
