This question is a significant "trap" for students across the UK's Foundation and lower Higher tiers. It tests three distinct skills simultaneously: understanding function notation, squaring decimals, and following the order of operations (BIDMAS).

The primary distractor is **C (1.8)**. Many students at the basic and proficient levels will incorrectly square the coefficient ($3$) first or simply compute $(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$. However, the most common error is multiplying $3 \times 0.3 = 0.9$ and then doubling it to get $1.8$ because they mistake the square symbol for a "multiply by 2" instruction.

Option **A (0.81)** catches those who perform the operation in the wrong order: $(3 \times 0.3)^2$.

Option **B (0.27)** is for those who square $0.3$ correctly ($0.09$) but then fail to multiply by $3$ or make a place value error, though it is less common than the mistake leading to D.

Option **D (2.7)** is the most common "near miss" error for those who correctly calculate $3 \times 0.09$ but misplace the decimal point, often confusing $0.3^2 = 0.9$ (the single most common decimal squaring error).
