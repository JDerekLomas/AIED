This question tests a student's understanding of the Commutative Property versus the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). 

Tom's statement ($3+2-1 = 4$ and $3-1+2 = 4$) is correct because addition and subtraction have equal priority and are associative when the sign stays with the number. However, many "below basic" and "basic" students have been taught the "A" before "S" rule literally, leading them to believe that changing the position of the subtraction relative to the addition is illegal. 

Katie's statement ($3+2 = 5$ and $2+3 = 5$) is a straightforward application of the commutative property of addition. Because the multiplication $2 \times 1$ is simple and yields $2$ in both cases, almost all students will see this as correct.

The most common trap here is for students to doubt Tom because they follow "BIDMAS" as a rigid left-to-right hierarchy where addition *must* happen before subtraction, leading them to pick B. 

below_basic: A=10% B=45% C=30% D=15%
basic: A=5% B=30% C=60% D=5%
proficient: A=2% B=15% C=81% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=4% C=94% D=1%
