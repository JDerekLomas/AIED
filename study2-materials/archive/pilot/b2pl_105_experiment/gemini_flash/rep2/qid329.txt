This question tests the priority of division over subtraction (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and the non-commutative property of subtraction. 

The presence of decimals ($0.1, 0.2, 0.3$) is a "distractor" designed to make the question look more difficult than a typical order of operations problem, potentially causing students to overthink the arithmetic rather than focusing on the structure of the expressions. 

Tom is correct because he correctly identifies that the division should be grouped, representing the order of operations. Katie is incorrect because she has swapped the terms around the subtraction sign ($a - b \neq b - a$), a common error for students who believe the order of terms doesn't matter or who are confused by "change the side, change the sign" rules in algebra.

**Below Basic:** Students in this category often struggle with the abstract nature of $\equiv$ and may guess randomly. Many will pick C because they see "maths-looking" rearrangements and assume both are valid "ways of writing it."
**Basic:** These students usually know BIDMAS but often apply it "left to right" regardless of the operators. They might lean towards Tom but are easily swayed by Katie's rearrangement if they lack confidence in how subtraction works.
**Proficient:** These students recognise BIDMAS and understand that $a - b$ is not $b - a$. They should identify Tom is correct, though a small percentage may be tripped up by the decimals and choose D, fearing a trick involving the values themselves.
**Advanced:** These students will instantly recognise the identity and the violation of commutativity in Katie's statement.
