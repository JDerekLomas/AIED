To predict the performance on this question, we must identify the primary hurdle: **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)**. Many students intuitively read left-to-right and will perform the subtraction before the multiplication.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **C (Correct):** $\frac{3}{4} - (\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{5}) = \frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{20} = \frac{15}{20} - \frac{1}{20} = \frac{14}{20} = \frac{7}{10}$.
*   **B (Left-to-Right Error):** $(\frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{4}) \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{2}{4} \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{2}{20} = \frac{1}{10}$. This is the most common distractor for all but the most advanced students.
*   **A (Calculation Error):** $\frac{3-1}{4+4} \times \text{something}$ or similar fraction addition/subtraction misconceptions where denominators are added.
*   **D (Random/Simplification Error):** A guess or an error in converting to common denominators.

**Difficulty assessment:** This is a high-discriminator question. The numbers for the incorrect left-to-right path ($\frac{2}{4} \times \frac{1}{5}$) result in a "clean" answer ($\frac{1}{10}$), which gives students false confidence in that path.
