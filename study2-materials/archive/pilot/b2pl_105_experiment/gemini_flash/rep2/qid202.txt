This question is significantly easier than many mixed number additions because the denominators are the same and the sum of the fractions ($1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5$) does not exceed a whole. This eliminates the need for finding common denominators or regrouping (carrying).

The primary distractor for lower-ability students is **D**, where they correctly add the numerators and whole numbers but incorrectly add the denominators ($5 + 5 = 10$). **B** is a mathematically correct improper fraction, but the prompt explicitly asks for a mixed number; advanced students will notice this instruction, while proficient students may occasionally get caught out if they are over-eager to show they can convert to improper fractions. **C** represents a total breakdown of fraction addition logic.

Below basic: These students often treat the top and bottom as separate integers.
Basic: These students know how to handle whole numbers but frequently fall into the trap of adding denominators.
Proficient: Most will get this right, but a small percentage will provide the improper fraction (B) or make a slip on the denominator.
Advanced: Almost all will read the instruction "Leave your answer as a mixed number" and perform the simple addition correctly.

below_basic: A=40% B=10% C=20% D=30%
basic: A=65% B=5% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=85% B=10% C=2% D=3%
advanced: A=98% B=2% C=0% D=0%
