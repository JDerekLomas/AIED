Substituting $x = -1$ into a quadratic is a classic "filter" question in the UK curriculum. The primary difficulty here isn't the algebra itself, but the handling of negative numbers when squaring.

Students often make two specific errors:
1. **The Squaring Error:** Thinking $(-1)^2 = -1$. This leads to $-1 - 2(-1) + 1 = -1 + 2 + 1 = 2$ (Option C).
2. **The Sign/Linear Error:** Correctly squaring to get $1$, but then calculating $-2(-1)$ as $-2$. This leads to $1 - 2 + 1 = 0$ (Option D).
3. **The Calculation Mush:** Adding all digits or ignoring signs, leading to $-2$ (Option A).

High-ability students (Advanced) almost universally know that a negative squared is a positive. Proficient students usually get it right but a small percentage will lapse into the "$-1^2 = -1$" calculator-style error or a sign slip on the $-2x$ term. Basic and Below Basic students frequently struggle with the double negative in the $-2x$ term and the squaring of the negative.
