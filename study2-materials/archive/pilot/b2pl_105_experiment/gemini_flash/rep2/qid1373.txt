This question is a classic diagnostic for negative number arithmetic in the context of expanding single brackets. The primary challenge is not the algebra (multiplying 3 by $m$ or 2), but the handling of the negative signs, specifically the "negative times a negative" in the second term.

**Key Drivers of Error:**
1. **The Double Negative:** Distributing $-3$ across $-2$ to get $+6$ is the most common failure point. Students often correctly identify $-3m$ but then keep the subtraction sign from the bracket, resulting in $-3m - 6$ (Option B).
2. **Sign Omission:** Some students ignore the negative sign in front of the 3 entirely, leading them to expand $3(m-2)$ and get $3m-6$ (Option C).
3. **Leading Negative Error:** A small subset of students might try to "balance" the signs or simply drop the negative from the $m$ term while flipping the sign of the constant (Option A).

**Ability Level Analysis:**
* **Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the basic concept of distribution and are highly inconsistent with directed numbers. They are almost as likely to pick B or C as they are the correct D.
* **Basic:** These students understand that they must multiply both terms, but they frequently trip over the rule $(-3) \times (-2) = +6$. Option B is the "most attractive" distractor here.
* **Proficient:** These students generally know the rules of directed numbers but may make a "slip" under pressure. Most will get it right, but a significant minority will still default to Option B.
* **Advanced:** At this level, expanding single brackets with negatives is a routine task. Errors are rare and usually down to simple clerical oversight.

below_basic: A=15% B=35% C=30% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=20% C=5% D=70%
advanced: A=1% B=4% C=0% D=95%
