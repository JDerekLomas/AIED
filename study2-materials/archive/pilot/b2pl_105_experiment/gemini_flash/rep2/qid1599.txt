This question tests the fundamental understanding of how to translate division into fraction notation, specifically dealing with a binomial divisor $(h+4)$. 

The main difficulty lies in "maintaining the grouping." Option C is a common mistake for students who process operations linearly from left to right without respecting the brackets. Option D represents the "numerator/denominator swap" confusion. Because the brackets are explicitly written in the question, students are more likely to keep the $h+4$ together than if the expression were written more ambiguously, making this a relatively accessible question for those with basic algebraic knowledge.

**below_basic:** A=45% B=15% C=25% D=15%
Students at this level often treat algebra as a "jumble of symbols." Many will pick A because it "looks right," but a significant number will be drawn to C (processing left-to-right) or B (trying to "balance" the expression by adding $+4$ to the top).

**basic:** A=72% B=5% C=13% D=10%
Students at this level generally understand that division equals a fraction bar. The primary error here is usually the orientation of the fraction (D) or failing to understand that the vinculum (fraction bar) acts as a grouping symbol for the entire $h+4$ (C).

**proficient:** A=92% B=1% C=4% D=3%
By this level, the convention that $\frac{a}{b}$ is the same as $a \div b$ is well-ingrained. The brackets in the question make it very clear that $h+4$ is the denominator. Errors are usually due to haste rather than a lack of understanding.

**advanced:** A=99% B=0% C=0% D=1%
For advanced students, this is a "gimme" question. The only likely errors are misclicks or extreme lapses in concentration.
