This question specifically tests the interaction between negative number substitution and the order of operations. The "trap" is the double negative created by $-2d$ when $d$ is negative.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A (-12):** This error comes from evaluating $10 - 2$ first (8) and then multiplying by $-2$, or sometimes from a complete confusion of signs (interpreting it as $-2 - 10$).
*   **B (6):** The most common mistake. Students substitute correctly but fail the sign rule: $10 - 2(-2) \rightarrow 10 - 4 = 6$. They ignore that subtracting a negative is addition.
*   **C (14):** The correct answer ($10 - (-4) = 10 + 4$).
*   **D (32):** A place-value misconception or "concatenation" error where students replace $d$ with $-2$ to get $10 - 2-2$, but then somehow interpret the $10 - (-22)$ or similar. Less common but seen in very low-ability cohorts.

**Teacher's Insight:**
Substitution with negative numbers is one of the most persistent hurdles in the UK GCSE curriculum. Even proficient students frequently default to $10 - 4 = 6$ because their brains prioritize the "subtraction" symbol already present in the expression, failing to realize the multiplication generates a second negative.
