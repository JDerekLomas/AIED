As a UK maths teacher, I have evaluated this question based on its presentation and the cognitive load required to solve it.

This question tests the ability to substitute values into an equation where $y$ is not the subject ($ax + by = c$). This is significantly harder for students than $y = mx + c$. 

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A (20):** A common error for students who lack "algebraic sense." They see 4 and 5 (from $4x$ and $10/2$) and multiply them, or they mistakenly think $4 \times 0$ is 4, then multiply by 5.
*   **B (3):** This is a distractor for students who incorrectly swap $x$ and $y$ or perform a different substitution further along the table.
*   **C (5):** The correct answer. $4(0) + 2y = 10 \implies 2y = 10 \implies y = 5$.
*   **D (2.5):** A very common "shortcut" error. Students see $4x$ and $10$ and divide $10 \div 4 = 2.5$, completely ignoring the $2y$ term or the fact that $x=0$.

**Teacher's Insight:**
For a "Below Basic" student, the sight of $4x + 2y = 10$ is intimidating because it requires two-step solving after substitution. Many will guess or perform a single operation using the visible numbers (10 and 4). "Basic" students often forget that $4(0)$ is $0$ and might try to subtract 4 from 10. "Proficient" students should handle the zero substitution easily, as it simplifies the equation to $2y = 10$.

below_basic: A=20% B=15% C=35% D=30%
basic: A=10% B=10% C=55% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=5% C=80% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=96% D=2%
