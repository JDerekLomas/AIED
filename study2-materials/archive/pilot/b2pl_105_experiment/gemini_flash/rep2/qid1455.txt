This question tests the ability to translate a multi-step word problem into an algebraic equation, specifically focusing on the correct use of brackets to show order of operations.

The key difficulty lies in the phrase "multiply the result by four." This requires the student to recognise that the addition must happen first. Option A is the classic "left-to-right" error where students ignore BIDMAS/BODMAS. Option B represents a misunderstanding of which part of the expression is being multiplied (the common $4n + 5$ structure). Option C is a rare confusion between multiplication and powers.

**Teacher's Analysis:**
*   **Below Basic** students often translate words directly into symbols in a linear fashion, leading them strongly towards A.
*   **Basic** students are starting to associate "multiply by 4" with the coefficient 4, but often fail to group the $(n+5)$, leading them to B or A.
*   **Proficient** students understand the need for grouping but might still glance and pick A if they aren't thinking about BIDMAS. However, most will recognise the distributive property or the need for brackets.
*   **Advanced** students will immediately identify the structure and look for the brackets.

below_basic: A=45% B=30% C=10% D=15%
basic: A=35% B=35% C=5% D=25%
proficient: A=15% B=10% C=0% D=75%
advanced: A=2% B=3% C=0% D=95%
