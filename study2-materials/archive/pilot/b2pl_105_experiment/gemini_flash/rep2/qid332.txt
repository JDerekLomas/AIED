This question is a classic test of understanding the hierarchy of operations and the distributive property when solving two-step equations. 

**Tom's method** follows the standard "reverse BEDMAS" approach: he adds 5 to both sides first. This is the most common and intuitive way to solve this equation, and most students will recognize it as correct.

**Katie's method** represents a common area of confusion. To get $x - 5 = 36$, she has multiplied by 3. However, she has failed to multiply the $-5$ by 3 (which would give $x - 15 = 36$). This is the single most common error students make when trying to eliminate a denominator before handling the constant term.

**Difficulty Analysis:**
*   **Below Basic** students often guess or think only one person can be right. They might see $12 \times 3 = 36$ and assume Katie is right without checking the $-5$.
*   **Basic** students usually know "add 5" is the first step, so they back Tom. Many will be tricked by Katie because the math ($12 \times 3 = 36$) "looks" correct in isolation.
*   **Proficient** students recognize Tom is correct. Some will still fall into the trap of thinking Katie's "alternative method" is valid because they often forget to multiply every term by the denominator.
*   **Advanced** students will immediately spot that Katie missed the $-5 \times 3$ and will confidently choose A.
