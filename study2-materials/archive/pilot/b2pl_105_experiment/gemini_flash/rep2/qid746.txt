As an experienced UK maths teacher, I evaluate this order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) question as a "high-trap" item for lower-ability students. 

The primary hurdle here is the tension between working left-to-right versus following the bracket-first rule. 
*   **The Correct Path:** $2+2=4$, then $12 \div 4=3$, then $4+3=7$ (Option B).
*   **The "Left-to-Right" Trap:** $4+12=16$, then $16 \div 4=4$ (Option D).
*   **The "Incorrect Priority" Trap:** Doing the division before the brackets ($12 \div 2 = 6$, then $4+6+2=12$) leads to Option C.
*   **The "Missing Brackets" Trap:** Doing $4+12 \div 2$ then $+2$ ($4+6+2$) also leads to 12.
*   **Option A** is often a result of doing the addition inside brackets, then the leftmost addition, then the division ($4+12=16, 16 \div 4=4$, then accidentally adding a stray digit or making a calculation error).

This specific question is tricky because the numbers $4+12 \div 4$ are "friendly" enough to encourage students to ignore the brackets and simply calculate sequentially.
