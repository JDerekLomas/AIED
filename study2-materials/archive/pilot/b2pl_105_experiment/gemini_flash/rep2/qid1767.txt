This question tests a fundamental understanding of inverse operations in algebraic equations. Specifically, it assesses whether a student recognises that to isolate $x$ when it is followed by a subtraction, the inverse operation (addition) must be performed.

The transition from $x - 7$ to $x$ is one of the most basic algebraic manipulations. However, "below basic" students often struggle with the direction of the operation. There is a common misconception where students see the minus sign in the first line and reflexively choose subtraction (Option D) because they are "matching" the symbols rather than performing an inverse. Some students may choose B or C if they have a generic confusion about how numbers move across an equals sign, but A is the overwhelmingly likely correct choice for anyone with basic proficiency.

The lack of a right-hand side in the prompt might slightly confuse students who are used to seeing full equations, but the visual "balancing" arrow usually mitigates this.

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=5% D=40%
basic: A=82% B=4% C=2% D=12%
proficient: A=96% B=1% C=1% D=2%
advanced: A=99% B=0% C=0% D=1%
