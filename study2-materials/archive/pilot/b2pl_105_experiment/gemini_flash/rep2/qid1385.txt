This question is a classic test of "procedural vs. flexible" thinking. While it tests addition of fractions with different denominators, the specific numbers chosen ($1/3, 2/3$ and $1/4, 3/4$) provide a significant "shortcut" for students who notice they can pair them to make wholes $(1 + 1 = 2)$. 

However, many students are trained to find a common denominator (12) as a first reflex. This leads to $\frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} + \frac{8}{12} + \frac{9}{12} = \frac{24}{12}$. Students who reach $\frac{24}{12}$ but fail to simplify will hunt for that numerator, making Option D a strong distractor. Option B represents the classic "add the tops and add the bottoms" misconception $(1+1+2+3) / (3+4+3+4)$, while Option A is usually a result of only adding the first two terms or losing track mid-calculation.

**Below Basic:** These students almost exclusively add across the numerators and denominators. They see four fractions and perform $(1+1+2+3) = 7$ and $(3+4+3+4) = 14$. 
**Basic:** These students know they need a common denominator but often get overwhelmed by four terms. Many will calculate the first two, get $7/12$, and then get stuck or distracted, picking A. Others will reach $24/12$ and choose D because it looks most like their unsimplified work.
**Proficient:** These students will mostly get to the answer, either by the "common denominator" method and simplifying $24/12$ to $2$, or by noticing the pairs. Some may still fall for the D trap if they are rushing.
**Advanced:** Almost all will spot the $1+1$ symmetry immediately.
