To solve the inequality \(-5 < 2x + 1 < 5\), students must perform two steps: subtract 1 from all parts (\(-6 < 2x < 4\)) and then divide by 2 (\(-3 < x < 2\)).

This question is a classic test of multi-step algebraic manipulation within a compound inequality.
*   **Option B is the correct answer.**
*   **Option C** is a common "estimate" error where students see the 5s and 1, subtract them mentally but lose track of the 2, or assume the answer must be symmetrical around zero because the question looks symmetrical.
*   **Option D** reflects a mistake in signs or operations, often seen when students subtract 1 from the right but add it to the left (a "misaligned" balance).
*   **Option A** is the "inverse operation" error where students multiply by 2 and add 1 instead of dividing and subtracting.

The difficulty here lies in the "double-ended" nature of the inequality. Below-basic students often ignore one side entirely or perform different operations on each side. Basic students often handle the subtraction correctly but stumble on the division or the signs.

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=10% B=55% C=20% D=15%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=10% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=95% C=3% D=1%
