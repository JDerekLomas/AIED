In this rearrangement question, the two steps involved—multiplying by the denominator and then taking the square root—test a student's grasp of inverse operations. 

**Below Basic** students often struggle with the order of operations and "blindly" move symbols. A common error here is not knowing which operation to perform first or mistakenly squaring $F$ instead of rooting the result (leading to A).

**Basic** students generally understand that $r$ needs to move to the other side via multiplication, but many fail at the final step. Option B is a very common "visual" distractor where students move $r$ but forget it should be in the numerator before rooting.

**Proficient** students are comfortable with two-step rearrangements. The most likely error for this group is a momentary lapse in concentration, perhaps picking B due to the fraction looking "more scientific."

**Advanced** students will find this straightforward as it is a common physics formula ($a=v^2/r$) and they are well-versed in isolating variables with powers.

below_basic: A=25% B=30% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=35% C=40% D=10%
proficient: A=5% B=15% C=75% D=5%
advanced: A=1% B=2% C=96% D=1%
