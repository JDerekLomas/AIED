This question is a classic test of the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). While it looks simple, the placement of the addition before the division is a deliberate "trap" for students who work strictly from left to right.

The most common errors in this specific problem are:
1.  **Left-to-Right (The most common error):** $(3 + 6) \div 2 + 1 = 9 \div 2 + 1 = 4.5 + 1 = 5.5$ (Option C).
2.  **Incorrect Grouping:** Adding everything first: $(3 + 6) \div (2 + 1) = 9 \div 3 = 3$ (Option B).
3.  **Correct Logic:** $3 + (6 \div 2) + 1 = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7$ (Option A).

Option D is a "distractor" for students who make basic calculation errors during the division or misinterpret the $+1$ at the end.
