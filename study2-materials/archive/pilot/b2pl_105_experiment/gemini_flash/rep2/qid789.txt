This question is a classic test of two distinct hurdles in fractional arithmetic: the procedural addition of fractions and the requirement to simplify the result.

Because the denominators are already the same, the most common error for **below_basic** students is "adding across" (adding both numerators and denominators) to get $\frac{8}{20}$. For **basic** and **proficient** students, the "trap" is not the addition itself, but the final instruction to "write your answer in its simplest form." Many students will calculate $\frac{8}{10}$ (Option B) and immediately select it, feeling a sense of completion before performing the simplification step. **Advanced** students will almost all reach $\frac{8}{10}$ and correctly simplify to $\frac{4}{5}$.

The presence of $\frac{8}{10}$ (Option B) acts as a powerful "distractor" because it is a correct intermediate step, often causing students to overlook Option C.

below_basic: A=45% B=30% C=15% D=10%
basic: A=20% B=45% C=30% D=5%
proficient: A=5% B=25% C=68% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=4% C=94% D=1%
