This question is a classic test of Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). While it looks straightforward, it contains two specific pressure points that catch students at different levels.

The first is the **Multiplication priority**: Lower-ability students often read left-to-right, performing $8-7=1$, then $1+10=11$, then $11 \times 3 = 33$ (Option D).

The second, and more subtle, is the **Addition vs. Subtraction trap**: Students who have memorized BIDMAS often mistakenly believe Addition must come before Subtraction because 'A' comes before 'S'. They calculate $7 + (10 \times 3) = 37$, then $8 - 37 = -29$ (Option C). Alternatively, some calculate $7+10=17$, then $8-17=-9$, then $-9 \times 3 = -27$ (not listed), but Option C is the primary attractor for the "A before S" misconception.

Option B is the correct answer: $8 - 7 + 30 \rightarrow 1 + 30 = 31$.

Here is the predicted performance breakdown:
