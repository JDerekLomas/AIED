This quadratic factorisation is a classic "sign-trap" question. To solve it, students must navigate two hurdles: finding factors of 6 that subtract to 1, and assigning the negative sign to the larger magnitude ($x - 3$) to ensure the middle term is $-x$.

**Below Basic:** These students often struggle with the concept of factorisation or directed numbers. They frequently pick Option C because they see positive integers as "safer" or because they ignore the minus signs in the expression entirely and just look for $3 \times 2 = 6$.
**Basic:** Students at this level know they need 3 and 2, but they are very likely to fall for the sign errors. Option D is a very common distractor here; they know one must be negative and one positive but often flip them (calculating $3 - 2 = 1$ instead of $-3 + 2 = -1$).
**Proficient:** These students usually have a reliable method (like "sums to $b$, multiplies to $c$"). Most will get it right, but a significant minority will still make a hasty error with the sign placement or fail to mentally expand to check their work.
**Advanced:** These students will almost universally get this correct. They usually perform a lightning-fast mental expansion of the brackets to verify the middle term before selecting.
