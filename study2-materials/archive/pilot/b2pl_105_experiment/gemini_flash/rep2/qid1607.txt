In this equation, Isaac correctly handles the first step by multiplying by 4 ($15 \times 4 = 60$). However, in Step 2, he makes a classic "inverse operation" error. To isolate $k$, he should subtract 1 from 60 ($60 - 1 = 59$), but instead, he performs the inverse of the sign *behind* the $k$ or simply adds 1 because he sees a "$+k$".

This is a very common point of failure for students. Below basic students often think any "maths-looking" steps are correct, or they fail at the initial multiplication. Proficient students usually spot the Step 2 error but are prone to rushing. Advanced students almost always identify that only the first step is logically sound.
