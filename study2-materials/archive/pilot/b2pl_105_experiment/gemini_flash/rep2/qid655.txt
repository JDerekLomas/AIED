This question is significantly more challenging than a standard directed numbers or basic algebra task because the result is not an integer. For many students, especially those at basic or below basic levels, the "instinct" is to divide the larger number by the smaller number ($8 \div 6$), but there is a profound confusion regarding the signs and the direction of the division.

**Analysis of Difficulties:**
1.  **Operation Reversal:** Students often see $6$ and $8$ and think $6/8$ (Option A or B) because they mistakenly try to "cancel out" or simplify the appearance, or they simply divide in the wrong order ($6 \div 8$ instead of $8 \div 6$).
2.  **Negative Sign Logic:** Students know that "two negatives make a positive" in multiplication. Since the product is negative ($-8$) and one factor is negative ($-6$), they know the star must be positive. This helps them eliminate B and C, but many will still choose A over D because $6/8$ "looks" like a more familiar fraction than the improper $8/6$.
3.  **Advanced Fluency:** Advanced students will recognize this as the equation $-6x = -8$, leading to $x = -8 / -6 = 8/6$. Even then, the lack of simplification to $4/3$ can momentarily throw them.

**Predicted Performance:**

below_basic: A=40% B=35% C=15% D=10%
*(These students struggle with the order of division and often guess randomly with signs, frequently picking B because they see two negatives in the question and assume a third belongs there.)*

basic: A=35% B=15% C=25% D=25%
*(Basic students often get the sign right (knowing a positive is needed) but follow the common error of "small number divided by big number" ($6/8$) or simple confusion on the inverse operation.)*

proficient: A=15% B=5% C=20% D=60%
*(Proficient students usually navigate the signs correctly but a significant minority will still perform the division in the wrong order or get distracted by the more "comfortable" fraction 6/8.)*

advanced: A=2% B=1% C=7% D=90%
*(Advanced students will solve it algebraically. The main trap for them is a clerical error regarding which number is the divisor.)*
