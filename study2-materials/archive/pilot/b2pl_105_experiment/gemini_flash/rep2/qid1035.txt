This question is a classic test of distributing a negative sign over a binomial, specifically when the second term is already negative. It triggers the "double negative" misconception ($ - \times - = + $). 

The most common error for lower-ability students is simply "dropping" the brackets (Option A) or only applying the negative sign to the first term while leaving the internal sign unchanged (Option B). Mid-level students often remember the sign must change but occasionally make a transcription error or apply a "sign flip" to both without respecting the leading negative (Option C).

Here is the predicted distribution:

below_basic: A=30% B=40% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=10% B=45% C=15% D=30%
proficient: A=5% B=20% C=5% D=70%
advanced: A=1% B=4% C=0% D=95%
