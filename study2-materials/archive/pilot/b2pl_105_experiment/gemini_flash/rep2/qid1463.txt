To predict the performance on this question, we must look at the specific numbers. Mo is calculating the $b^2$ part of the discriminant in the quadratic formula: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.

In this equation, $b = -3$. Therefore, the triangle represents $b^2 = (-3)^2$. 

The common trap here is the "squaring a negative" error. Many students incorrectly process $(-3)^2$ as $-3^2 = -9$ (calculating $3 \times 3$ and then attaching the sign, or trusting a calculator without using brackets). Because the question specifically asks what replaces the *triangle* symbol, and the symbol represents the result of the squaring, students must decide between $9$ and $-9$. 

Students at the lower end often default to $-9$ because they see the minus sign in front of the $3h$. More advanced students know that a squared real number is always positive in this context.
