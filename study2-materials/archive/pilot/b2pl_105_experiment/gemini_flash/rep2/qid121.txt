This question is a classic "gradient of a linear equation" problem that tests algebraic manipulation rather than just reading a graph. While $y = mx + c$ is a foundation of GCSE maths, rearranging $ax + by = c$ causes significant issues.

**Analysis of the Distractors:**
*   **A ($5$):** This is the most common error for lower-ability students. They simply look for the coefficient of $x$ without considering the $3y$ or the rearrangement.
*   **B ($-5$):** These students know they need to "move the $5x$ across," but they forget to divide by the coefficient of $y$.
*   **C ($\frac{5}{3}$):** These students understand that they need to divide by $3$ and have some idea that $5$ and $3$ are the key numbers, but they either make a sign error during the subtraction of $5x$ or assume all gradients in textbook problems are positive.
*   **D ($-\frac{5}{3}$):** The correct answer, requiring two steps: subtracting $5x$ and then dividing by $3$.

**Student Performance Expectations:**
The jump from "basic" to "proficient" is where we see students move away from simply picking the number in front of $x$ and towards actually attempting the rearrangement. "Advanced" students will likely do this mentally and get it right, though some may still make a careless sign error ($+5/3$).

below_basic: A=60% B=15% C=15% D=10%
basic: A=40% B=20% C=25% D=15%
proficient: A=15% B=15% C=25% D=45%
advanced: A=5% B=5% C=10% D=80%
