This question tests a student's ability to rearrange a formula involving a fraction, a constant ($\pi$), and a power ($r^3$). 

While the concept is straightforward Higher Tier GCSE material, students often struggle with "backwards" volume questions when there are no numerical values to work with. The primary hurdle here is the algebraic manipulation of the fraction $\frac{4}{3}$. Many students incorrectly multiply by 4 and divide by 3 (leading to Option B) or fail to realize that $\pi$ is in the numerator of the volume formula and should therefore end up in the denominator of the radius formula.

**Option A** is a common "blind" guess where students just group all symbols together.
**Option B** is the most common mathematical error (inverting the fraction incorrectly).
**Option C** is the correct rearrangement.
**Option D** represents a failure to understand that the cube root applies to the entire expression, not just the $V$.
