This question specifically tests the understanding of multiplicative inverses (reciprocals) in the context of signed numbers.

The "trap" here is the negative sign. Many students correctly identify that a fraction multiplied by its reciprocal equals 1, but they struggle with the requirement for the product to be **-1** rather than +1. At lower ability levels, students often remember the rule "multiplying by the upside-down fraction gives 1" and will automatically choose the positive reciprocal (A), overlooking the sign needed to keep the result negative.

**A (4/3):** The most common error. Students know they need the reciprocal but assume a "different" number is needed to change the result, or they forget that a negative times a positive equals a negative.
**B (-4/3):** The correct answer. Students must realize that to keep the product negative, they must multiply by a positive.
**C (3/4):** Chosen by students who think they just need to "cancel out" the negative sign with another negative or who are guessing based on the numbers in the question.
**D (-3/4):** A common guess for students who associate "multiplying something to get -1" with identity elements or squaring.
