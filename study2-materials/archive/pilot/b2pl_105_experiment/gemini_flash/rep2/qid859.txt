This question is a classic multi-step linear equation with variables on both sides. While it appears standard, the specific constants used create a significant trap.

The most common error in this specific problem is the "vanishing constant" or "sign error" when balancing. A student subtracts $6d$ correctly to get $6d - 3 = 3$, but then instinctively "cancels" the $3$s to get $6d = 0$ (leading to option A) or mistakenly treats $-3$ and $3$ as terms that cancel out during a move across the equals sign. Option B is the correct answer $(6d = 6)$, but it requires two steps of adding/subtracting correctly. Option D represents the "division by the wrong number" or a coefficient flip $(6/18$ or $3/9$ logic).

Here is the predicted breakdown:

below_basic: A=40% B=30% C=15% D=15%
basic: A=25% B=55% C=10% D=10%
proficient: A=10% B=82% C=4% D=4%
advanced: A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%
