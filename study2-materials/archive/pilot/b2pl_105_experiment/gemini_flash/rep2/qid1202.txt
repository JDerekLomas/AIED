This question addresses a classic stumbling block in early algebra: solving equations where the variable is subtracted (the "negative unknown"). 

**Teacher’s Analysis:**
The most common error here is the "subtraction by instinct." Students see $3$ and $5$ and immediately think $5 - 3 = 2$. Option A is a very powerful "intuitive" distractor. Option C attracts students who think that because the $3$ moves across the equals sign, it must be added to the $5$. Option B, the correct answer, requires a student to either understand directed numbers or to perform a two-step rearrangement ($3 = 5 + y$ then $-2 = y$). 

At the **below_basic** level, the confusion between $3-y=5$ and $y-3=5$ is frequent, leading to a high percentage choosing C. At the **basic** and **proficient** levels, the "A" trap ($3$ and $5$ make $2$) is the dominant error because students often ignore the sign attached to the $y$.

**Predicted Statistics:**

below_basic: A=35% B=15% C=40% D=10%
basic: A=45% B=30% C=20% D=5%
proficient: A=15% B=75% C=8% D=2%
advanced: A=2% B=96% C=1% D=1%
