This question specifically tests the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). While "Multiplication comes before Subtraction" is a standard rule, the presence of brackets overrides this. The trap here is that many students read from left to right, making Option A the primary attractor for lower-ability students. Others remember that multiplication is "stronger" than addition/subtraction but forget the priority of brackets, leading them to Option B.

**Analysis of student performance:**
*   **Below Basic:** Often ignore formal order of operations entirely, defaulting to left-to-right processing (Option A).
*   **Basic:** Have heard of BIDMAS but are inconsistent. They may see the multiplication sign and assume it takes priority over everything else (Option B), or they might correctly identify the brackets but second-guess themselves.
*   **Proficient:** Generally recognise that "B" for Brackets comes first. Errors here are usually due to rushing rather than a lack of knowledge.
*   **Advanced:** Almost universally identify the brackets as the first step. They are very unlikely to be caught out by this specific structure.

below_basic: A=45% B=20% C=25% D=10%
basic: A=25% B=15% C=55% D=5%
proficient: A=8% B=4% C=86% D=2%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=98% D=0%
