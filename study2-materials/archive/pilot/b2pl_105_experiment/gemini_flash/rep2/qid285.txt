As an experienced UK maths teacher, I evaluate this question as a standard "changing the subject" problem involving two steps: division and a square root.

The primary hurdle for students is the order of operations in reverse (BIDMAS/SAMDIB). **Below basic** students often struggle with the algebraic notation, sometimes confusing the multiplication of $r$ and $\omega$ with an operation that requires squaring $F$ (Option A). **Basic** students often recognize that a square root is needed but frequently make mistakes in the algebraic manipulation, either multiplying instead of dividing (Option C) or failing to include $r$ under the radical (Option D). **Proficient** students usually navigate the two steps correctly, though a small margin still makes a transcription error. **Advanced** students find this straightforward.

One subtle trap is Option D ($\omega = \frac{\sqrt{F}}{r}$); students who square root before dividing by $r$ will gravitate here, which is a common procedural error at the GCSE Higher level.

below_basic: A=30% B=25% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%
