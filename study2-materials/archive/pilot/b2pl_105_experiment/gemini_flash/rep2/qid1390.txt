This question is a classic test of **Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)** combined with fraction arithmetic.

The core challenge here is that students are naturally inclined to read from left to right. A student who incorrectly performs the addition first ($\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{6}$) and then multiplies by $\frac{1}{3}$ will arrive at $\frac{5}{18}$ (Option B). This is the primary "distractor" and a very common error for students up to the proficient level.

Option A ($\frac{1}{2}$) is the correct answer, derived by multiplying first: $\frac{1}{3} + (\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3}) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$.

Option C ($\frac{2}{9}$) often comes from students adding the numerators and denominators for the first part then multiplying ($\frac{2}{5} \times \frac{1}{3}$), or general confusion with common denominators. Option D ($\frac{1}{15}$) usually results from "adding across" all components and making a calculation error.

For **Below Basic** students, the "left-to-right" pull is almost irresistible. **Advanced** students will recognize the BIDMAS trap immediately, though a small percentage may still make a computational slip during the addition of fractions with different denominators.
