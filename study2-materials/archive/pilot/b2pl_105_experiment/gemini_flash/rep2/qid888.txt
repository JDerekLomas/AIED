This question is a standard quadratic expansion that focuses on the multiplication and addition of directed numbers (negative integers). 

The primary pitfalls for students are:
1.  **The product of two negatives:** Many students at the 'basic' level will correctly add $-5$ and $-7$ to get $-12$, but incorrectly multiply them to get $-35$ (Option D).
2.  **The sum of two negatives:** Some students struggle with $(-5) + (-7)$ and end up with $-2$ or $+2$ (Option A).
3.  **General confusion with signs:** Those who memorise "two minuses make a plus" without context often change every sign in the expression to positive (Option C).

Because the variables are simple ($m$ with no coefficient), "Advanced" students will almost universally get this correct. "Proficient" students generally handle the multiplication correctly but occasionally slip on the sign of the constant term.

below_basic: A=20% B=30% C=25% D=25%
basic: A=15% B=45% C=15% D=25%
proficient: A=5% B=80% C=5% D=10%
advanced: A=1% B=97% C=1% D=1%
