As an experienced UK maths teacher, I've observed that this specific question type focuses on the **notation of operations** rather than the calculation itself. 

The movement from $9y$ to $y$ represents a fundamental step in solving linear equations. While most students at higher levels see this as an automatic process, lower-ability students often struggle with the "invisible" multiplication sign between the $9$ and the $y$. The most common error is choosing $D$ (subtracting 9) because they see the 9 "disappear" and associate removal with subtraction. Others choose $B$ (multiply 9) because they identify that the 9 is currently "multiplying" the $y$, but they fail to realise the question asks for the *operation performed* to solve it, rather than the relationship currently present.

The phrasing "Isaac always records what operation he has done to both sides" is a clear hint for those with a firm grasp of balancing equations.

Here is the predicted percentage breakdown for each ability level:

below_basic: A=10% B=15% C=45% D=30%
basic: A=5% B=10% C=65% D=20%
proficient: A=2% B=5% C=85% D=8%
advanced: A=1% B=1% C=96% D=2%
