As an experienced teacher, I evaluate this question by looking at the specific order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and how students interpret function machines versus algebraic equations.

The core difficulty here is the distinction between $x^2 + 5$ and $(x+5)^2$. Students with a weak grasp of the priority of operations often read equations strictly from left to right. Therefore, Option A is the "classic" trap: it assumes the $+5$ happens before the squaring because it appears after $x$ in the linear text of the equation. Option D targets the common misconception that the inverse of "squaring" is "dividing by 2."

However, because the equation is relatively simple, proficient and advanced students will instantly recognize that 9 is the intermediate step ($14-5$), leading them to the "square root" inverse in Option C.

Here is the predicted breakdown of student responses:

below_basic: A=45% B=10% C=25% D=20%
basic: A=30% B=5% C=45% D=20%
proficient: A=10% B=2% C=80% D=8%
advanced: A=2% B=0% C=97% D=1%
