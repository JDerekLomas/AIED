This item asks students to add 3/5 and 1/4. The correct answer is 17/20, which requires finding a common denominator of 20, converting to 12/20 + 5/20 = 17/20.

The misconception tested is "adds numerators and denominators" which would give 4/9 (option A). This is a very common misconception among younger students learning fractions.

Looking at the distractors:
- A) 4/9: classic numerator+numerator / denominator+denominator error
- B) 4/20: numerators added (3+1=4) but correct denominator found - partial understanding
- C) 7/20: not sure how a student gets this... maybe 3+4=7 over 20? Confusing numerator with denominator somehow
- D) 17/20: correct

Comparing to calibration items: The equation -5=p+10 with difficulty 0.167 is straightforward algebra. The factorising item at 0.473 is moderately hard. Adding fractions with unlike denominators is a fundamental skill but one where misconceptions are very persistent. I'd estimate this is moderate difficulty - maybe around 0.35-0.45 proportion incorrect.

The visual component (circles diagram) adds slight complexity but the question is quite clear. The procedure requires: recognize addition, find LCD, convert both fractions, add numerators. That's about 4 steps.

The distractor A is very plausible for students with the target misconception. B and C catch other partial errors. Discrimination should be reasonable since this cleanly separates students who understand fraction addition from those who don't.
