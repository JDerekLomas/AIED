Item: 1/3 + 1/2 x 1/3
Correct answer: A (1/2)
Misconception: Left-to-right processing ignoring operator precedence

Correct working: BIDMAS says multiply first. 1/2 x 1/3 = 1/6. Then 1/3 + 1/6 = 2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2.

Misconception working: 1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6, then 5/6 x 1/3 = 5/18. This gives B.

I want to think about the population of UK secondary students taking this item. Order of operations is introduced early in KS3 and reinforced throughout. By Year 9-10, most students should handle this. But the fraction context adds cognitive load compared to integer-based BIDMAS questions.

Key considerations for difficulty estimation:
1. The misconception (ignoring BIDMAS) is very common, especially in younger students
2. Fraction arithmetic adds a layer of difficulty even for students who know BIDMAS
3. The correct answer (1/2) is actually the simplest-looking option, which could go either way: some students might gravitate toward it, others might distrust it

Looking at the calibration items more broadly:
- Easy items (classical diff ~0.13-0.17): simple equation solving, order of operations with decimals
- Medium items (classical diff ~0.30): function machines requiring inverse operations
- Hard items (classical diff ~0.47-0.57): factorising, inequalities

This item feels like it sits between easy and medium. The pure fraction context and the strong distractor pull toward B make it moderately challenging. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.23.

For discrimination: the item should discriminate well. Students who understand BIDMAS will get it right; those who don't will reliably choose B. This clean separation suggests good discrimination, maybe 1.3-1.5.

Guessing: the correct answer doesn't particularly stand out as a guess target. Low guessing, around 0.05 or less.
