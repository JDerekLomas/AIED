The target item presents four calculations and asks which equals -20. This is a "which calculation equals X" format, requiring students to evaluate multiple expressions with negative numbers.

Working through each:
A) 2 × (-2) - (-4) × 4: By BIDMAS, multiplications first: 2×(-2) = -4 and (-4)×4 = -16. Then -4 - (-16) = -4 + 16 = 12.
B) -28 - (-4) × 2: Multiplication first: (-4)×2 = -8. Then -28 - (-8) = -28 + 8 = -20. This is correct.
C) (-5)^2 + 5: (-5)^2 = 25, so 25 + 5 = 30.
D) (-42) ÷ (-2) + 1: (-42)÷(-2) = 21, so 21 + 1 = 22.

The key misconception is about multiplying two negatives. Consider how this plays out:
- Option C: A student who thinks (-5)^2 = -25 would get -25 + 5 = -20, selecting C.
- Option D: A student who thinks (-42)÷(-2) = -21 would get -21 + 1 = -20, selecting D.
- Option A: Various computational errors could lead students here.

So C and D are particularly strong distractors for students holding the tested misconception, as both yield exactly -20 under the misconception. This is very well-designed.

Comparing to the calibration item testing the same misconception (factorising, classical difficulty 0.473, IRT b = 0.404), this item is computational rather than algebraic. The need to evaluate all four options increases cognitive load. However, the arithmetic itself is relatively straightforward for KS3/KS4 students. I'd place this at roughly similar difficulty to the factorising item, perhaps slightly harder due to the multiple evaluations and strong distractors pulling students toward C or D.

The discrimination should be reasonable - students who understand negative number arithmetic will reliably get this right, while those with the misconception will be systematically drawn to wrong answers.
