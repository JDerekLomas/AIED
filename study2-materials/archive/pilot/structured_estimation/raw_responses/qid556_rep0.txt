This item asks students to identify the inverse operation needed to go from 9y to y. The equation shows 9y = ... becoming y = ..., so the student must recognize that dividing by 9 is the correct operation.

Looking at the calibration examples, three of them test the same misconception: "When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse." The calibration items with this misconception range from easy (classical difficulty 0.167) to moderate-hard (0.569). The key factor seems to be the complexity of the surrounding equation context.

This target item is notably simpler than most calibration items. It isolates a single step -- going from 9y to y -- without requiring the student to solve a full equation. The operation is straightforward multiplication/division. However, the visual presentation (a diagram with a star) adds a small layer of interpretation.

The distractors: +9 and -9 are additive operations (common error for students who confuse operations); x9 represents using the same operation rather than the inverse (the tested misconception); /9 is correct. The misconception distractor (x9) should attract students who don't understand inverse operations, while -9 might attract students who default to subtraction when "removing" a number.

Given the simplicity of the isolated step, I'd expect this to be on the easier side -- comparable to the first calibration item (solving -5 = p + 10, difficulty 0.167). However, the visual/diagrammatic presentation could add slight difficulty. The misconception is common at younger ages but most students aged 12+ should handle this.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.20, IRT difficulty around -0.5. The discrimination should be moderate-to-good since this cleanly targets one concept. Guessing should be low since the item is relatively straightforward for those who understand inverse operations.
