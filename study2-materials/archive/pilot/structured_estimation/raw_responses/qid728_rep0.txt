This item asks students to add brackets to the expression 16-6+4÷2 to make it equal 7. The correct answer is D: (16-6+4)÷2.

Let me verify each option:
A) 16-(6+4)÷2 = 16 - 10÷2 = 16 - 5 = 11
B) (16-6)+4÷2 = 10 + 2 = 12
C) 16-6+(4÷2) = 16 - 6 + 2 = 12
D) (16-6+4)÷2 = 14÷2 = 7 ✓

The misconception tested is "carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order." Students who don't understand order of operations might think the original expression already equals 7 (doing 16-6=10, 10+4=14, 14÷2=7), which is actually the left-to-right reading. The item cleverly tests whether students understand that brackets change grouping.

Looking at calibration: the order-of-operations calibration item (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT b = -0.245. That item was somewhat easier. This item requires students to evaluate all four options and determine which yields 7, which involves more computation. Additionally, students must understand how brackets interact with order of operations.

However, option D essentially represents the left-to-right computation, which many students might recognize. Students who do operations left-to-right by default would naturally arrive at 7 for the unbracketed expression, and option D formalizes that grouping. This could make the item moderate in difficulty.

The distractors are plausible because each option places brackets differently and requires careful evaluation. Cognitive load is moderate-to-high since students must compute 4 expressions. The item is age-appropriate for KS3/KS4 curriculum covering order of operations.

Comparing to the calibration set, I'd place this around the 0.30-0.40 range for classical difficulty (proportion incorrect), comparable to the function machine item but somewhat harder due to multiple evaluations needed.
