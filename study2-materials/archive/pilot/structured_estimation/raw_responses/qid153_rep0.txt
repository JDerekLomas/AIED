This item asks students to solve a simple linear equation: 12d - 3 = 0. The solution requires two steps: add 3 to both sides to get 12d = 3, then divide both sides by 12 to get d = 3/12 = 1/4.

The misconception tested is "uses the same operation rather than the inverse." Looking at the distractors:
- A) d = -1/4: This could come from subtracting 3 instead of adding (getting 12d = -3) then dividing by 12.
- B) d = 4: This could come from dividing 12 by 3, or multiplying instead of dividing.
- C) d = -4: Combination of sign error and operation error.
- D) d = 1/4: Correct.

Comparing to calibration items: The first calibration item (-5 = p + 10, same misconception) had classical difficulty 0.167 and IRT b = -0.702. That was a one-step equation. This item requires two steps AND involves fractions in the answer, which tends to increase difficulty. The inequality item (calibration 5) with the same misconception had difficulty 0.569 and b = 0.808, but that involved inequalities and rearranging variables.

This item sits somewhere in the middle. The fraction answer (1/4) is less intuitive for students, and the distractors are reasonably plausible. I'd estimate classical difficulty around 0.25-0.35 and IRT difficulty around -0.2 to 0.2. The discrimination should be moderate to good since the misconception is well-targeted. Guessing should be low since there's a clear solution path.
