Target: -4 + (-5) x 3 = ?
Correct: D (-19). Misconception: left-to-right processing.

This is fundamentally a BIDMAS item wrapped in negative number arithmetic. Let me think about the student population -- UK secondary students ages 11-16. Order of operations is introduced around Year 7 and reinforced through KS3. Negative number operations are also KS3 content. By KS4, most students should handle both, but the combination can still cause errors.

The key question for difficulty estimation: how many students in a broad 11-16 sample will either (a) not know BIDMAS or (b) know BIDMAS but make arithmetic errors with negatives?

Looking at the calibration data more carefully:
- Item 2 (same misconception, BIDMAS with decimals/fractions): classical difficulty 0.134, b=-0.245
- This suggests BIDMAS items tend to be on the easier side for this population

But item 2 involved 0.4 - 1/5 x 3. The current item -4+(-5)x3 uses only integers but more negative signs. I think the difficulty is comparable. The negative signs add some cognitive load but the computation is more straightforward than dealing with fractions and decimals.

I'll estimate this as slightly easier or comparable to the calibration BIDMAS item. Classical difficulty around 0.15-0.20. The b parameter around -0.3 to -0.1.

One consideration: the parentheses around -5 make the multiplication more visually apparent, which might actually help students recognize they should multiply first. This could make it easier than expected.

Discrimination: The item should discriminate well. Students who know BIDMAS get -19, those who don't get -27. Clean separation. I estimate a around 1.5.

Guessing: Very low. Each option corresponds to a specific calculation path.
