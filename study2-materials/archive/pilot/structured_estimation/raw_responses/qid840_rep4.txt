Item analysis for 8x/5 = 40 with two student claims.

Verifying Tom: He says 8x = 8. The correct move to eliminate /5 is to multiply both sides by 5, yielding 8x = 200. Tom obtained 8, which is 40/5 — he divided when he should have multiplied. This directly exemplifies the tested misconception. Tom is wrong.

Verifying Katie: She says x/5 = 5. Dividing both sides of 8x/5 = 40 by 8 yields x/5 = 5. Checking: if x/5 = 5, then x = 25, and 8(25)/5 = 200/5 = 40. Confirmed — Katie is correct.

Answer is B.

Difficulty considerations: This is a multi-layered item. Students must:
1. Understand what valid equation manipulation looks like
2. Check Tom's work (identify the inverse-operation error)
3. Check Katie's work (verify an unusual but valid first step)
4. Synthesize both judgments into a single answer choice

The "who is correct" structure is well-suited to diagnostic assessment because it forces engagement with the misconception directly. Students can't just solve the equation and pick the numerical answer.

Comparing to calibration anchors: The factorising "who is correct" item (also testing a misconception about sign rules) had classical difficulty 0.473. That item required knowledge of factorising quadratics, which is arguably a higher-level skill. This equation-solving item uses more fundamental algebra but the fraction makes it trickier than basic linear equations.

I think difficulty will be moderate — around 0.47. The IRT difficulty should be near 0.35, placing it between the function machine item (0.002) and the factorising item (0.404). Discrimination around 1.20 — the "who is correct" format introduces some noise but the item still targets the misconception clearly. Guessing parameter modest at 0.12, since partial reasoning can eliminate some options.
