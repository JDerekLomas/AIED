This item requires students to evaluate four arithmetic expressions involving negative numbers and identify which equals -20. The correct answer is B: -28 - (-4) × 2.

Let me evaluate each option:
A) 2 × (-2) - (-4) × 4 = -4 - (-16) = -4 + 16 = 12. Not -20.
B) -28 - (-4) × 2 = -28 - (-8) = -28 + 8 = -20. Correct.
C) (-5)^2 + 5 = 25 + 5 = 30. Not -20.
D) (-42) ÷ (-2) + 1 = 21 + 1 = 22. Not -20.

The misconception tested is "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer." This is highly relevant here. In option B, students must correctly compute (-4) × 2 = -8, then -28 - (-8) = -28 + 8 = -20. A student with the misconception might incorrectly evaluate other expressions. For instance, in option C, if a student believes (-5)^2 = -25, then -25 + 5 = -20, making C appear correct. Similarly in option D, if (-42) ÷ (-2) is wrongly computed as -21, then -21 + 1 = -20.

So distractors C and D become very attractive to students holding this misconception. Distractor A is less plausible for this misconception but involves multiple negative operations that could trip students up through order of operations errors.

This item has moderate cognitive load: students must evaluate all four expressions, each involving 2-3 operations with negative numbers. The concept complexity is moderate - it's fundamentally about arithmetic with negative numbers but requires BIDMAS awareness too. Comparing to calibration items, the factorising item (classical difficulty 0.473) tested the same misconception. This item is somewhat more computationally demanding but more concrete. I'd estimate slightly higher difficulty than the factorising item since students must evaluate all four options and the distractors are cleverly designed to exploit the target misconception.
