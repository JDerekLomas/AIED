Item: 4 + 12 / (2+2)

Working through the solution: parentheses first gives (2+2)=4, division next gives 12/4=3, addition last gives 4+3=7. Correct answer is B.

Let me think carefully about how UK secondary students would approach this. The tested misconception is "carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order." A student with this misconception would compute 4+12=16, then 16/(2+2)=16/4=4 (distractor D) or 16/2=8, 8+2=10 (distractor A). Actually, a strict left-to-right reading might go: 4+12=16, 16/2=8, 8+2=10. But some students might still respect brackets while ignoring division priority - those students would get the right answer here since the division is with a bracketed expression.

Wait, that's an important point. The left-to-right misconception manifests differently depending on whether students at least respect brackets. If they respect brackets but otherwise go left-to-right: 4+12=16, 16/(4)=4. That's distractor D. If they ignore brackets too: 4+12=16, 16/2=8, 8+2=10. That's distractor A.

This means the distractors actually capture two different severity levels of the misconception, which could diffuse the error across multiple options. This might make discrimination slightly lower than a clean two-option split.

For calibration: the BIDMAS item (item 2) had b=-0.245, a=1.552 with classical difficulty 0.134. That item was more complex in arithmetic. This item might be slightly harder than that one because of the multiple ways to go wrong with brackets+division, or slightly easier because the brackets make the structure more visible. I'll estimate somewhere close: classical difficulty around 0.22, b around -0.05. I'm pushing difficulty slightly higher than my initial instinct because of the multiple error pathways.

Discrimination might be moderate (around 1.3) since errors split across distractors. Guessing low.
