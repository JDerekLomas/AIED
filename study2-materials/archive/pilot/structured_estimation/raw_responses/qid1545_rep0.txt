Let me work through this item carefully.

The question asks students to compare two expressions:
- Left side: 8 + 12 ÷ 4
- Right side: (8 + 12) ÷ 4

Left side (using correct order of operations): 12 ÷ 4 = 3, then 8 + 3 = 11.
Right side: (8 + 12) = 20, then 20 ÷ 4 = 5.
So 11 > 5, and the answer is A (>).

The misconception tested is "carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order." A student with this misconception would compute the left side as (8+12) ÷ 4 = 5, getting the same result on both sides, and choose C (=).

Looking at the calibration examples, the order-of-operations item (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.245. That item involved decimals and fractions which adds complexity, but the BODMAS error there was also very common.

This item is conceptually simpler — whole numbers only, no fractions — but the comparison format is somewhat unusual. Students must evaluate both sides and compare. The misconception of left-to-right processing is extremely common among younger secondary students. The distractor C (=) is highly plausible for students who ignore order of operations.

However, option D (≥) is not particularly attractive, and option B (<) requires a specific different error. The main trap is C. I'd estimate this is a relatively easy-to-moderate item — students who know BODMAS will get it right, and those who don't will likely choose C.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.25-0.30 — somewhat harder than the calibration BODMAS item because the comparison format adds cognitive load, but the numbers are simpler. The discrimination should be moderate-to-good since it cleanly separates those who know order of operations from those who don't.
