Item: 2/7 + 1/7 = ? with correct answer 3/7 (C).

This tests whether students can add fractions with like denominators. The key misconception is adding denominators too, giving 3/14.

Let me approach this from a student perspective. A Year 7 student who learned fractions properly would immediately see same denominators and add numerators: 2+1=3, keep 7, get 3/7. Takes about 5 seconds.

A student with the misconception might think: "2+1=3 on top, 7+7=14 on bottom, so 3/14." This is option D. Research shows this misconception is common among students who treat fractions as two independent whole numbers rather than a single quantity.

Option B (2/49) is an unusual distractor -- it looks like (2×1)/(7×7), mixing up addition with multiplication procedures. This might catch a small number of students.

Option A (2/7) is weak as a distractor. I can't identify a clear misconception path to it. Maybe a student who ignores the 1/7 entirely?

For difficulty estimation: Looking at the calibration set, the easiest item (solving -5=p+10) has classical difficulty 0.167. That equation requires understanding inverse operations. This fraction question requires knowing that same-denominator fractions add by keeping the denominator. Both are foundational, but I'd argue this fraction item might actually attract more errors because the "add everything" misconception is so natural.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.15-0.25. Let me split the difference at 0.19. IRT b around -0.7. Good discrimination because the misconception creates a clean separation between those who understand and those who don't.
