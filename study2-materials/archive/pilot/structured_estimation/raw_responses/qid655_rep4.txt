Examining (-6) x star = -8 with answer D (8/6).

To solve: divide -8 by -6. Two negatives in division yield a positive: 8/6. This tests whether students know that a negative times a positive equals a negative (so the star must be positive to make the product negative when multiplied by -6... wait, let me reconsider).

Actually: (-6) x star = -8. If star is positive (8/6), then (-6) x (8/6) = -48/6 = -8. Yes, that works. So the answer IS positive because negative times positive equals negative, matching the -8 on the right side.

The misconception "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative" would lead a student to think: "I need negative times something to get -8, so the something must also be negative" — leading them to pick C (-8/6). But actually, negative times POSITIVE gives negative, which is what we need here.

This is a subtle point. Students who have partially learned sign rules might think "negative result means both factors have the same sign" which is wrong. The correct reasoning is: since one factor is negative and the product is negative, the other factor must be positive.

This makes the item potentially quite tricky. The student needs to reason about signs carefully rather than apply a rote rule. The fraction aspect (knowing to divide 8 by 6, not 6 by 8) adds additional load.

For calibration: I think this is moderately difficult. The combination of sign reasoning and fraction construction makes it comparable to or slightly harder than the Tom/Katie factorising item (0.473 classical difficulty). The distractors form a systematic 2x2 pattern (sign x fraction orientation) which means each distractor captures a specific error — this typically leads to good discrimination but also spreads incorrect responses across multiple options rather than concentrating them.

I'll estimate slightly higher difficulty than my initial instinct: classical difficulty around 0.52, IRT difficulty around 0.50. The discrimination should be moderate — the systematic distractor structure helps differentiate students but the 2x2 pattern may dilute the signal somewhat. Guessing around 0.15 since there's no obvious way to eliminate options without some knowledge.
