Item: 3/4 - 1/4 × 1/5. Correct answer C (7/10). Misconception: left-to-right processing ignoring operator precedence.

Correct path: multiply 1/4 × 1/5 = 1/20, then 3/4 - 1/20 = 15/20 - 1/20 = 14/20 = 7/10.
Misconception path: 3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4, then 2/4 × 1/5 = 2/20 = 1/10 → B.

Let me think about this from a student population perspective. UK secondary students learn BODMAS early (typically Year 7), and fraction operations are practiced extensively through Years 7-9. By the time students sit diagnostic assessments, most will have encountered both topics multiple times.

However, the combination of BODMAS with fraction arithmetic is less commonly practiced than either in isolation. This "integration" demand — applying BODMAS within a fraction context — is where errors creep in. The subtraction 3/4 - 1/4 is so temptingly clean that even students who nominally know BODMAS might be lured into computing it first.

Comparing carefully to the calibration item (0.4 - 1/5 × 3, difficulty 0.134): that item had a decimal mixed with fractions. Arguably, this item is slightly harder because:
1. All fractions require more working memory for fraction subtraction with unlike denominators
2. The 3/4 - 1/4 pattern is more tempting than 0.4 - 1/5

But counterarguments: the numbers here are smaller and simpler; 1/4 × 1/5 is trivial multiplication.

On balance, I think this item is modestly harder than the calibration. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.24 — roughly one in four students gets it wrong. This is still on the easier side of the calibration range.

For discrimination: the misconception maps neatly to distractor B, which should produce good discrimination. Students above a certain ability threshold will almost all get this right. I'd estimate a around 1.3-1.5.

Guessing should be minimal since students with the misconception will confidently choose B rather than guess randomly. Those who know BODMAS will choose C. Very few students will end up truly guessing.
