This item tests substitution into y = 3x^2 with x = 0.3. The correct answer is B: 3 * (0.3)^2 = 3 * 0.09 = 0.27.

The key misconception is order of operations—specifically, students who multiply 3 * 0.3 first (getting 0.9) and then square (getting 0.81, answer A). This is a classic BIDMAS error where exponentiation should precede multiplication.

Let me consider each distractor:
- A (0.81): (3 * 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81. This is the primary misconception trap.
- C (1.8): Possibly from treating x^2 as 2x, so 3 * 2 * 0.3 = 1.8. Or perhaps 3 * 0.3 * 2 = 1.8.
- D (2.7): Could come from 3 * 0.3 * 3 = 2.7, or thinking 0.3^2 = 0.9 (a squaring error) then 3 * 0.9 = 2.7.

Distractor D is interesting—if a student thinks squaring 0.3 means multiplying by the exponent base somehow, or confuses 0.3^2 with 0.3 * 10 * 3... Actually, 0.3^2 might be mistakenly computed as 0.9 (multiplying 0.3 by 3 instead of by itself), yielding 3 * 0.9 = 2.7. That's also quite plausible.

So we have two strong distractors (A and D), making this moderately difficult. Comparing to calibration: the BIDMAS item had difficulty 0.134 but involved fractions and subtraction in a simpler setup. This item's decimal squaring component and multiple plausible errors suggest higher difficulty.

I'd estimate this is somewhat harder than the calibration BIDMAS item but not as hard as the factorising item. Perhaps around 0.30-0.40 classical difficulty.
