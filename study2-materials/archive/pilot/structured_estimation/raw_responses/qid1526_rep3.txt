This item tests fraction addition with unlike denominators: 3/5 + 2/7.

Step-by-step solution: Find common denominator 35, rewrite as 21/35 + 10/35 = 31/35 (B).

Key consideration: the visual format uses a "fraction wall" or pyramid structure where two lower circles sum to the upper one. This is a standard UK maths presentation, particularly common in KS3 diagnostic assessments. Students should be familiar with this format.

Distractor analysis:
- A (11/35): Wrong numerator, correct denominator. Could arise from 3*2+5=11? Or perhaps 3+7+2-1=11? This seems like an arithmetic error rather than a systematic misconception.
- B (31/35): Correct.
- C (5/12): The classic "add tops and bottoms" misconception. Very attractive to weaker students.
- D (5/35): Adds numerators correctly notes denominator should be 35. This is interesting -- it catches students who partially understand (they know to multiply denominators) but don't convert numerators.

The misconception of adding numerators and denominators is extremely common and well-documented. However, this is a skill that gets extensive practice in UK KS3 curriculum, so by the time students are in Year 9+, many will have overcome it. The population tested (ages 11-16) spans a wide range, so difficulty depends heavily on the age distribution.

Calibration comparison: The solving equation items range from 0.167 to 0.569 in classical difficulty. Fraction addition with unlike denominators is a KS3 skill that many students find challenging. I'd place it around 0.30-0.40.

For discrimination: this item should discriminate well because it tests a specific, well-defined skill. Students either know how to find common denominators or they don't. I expect a value around 1.2-1.5.

Guessing should be very low -- students with the misconception will gravitate toward C, not guess randomly.
