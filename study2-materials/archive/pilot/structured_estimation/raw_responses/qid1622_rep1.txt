This item presents a table of values for the linear equation 3x + 2y = 6 and asks what y equals when x = 0. Substituting x = 0 gives 0 + 2y = 6, so y = 3.

The misconception is about using the same operation rather than the inverse. Distractor D (y=12) would result from multiplying 6 by 2 rather than dividing — this is the classic "same operation" error. Distractor B (y=2) might come from confusing coefficients or thinking y equals the coefficient in front of y. Distractor C (y=1.5) could arise from dividing 3 by 2, perhaps confusing the coefficient of x with something relevant.

The table context is somewhat unusual compared to a plain "solve for y" question. Students need to understand what a table of values means and connect the star to the y-value when x=0. This adds a layer of interpretation beyond pure algebraic manipulation.

Comparing with calibration: The equation-solving items show a range. The simplest (-5 = p+10) had difficulty 0.167. The inequality item had 0.569 but was considerably harder algebraically. This item sits in between — the algebra is simple but the contextual framing (table of values) requires understanding. I'd place it around 0.20-0.25 difficulty.

The discrimination should be moderate — students who understand substitution should get this right consistently, while those who don't will fall for distractors.
