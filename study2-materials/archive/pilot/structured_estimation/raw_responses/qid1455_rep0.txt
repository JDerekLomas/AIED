This item asks students to translate a verbal description of operations into an algebraic equation. The key concept is order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) -- specifically, understanding that "add five then multiply by four" means the addition happens first, requiring brackets: 4(n+5)=17.

Looking at the distractors:
- A) n+5*4=17 is the classic left-to-right error -- writing operations in order without brackets, which due to BIDMAS would actually compute 5*4 first. This directly tests the stated misconception.
- B) 4n+5=17 confuses "multiply by four" with "four times the number" and places addition second.
- C) n^4+5=17 confuses "multiply by 4" with "raise to the power 4" -- a less common error.
- D) 4(n+5)=17 is correct.

Distractor A is very plausible because students who read left-to-right and don't understand why brackets are needed will select it. B is also somewhat plausible as it uses the right operations but in the wrong structure. C is weaker.

Comparing to calibration items: The order-of-operations item (0.4 - 1/5 * 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT b = -0.245. That was computational; this is translational (words to algebra), which adds abstraction. However, the verbal framing is quite clear and scaffolded. I'd expect this to be moderately easy but harder than the pure computation BODMAS item since forming the equation requires understanding bracket notation.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.30-0.35, placing it near the function machine item in difficulty. The misconception of left-to-right processing is strong and common, but the verbal cues ("add five THEN multiply") may actually help some students see the grouping. Discrimination should be reasonable -- students who understand brackets vs those who don't will separate well.
