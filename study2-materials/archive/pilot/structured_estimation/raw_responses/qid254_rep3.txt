Let me analyze this item carefully.

The question asks students to identify the correct calculation for finding the mean of 0, 1, 3, 4, 7.

The correct answer is A: (1+3+4+7)/5 = 15/5 = 3

Wait, let me check this. The mean of 0, 1, 3, 4, 7 should be (0+1+3+4+7)/5 = 15/5 = 3.

Looking at option A: (1+3+4+7)/5 = 15/5 = 3 - This is correct because adding 0 doesn't change the sum.

Option B: 0+1+3+4+7 ÷ 5 - This would be interpreted as 0+1+3+4+(7÷5) = 0+1+3+4+1.4 = 9.4 if following order of operations correctly. This tests the misconception about order of operations.

Option C: (1+3+4+7)/4 = 15/4 = 3.75 - This excludes 0 from both the sum AND the count, which is incorrect.

Option D: None of them

The misconception being tested is "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order" - students who don't understand BIDMAS/BODMAS might think option B is correct because they read it left to right.

Let me think about difficulty:
- The concept of mean is basic (sum ÷ count)
- The twist is recognizing that 0 in the numerator doesn't affect the sum but DOES affect the count
- Students need to understand order of operations to see why B is wrong
- Option C is a trap for students who think 0 "doesn't count"

This is a conceptual question requiring:
1. Understanding of mean calculation
2. Understanding that 0 counts as a data point
3. Understanding order of operations (to reject B)

The calibration example with the same misconception (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) had difficulty 0.134 (proportion incorrect), which was relatively easy. However, that was a direct calculation, while this requires more reasoning about which expression is correct.

This question requires students to:
1. Know the mean formula
2. Recognize that 0 is still a data value (affects n)
3. Understand order of operations to reject B
4. Evaluate multiple options

The distractors are quite plausible:
- B looks like the correct formula written linearly (common student error)
- C might trap students who think 0 "doesn't count"

Given the multiple concepts involved and the plausibility of distractors, I'd estimate this is moderately difficult.

For discrimination: The question clearly separates students who understand both mean calculation AND order of operations from those who don't. This should discriminate well.

The question is clear and age-appropriate for UK secondary school (mean is taught early in secondary).
