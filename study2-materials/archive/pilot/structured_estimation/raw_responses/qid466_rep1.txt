Analyzing: -3/4 * star = -1. The student needs to isolate the star by dividing both sides by -3/4, giving star = (-1) / (-3/4) = (-1) * (-4/3) = 4/3.

Key skills required:
1. Understanding division of fractions (multiply by reciprocal)
2. Understanding sign rules for multiplication/division of negative numbers
3. Algebraic reasoning to isolate an unknown

The misconception being tested - "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative" - would lead students to choose B (-4/3). They'd correctly find the magnitude 4/3 but incorrectly assign a negative sign.

Distractor analysis:
- C (3/4): A student might think "what times -3/4 gives -1" and reason that since -3/4 is close to -1, the answer should be close to 1, picking 3/4 without properly computing the reciprocal. Or they might confuse multiplicative inverse with just changing the sign.
- D (-3/4): A very weak student might just repeat the given fraction.

This question requires multiple conceptual layers - fractions, reciprocals, and negative number rules. Compared to the calibration item on factorising (same misconception, difficulty 0.473), this item adds fraction manipulation which many students find challenging. I'd place it slightly harder.

The discrimination should be reasonable since the item cleanly tests whether students understand negative multiplication rules, though the additional fraction complexity might add noise. Some guessing is possible since a student might reason that "positive times negative = negative" and eliminate C and D, then guess between A and B.
