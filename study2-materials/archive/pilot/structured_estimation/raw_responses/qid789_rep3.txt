Item: 3/10 + 5/10, answer in simplest form. Correct: C (4/5).

I want to focus on what the student population looks like. These are UK students aged 11-16 taking diagnostic assessments. The age range is wide. For 15-16 year olds, this is trivial. For 11-12 year olds still developing fraction fluency, this could be challenging.

The misconception tested (adding numerators and denominators) is one of the most well-documented in mathematics education research. Studies consistently show 20-40% of middle school students make this error, depending on age and context. However, when denominators are already the same, the error rate drops significantly because students recognize they're adding "like" parts.

The real difficulty driver here is distractor B (8/10). "Simplest form" is an additional requirement that many students overlook or struggle with. Students need to recognize that 8 and 10 share a common factor of 2. This is not hard, but it's a second step that catches careless or less experienced students.

Distractor D (4/10) is weak -- it's hard to construct a natural reasoning path to it. This reduces the effective number of distractors, which could slightly inflate guessing.

Comparing to calibration items: This is simpler than all five calibration items conceptually. The easiest calibration item had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.702. I think this item is harder than that because the simplification step and strong distractors add difficulty. I'd place classical difficulty around 0.25, IRT difficulty around -0.30.

Discrimination: the item neatly separates ability levels through its distractors (misconception holders -> A, partial knowledge -> B, full understanding -> C), suggesting good discrimination around 1.3-1.5.
