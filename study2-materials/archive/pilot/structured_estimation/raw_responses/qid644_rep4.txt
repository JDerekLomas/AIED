The item asks: when expanding (2p-1)(3p-4), what is the product of -1 and -4 (indicated by arrows in a diagram)? Correct answer is A: +4.

Let me approach this from the student perspective at different ability levels:

Low ability students (below average): These students likely struggle with signed number rules and may not even understand what "multiplying the two terms" means in context. They might guess or default to B (-4) thinking that since both numbers are negative, the answer must be negative. Some might add instead of multiply, getting -5 (option D).

Middle ability students: This is where the item should discriminate most. Students at this level know bracket expansion procedures but may have shaky foundations in signed arithmetic. The misconception that negative times negative equals negative is remarkably persistent -- research shows it persists even into adult populations. These students will confidently choose B.

High ability students: Will correctly identify +4 with little difficulty. The task is straightforward for anyone who has internalized the sign rule.

Comparing to calibration anchors:
- The easiest calibration items (equation solving, order of operations) had classical difficulties of 0.13-0.17 and b values of -0.7 to -0.2. Those tested procedural misconceptions.
- The Tom/Katie item (same misconception) had 0.473 difficulty and b=0.404. That was structurally more complex.
- The inequality item was hardest at 0.569, b=0.808.

This item should fall between the easy procedural items and the Tom/Katie item. It tests the same misconception as Tom/Katie but more directly. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.37 -- easier than Tom/Katie because the task is simpler, but harder than the basic equation items because the misconception is strong and the algebraic context adds overhead.

IRT difficulty around 0.15, discrimination around 1.45 (the clean targeting of one misconception should yield good discrimination), guessing around 0.05 (students tend to have strong but wrong beliefs here rather than guessing).
