Examining this item about converting a sequence of operations into correct algebraic notation.

The operations: start with n, subtract 5, divide by 8, add 4, multiply by 7.

Building up: n-5, then (n-5)/8, then (n-5)/8 + 4, then 7((n-5)/8 + 4).

Jo's version 7((n-5)/8 + 4) is correct — it nests the addition of 4 inside the multiplication by 7, preserving the intended order.

Paul's version 7((n-5) ÷ 8) + 4 is wrong — the +4 occurs after the multiplication by 7, which means Paul's expression performs multiply-by-7 before add-4, reversing those two operations.

Answer: A (Only Jo).

Now for difficulty estimation. I need to consider what makes this item challenging:

1. Students must parse two different algebraic expressions with brackets — this requires algebraic reading fluency.
2. The difference between the expressions is a single structural detail (placement of +4 relative to the outer brackets).
3. The function machine context helps ground the problem but the notation itself is abstract.

A key consideration: many students at KS3/KS4 level struggle with nested brackets. Research on BIDMAS understanding suggests that even after instruction, a significant proportion of students default to left-to-right processing. The tested misconception is quite prevalent.

However, the function machine scaffold makes this more accessible than a purely symbolic question. Students who carefully trace through each step can arrive at the answer even without deep algebraic fluency.

Comparing to calibration: the BIDMAS item (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) was easy (0.134 incorrect). But that was computation, not expression interpretation. This is considerably more demanding. I'd place it closer to the factorising item difficulty (0.473) or slightly above.

My estimates: classical difficulty ~0.52, IRT b ~0.50. The item should discriminate well because it targets a specific, well-defined skill. Guessing probability is moderate — the "who is correct" format has some inherent structure that allows partial-knowledge responses.
