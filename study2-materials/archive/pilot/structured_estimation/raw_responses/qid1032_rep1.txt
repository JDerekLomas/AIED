The target item asks students to evaluate 5 + 4 x 3. This is a classic BIDMAS/BODMAS question. Students must know to perform multiplication before addition.

Correct solution: 4 x 3 = 12, then 5 + 12 = 17 (answer B).

The primary misconception tested is performing operations left to right: 5 + 4 = 9, then 9 x 3 = 27 (answer A). This is one of the most persistent misconceptions in early secondary mathematics. Even students who have been taught BIDMAS frequently revert to left-to-right processing under time pressure or when not actively thinking about order of operations.

Looking at distractors C (60) and D (12): C=60 might come from multiplying all three numbers (5x4x3), which is unusual. D=12 is just the multiplication part (4x3) without the addition - a careless or incomplete answer. Neither C nor D is as compelling as A.

The calibration example with the same misconception (0.4 - 1/5 x 3) had classical difficulty 0.134, meaning 86.6% got it correct. That's quite easy despite involving fractions and decimals. The present item uses only whole numbers and is arguably even more straightforward, but the left-to-right pull of "5 + 4" at the start could be stronger here because the addition appears first. In the calibration item, students see a decimal and fraction which might actually cue them to think more carefully.

I think this item might be slightly harder than the calibration example because the left-to-right trap is more natural with simple integers. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.18-0.28, IRT difficulty around -0.3, with good discrimination since option A cleanly captures the misconception.
