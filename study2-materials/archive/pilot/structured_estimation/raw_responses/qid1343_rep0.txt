This item tests order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) with the expression 12 / 2 + 1 x 2. The correct procedure is to perform division and multiplication before addition: 12 / 2 = 6, then 1 x 2 = 2, then 6 + 2 = 8 (answer D).

The misconception tested is "carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order." A student with this misconception would compute: 12 / 2 = 6, then 6 + 1 = 7, then 7 x 2 = 14, arriving at answer C. This is a very common error pattern.

Looking at distractor analysis:
- A (9): Could come from 12 / 2 = 6, then 1 x 2 = 2, then miscomputing 6 + 2 + 1 = 9, or some other partial error. Less obvious path.
- B (3): Perhaps 12 / (2 + 1) x 2 / something? Hard to see a clean path. Maybe 12 / (2+1) = 4, then 4 x 2 = 8... no. Or 12 / 2 / (1+1) = 3. Grouping errors.
- C (14): Left-to-right: 12/2=6, 6+1=7, 7x2=14. This is the primary misconception distractor.
- D (8): Correct.

Comparing to calibration: the BODMAS calibration item (0.4 - 1/5 x 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.245. That item involved decimals and fractions which adds complexity, yet was easy. This item uses only integers and basic operations, which is simpler. However, the left-to-right misconception is very strong for this type of expression. The calibration item's low difficulty suggests students at this level mostly know BODMAS. But this item has a very tempting distractor (C=14).

I'd estimate this is relatively easy but not trivial. Classical difficulty around 0.20-0.25 (proportion incorrect). The discrimination should be moderate-to-good since it cleanly separates those who know BODMAS from those who don't.
