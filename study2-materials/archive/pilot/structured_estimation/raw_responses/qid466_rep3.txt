Item: -3/4 * star = -1, find star. Correct answer: A (4/3).

This item sits at the intersection of three topics: solving equations with multiplicative unknowns, fraction arithmetic (reciprocals), and negative number multiplication rules. For UK secondary students, each of these individually is manageable by Year 8-9, but combining them raises the difficulty.

The misconception tested is about negative * negative sign rules. Distractor B (-4/3) is the primary misconception trap. Students who correctly find the reciprocal but misapply sign rules will choose B.

Distractor C (3/4) catches students who flip the sign but don't take the reciprocal - they essentially just make -3/4 positive. Distractor D (-3/4) is for students who think the star should equal the coefficient itself.

Thinking about the population: In a typical mixed-ability UK secondary cohort, I'd expect:
- Strong students (maybe 45-50%) get A correctly
- Students with the target misconception (maybe 25-30%) choose B
- Students confused about reciprocals (maybe 10-15%) choose C
- Weak students (maybe 5-10%) choose D

This gives a classical difficulty (proportion incorrect) around 0.50-0.55.

Comparing to the calibration set, the factorising item (same misconception) had difficulty 0.473. That item required expanding brackets mentally which is arguably more complex. But this item's fraction component and the less familiar "missing factor" format could offset that. I'll estimate slightly higher difficulty than the factorising item.

For discrimination, the item tests a clear conceptual boundary. Students who understand sign rules and reciprocals will succeed; those missing either concept will fail. This should give decent discrimination, perhaps a=1.2-1.3.

Guessing should be low-moderate. The distractors are well-targeted so random guessing among all four is unlikely - students will gravitate toward their specific error pattern.
