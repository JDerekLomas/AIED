This item tests whether students can correctly multiply (-8) x (-2) = +16 in the context of expanding double brackets. The misconception is that multiplying two negatives gives a negative.

Let me think about the student population. UK secondary students aged 11-16 encounter bracket expansion typically in Year 8-9 (ages 12-14). The sign rule for multiplication is taught earlier but remains a persistent source of error even into GCSE years.

The item is quite focused. Unlike the Tom/Katie calibration item (same misconception, difficulty 0.473), this one doesn't require students to do the full expansion -- just one specific multiplication. The arrows make it explicit which terms to multiply. This directness should make it easier.

However, I note that the answer options include -10 (addition), -6 (subtraction?), +16 (correct), and -16 (misconception). The presence of -16 as a distractor is very targeted. Students who know they need to multiply but get the sign wrong will go straight to D. Students who don't know what operation to do might pick A (-10, addition) or C (-6).

Looking at the calibration set for anchoring: the easiest item (solving -5=p+10) had classical difficulty 0.167. The hardest (solving inequality) had 0.569. The factorising item with the same misconception was 0.473. I think this item is a bit easier than the factorising one -- maybe 0.30-0.35 classical difficulty -- because it's more straightforward and only tests one step.

For IRT parameters: discrimination should be good (1.2-1.5 range) as it cleanly tests one concept. Guessing should be relatively low given the strong distractor pull.
