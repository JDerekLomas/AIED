This item asks students to find the y-intercept of y=(x-8)(x-6). To solve, substitute x=0: y=(0-8)(0-6)=(-8)(-6)=48, giving (0,48) which is answer C.

The misconception tested is "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer." A student with this misconception would compute (-8)(-6)=-48 and choose D.

Looking at the distractors:
- A: (0,-14) -- student may have added -8 and -6 instead of multiplying, getting -14
- B: (0,8) and (0,6) -- student confuses y-intercept with x-intercepts, and also gets the x-intercepts wrong (they should be 8 and 6 on the x-axis, not y-axis)
- C: (0,48) -- correct
- D: (0,-48) -- the target misconception, multiplying negatives incorrectly

Comparing to calibration items: The factorising item (Tom and Katie) also tests "multiplying two negatives gives negative" and has classical difficulty 0.473 and IRT b=0.404. This item is somewhat similar but requires knowing how to find y-intercepts AND correctly multiplying negatives. The procedural demand is moderate -- substitute x=0, then multiply two negative numbers.

The distractors are quite plausible. D directly targets the misconception. A catches students who add instead of multiply. B catches students who confuse intercept types. This should be a moderately difficult item, perhaps slightly harder than the factorising calibration item because it combines intercept knowledge with negative multiplication.

I estimate classical difficulty around 0.50, IRT difficulty around 0.45. Discrimination should be decent since the distractors target specific errors.
