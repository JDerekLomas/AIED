This item asks students to add two fractions with the same denominator (3/10 + 5/10) and simplify. This is a foundational fractions skill, typically introduced around age 11-12 in the UK curriculum (Key Stage 3).

The correct answer is C (4/5), which requires: (1) adding numerators to get 8/10, (2) simplifying by dividing both by 2.

The distractors:
- A (8/20): adds both numerators AND denominators -- this is exactly the misconception being tested. Very plausible for students who don't understand fraction addition.
- B (8/10): correct addition but fails to simplify. This will catch many students who can add but forget/can't simplify.
- D (4/10): seems like a partial simplification error or perhaps adding numerators wrong then simplifying.

Looking at the calibration items, the easiest had classical difficulty 0.134 (order of operations) and 0.167 (solving simple linear equation). This item involves simpler math concepts but the simplification step and the strong misconception about adding denominators could trip up weaker students. The misconception of adding numerators and denominators is extremely common among younger students.

However, this is a very basic item. I'd expect most KS3/KS4 students to get this right. The distractor B (8/10) is particularly attractive because students who correctly add but don't simplify will choose it. Distractor A targets the specific misconception.

I estimate around 25-30% of students would get this wrong, placing it as moderate-easy difficulty. The discrimination should be reasonable since this separates students who understand fractions from those who don't.
