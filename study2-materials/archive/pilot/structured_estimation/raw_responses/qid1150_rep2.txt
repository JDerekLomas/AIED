Target: Rearrange F = v^2/r for v. Correct answer: v = sqrt(rF) (option C).

This is a subject-changing problem involving two inverse operations: undoing division by r (multiply) and undoing squaring (square root). Students need to understand both operations and apply them in the correct order.

Distractor analysis:
- A: v = rF^2. Student squares F rather than square-rooting, suggesting they applied the same operation (squaring) rather than the inverse (square root). This directly tests the named misconception.
- B: v = sqrt(F/r). Student divided by r rather than multiplied, applying the same operation as in the formula. Also tests the named misconception but for the division step.
- C: v = sqrt(rF). Correct.
- D: v = r*sqrt(F). Student correctly takes the square root of F but incorrectly handles the r -- pulling it outside the radical and multiplying rather than including it under the square root. This is a different error related to misunderstanding how radicals work with products.

All three distractors are quite plausible. Option B is particularly tempting because the F/r structure mirrors the original equation. Option D shows partial knowledge.

Comparing to calibration: This item requires more sophisticated algebra than the linear equation items. The need to deal with a squared variable and rearranging a physics-style formula elevates the difficulty. I'd compare it most closely to the inequality item (classical difficulty 0.569, b = 0.808) since both require multi-step algebraic manipulation beyond basic equation solving.

However, formula rearrangement might be more practiced in science contexts, which could lower the difficulty slightly. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.55 and b around 0.60.
