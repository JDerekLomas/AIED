This item asks students to factorise x^2 - x - 6. The correct answer is (x-3)(x+2) = x^2 + 2x - 3x - 6 = x^2 - x - 6. Check.

The misconception tested is "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer." This maps to distractor B: (x-3)(x-2) = x^2 - 2x - 3x + 6 = x^2 - 5x + 6. A student who thinks (-3)(-2) = -6 instead of +6 would choose B, since they need the constant term to be -6 and think two negatives work.

Distractor C: (x+3)(x+2) = x^2 + 5x + 6 -- wrong signs entirely.
Distractor D: (x+3)(x-2) = x^2 - 2x + 3x - 6 = x^2 + x - 6 -- gets the middle term sign wrong.

Comparing to the calibration item about Tom and Katie's factorising (classical difficulty 0.473, IRT b = 0.404), that item required evaluating someone else's factorisations and understanding negative multiplication. This item is more direct -- just factorise -- but still requires understanding how signs work in factorisation.

I'd expect this to be moderately difficult, similar to the Tom/Katie item but perhaps slightly easier since it's a more standard presentation. Students need to find two numbers that multiply to -6 and add to -1. The distractors are well-designed around sign errors.

Classical difficulty estimate: around 0.40-0.50. The factorisation concept is GCSE-level, typically age 14-16. Discrimination should be decent as this separates students who understand signs from those who don't.
