Item: 12d - 3 = 0, solve for d. Answer: d = 1/4.

Step-by-step solution: Add 3 to both sides -> 12d = 3. Divide both sides by 12 -> d = 3/12 = 1/4.

This tests a fundamental algebra skill. The equation itself is not complex, but there are several sources of potential difficulty:

1. The answer is a unit fraction (1/4), which is less common in early equation-solving practice where answers tend to be integers. Students may doubt an answer of 1/4 and look for an integer alternative.

2. The coefficient 12 is relatively large compared to the constant 3, creating the fractional result. Students who are used to "nice" numbers may struggle.

3. The distractors include both the sign-error version (-1/4) and integer alternatives (4, -4), giving students multiple "escape routes" from the correct answer.

Thinking about population-level performance: This would typically be taught in Year 7-8 (ages 11-13) in UK curriculum. By Year 9, most students should handle this. Across the full 11-16 age range, I'd expect around 65-75% to get it right, putting classical difficulty (proportion incorrect) at 0.25-0.35.

Comparing to the calibration set: The simple one-step equation had difficulty 0.167. This two-step equation with a fractional answer should be harder. The function machine item (also same misconception, b = 0.002) required understanding function machines, a different representation. I'd place this item's IRT difficulty around 0.0 to 0.15 -- slightly harder than the simple equation but easier than items requiring more complex reasoning.

Discrimination: The misconception is well-targeted by distractor A, but distractor B could catch students making a different type of error. This spread of error types might slightly reduce discrimination. I'll estimate a = 1.15-1.35.
