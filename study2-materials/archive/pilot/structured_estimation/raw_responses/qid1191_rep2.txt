Item: Solve 20t - 5 = 5t + 10. Correct: t = 1 (option B).

Step-by-step solution:
1. Subtract 5t from both sides: 15t - 5 = 10
2. Add 5 to both sides: 15t = 15
3. Divide by 15: t = 1

This is a 3-step linear equation with variables on both sides. In the UK National Curriculum, this falls under KS3/KS4 algebra. The large coefficient (20) might initially intimidate weaker students but the arithmetic simplifies cleanly.

Regarding the misconception "uses same operation rather than inverse": in this context, a student might try to "move" 5t to the left by adding rather than subtracting, or move -5 to the right by subtracting rather than adding. However, I notice that the specific distractor t = -1 could arise from collecting terms incorrectly by moving 20t to the right instead: 5t - 20t = -5 - 10 gives -15t = -15 gives t = 1 (still correct!). Or if signs are mishandled: -5 = 5t - 20t + 10, -15 = -15t, t = 1. The equation is somewhat forgiving. Let me think about what actually gives the wrong answers.

t = 0: Perhaps from 20t = 5t (ignoring constants) leading to t = 0 when student reasons "same coefficient ratio."
t = -1: Could come from 20t - 5t = -10 + 5 (moving with wrong signs), 15t = -5, t = -1/3... no. Or from 5 - 20t = 5t - 10, misarranging completely. Actually: if student does 20t - 5 - 5t - 10 = 0, gets 15t - 15 = 0, t = 1. Hard to get -1. Maybe from a completely different error.
t = 1/5: Could arise from dividing 5 by 25 or some coefficient confusion.

The distractors seem somewhat arbitrary, which might lower discrimination. But t = 1 is easy to verify by substitution (20-5 = 15, 5+10 = 15, checks out), and stronger students will likely do this.

Comparing to calibration: this should be harder than the simple p+10 = -5 item (0.167) but easier than the inequality (0.569). I'll estimate around 0.35 classical difficulty. The clean numbers and possibility of back-substitution make it somewhat accessible.
