Examining this diagnostic item about equation solving.

The equation: 15 = 2p - 4

Step 1 check: Going from 15 = 2p - 4, the operation on p's side is "- 4", so we should do "+ 4" to both sides. That gives 19 = 2p. Isaac writes 11 = 2p, which means he did 15 - 4 = 11. He applied the same operation (subtract) instead of the inverse (add). Step 1 is wrong.

Step 2 check: From his result 11 = 2p, the operation is "× 2", so we should do "÷ 2". That would give 5.5 = p. Isaac writes 22 = p, meaning he did 11 × 2 = 22. Again, same operation instead of inverse. Step 2 is wrong.

Both steps wrong → answer D.

Now let me think about difficulty from a different angle. What proportion of the student population holds this misconception firmly enough to select C?

In the calibration data, for the simple equation -5 = p + 10, only 16.7% got it wrong. That suggests most students CAN do basic inverse operations. But that was a one-step, very transparent problem. Here, the format is different: students must evaluate rather than execute, and two steps are presented.

However, I should also consider that the "evaluate someone else's work" format might actually help some students. When you see someone else's steps laid out, you can check each one more carefully than when you're doing the work yourself under time pressure. This could make the item slightly easier than expected.

On the other hand, the answer "both incorrect" (D) is psychologically the least attractive option in "who is correct" style items. Students tend to assume at least one step must be right, creating a bias away from D.

Balancing these factors: the misconception is common but not universal, the format adds some difficulty, and the distractor C is strong. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.42, placing it between the simple equation and the inequality item. IRT b around 0.30. Discrimination should be moderate-to-good since this is a clean diagnostic item.

One more consideration: the guessing parameter. With 4 options, random guessing gives 0.25 base rate. But D ("neither/both incorrect") options tend to be selected at below-chance rates by low-ability students who prefer to pick a positive answer. So effective guessing might be lower than 0.25 for this particular option.
