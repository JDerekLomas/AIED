The item presents a compound inequality -3 < 2x + 1 < 7 and asks for the solution.

To solve: subtract 1 from all three parts (-4 < 2x < 6), then divide by 2 (-2 < x < 3). This gives answer A.

Let me think about what makes this item challenging from a student perspective. The compound inequality notation itself can be unfamiliar -- many students first encounter inequalities as single comparisons. Seeing a "sandwich" inequality requires understanding that the variable expression is bounded on both sides and that any operation must be applied uniformly to all three parts.

The misconception tested is applying the same operation instead of the inverse. In practice, I find this misconception is very persistent, especially when students are first learning equation solving. However, by the time students encounter compound inequalities (typically Year 10-11), many have overcome this basic misconception for simple cases. The compound format might reintroduce errors though, as students are managing more cognitive load.

Distractor analysis:
- A: -2 < x < 3 (correct)
- B: -1 < x < 3 -- error on the left bound only. Could come from adding 1 to -3 (getting -2) then dividing by 2 (getting -1). This fits the tested misconception partially.
- C: -0.5 < x < 2.5 -- this is puzzling. Maybe from (-3+1)/4 = -0.5 and (7-1)/... hmm, (7+1)/... no. Actually if someone divided first: -3/2 < x + 1/2 < 7/2, giving -1.5 < x + 0.5 < 3.5, then -2 < x < 3. That gives the right answer. Maybe C comes from -3/2 = -1.5 then -1.5+1 = -0.5, and 7/2 = 3.5 then 3.5-1 = 2.5? That's doing operations in wrong order.
- D: -5 < x < 15 -- likely from multiplying by 2 instead of dividing. -3+1=-2... no. Or (-3-2) = -5, (7+2)*... hmm. Maybe (-3)*2+1 = -5, (7)*2+1 = 15. That's applying the operations forward instead of inverse.

D is actually quite plausible for the stated misconception -- applying the original operations (multiply by 2, add 1) forward to the bounds. That's a strong distractor for weaker students.

Given the calibration set, comparing to item 5 (single inequality, b=0.808, classical=0.569): compound inequalities are typically taught at a similar or slightly later stage. The procedural demands are similar. I think this is comparable in difficulty, perhaps slightly easier because the operations are simpler (no collecting like terms). I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.48 and b around 0.50.

Discrimination should be moderate -- the item cleanly separates those who can apply inverse operations in compound inequalities from those who cannot. I estimate a around 1.20.
