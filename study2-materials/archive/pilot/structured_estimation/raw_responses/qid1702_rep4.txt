Examining the target item from a fresh perspective. The question gives 10x - 6y = 30 in table form with y = 0.5 and asks for x.

Correct working: substitute y = 0.5 into the equation.
10x - 6(0.5) = 30
10x - 3 = 30
10x = 33
x = 3.3 (C)

Let me focus on what a typical Year 9 or Year 10 student might experience with this problem.

First, the table format. Students are used to seeing tables of values for functions like y = 2x + 1, but here the equation is in implicit form (10x - 6y = 30). This is a less common presentation and requires recognizing that you substitute the given y-value and solve for x. Some students might be confused about which value goes where.

Second, the coefficients are larger than typical simple equation problems (10 and 6), and there's a decimal (0.5). While 6 * 0.5 = 3 is not hard, it does require comfort with decimal-fraction multiplication.

Third, the solving step: 10x - 3 = 30 requires recognizing that you add 3 to both sides. The misconception tested - using the same operation - would lead to subtracting 3, giving 10x = 27, x = 2.7 (option D).

Now considering the broader population. This item combines several skills:
- Interpreting implicit linear equations
- Reading a table of values
- Substitution
- Decimal multiplication
- Two-step equation solving

For weaker students, any of these could be a stumbling block. But for students with solid KS3 algebra, this is routine.

Looking at the calibration set more carefully: the inequality item (p = 0.569, b = 0.808) requires similar algebraic manipulation but with variables on both sides and inequality notation. That's harder. The function machine item (p = 0.295, b = 0.002) requires conceptual understanding of inverse operations. This item is somewhere between those two.

I think the implicit form of the equation and the table presentation push this toward moderate difficulty. The decimal doesn't help either - students sometimes panic when they see decimals in algebra. I'll estimate around 0.50 proportion incorrect, maybe b around 0.4-0.5.

For discrimination, this should be decent. The item cleanly separates students who can do substitution and equation solving from those who cannot. The key distractor D is well-constructed. However, distractors A and B are somewhat opaque in their error logic, which might lead to some guessing among confused students, slightly lowering discrimination.

Guessing: with 4 options, baseline is 0.25, but this isn't a pure guess scenario. Some students will eliminate options through partial reasoning (e.g., x should be positive since 10x must exceed 30+something). I'll estimate guessing around 0.15.
