Let me analyze this item carefully.

The question asks for the 15th term of the sequence defined by u_n = 1 - 3n.

To solve correctly:
1. Substitute n = 15 into the formula
2. Calculate u_15 = 1 - 3(15) = 1 - 45 = -44

The correct answer is A) -44.

Now let me analyze the distractors and the misconception:

The misconception tested is "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order."

If a student does this incorrectly:
- They might calculate (1 - 3) × 15 = -2 × 15 = -30 → This is option D
- Or they might do 1 - 3 = -2, then -2 × 15 = -30

Let me check the other distractors:
- B) -46: This could come from 1 - 3(15) = 1 - 45 = -44, but getting -46 might be an arithmetic error (perhaps thinking 3 × 15 = 47?)
- C) -14: This might come from 1 - 15 = -14 (ignoring the coefficient 3 entirely)
- D) -30: This comes from (1-3) × 15 = -30 (left to right error - the tested misconception)

The misconception is quite common, especially with expressions like "1 - 3n" where students might interpret this as "(1-3)n" rather than "1 - (3n)".

Comparing to calibration items:
- The similar misconception item (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.245
- This item is similar but involves substitution into an algebraic formula, which adds a step

The question is quite clear - it uses standard nth term notation which is common in UK secondary curriculum. The formula is straightforward and the question is unambiguous.

Prerequisite knowledge needed:
- Understanding of sequence notation (u_n)
- Substitution into formulas
- Order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)
- Working with negative numbers

This is appropriate for ages 13-16 (KS3/KS4).

The distractors are plausible because:
- D directly tests the misconception
- C tests ignoring the coefficient
- B might catch arithmetic errors

Given the comparison to the calibration item testing the same misconception, I expect this to be relatively easy but slightly harder due to the additional substitution step and working with a sequence formula context.

Classical difficulty estimate: Around 0.15-0.25 (most students should get this right)
IRT difficulty: Around -0.3 to 0.1
Discrimination: Should be moderate to good (1.2-1.6) as it clearly separates those who understand order of operations
Guessing: Low, as the distractors are designed to catch specific errors
