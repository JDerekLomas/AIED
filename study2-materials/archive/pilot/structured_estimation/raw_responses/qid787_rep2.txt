The equation is 2v - 5 = 6v - 3. I need to evaluate Jo's and Paul's proposed first steps.

Jo: 2v - 8 = 6v. She seems to be eliminating the -3 term from the right. Correct approach: add 3 to both sides → 2v - 2 = 6v. Jo wrote 2v - 8, suggesting she subtracted 3 from the left side (using subtraction, the same operation as the sign of the term, rather than the inverse). Incorrect.

Paul: 2v = 6v - 8. He seems to be eliminating the -5 term from the left. Correct approach: add 5 to both sides → 2v = 6v + 2. Paul wrote 6v - 8, suggesting he subtracted 5 from the right side instead of adding it. Same misconception. Incorrect.

Answer: D (Neither is correct).

Key psychometric considerations:

The "who is correct" format is a well-known assessment technique that probes conceptual understanding rather than procedural fluency. It requires students to act as evaluators of mathematical reasoning. Research shows these items tend to have moderate-to-high difficulty.

Distractor analysis:
- A (Only Jo): A student might check Jo's work incorrectly and accept it, while noticing Paul's error
- B (Only Paul): Similarly, accept Paul but reject Jo
- C (Both): The most attractive distractor — students with the tested misconception will verify both as correct since both "look right" if you don't understand inverse operations
- D (Neither): Correct — requires recognizing the error in BOTH claims

The fact that C is likely the strongest distractor is important. Students who can't properly evaluate algebraic steps will gravitate toward C, making this item a good discriminator for the specific misconception.

Calibration comparison: The closest calibration item structurally is the Tom/Katie factorising item (classical 0.473, b = 0.404). That item also required evaluating two algebraic claims. However, in that item one person was correct (Tom), making it somewhat easier to get right by only checking one. Here, NEITHER is correct, which is psychologically harder — students must reject both claims and have confidence in doing so.

I predict this item is moderately difficult, somewhat harder than the factorising item. Classical difficulty around 0.58, IRT b around 0.65. Discrimination should be good since the item cleanly separates students who understand inverse operations from those who don't.
