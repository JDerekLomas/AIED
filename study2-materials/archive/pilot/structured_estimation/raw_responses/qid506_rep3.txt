Solve 3p = 1/12. The operation needed is dividing both sides by 3, giving p = 1/36 (answer B).

Distractor analysis:
- A (p = 1/4): From multiplying 1/12 by 3 = 3/12 = 1/4. This is the "same operation" misconception -- the primary target.
- B (p = 1/36): Correct. Dividing 1/12 by 3.
- C (p = 4): Perhaps from 12/3 = 4, treating the equation as if p = 12/3 and ignoring the fraction entirely.
- D (p = 1/9): From 1/(12-3), subtracting instead of dividing.

This item is interesting because it tests whether students can apply the inverse operation (division) when the result is a fraction. The "same operation" error is particularly tempting here because multiplying gives a cleaner-looking answer (1/4 vs 1/36).

Regarding calibration: among the anchors, items testing the same misconception range from 0.167 to 0.569. The difficulty seems to scale with the mathematical context complexity. This item's fraction context is intermediate -- harder than basic integer equations but simpler than inequalities with variable terms on both sides.

I'll place classical difficulty around 0.42. The fraction context pushes it above the simple equation but below the inequality. IRT difficulty around 0.25. Discrimination should be moderate-to-good -- maybe 1.20. The item cleanly separates students who understand inverse operations from those who don't, but the fraction arithmetic adds noise. Guessing should be low given well-constructed distractors.
