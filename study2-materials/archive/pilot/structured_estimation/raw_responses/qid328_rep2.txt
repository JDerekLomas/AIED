Analyzing 2/9 + 1/3. This is a straightforward fraction addition problem where the key skill is finding a common denominator.

Step-by-step solution: Recognize that 3 divides into 9, so LCD = 9. Convert 1/3 = 3/9. Add: 2/9 + 3/9 = 5/9.

The misconception (adding numerators and denominators) is arguably the single most common error students make with fraction addition. Research consistently shows this is extremely prevalent, especially among students who haven't fully internalized why common denominators are needed.

Distractor analysis:
- B) 3/12 = direct application of the misconception (2+1)/(9+3)
- C) 3/9 = adding numerators but keeping the larger denominator, or possibly (2+1)/9 without converting
- D) 1/6 = this is puzzling. Could be from 2/(9+3) = 2/12 = 1/6? That would be a different type of error where the student only adds denominators. Or perhaps the student does something with the relationship between 9 and 3.

Actually, D being 1/6 could come from a student thinking: the difference between 9 and 3 is 6, and 1 is the numerator... or some other idiosyncratic reasoning. It's the weakest distractor.

Comparing to the calibration items, this item tests a fundamental skill. The calibration items ranged from 0.167 to 0.569 in classical difficulty. Fraction addition with related denominators should be on the easier side for the age range, but the misconception pulls many students toward B. I'd place this around 0.25 classical difficulty.

For IRT difficulty, comparing to the calibration: the easiest items had b around -0.7 to -0.2. This should fall around -0.2 to 0.1. Discrimination should be moderate to good since the item cleanly tests a specific skill. Guessing should be near zero because students with the misconception will systematically choose B rather than guess.
