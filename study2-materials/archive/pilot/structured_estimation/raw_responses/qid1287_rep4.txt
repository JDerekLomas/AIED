I need to analyze this cups-and-counters equation item. Let me think about what makes this item tick from a psychometric perspective.

The item shows a physical/visual model for solving x + 4 = 2x + 2. The three steps in the diagram demonstrate the balance method concretely. Students must match this to the correct algebraic representation.

Correct answer A: x + 4 = 2x + 2, x = 2. This directly mirrors the visual steps.

Now, the misconception "uses the same operation rather than the inverse" manifests in the distractors. Specifically:
- D tempts students who think solving means "put all the x's together and all the numbers together" by addition: x + 2x = 3x, 4 + 2 = 6, giving 3x = 6. This is the primary trap.
- B is just 3x = 6, the same error but skipping the setup step.
- C is 3x = 2, a less coherent version of the error.

An important consideration: the question says "the correct START to work it out." Since A, C, and D all start with x + 4 = 2x + 2, the differentiator is the second line. So students must evaluate both the equation setup AND the first solution step. This means even students who correctly read the visual model need to also evaluate the algebra in the second line.

For students comfortable with the cups model, this should be relatively straightforward - the diagram literally shows subtraction (removing items from both sides). But students who have the misconception will see the visual and still default to adding terms together when writing algebra.

Thinking about the student population: cups and counters are typically introduced in Year 7-8 (ages 11-13). By KS4, many students have moved past this representation. So the target demographic is probably younger or lower-attaining students. For this population, the visual helps but the misconception is quite prevalent.

Comparing to calibration items with the same misconception:
- Simple equation (-5 = p + 10): difficulty 0.167 - very easy
- Function machine (x^2 + 5 = 14): difficulty 0.295 - moderate
- Inequality (2n + 3 <= 3n - 7): difficulty 0.569 - hard

This item is more concrete than all three due to the visual scaffold. But it requires cross-representational reasoning. I'd place it between the simple equation and the function machine, maybe around 0.25-0.30.

However, I should also consider that distractor D is quite compelling because it uses "correct-looking" algebra. Many students have been trained to "collect like terms" and might default to that procedure even when it doesn't apply here.

Final estimates: classical difficulty 0.30, IRT difficulty around -0.10 to 0.10. Moderate discrimination. Low guessing since the options look quite different from each other.
