Target: 8 - 7 + 10 × 3. Correct answer B (31).

This tests BODMAS - a core KS3 topic. The misconception is computing left-to-right without respecting multiplication priority.

Key consideration: how does this compare to the calibration BODMAS item? That item (0.4 - 1/5 × 3 = -0.2) had difficulty 0.134 and IRT b = -0.245. It involved fractions and decimals, which adds procedural complexity but might actually help cue students that something non-trivial is going on. This integer-only item looks deceptively simple, which could actually cause MORE students to rush through left-to-right without thinking about order of operations. On the other hand, BODMAS with integers is the most drilled version in classrooms.

The distractors are well-constructed. D (33) is the classic left-to-right error. C (-29) captures a subtraction-scope error. A (36) is less obvious but provides a fourth option.

I think the simplicity of the numbers means most students who know BODMAS will get it right quickly. But the left-to-right trap is strong. Research on order of operations misconceptions shows they're remarkably persistent even after instruction.

Given that this is a very standard presentation (no fractions, no brackets, just integers), and the calibration BODMAS item was 0.134, I think this might actually be slightly easier - maybe 0.12-0.18. Students are most practiced with this exact format. The discrimination should be high because it cleanly separates students who understand BODMAS from those who don't.

Actually, re-examining: this expression has a subtraction which adds a wrinkle. Students need to handle 8 - 7 + 30 correctly even after identifying the multiplication. Some might get tripped up there. I'll adjust slightly upward to 0.17.
