Item: Solve 3p = 1/12. Correct answer: p = 1/36 (B).

Solution path: Divide both sides by 3. This means p = (1/12) * (1/3) = 1/36.

The misconception is using the same operation rather than the inverse. A student who multiplies instead of divides would get p = 3 * (1/12) = 1/4, choosing distractor A.

Let me think about how hard this is relative to the anchors. The simplest equation anchor (-5 = p + 10) was 0.167 incorrect. That involved addition/subtraction with integers. This item involves multiplication/division with fractions -- two steps up in complexity. The inequality anchor (0.569) involved multi-step algebraic manipulation.

This item is a single-step equation but the fraction context significantly increases error rates. UK students ages 11-16 notoriously struggle with fraction operations. The fact that dividing 1/12 by 3 yields a smaller fraction (1/36) can be counterintuitive -- many students expect division to make things bigger or at least not change the denominator so drastically.

I think distractor A will be very attractive. Distractor D (1/9) is moderately attractive for students who try subtraction. Distractor C (p=4) catches students who somehow invert everything.

I'd estimate this is moderately difficult -- maybe 0.45 classical difficulty. The IRT difficulty might be around 0.25-0.35. Discrimination should be good since the misconception is targeted well, but the multiple error pathways might reduce it slightly. Low guessing since the distractors each correspond to specific errors.
