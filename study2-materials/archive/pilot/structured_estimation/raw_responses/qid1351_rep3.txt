Item: Solve -3 = p + 12. Correct answer: B (p = -15).

Step-by-step: subtract 12 from both sides, yielding p = -3 - 12 = -15. This is a single-step linear equation requiring knowledge of inverse operations and negative number arithmetic.

Distractor analysis:
- A) p = 9: Student computes -3 + 12 = 9 (same operation, the tested misconception). This is the primary trap.
- C) p = -9: Could arise from 12 - 3 = 9 with a negative sign, or confusing subtraction order. A secondary error pattern.
- D) p = 15: Student computes 3 + 12 = 15, dropping the negative. Likely attracts weaker students.

This is essentially a parallel form of calibration item 1. The key difference is the specific numbers (-3 and 12 vs. -5 and 10), but the cognitive demand is identical. I note that -3 - 12 might actually be slightly trickier than -5 - 10 because -5 - 10 = -15 has a nice "round" feel, while -3 - 12 = -15 requires crossing through -10 mentally. This could push difficulty up by a small margin.

On the other hand, the distractor set might be slightly less plausible because p = 9 and p = 15 are both positive, which might cue students that something is wrong if they have a rough sense that p should be negative given the -3 on the left. This could make the item slightly easier.

These effects roughly cancel out. I'll predict difficulty close to but marginally higher than calibration item 1.

For discrimination, the clean alignment between the misconception and distractor A should produce good discrimination. I expect a value around 1.2-1.4, consistent with the calibration items testing this misconception.

Guessing should be near zero for an item this straightforward -- students either can solve it or fall into a specific error pattern.
