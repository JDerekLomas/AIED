Analyzing: 15 = (1+k)/4, with Isaac's two steps shown.

Step 1: 60 = 1 + k — multiplying both sides by 4. This is correct inverse operation (multiply to undo divide).

Step 2: 61 = k — here Isaac added 1 to 60 instead of subtracting. He should get k = 59. This is the tested misconception: using addition (same operation as the +1 in the equation) instead of subtraction (the inverse).

The correct answer is A.

Key difficulty drivers:
1. The evaluative framing ("which steps are correct?") requires students to check each step, not just solve. This is cognitively demanding because students often just scan and assume steps look right.
2. The fraction in the original equation adds slight complexity to Step 1 verification.
3. The error in Step 2 is subtle — 61 vs 59 — students who don't carefully verify might accept it.
4. However, the misconception tested is extremely common and well-documented, so many students who have this misconception might actually think BOTH steps are correct (choosing C).

Looking at the calibration set, the Tom/Katie factoring item is the closest analogue (evaluating others' work). That had difficulty 0.473 with b = 0.404. But that involved quadratic factoring, which is harder content. This item's content is simpler (linear equation with fractions), so I'd expect somewhat lower difficulty.

I note this question has a slight typo ("ste.p" and "step.s" in options B and D) which could slightly affect clarity but probably won't confuse most students.

Estimated classical difficulty: 0.38, IRT b: 0.12. Discrimination should be solid since this cleanly separates those who understand inverse operations from those who don't.
