This item tests whether students can correctly expand -(2 - 3p) by distributing the negative sign. The key conceptual hurdle is understanding that -(-3p) = +3p, i.e., multiplying two negatives gives a positive.

The answer options systematically cover the common errors:
- A) 2 - 3p: Ignores the negative sign entirely, just drops brackets
- B) -2 - 3p: Negates the first term correctly but fails on the double negative (-1 * -3p), keeping it as -3p. This is the primary misconception distractor.
- C) 2 + 3p: Flips only the second term's sign - unusual error pattern
- D) -2 + 3p: Correct

This is a fairly standard algebra task that appears in KS3/KS4 curricula. Students encounter expanding brackets with negative multipliers regularly. However, the double negative aspect trips up many students.

Comparing to calibration items: The equation -5 = p + 10 (classical difficulty 0.167) is simpler. The factorising item with the same misconception (classical difficulty 0.473) is harder due to requiring factorisation knowledge. This expanding item sits somewhere in between but closer to moderate difficulty.

The discrimination should be reasonable since stronger students will handle sign rules confidently while weaker students commonly fall for distractor B. I estimate moderate-to-good discrimination.

Guessing should be low since the distractors represent systematic errors rather than random choices, but some students may guess correctly by elimination.
