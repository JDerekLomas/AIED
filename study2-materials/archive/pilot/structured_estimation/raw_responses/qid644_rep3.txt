This item embeds a signed multiplication task within bracket expansion. The student sees (2p-1)(3p-4) with arrows indicating the -1 and -4 terms, and must compute their product.

The question is somewhat unusual in its presentation -- rather than asking students to fully expand the brackets, it isolates one specific multiplication step and asks what the result should be. This is pedagogically useful for diagnosing the specific misconception about negative multiplication, but the visual/arrow notation might be unfamiliar to some students.

Let me think about who gets this wrong and why:
- Students who believe neg x neg = neg will choose B (-4). This is the target misconception and likely the most common error.
- Students who add instead of multiply might choose D (-5, from -1 + -4) or C (+5, from 1+4 with wrong sign handling).
- Some students might not understand what the arrows mean and guess.

The calibration item testing the same misconception (Tom/Katie, factorising) had classical difficulty 0.473. That required evaluating whether two factorizations were correct, involving more complex reasoning. This item strips away the complexity and directly asks about the multiplication. However, the visual presentation with arrows could add confusion for some students who aren't used to this format.

I think the difficulty will be moderate. The misconception about negative multiplication is deeply ingrained in many students, even those who can otherwise handle algebra. But the item is quite direct -- if you know the rule, it's trivial. This binary nature should give good discrimination.

My estimates: classical difficulty ~0.45 (the misconception is very sticky), b ~0.35, discrimination ~1.25 (good but the unusual format might reduce it slightly), guessing ~0.15.
