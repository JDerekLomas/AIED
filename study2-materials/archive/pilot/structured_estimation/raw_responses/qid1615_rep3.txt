The target item presents a classic "I think of a number" word problem requiring students to form an equation. The operations described are: (1) start with n, (2) subtract 6, (3) divide by 3, (4) result is 21.

Correct answer: A, which shows (n-6)/3 = 21 using fraction notation.

Let me think about this from a student's perspective. A Year 7 or 8 student reading this might process it as follows: "take away 6... so n - 6... divide by 3... so ÷ 3... equals 21." They might then look for something that reads "n - 6 ÷ 3 = 21" and select B. This is exactly the misconception being tested.

But actually, many students DO understand fraction notation and would recognize that A shows the subtraction happening before the division. The fraction bar is arguably clearer than writing with a ÷ symbol. So the question becomes: do students understand that the fraction bar groups the numerator?

Distractor analysis:
- B is the main trap (BIDMAS misconception). Very plausible for weaker students.
- C confuses multiply and divide — moderate plausibility.
- D reverses the operation order — moderate plausibility for students who don't carefully track the word problem sequence.

I think B and D together will catch a substantial number of students, making this moderately difficult. But strong students will immediately recognize A.

Looking at the calibration data more carefully: the first BIDMAS item (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) had classical difficulty only 0.134, which is quite easy. That suggests students generally handle order of operations well at this level. But forming equations is a different skill than computing — it requires working in the opposite direction.

Actually, I may be overestimating difficulty. The "think of a number" format is heavily drilled in UK schools. Students practise forming these equations frequently. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.25, making it relatively easy but not trivial. IRT difficulty slightly below zero.

Discrimination should be good — the item cleanly separates students who understand equation formation from those who don't. The misconception is well-targeted.
