Let me analyze this item carefully.

**The Question:**
Find the 15th term of the sequence where u_n = 1 - 3n

**Correct Solution:**
u_15 = 1 - 3(15) = 1 - 45 = -44

So the correct answer is A) -44

**Misconception Analysis:**
The misconception tested is "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order"

If a student does this incorrectly:
- They might calculate: 1 - 3 = -2, then -2 × 15 = -30
- This gives answer D) -30

Let me check the other distractors:
- B) -46: This could come from 1 - 3(15) = 1 - 45 = -44, but making an arithmetic error (perhaps -1 - 45 = -46)
- C) -14: This could come from various errors, perhaps 1 - 15 = -14 (ignoring the 3 entirely) or some other calculation error
- D) -30: As analyzed, this comes from (1-3) × 15 = -2 × 15 = -30 (the target misconception)

**Comparison to Calibration Items:**
Looking at the calibration item with the same misconception (0.4 - 1/5 × 3):
- Classical difficulty: 0.134
- IRT difficulty: -0.245
- This was relatively easy

However, this current item involves:
1. Understanding sequence notation (u_n)
2. Substituting n = 15
3. Following order of operations (multiplication before subtraction)
4. Working with negative numbers

The sequence notation adds complexity compared to the pure arithmetic problem.

**Rating Analysis:**
- Concept complexity: Involves sequences, substitution, order of operations, negative numbers - moderate (5)
- Procedural steps: Substitute n=15, multiply 3×15, subtract from 1 - about 3 steps (4)
- Abstraction level: Uses algebraic notation u_n which is somewhat abstract (6)
- Prerequisite knowledge: Need to know sequences, substitution, BODMAS, negative numbers (5)
- Distractor plausibility: D is very plausible for the misconception, B catches arithmetic errors (6)
- Misconception strength: Order of operations errors are common, but students at this level often know to multiply first (5)
- Question clarity: Very clear what's being asked (9)
- Cognitive load: Need to hold several pieces of information (5)
- Age appropriateness: Sequences are typically KS3/KS4 content (9)
- Transfer distance: Standard sequence notation, fairly typical presentation (4)
- Visual complexity: Simple algebraic notation (3)
- Solution uniqueness: Must correctly apply order of operations to get the right answer (7)

**Difficulty Prediction:**
This is similar to the order of operations item (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) but with added complexity of sequence notation. The added abstraction might make it slightly harder. I'd estimate:
- Classical difficulty: around 0.20-0.25 (slightly harder than the 0.134 calibration item due to sequence notation)
- IRT difficulty: around 0.0 to 0.3
- Discrimination: Should be moderate to good, around 1.3-1.5
- Guessing: Low, as students who understand will get it right
