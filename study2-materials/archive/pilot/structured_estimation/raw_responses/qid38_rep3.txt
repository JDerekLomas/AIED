Item: 3/(2x) + 4/x. Answer: 11/(2x).

This is a standard algebraic fractions addition problem. Let me consider the student population - UK secondary ages 11-16. For the younger end (11-13), this would be beyond their level. For 14-16 year olds studying GCSE maths, this is standard content, appearing in higher tier papers.

The procedure is straightforward for a student who understands fractions: find LCD (2x), multiply 4/x by 2/2 to get 8/(2x), add to get 11/(2x). Only 3 steps really.

But the misconception tested - adding numerators and denominators - is perhaps THE most common fraction error. Research consistently shows this persists even into adulthood. The algebraic context may actually make it worse since students are less comfortable and more likely to fall back on incorrect heuristics.

Distractor analysis:
- B (7/3x): Direct numerator+denominator addition. Very strong pull.
- C (11/x): Gets numerator right (so understands need for common denominator and conversion) but drops the 2 from denominator somehow. Moderate pull.
- D (7/2x): Adds 3+4 without converting but uses correct denominator 2x. This student partially understands common denominators but doesn't convert fractions. Moderate-strong pull.

All three distractors represent plausible errors, making this a well-designed item.

Calibration comparison: I note the easier calibration items (classical difficulty 0.13-0.17) involve simpler algebra. The harder ones (0.47-0.57) involve more complex reasoning. Algebraic fractions sit firmly in the harder category. I'd place this around 0.45-0.50 classical difficulty.

For discrimination: this should discriminate well since it cleanly separates students who understand fraction addition from those who don't. I'll estimate around 1.2-1.4.

Guessing: with 4 options and plausible distractors, random guessing is 0.25 but the strong misconception pull means effective guessing is lower - students with misconceptions will systematically choose wrong answers rather than guess randomly.
