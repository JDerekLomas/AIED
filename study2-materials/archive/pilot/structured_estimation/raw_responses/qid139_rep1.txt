The target item presents an expanding brackets problem (5p-4)(2p-3) and asks what happens when you multiply the two constant terms indicated by arrows: -4 and -3. The correct answer is +12 (option C), because negative times negative equals positive.

Let me consider the distractors:
- A) +7: This is (-4)+(-3)=-7... no, +7 would be the result of adding the absolute values. Perhaps a student who adds instead of multiplies.
- B) -12: The classic misconception answer - student multiplies 4x3=12 but keeps a negative sign, believing two negatives multiply to a negative.
- C) +12: Correct.
- D) -7: This is (-4)+(-3)=-7, a student who adds instead of multiplying.

So distractors A and D capture an "adds instead of multiplies" error, and B captures the "two negatives make negative" misconception. The distractors are well-designed and plausible.

The question itself is quite focused - it isolates one specific step in FOIL expansion. Students don't need to complete the full expansion, just identify what one particular multiplication yields. The visual component (arrows pointing to specific terms) should help clarity but also requires interpreting a diagram.

Comparing with the calibration item testing the same misconception (Tom/Katie factorising, difficulty 0.473): that item required more complex reasoning (checking two students' factorisations). This one is more direct but still requires understanding that terms carry signs from the brackets. I'd place this slightly easier than the Tom/Katie item.

The misconception tested is quite strong among younger students but becomes less common with older students. Given the age range 11-16, a substantial portion will fall for option B.

My estimates: classical difficulty around 0.38, IRT difficulty around 0.15, discrimination moderate-high since this cleanly tests one concept, low guessing since students with the misconception are drawn strongly to B rather than guessing randomly.
