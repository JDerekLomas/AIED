The item: expand -3(m-2), correct answer -3m+6.

This is a standard expanding brackets question but with the added complexity of a negative coefficient outside. The critical step is recognizing that -3 multiplied by -2 gives +6, not -6.

From my experience with UK maths assessments, expanding brackets with negative coefficients is a common source of errors. Students typically encounter this in KS3 (Years 7-9). The misconception that multiplying two negatives gives a negative is one of the most persistent errors in secondary mathematics.

Looking at distractor attractiveness: B (-3m-6) will catch students with the target misconception. A (3m+6) might attract students who somehow lose the negative on the first term. C (3m-6) is the least likely choice as it requires two errors.

Comparing with calibration items, I note that the Tom/Katie factorising question (same misconception) had difficulty 0.473. That question required more sophisticated reasoning - evaluating two claims about factorisation. This question is more direct. However, the negative coefficient makes this genuinely challenging for many students.

I think this item is slightly harder than average. The sign manipulation with brackets is a well-known stumbling block. I'd estimate maybe 50% get it wrong, which would put classical difficulty around 0.50. Actually, that might be high - the question is quite direct and clear. Let me revise down to about 0.43.

For IRT, with the factorising comparison item at b=0.404, I'd put this slightly lower, maybe b=0.30 since it's more straightforward procedurally.

Discrimination should be solid - this is a well-constructed diagnostic item. Maybe 1.40. The guessing parameter is likely low since the distractors are meaningful.
