This item asks students to convert the expression c / (h+4) into proper algebraic fraction notation. The correct answer is A: c/(h+4), which is a direct translation.

Looking at the distractors:
- B: (c+4)/(h+4) - student might incorrectly distribute or misapply operations
- C: c/h + 4 - this is the key distractor matching the misconception "carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order." A student ignoring the brackets would read c divided by h, then plus 4.
- D: (h+4)/c - student reverses numerator and denominator

This is fundamentally a notation/convention question rather than a computational one. Students need to understand that division by a grouped expression means the entire group goes in the denominator, and that fraction notation inherently handles the grouping.

Comparing to calibration items:
- The order-of-operations item (0.4 - 1/5 x 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and tested the same misconception but required actual computation. This item is purely notational.
- The equation-solving items ranged from 0.167 to 0.569 in difficulty.

This item should be relatively easy because it requires recognition rather than computation. Students who understand fraction notation will immediately see answer A. However, distractor C is plausible for students who process left-to-right. I'd estimate this is on the easier side, perhaps around 0.20-0.25 classical difficulty.

The discrimination should be moderate-to-good since it cleanly separates students who understand algebraic convention from those who don't. Guessing should be low since answer A is quite obviously correct to students with the requisite knowledge.
