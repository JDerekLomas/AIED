The target item presents 5x + 3y = 15 and asks for the gradient. The correct procedure is to rearrange to y = mx + c:

5x + 3y = 15
3y = 15 - 5x
y = 5 - (5/3)x
y = -(5/3)x + 5

So gradient = -5/3, which is option D.

Distractor analysis:
- A (5): The student identifies the coefficient of x in the original equation as the gradient without rearranging. This is a conceptual error about what gradient means in different equation forms.
- B (-5): The student correctly negates but doesn't divide by 3. This is a procedural error -- incomplete rearrangement.
- C (5/3): The student divides by 3 but doesn't negate. This directly maps to the tested misconception of using the same operation rather than the inverse.
- D (-5/3): Correct.

All four distractors represent genuinely different levels of understanding, which should produce strong discrimination. Option C is likely the most popular wrong answer since it's the closest to correct (only missing the sign change).

Thinking about difficulty relative to calibration items: This requires knowledge of the y = mx + c form, which is a key GCSE topic. In the UK curriculum, this is typically covered in Year 9-10. The combination of rearranging with fraction arithmetic and sign changes makes this moderately challenging.

I think this is slightly harder than the function machines item (0.295) and comparable to the factorising item (0.473). The fractional gradient adds difficulty that pure equation-solving items don't have. However, finding gradient from ax + by = c is a very commonly practiced skill. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.45, placing it just below the factorising item.

For IRT parameters, the clean mapping between distractors and specific errors should give good discrimination (around 1.3-1.4). Guessing should be relatively low because the distractors are attractive -- students with misconceptions are drawn to specific wrong answers rather than guessing randomly.
