The item presents 8x/5 = 40 and asks students to evaluate Tom's and Katie's proposed next steps.

Let me verify each claim carefully.

Tom: 8x = 8. Starting from 8x/5 = 40, to remove the /5 from the left side, we multiply both sides by 5. That gives 8x = 200, not 8x = 8. Tom seems to have done 40/5 = 8 — dividing instead of multiplying. This is wrong.

Katie: x/5 = 5. Starting from 8x/5 = 40, dividing both sides by 8 gives (8x)/(5·8) = 40/8, which simplifies to x/5 = 5. This is correct.

Answer: B (Only Katie).

Now for psychometric estimation. Key considerations:

1. The "who is correct" format requires evaluating two separate claims, which doubles the cognitive work compared to just solving the equation.

2. Tom's error is seductive — 40 ÷ 5 = 8 is a clean calculation, and students who share the same-operation misconception will think Tom is right.

3. Katie's step is less obvious. Many students default to "undo the fraction first" when solving, so dividing by 8 as a first step may seem unfamiliar even though it's valid. Some students might reject Katie's approach simply because it's not the standard textbook sequence.

4. This means option C ("Both correct") and option A ("Only Tom") are both strong distractors.

Looking at the calibration set: Items with this misconception span a wide difficulty range. The simple p + 10 = -5 item is easy (0.167), while the inequality is hard (0.569). This item's added complexity from the "who is correct" format and the fractional coefficient suggests moderate-to-high difficulty.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.52, slightly harder than the factorising item due to the fraction manipulation. Discrimination should be moderate — perhaps slightly lower than average because the "who is correct" format can introduce noise from students who solve correctly but misjudge the claims.
