Target item: 1/3 + 1/2 x 1/3

Correct solution path:
- Apply BIDMAS: multiplication before addition
- 1/2 x 1/3 = 1/6
- 1/3 + 1/6: common denominator 6, so 2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2
- Answer: A

Misconception path (left-to-right):
- 1/3 + 1/2 = 2/6 + 3/6 = 5/6
- 5/6 x 1/3 = 5/18
- Answer: B

This is a relatively straightforward order-of-operations question embedded in a fraction context. The fractions involved are simple (unit fractions with small denominators), so the arithmetic itself isn't the main challenge; the conceptual hurdle is remembering to multiply before adding.

Looking at the calibration set, the item testing the same misconception (0.4 - 1/5 x 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.245. That item is quite easy. However, I note that in that item, the subtraction sign might actually help students because subtraction feels "less automatic" than addition, prompting them to look at the whole expression more carefully. With addition, students might more readily just proceed left to right.

Also, the correct answer here (1/2) is deceptively simple-looking. Some students might second-guess themselves because 1/2 seems "too clean" and opt for a more complex-looking answer like 5/18, increasing the error rate.

On the other hand, the item is fairly standard for KS3 curriculum. I estimate this is slightly harder than the calibration analogue. Classical difficulty perhaps 0.20-0.25. IRT difficulty around -0.05 to 0.15. Good discrimination since it clearly targets one misconception.
