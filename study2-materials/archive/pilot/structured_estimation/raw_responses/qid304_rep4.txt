The expression is 1 + 2 x (3 - 4) and students must identify which calculation to do first. This directly tests knowledge of order of operations -- specifically the role of brackets (parentheses) in BIDMAS/BODMAS.

Let me think about how UK secondary students at various levels would approach this:

Year 7-8 students (ages 11-13) learn BIDMAS explicitly. Many will recall "Brackets first" and correctly choose C. However, a meaningful minority will default to left-to-right processing, especially younger or lower-attaining students, selecting A (1+2).

Distractor B (2x3) is interesting -- it targets students who partially remember the priority rules (multiplication before addition) but fail to notice or prioritize the brackets. This is a subtler error than pure left-to-right processing.

Distractor D ("doesn't matter") would attract students who have no understanding of order of operations at all, or who confuse commutativity/associativity with order of operations.

Comparing with calibration examples:
- The BODMAS calibration item (0.4 - 1/5 x 3 = ?) had difficulty 0.134 (proportion incorrect) and b = -0.245. That required computation. This item is purely about identifying the rule, which should be easier for students who have memorized BIDMAS even if their execution is shaky.
- However, the presence of distractor B could catch students who have incomplete BIDMAS knowledge, potentially making this slightly harder than expected for a "brackets" question.

I estimate this is an easy item overall. Classical difficulty probably around 0.18. The item discriminates well because it has layered distractors that capture different levels of misunderstanding. Guessing should be minimal since most students have some BIDMAS exposure by secondary school.
