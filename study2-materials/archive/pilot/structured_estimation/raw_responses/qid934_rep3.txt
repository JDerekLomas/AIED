The target item presents a table of values for the equation 4x + 2y = 10 and asks what y equals when x = 0 (the star position).

Working through the solution:
4(0) + 2y = 10
2y = 10
y = 10/2 = 5
Answer: C

Thinking about this from a student perspective -- many students at KS3 level are comfortable with substitution and simple equation solving. The x = 0 case is particularly friendly because it eliminates one term entirely, reducing the problem to 2y = 10.

However, the item has several features that could challenge students:
1. Two-variable equation -- students must understand that substituting one variable lets them solve for the other
2. Table interpretation -- they need to map the star to the correct (x, y) pair
3. The equation has coefficients on both variables (4 and 2), which adds mild complexity

The misconception "uses same operation rather than inverse" maps directly to distractor A (20). From 2y = 10, multiplying instead of dividing gives 20. This is a well-known and common error.

Looking at the calibration set more carefully: the items range from classical difficulty 0.167 to 0.569, with IRT b from -0.702 to 0.808. The easier items involve single-variable equations; the harder ones involve factorising or multi-step inequality solving.

This item sits in the easier portion. The substitution step with x = 0 is trivial, and 2y = 10 is about as simple as single-step equations get. But the framing (table of values, two-variable equation) pushes it slightly above the easiest calibration item.

I'd place classical difficulty around 0.22, IRT b around -0.30. The discrimination should be moderate -- maybe around 1.35 -- since the item cleanly tests one specific misconception. Guessing is likely low because each distractor has a plausible derivation; random guessing is unlikely to be a dominant strategy here.
