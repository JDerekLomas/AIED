The expression 18 / 2 + 2 x 2 requires applying BIDMAS rules. Students must recognise that division and multiplication take priority over addition. Computing correctly: 18/2 = 9 and 2x2 = 4, giving 9 + 4 = 13, answer B.

Distractor analysis:
- C (22): Left-to-right computation: 18/2=9, 9+2=11, 11x2=22. This is the primary misconception target.
- A (3): Possibly 18/(2+2x2) = 18/6 = 3, or 18/(2+2) then /2 = 3. This represents a different error pattern where the student groups incorrectly.
- D (12): Perhaps the student computes 18/2 + 2 = 11 and then makes an arithmetic error, or does 18/(2+2) x 2 = 18/4 x 2 = 9... actually that gives 9. Maybe 2+2x2=6, 18/6x... Hmm, D=12 could come from ignoring the division: 2+2x2=6, then 18-6=12? Or 18/2 + 2 = 11, confusing with 12. It's a weaker distractor.

Compared to the calibration item testing the same misconception (classical difficulty 0.134), this item uses simpler numbers with no fractions or decimals. However, BODMAS is a very commonly tested misconception in UK schools, so many students will have been drilled on it. I expect this to be relatively easy, perhaps slightly easier than the calibration item. The discrimination should be solid because the misconception is cleanly targeted. Guessing is unlikely to be a factor since even low-ability students will compute something rather than guess randomly.
