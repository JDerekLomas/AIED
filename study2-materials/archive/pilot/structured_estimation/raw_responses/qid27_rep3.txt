Item: If d = -2, what is 10 - 2d? Correct answer: C (14). Misconception: multiplying two negatives gives a negative.

Let me focus on the population this targets. UK secondary students ages 11-16 — substitution into algebraic expressions appears in KS3 (years 7-9). The negative number aspect is a well-documented difficulty. Research consistently shows that students struggle with the subtraction of negative products.

The key cognitive step: recognizing that -2d when d=-2 becomes -2*(-2) = +4, making the expression 10+4 = 14. Students holding the tested misconception would compute -2*(-2) = -4, yielding 10-4 = 6 (option B).

Let me consider the full error landscape:
- Option B (6): Primary attractor. Multiple error paths lead here — ignoring the negative in d, or applying the misconception about negative multiplication. This is likely to attract 15-25% of students.
- Option A (-12): Could come from a sign error cascade. Perhaps computing d = -2, then 10 - 2(-2) as -10 - 2 = -12? Or reading as -(10) + (-2) = -12? Unusual but possible for very weak students.
- Option D (32): Very hard to reach through a natural error. Maybe 10 * 2 * (-2) * (-1) = 40... no. Or some concatenation error. Will attract very few students.

The item has strong face validity as a diagnostic for negative number misconceptions. It's a clean, well-constructed item. The question is completely unambiguous.

Comparing to calibration: The equation -5 = p + 10 (difficulty 0.167, b = -0.702) was simpler with no negative multiplication. The factorising item with the same misconception (difficulty 0.473, b = 0.404) was much harder. This item sits between them but closer to the easier end since substitution is more basic than factorising.

I'm going to estimate slightly higher difficulty than the simple equation because negative number operations reliably trip up a substantial minority. My estimate: classical difficulty 0.32, IRT b around -0.05, discrimination 1.25, low guessing.
