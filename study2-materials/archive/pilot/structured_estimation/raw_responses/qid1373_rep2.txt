Expanding -3(m-2). This is a bread-and-butter algebra skill in UK secondary maths, typically introduced in Year 7-8 and revisited throughout.

The four options form a systematic pattern based on two binary sign decisions:
- First term: -3m or +3m (did you keep the negative on the 3?)
- Second term: +6 or -6 (did you correctly multiply two negatives?)

This creates a 2x2 grid:
- A: +3m, +6 (wrong first, right second)
- B: -3m, -6 (right first, wrong second) -- the misconception target
- C: +3m, -6 (wrong first, wrong second)
- D: -3m, +6 (right, right) -- correct

The misconception being tested is specifically about negative times negative. Option B is the strongest distractor because students often get -3*m correct but stumble on -3*(-2).

Thinking about difficulty: This is a fairly fundamental skill, but negative number operations are notoriously tricky. Research consistently shows sign errors are persistent even into later secondary years. I'd compare this to the calibration items - it's not as easy as solving -5=p+10 (0.167 difficulty) because that's more procedural. It's probably comparable to the factorising item in misconception strength but simpler in concept, so maybe slightly easier.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.38, meaning about 62% get it right. IRT difficulty perhaps 0.15 - slightly above average but not extremely hard.

Discrimination should be decent - this cleanly separates students who understand sign rules from those who don't. I'll estimate around 1.30. Low guessing since the distractors are well-designed and there's no obvious way to eliminate options without understanding the content.
