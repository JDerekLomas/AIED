Analyzing the target item: Students see that 9y becomes y and must identify the operation as dividing by 9.

This is essentially a concept-recognition task rather than a problem-solving task. The student doesn't need to perform any calculation -- they just need to recognize that to get from 9y to y, you divide by 9. This makes it fundamentally different from the calibration items where students had to actually solve equations.

Let me think about what makes this potentially tricky despite its simplicity:
- The diagram format is non-standard. Students used to seeing "9y = 27, solve for y" might be thrown off by the abstract presentation showing just the left-hand side transformation with a star.
- The question asks about the operation applied to "both sides," which requires understanding that equation solving involves balanced operations. Some students might focus only on "what turns 9y into y" without connecting it to equation-solving principles.

For the misconception specifically: a student who uses "the same operation rather than the inverse" would see 9y (9 times y) and choose "times 9" (option B). But I think many students will intuitively recognize that going from 9y to y means dividing, even without formal understanding of inverse operations. The visual context of "9y becoming y" makes the division quite salient.

Comparing to calibration: The first calibration item (-5 = p+10, difficulty 0.167) required students to identify and apply the inverse operation AND deal with negative numbers. This target item only requires identification, not application, and involves no negatives. So it should be easier.

However, I want to consider that the non-standard format might confuse lower-ability students more than expected. Some may not understand what the diagram is asking. This could push difficulty slightly higher than the pure math would suggest.

Estimate: classical difficulty 0.15, IRT difficulty -0.70. The item should discriminate well since it cleanly tests one concept. Low guessing since competent students won't be uncertain.
