Analyzing this item about the product of two numbers equaling -24.

The mathematical content: Students must know that for a product to be negative, exactly one factor must be negative and one positive. They also need to verify the multiplication gives 24 in magnitude.

Checking each answer:
A) -3 x -8 = +24 (positive, not -24) -- targets the tested misconception directly
B) -4 x 6 = -24 (correct)
C) -10 x -14 = +140 (wrong sign and wrong magnitude)
D) -3 x 9 = -27 (correct sign, wrong magnitude)

This is interesting because students must do two checks: (1) sign of the product, and (2) magnitude of the product. Option A passes the magnitude check (3 x 8 = 24) but fails the sign check for students who know the rules. Option D passes the sign check but fails magnitude. Option C fails both.

The strongest distractor is clearly A, which will catch students holding the misconception. D might catch students who are careless with multiplication. C is quite weak since both the sign and magnitude are wrong.

Comparing with calibration examples: The factorising item with the same misconception was at 0.473 classical difficulty. But that required understanding quadratic factorisation on top of sign rules. This item isolates the sign rule more cleanly.

However, I should consider that "product" as terminology might trip up some students who confuse it with "sum." This could add some difficulty beyond just the sign rules.

I estimate this item is moderate in difficulty. Perhaps classical difficulty around 0.40, given that the misconception is common and the word "product" adds a small comprehension hurdle. IRT difficulty around 0.2.
