This item asks students to find a missing y-value in a table for the linear equation 4x + 2y = 10, specifically when x = 0.

Solution: Plug in x = 0 into 4x + 2y = 10.
4(0) + 2y = 10
2y = 10
y = 5 (Answer C)

Distractor analysis:
- A (20): This is the key misconception distractor. A student who multiplies both sides by 2 instead of dividing (same operation instead of inverse) gets y = 20.
- B (3): This might come from a student who substitutes x = 1 by mistake: 4(1) + 2y = 10 => 2y = 6 => y = 3. Or some other arithmetic slip.
- D (2.5): Could result from dividing 10 by 4 (confusing the coefficient of x with the coefficient of y), giving 2.5.

The question requires: (1) understanding what a table of values means, (2) identifying x = 0 corresponds to the star, (3) substituting into the equation, (4) solving a simple linear equation in one variable.

The table presentation is a slight transfer from a standard "solve for y" problem, which could trip up some students who aren't used to reading tables of values. The visual complexity of the table notation adds mild cognitive load.

Comparing to calibration: The first calibration item (solve -5 = p + 10) had difficulty 0.167, b = -0.702. That's a simpler one-step equation. This item requires substitution first, then solving, making it slightly harder. But the solving step (2y = 10) is very basic. I'd place this around the 0.20-0.30 difficulty range, closer to the second calibration item.

I think this is a moderate-easy item with decent discrimination because the misconception distractor is well-targeted.
