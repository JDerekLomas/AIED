Expanding (m-5)(m-7): This is a standard GCSE algebra skill. The correct answer is m² - 12m + 35 (option B).

Step-by-step: m·m = m², m·(-7) = -7m, (-5)·m = -5m, (-5)·(-7) = +35. Then -7m + (-5m) = -12m. Result: m² - 12m + 35.

The misconception being tested — believing two negatives multiplied give a negative — is one of the most persistent errors in secondary mathematics. Research consistently shows students struggle with this even after direct instruction. In this context, the error is embedded within a multi-step algebraic procedure, making it harder to catch.

Looking at the answer options:
- A: m² - 2m - 35 (wrong middle term AND wrong sign on constant)
- B: m² - 12m + 35 (correct)
- C: m² + 12m + 35 (positive middle term — treating both as positive)
- D: m² - 12m - 35 (only the constant sign is wrong — the primary misconception trap)

Option D is extremely plausible for the target misconception. Option A might attract students who make multiple errors. Option C would attract students who ignore the negatives entirely.

Compared to the Tom/Katie calibration item (same misconception, difficulty 0.473), this item is slightly more procedural but less complex in reasoning. The factorisation item required understanding what correct factorisation looks like and checking two claims. This item just requires executing FOIL correctly. I'd place it slightly easier, perhaps 0.38-0.45 classical difficulty.

The discrimination should be moderate to good — the item cleanly tests whether students can handle negative multiplication within bracket expansion. Some guessing is possible since students might eliminate C quickly (all positive seems wrong when both brackets have negatives).
