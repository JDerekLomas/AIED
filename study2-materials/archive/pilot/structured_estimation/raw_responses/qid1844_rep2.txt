Analyzing y=(x-8)(x-6) and finding the y-intercept.

Step 1: Recognize y-intercept means x=0.
Step 2: Substitute: y=(0-8)(0-6) = (-8)(-6)
Step 3: Multiply: (-8)(-6) = 48
Step 4: Write as coordinate: (0,48) = answer C.

This is a multi-concept item. Students need to know:
1. What "y-axis intercept" means (set x=0)
2. How to substitute into factored form
3. How to multiply negative numbers correctly

The misconception being tested -- that negative times negative gives negative -- is extremely common, especially among students who are still developing fluency with signed number operations. This is particularly tricky because students might correctly identify the procedure but stumble on the arithmetic.

I notice the question text appears duplicated (the question and answers appear twice), which might slightly reduce clarity, though students would likely just ignore the repetition.

Looking at distractor D: (-48) is the direct result of the target misconception. This will be very attractive to students who otherwise know the correct procedure. Distractor B shows a fundamental confusion about intercept types. Distractor A shows additive rather than multiplicative thinking.

The calibration item with the same misconception (Tom/Katie) was at 0.473 classical difficulty. However, that required higher-order reasoning (evaluating two claims about factorisation). This item is more procedural but still requires the negative multiplication skill. I think the difficulty should be comparable.

One thing that could make this harder: the question is in factored form which is less commonly seen when asking about y-intercepts. Students are more used to finding y-intercepts from y=mx+b form. This transfer distance adds difficulty.

I'll estimate classical difficulty at 0.52, slightly above the calibration comparator, mainly because of the transfer from standard y-intercept problems and the strong pull of distractor D.
