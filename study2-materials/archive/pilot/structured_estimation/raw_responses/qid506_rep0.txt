This item asks students to solve 3p = 1/12 for p. The correct answer is p = 1/36 (dividing both sides by 3, i.e., multiplying 1/12 by 1/3). The misconception tested is "uses the same operation rather than the inverse" -- so instead of dividing by 3, a student might multiply by 3, getting 3/12 = 1/4 (distractor A).

Looking at the calibration items with the same misconception ("uses same operation rather than inverse"):
- The simple linear equation -5 = p + 10 had classical difficulty 0.167 (easy)
- The function machine item had 0.295 (moderate)
- The inequality item had 0.569 (hard)

This item combines equation solving with fraction arithmetic, which adds complexity. Students need to know how to divide a fraction by a whole number (or multiply by 1/3). The fraction context makes the inverse operation less obvious. Distractor A (p = 1/4) comes from multiplying 1/12 by 3 -- the same-operation error. Distractor C (p = 4) might come from thinking 12/3 = 4, ignoring the fraction. Distractor D (p = 1/9) could come from subtracting 3 from 12 in the denominator.

The distractors are quite plausible because fraction division is a known stumbling block. I'd estimate this is moderately difficult -- harder than the simple -5 = p + 10 but the equation structure itself is straightforward. The fraction manipulation adds cognitive load.

Comparing to calibration items, I'd place this around 0.35-0.45 classical difficulty. The IRT difficulty should be moderate, maybe around 0.1-0.3. Discrimination should be reasonable since the misconception is well-targeted. Some guessing is possible but the distractors are distinct enough that random guessing is less likely.
