The target item requires expanding -5(m - 7). The correct expansion is -5m + 35 (option C).

Key skills required: distributing a negative number over a bracket containing a subtraction. The critical step is recognizing that -5 multiplied by -7 yields +35.

The tested misconception -- believing that multiplying two negatives gives a negative -- is extremely common among Key Stage 3 and early Key Stage 4 students. Research consistently shows sign errors are one of the most persistent algebraic misconceptions.

Analyzing each distractor:
- Option A (5m + 35): Student might think the negative signs "cancel" across both terms somehow, or forgot the negative on -5 * m. Less likely than B.
- Option B (-5m - 35): Direct manifestation of the tested misconception. Student correctly computes -5 * m = -5m but then computes -5 * -7 = -35. This will be the most popular incorrect answer.
- Option D (5m - 35): Student may have distributed incorrectly in a different way, perhaps changing signs arbitrarily. Less common.

Comparing to the calibration item about Tom and Katie (also testing negative * negative misconception): That item had classical difficulty 0.473 and b = 0.404. That problem required students to factorise and then evaluate two claims, adding layers of complexity. This bracket expansion is more direct and procedural, so should be somewhat easier. But the misconception is still potent in this straightforward context.

I estimate roughly 35% answering incorrectly. The item should discriminate well because it cleanly tests one specific skill. Guessing should be low since students who understand the concept will reliably get it right, and those with the misconception will reliably choose B.
