Analyzing 10 - 8 x 7 + 6: "Which calculation should you do first?"

This is a pure knowledge-check on order of operations. Students don't need to compute anything; they just need to recognize that multiplication precedes addition and subtraction in the priority hierarchy.

Key consideration: the presence of option D ("It doesn't matter") is interesting. For students who haven't been taught BIDMAS, this is a very tempting distractor because with simple addition/subtraction chains, order genuinely doesn't matter. Students may overgeneralize from that experience. This could push difficulty higher than I'd initially expect.

Option B (10-8) targets the core misconception of left-to-right processing. Together, B and D form a strong pair of distractors that could catch a meaningful proportion of students.

Comparing to calibration: the same-misconception calibration item (0.4 - 1/5 x 3 = ) had difficulty 0.134. But that item required students to actually perform the calculation correctly, not just identify the first step. Paradoxically, the identification question might be harder for some students because they can't "accidentally" get the right answer through computation - they must explicitly know the rule. But overall, I think the simplicity and directness of this question makes it easier.

However, I want to consider that order of operations is introduced around Year 7 and the student population spans ages 11-16. Younger students in the sample may not have encountered BIDMAS yet, which could inflate difficulty somewhat.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.25 - slightly harder than the computation-based calibration item because the distractors B and D are both very plausible, and some younger students may not have learned the rule yet. IRT difficulty around -0.20. Good discrimination expected since this is a clean single-concept test.
