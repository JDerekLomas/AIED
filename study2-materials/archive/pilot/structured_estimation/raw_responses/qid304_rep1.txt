Let me analyze this item carefully.

The question asks about order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEMDAS) - specifically which calculation should be done first in the expression 1+2×(3-4).

The correct answer is C (3-4) because brackets/parentheses have the highest priority in order of operations.

Let me consider each distractor:
- A) 1+2: This would be chosen by students who work left to right regardless of order of operations
- B) 2×3: This might be chosen by students who know multiplication comes before addition but ignore brackets
- D) "It doesn't matter": This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of order of operations

The misconception being tested is "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order" - this directly relates to distractor A.

Comparing to calibration items:
- The similar misconception item (0.4-1/5×3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.245
- That item required actual computation, while this item just asks which operation to do first

This is a more direct, conceptual question about order of operations rather than requiring full computation. It's testing recognition of the rule rather than application.

Ratings analysis:
- Concept complexity: This involves understanding order of operations (BIDMAS) - a single but important concept (3-4)
- Procedural steps: Just need to identify the priority - very few steps (2)
- Abstraction level: Fairly concrete - looking at a specific expression (3)
- Prerequisite knowledge: Need to know BIDMAS rules (4)
- Distractor plausibility: A is very plausible for those with the misconception, B might attract some, D is less likely (5)
- Misconception strength: Left-to-right processing is a very common misconception (7)
- Question clarity: Very clear what's being asked (9)
- Cognitive load: Low - just need to apply the rule (3)
- Age appropriateness: Order of operations is typically taught around Year 6-7, so very appropriate for 11-16 (9)
- Transfer distance: This is a standard presentation of order of operations questions (3)
- Visual complexity: Simple numerical expression with brackets (3)
- Solution uniqueness: Need to understand BIDMAS to get it right, but partial knowledge could help (6)

For predictions:
- This is a fairly straightforward question about a fundamental concept
- The similar item with the same misconception had difficulty 0.134
- However, that item required computation while this just asks about identification
- This should be easier than that item
- I estimate classical difficulty around 0.15-0.20 (proportion incorrect)
- IRT difficulty should be negative (easy item), around -0.5 to -0.8
- Discrimination should be moderate to good since it clearly separates those who know BIDMAS from those who don't
- Guessing should be low since students will likely have a systematic approach (right or wrong)
