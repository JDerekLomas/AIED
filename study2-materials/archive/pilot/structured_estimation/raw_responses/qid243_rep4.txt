Solving 3n + 2 >= 4n - 5. Correct: C (7 >= n).

Let me approach this from a curriculum perspective. In the UK secondary curriculum, solving linear inequalities appears in Key Stage 3/4 (ages 13-16). Students encounter equations first, then inequalities. The additional challenge with inequalities is tracking the direction of the sign, especially when multiplying or dividing by negatives.

This particular item doesn't require dividing by a negative (since 4n - 3n = +n), so the inequality direction is preserved throughout. The main challenge is correctly applying inverse operations to collect terms.

Step-by-step solution:
3n + 2 >= 4n - 5
Subtract 3n: 2 >= n - 5
Add 5: 7 >= n

Only two steps needed. The arithmetic is simple (just adding 2 + 5 = 7).

Now, thinking about the student population: the Eedi platform typically serves a broad range of abilities. For this item type, I'd expect a bimodal-ish distribution — students who have mastered solving inequalities will find this routine, while those still developing the skill will likely fall into one of the distractor traps.

Distractor A (-3 >= n) directly tests the misconception. If a student subtracts 5 from 2 instead of adding (same operation, not inverse), they get -3. This is a very natural error.

Distractor D is interesting because it's mathematically equivalent to the correct answer if you read it as "n is at most 7" but written as n >= 7, which actually means "n is at least 7" — the opposite. Students who focus on the numbers but not the inequality direction will choose D.

Comparing with calibration: the closest match is the 2n+3 <= 3n-7 item. That item yielded classical difficulty 0.569. I think this item might be slightly easier — the numbers are smaller and the arithmetic cleaner. But the C vs D confusion could offset that. I'll estimate 0.54 classical difficulty.

For IRT parameters: b around 0.72 (slightly below the anchor's 0.808), discrimination around 1.10 (slightly above the anchor's 1.050 because the misconception distractor A is very well-targeted), and guessing around 0.16.
