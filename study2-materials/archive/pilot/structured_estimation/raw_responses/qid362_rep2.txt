Analyzing: "A line has equation 4x + 3y = 5. What is its gradient?"

The solution requires converting from general form to slope-intercept form. Steps: subtract 4x from both sides to get 3y = -4x + 5, then divide by 3 to get y = (-4/3)x + 5/3. The gradient is the coefficient of x, which is -4/3.

Key considerations for difficulty estimation:

1. Topic intersection: This sits at the intersection of algebra (equation rearrangement) and coordinate geometry (understanding gradient). Students need to know that gradient = m in y = mx + c AND be able to rearrange correctly. This dual requirement increases difficulty.

2. The fraction in the answer is significant. Many students at KS3/KS4 are uncomfortable with fractional gradients and may second-guess themselves even if they rearrange correctly. This could push some students toward -4 (option A) as a "cleaner" answer.

3. The negative sign is another hurdle. Students must track the sign change when moving 4x across the equals sign. The tested misconception directly targets this.

4. Looking at the calibration set, items testing "uses same operation rather than inverse" range from easy (b=-0.702) to hard (b=0.808). The easier ones involve simpler equations; the harder ones involve more steps or concepts. This item has moderate complexity -- harder than p+10=-5 but perhaps comparable to the inequality.

5. However, the inequality item also required understanding of inequality notation and had more algebraic complexity. This gradient item is conceptually challenging but procedurally moderate.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.52 (slightly more than half get it wrong), b around 0.50. The distractors are systematically constructed to capture specific errors, which should yield decent discrimination. The guessing parameter should be low since students with partial knowledge will systematically choose a specific wrong answer rather than guess.
