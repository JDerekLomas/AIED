Analyzing the compound inequality -3 < 2x + 1 < 7.

Solution path: Subtract 1 throughout: -4 < 2x < 6. Divide by 2 throughout: -2 < x < 3. Answer A.

This is a compound inequality which is a step up from the single inequality in calibration item 5 (b=0.808, classical=0.569). However, the actual algebra here is straightforward -- just two inverse operations applied uniformly. The compound format adds cognitive load because students must track three expressions simultaneously.

Looking at the distractors through the lens of the tested misconception (same operation instead of inverse):
- If a student adds 1 instead of subtracting: -2 < 2x < 8, then /2: -1 < x < 4. Not an option, but -1 < x < 3 (option B) is close -- perhaps a student who adds 1 to the left but subtracts from the right, or makes an arithmetic error.
- Option D (-5 < x < 15): Could arise from multiplying by 2 instead of dividing. -3-1=-4, then *2=-8... doesn't quite work either. Maybe -3*2-... These distractors seem somewhat constructed rather than arising naturally from the misconception.
- Option C (-0.5 < x < 2.5): Possibly from dividing by 2 first without subtracting 1? (-3)/2 = -1.5... no. Or (2x+1)/2 treated as x + 0.5, so -3 < x + 0.5 < 7, then -3.5 < x < 6.5... no.

The distractors are moderately plausible but don't all map cleanly to the stated misconception. The item requires multi-step reasoning but is standard curriculum content for ages 14-16.

Comparing to calibration: This feels harder than calibration item 3 (b=0.002) but perhaps comparable to item 4 (b=0.404) or slightly harder. The compound inequality format pushes difficulty up. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.52 and IRT b around 0.55.
