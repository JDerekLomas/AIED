The target item asks students to evaluate 3 - 5 + 4 × 2. Applying BIDMAS/BODMAS correctly: first compute 4 × 2 = 8, then 3 - 5 + 8 = 6. The correct answer is A (6).

Let me trace each distractor:
- A) 6: Correct. Follows order of operations properly.
- B) 4: This would come from computing 3 - 5 + 4 × 2 left to right but making an error, or perhaps 3 - 5 + 4 = 2, then 2 × 2... wait, that gives 4. So B represents strict left-to-right computation: (((3-5)+4)×2) = ((−2+4)×2) = (2×2) = 4. This is the classic BIDMAS misconception.
- C) -12: Possibly (3-5) × (4-2)... no. Or maybe (3 - 5 + 4) × 2 with a sign error? (-5+4) = -1, 3-1=2... no. Let me try: if someone does 3 - (5+4) × 2 = 3 - 18 = -15, not quite. Or 3 - 5 × 4 + 2... reordering? Actually (3-5)=−2, then −2 × (4+2) = −12. Some combination of left-to-right and grouping errors.
- D) -10: Perhaps 3 - 5 - 4 × 2 = 3 - 5 - 8 = -10. This represents a sign error, treating the + as -.

The item uses only integers and basic operations. It's a standard BIDMAS question that appears frequently in KS3 curricula. The misconception tested (left-to-right regardless of priority) is very common among younger students.

Comparing to the calibration item 0.4 - 1/5 × 3: that item involves decimals and fractions, making it computationally harder, yet had classical difficulty of only 0.134. The current item uses simpler numbers but the same core misconception. The left-to-right error here produces distractor B (4), which is quite plausible. However, with simpler numbers, students who know BIDMAS should find this straightforward. I'd estimate slightly lower difficulty than the calibration item since the arithmetic is simpler, but the misconception pull is strong.

I estimate classical difficulty around 0.15-0.20, IRT difficulty around -0.3 to 0.0. The discrimination should be moderate to high since the item cleanly separates those who know order of operations from those who don't.
