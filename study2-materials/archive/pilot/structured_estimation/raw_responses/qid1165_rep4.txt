The item asks students to find the product of -8 and -2 within the context of expanding (x-8)(x-2). The arrows point to the last terms of each bracket. The correct answer is +16 (B).

Key considerations:

1. Conceptual demands: Students need to understand bracket expansion (FOIL method or equivalent), recognize that the indicated step is multiplication, and know that (-8)(-2) = +16. The first two are contextual; the core test is the sign rule.

2. Misconception prevalence: The belief that negative x negative = negative is extremely common among secondary students. Research consistently shows this is one of the most persistent arithmetic misconceptions. Even students who can state the rule abstractly often get it wrong in context.

3. Distractor quality: D (-16) directly targets the misconception. A (-10) catches operation confusion. C (-6) is less clearly motivated but provides an alternative for confused students. The distractors are well-designed with D being the primary trap.

4. Comparison to calibration items: The Tom/Katie item testing the same misconception had difficulty 0.473 but required much more complex reasoning (expanding and checking two quadratics). This item isolates just the multiplication step. I'd expect it to be noticeably easier, perhaps in the 0.30-0.40 range.

5. The visual element (diagram with arrows) is important -- it removes ambiguity about which terms to multiply, but students must interpret the diagram correctly. Some students unfamiliar with this presentation style might struggle with interpretation rather than the math itself.

I'll anchor my estimate around 0.40 for classical difficulty. The misconception is strong enough that even with the simpler format, a substantial proportion of students will select D. IRT difficulty probably around 0.2-0.3. Discrimination should be solid -- this is a clean diagnostic item. Low guessing since the misconception systematically drives incorrect responses toward D.
