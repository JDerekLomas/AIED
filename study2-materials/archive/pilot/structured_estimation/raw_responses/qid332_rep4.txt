Item analysis for (x/3) - 5 = 12, with Tom and Katie each proposing a next step.

Verifying Tom: x/3 = 17. Starting from (x/3) - 5 = 12, add 5 to both sides: x/3 = 17. Correct.

Verifying Katie: x - 5 = 36. Starting from (x/3) - 5 = 12, multiply both sides by 3: should give x - 15 = 36. Katie wrote x - 5 = 36. She correctly multiplied x/3 by 3 and 12 by 3, but left -5 unchanged. This is incorrect - she failed to distribute the multiplication to all terms.

Answer: A (Only Tom).

Difficulty analysis: The "Who is correct?" format is a higher-order task - it's easier to solve an equation yourself than to evaluate someone else's steps. However, Tom's step is quite obviously correct to anyone with basic algebra skills, so the real discriminating factor is whether students can detect Katie's error.

Katie's error is subtle and common. Many students aged 12-15 struggle with distributing multiplication across multi-term expressions. The fact that two of the three components of Katie's step are correct (x/3 * 3 = x, 12 * 3 = 36) makes it highly plausible. I expect option C ("Both") to be the most popular incorrect answer.

Calibration anchoring: The Tom/Katie factoring item is the closest parallel in format. That had classical difficulty 0.473 and b = 0.404 with discrimination 1.451. The factoring item required understanding of negative number multiplication in the context of factoring, which is arguably more conceptually demanding. However, fractions and distribution errors are very common stumbling blocks at KS3/KS4.

I think this item is slightly easier than the factoring one because the algebra involved (linear equation) is more accessible than quadratic factoring. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.42, IRT b around 0.25. Discrimination should be good since the item cleanly targets algebraic understanding. The guessing parameter is probably low to moderate.
