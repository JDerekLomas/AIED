This item asks students to determine which algebraic expression correctly represents a sequence of operations: "Think of a number, subtract 5, divide by 8, add 4, multiply by 7."

Let me trace through the operations step by step with variable n:
1. Start: n
2. Subtract 5: n - 5
3. Divide by 8: (n - 5) / 8
4. Add 4: (n - 5)/8 + 4
5. Multiply by 7: 7 * ((n - 5)/8 + 4)

Jo's expression: 7((n-5)/8 + 4) — this matches exactly. Jo is correct.

Paul's expression: 7((n-5) ÷ 8) + 4 — here the multiplication by 7 happens before adding 4. Paul's brackets only enclose the division step, so the +4 is outside the multiplication by 7. This doesn't match the sequence. Paul is incorrect.

So the answer is A (Only Jo).

The misconception tested is "carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order." A student who reads Paul's expression left-to-right without attending to brackets/order might think Paul is also correct, leading them to answer C (Both).

Comparing to calibration items:
- The order-of-operations item (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT b = -0.245. That was purely computational.
- This item requires understanding how brackets affect order of operations in algebraic expressions, plus translating a word problem into algebra. It's more complex.
- The factorising item (Tom and Katie) had difficulty 0.473, b = 0.404. That required checking two factorisations.
- This item involves multiple steps of reasoning: translating the word sequence, then checking two expressions. The "who is correct" format adds cognitive load since students must evaluate both.

I'd estimate this is moderately difficult — harder than the simple equation items but comparable to the Tom/Katie item. The distinction between Jo's and Paul's expressions is subtle (whether +4 is inside or outside the multiplication by 7), which makes distractors plausible. Many students struggle with nested brackets.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.50, IRT difficulty around 0.45. The discrimination should be reasonable since it tests a clear misconception. Some guessing is likely given the "who is correct" format invites elimination.
