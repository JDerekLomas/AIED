Analyzing the fraction addition item: 3/5 + 1/4 = ?

The correct procedure is to find a common denominator. LCM(5,4) = 20. So 3/5 = 12/20, 1/4 = 5/20, sum = 17/20 (option D).

The misconception "adds numerators and denominators" produces 4/9 (option A). This is an extremely common error pattern, especially among students who haven't fully internalized why common denominators are necessary.

Thinking about the population of UK secondary students ages 11-16: by the upper end of this range, most students should handle this. But at ages 11-12, many will still make this error. Across the full range, I'd expect maybe 30-40% to get it wrong.

The visual presentation uses a circle diagram which is slightly non-standard - instead of just saying "add these fractions," it wraps it in a visual puzzle format. This adds a small layer of interpretation but is generally clear.

Key consideration: the correct answer 17/20 has a numerator larger than either input numerator, which might seem counterintuitive to weaker students (they might expect a "smaller-looking" answer). This could push some students toward the incorrect options.

Option B (4/20) is interesting - it represents a student who found the common denominator but forgot to scale the numerators. Option C (7/20) might come from 3+4=7 with denominator 20, possibly confusing which numbers to add.

Given the strong misconception and multiple plausible distractors, I think this item discriminates well. Comparing to calibration: harder than the basic equation solving (0.167) but easier than the inequality (0.569). I'll place it around 0.38.

For guessing: the correct answer D (17/20) doesn't "look" like a typical guess since it's the largest fraction. Students guessing randomly would likely pick something simpler like 4/9. So guessing parameter should be low.
