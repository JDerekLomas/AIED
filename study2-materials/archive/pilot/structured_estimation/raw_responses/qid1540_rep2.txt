Evaluating y = x² - 2x + 1 when x = -1.

Correct: (-1)² - 2(-1) + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 (B).

This is fundamentally a substitution task, which is a core algebraic skill taught from Year 7 onwards. The difficulty comes entirely from handling negative numbers, not from conceptual complexity.

Thinking about the distractor structure: three of the four answers (A=-2, C=2, D=0) can be reached through systematic errors with negatives. This means the item discriminates well between students who understand negative number arithmetic and those who don't.

The table of values format is very standard — students encounter this regularly when plotting quadratic graphs. So the transfer distance is low. However, the combination of squaring a negative and multiplying by a negative coefficient creates a multi-step negative-number challenge.

Comparing to calibration items: the equation -5 = p + 10 (classical difficulty 0.167) is much simpler. The factorisation item with the same misconception (0.473) involves conceptual reasoning about expanding brackets. This substitution item sits somewhere in between — it's procedural rather than conceptual, but the negative arithmetic is genuinely challenging.

I think this is moderate difficulty. Students who are comfortable with negatives will find it straightforward; those who aren't will likely get option C (the "half-wrong" answer where they only make one negative error). I estimate about 35-40% incorrect, putting it slightly below the factorisation item.
