This item tests whether students understand the sign rules for multiplying and dividing negative numbers. Let me work through each person's claim.

Tom says: -3 × (-8) = -24. The rule is negative × negative = positive, so -3 × (-8) = 24. Tom's answer of -24 is wrong.

Katie says: (-24) / (-3) = -8. Similarly, negative ÷ negative = positive, so (-24)/(-3) = 8. Katie's answer of -8 is wrong.

Neither is correct, so D is the answer.

The diagram context is interesting — it shows a directed arrow representing -24 and a sub-arrow that's a third of the length. This is meant to give a geometric interpretation of the division/multiplication. Students need to connect the abstract sign rules with the visual representation.

For difficulty estimation, I want to think about what different students would do:
- A student with the "two negatives make negative" misconception would verify both Tom and Katie as correct, choosing C.
- A student who knows the rule for multiplication but not division (or vice versa) might choose A or B.
- Only students who correctly apply sign rules to both operations would choose D.

The "neither" option is notoriously difficult for students because it requires confidence to reject both claims. This creates a psychological barrier beyond the mathematical one.

Looking at the calibration set, the factorising item with the same misconception had difficulty 0.473 and b=0.404. That item required factorising knowledge on top of the sign rule. This item is more straightforward computationally but the "both wrong" structure and diagram interpretation add difficulty. I'd put it at a similar level, perhaps slightly higher difficulty.

The discrimination should be moderate — students who understand sign rules will get it right, but the "neither" option might cause some high-ability students to second-guess themselves, slightly lowering discrimination.
