This item asks students to evaluate two steps in solving the equation 15 = (1+k)/4. Let me work through it:

Step 1: Multiply both sides by 4 → 60 = 1 + k. This is correct — the inverse of dividing by 4 is multiplying by 4.

Step 2: 61 = k. This is WRONG. The student added 1 to both sides instead of subtracting 1. The correct step would be 60 - 1 = k, so k = 59. The student used the same operation (addition) rather than the inverse (subtraction).

So the correct answer is A (Only Step 1 is correct).

Looking at the calibration items for reference:
- The first calibration item tests the same misconception ("uses same operation rather than inverse") with classical difficulty 0.167 and IRT b = -0.702. That was a straightforward solve-the-equation task.
- The inequality item (same misconception) had classical difficulty 0.569 and b = 0.808, but that involved inequalities and collecting variables from both sides — much harder.

This target item is more complex than the first calibration because students must evaluate someone else's work rather than solve directly. This metacognitive demand increases difficulty. However, Step 1 is clearly correct and Step 2 has an obvious error if you check it. The misconception being tested (adding instead of subtracting) is very common.

The distractors: Option B (only step 2) would require thinking step 1 is wrong but step 2 is right — unlikely. Option C (both correct) would be chosen by students who don't check carefully. Option D (both wrong) might attract students confused by the fraction. The main attractor is likely C for students who assume both steps look reasonable.

Comparing to calibration items, I'd place this around 0.35-0.45 classical difficulty — harder than the simple equation (0.167) because of the evaluative framing, but easier than the inequality (0.569). IRT difficulty around 0.1-0.3.
