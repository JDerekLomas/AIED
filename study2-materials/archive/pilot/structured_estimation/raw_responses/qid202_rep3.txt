Target: 2 1/5 + 1 2/5 = ? (as mixed number). Correct answer: A, 3 3/5.

Let me think about this from the student perspective. A Year 7 or 8 student sees two mixed numbers to add. The fractions have the same denominator, which is good. But how many students at this level actually recognize that and proceed correctly?

Research suggests fraction addition misconceptions are remarkably persistent. The "add tops and bottoms" error is one of the most common in mathematics education. Even when denominators match, students who have internalized this faulty procedure will still add 5+5=10 for the denominator.

Distractor D (3 3/10) is particularly seductive because the whole number part is correct, so a student gets partial reinforcement. They think "I got the 3 right, the fractions look right, this must be correct."

Distractor B (18/5) is interesting because it IS mathematically equivalent to the correct answer. Students who convert to improper fractions and compute correctly but don't convert back will choose this. This is more of a "reading the question" error than a mathematical misconception.

Distractor C (18/10) requires both converting to improper fractions AND adding denominators -- a double error that's probably less common.

Given the prevalence of fraction misconceptions in UK secondary, I think this item may be harder than it first appears. I'd estimate maybe 30% get it wrong, putting classical difficulty at 0.30. The fraction addition misconception is one of the most robust in the research literature.

Calibrating against the examples: the factorising item had 0.473 difficulty and tested a misconception about negatives. This item tests a similarly common misconception but in a simpler computational context. I'll put it around 0.28-0.32.

IRT difficulty: around -0.1 to 0.1 (near average, slightly below).
Discrimination: moderate, around 1.3. The item clearly separates students who understand fraction addition from those who don't.
Guessing: some students might guess A because it's the "neatest" answer, so perhaps 0.10.
