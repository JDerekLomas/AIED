Analyzing: 8 - 7 / 6^3, which operation first?

This is a direct test of order of operations knowledge. The expression contains three operations: subtraction, division, and exponentiation. BIDMAS dictates: Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction. So 6^3 (indices) comes first.

Let me consider how students might approach this differently from a standard BIDMAS textbook question. Typically, students practice BIDMAS by computing full expressions. Here, they just need to identify the first step. This is actually a metacognitive task — thinking about the process rather than doing it. Some research suggests students can apply rules procedurally without being able to articulate them, so this "identify the step" format might trip up students who can compute correctly but can't explicitly state the rule.

On the other hand, the BIDMAS mnemonic is so heavily drilled that many students can recite the order even if they sometimes fail to apply it in computation. So this identification task might actually be easier than computation.

The distractor analysis: Option C (8-7, left-to-right) is the primary misconception target. Option B (7/6, doing division before indices) tests a subtler misunderstanding — perhaps students who remember "division comes somewhere in the middle" but forget indices come before it. Option D (doesn't matter) catches students with no understanding of order of operations.

Looking at calibration data, the closest comparison is the 0.4 - 1/5 x 3 item (same misconception, classical difficulty 0.134). That required computation; this requires identification only. I'd expect this to be comparable or slightly easier.

However, I want to consider that the exponent notation 6^3 might itself be a source of confusion for younger students. Some Year 7 students might not even recognize what 6^3 means, leading them to skip over it and choose B or C. This could push difficulty up slightly.

Balancing these factors, I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.20 and IRT difficulty around -0.25. Discrimination should be solid since this is a clean single-concept item.
