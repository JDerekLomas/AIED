The target item presents a partially worked equation: x - 7 = ... on one line, then x = ... on the next, with a star indicating the operation applied to both sides. Students must identify that +7 was applied to isolate x. The correct answer is A (+7).

This is fundamentally about understanding inverse operations in equation solving. The misconception tested is "uses the same operation rather than the inverse," meaning a student who doesn't understand inverse operations would pick D (-7).

Considering the cognitive demands: the student doesn't need to perform any calculation. They need to read a diagram, understand the notation of recording operations on both sides, and recognize that subtracting 7 is undone by adding 7. The visual presentation with the star and arrow adds a slight interpretive demand but is fairly standard in UK maths teaching.

Looking at calibration anchors: The simplest calibration item (solve -5 = p + 10) had classical difficulty 0.167 and IRT b = -0.702, with discrimination 1.324. That item requires actually computing the answer. This item is more of a recognition task, which should be easier. However, the diagram-based presentation and the slightly unusual format (identifying the operation rather than the answer) might trip up some students who aren't used to this framing.

The distractor set: +7 (correct), x7, /7, -7. Only -7 is a strong distractor testing the target misconception. The multiply and divide options are weak distractors for this context. This somewhat reduces discriminatory power since students who don't fully understand might still eliminate B and C.

I'll place this as an easy item: classical difficulty around 0.13, IRT b around -0.80.
