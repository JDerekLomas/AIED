Analyzing this formula rearrangement item. Students must transform A = (1/2)bh into h = ...

The algebraic steps are: multiply by 2, divide by b, yielding h = 2A/b (option B).

I want to approach this from the perspective of common student errors and how they map to the answer choices.

Error pattern 1 (Option A): Student treats rearrangement as simple substitution -- swapping A and h in the original formula. This yields h = (1/2)(bA). This is a very basic misunderstanding, likely from younger or lower-ability students.

Error pattern 2 (Option C): Student attempts rearrangement but applies the same operation instead of the inverse. Seeing that h is multiplied by (1/2) and b in the original, the student divides by both 2 and b, getting h = A/(2b). This is the primary misconception being tested and is extremely common in the research literature on algebraic equation solving.

Error pattern 3 (Option D): Student either cannot solve it and defaults to this, or makes an error that doesn't match any option and concludes they're all wrong.

What's interesting about this item is the interplay between the formula context and the algebraic demands. The triangle area formula is very well-known, which means students might try to use memorized versions rather than algebraic manipulation. Some students might actually know that h = 2A/b from memory rather than deriving it, which would reduce discrimination slightly.

Thinking about the calibration set more carefully: the items testing this same misconception show a clear progression. Simple linear equation: 0.167. Function machine: 0.295. Inequality with multiple terms: 0.569. This formula rearrangement sits somewhere in between -- it's more complex than a single-operation equation but the context is very familiar. I'd place it around 0.40-0.52.

One factor that could push difficulty higher is that many students are more comfortable "solving for x" in equations than "making y the subject" in formulae. The language of "rearrangement" and "subject" can itself be a barrier.

I'll estimate classical difficulty at 0.52, IRT difficulty slightly above zero, good discrimination, and low guessing.
