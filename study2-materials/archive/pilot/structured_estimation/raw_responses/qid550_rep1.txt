Analyzing this order of operations item step by step.

Tom's claim: 3+2-1 = 3-1+2
- Left side: 3+2-1 = 5-1 = 4
- Right side: 3-1+2 = 2+2 = 4
- Tom is correct. This works because addition and subtraction are inverse operations at the same precedence level, and we can think of this as 3+(+2)+(-1) = 3+(-1)+(+2), which is just commutativity of addition.

Katie's claim: 3+2x1 = 2x1+3
- Left side: By BIDMAS, multiplication first: 2x1=2, then 3+2=5
- Right side: By BIDMAS, multiplication first: 2x1=2, then 2+3=5
- Katie is correct. The multiplication is performed first regardless of position, and then the addition is commutative.

Answer C is correct: both are right.

Now thinking about where students go wrong. The tested misconception is about left-to-right processing. A student who rigidly applies left-to-right might:
- For Tom: 3+2=5, 5-1=4 vs 3-1=2, 2+2=4. They'd likely say Tom is correct.
- For Katie: 3+2=5, 5x1=5 vs 2x1=2, 2+3=5. If they do left-to-right, LHS becomes 5 and RHS becomes 5. So they'd also get Katie correct!

Wait, so the misconception doesn't actually lead to an incorrect answer here? That's interesting. The numbers are chosen so that even with the misconception, you get the same numerical answers. So perhaps the difficulty is more about the conceptual understanding rather than getting tripped up by computation.

Actually, I think the real trap might be different. Some students might reason: "Tom just swapped the order of + and -, that's fine. But Katie has a multiplication mixed in, so you can't just rearrange." This is a more conceptual error about whether commutativity applies when mixed operations are involved. They'd pick A (Only Tom).

Looking at the calibration set for comparison:
- The simple equation (-5=p+10) was very easy: 0.167 classical difficulty
- The BODMAS item with fractions: 0.134 difficulty (surprisingly easy)
- The factoring Tom/Katie item: 0.473 difficulty

This item uses the same Tom/Katie format as the factoring item. The "who is correct" format requires evaluating two separate claims and combining judgments, which increases cognitive load. However, the arithmetic here is trivially simple compared to factoring quadratics.

I think this falls in moderate difficulty range. The format creates some challenge but the math is very accessible. Students who understand BIDMAS well will breeze through it. Those who are shaky on order of operations might incorrectly say only Tom is right.

Estimating classical difficulty around 0.25-0.30, somewhat easier than the factoring item.
