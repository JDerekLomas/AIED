Target: factorise x^2 - x - 6. Answer: (x-3)(x+2) = option A.

I want to think about this from the student perspective. A student approaching this needs to find two numbers that multiply to -6 and add to -1. The number pairs that multiply to 6 are (1,6), (2,3). Since the product must be -6, one must be negative. To get sum -1, we need -3 and +2.

Now, many students learn factorisation somewhat mechanically. Some might try each option by expanding -- this is a viable strategy with MCQ and would make the item easier than if it were free-response. A student who can reliably expand brackets would get this right by testing each option.

But students who try to factorise directly face the sign challenge. The misconception about negative times negative is common in early algebra.

Looking at the calibration items: the easiest was the simple equation -5 = p + 10 (classical difficulty 0.167). The hardest was the inequality (0.569). The Tom/Katie factorising item was 0.473.

This item is a direct factorisation with a negative constant term, which is harder than positive constant terms. But it's multiple choice, so students can use elimination or expansion. I think it's comparable to Tom/Katie but the MCQ format with expandable options might make it slightly easier. I'll estimate 0.40 classical difficulty.

For discrimination, factorisation items tend to discriminate well. I'll estimate a = 1.45. The guessing parameter might be slightly elevated since students might guess between A and D (both give -6 as constant).
