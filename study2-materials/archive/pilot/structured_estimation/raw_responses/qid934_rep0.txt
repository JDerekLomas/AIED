Let me analyze this item carefully. The question presents a table of values for the equation 4x + 2y = 10. When x = 0, we need to find y (the star).

Substituting x = 0: 4(0) + 2y = 10 => 2y = 10 => y = 5. So the correct answer is C (5).

Now let me consider the distractors and the misconception tested ("uses the same operation rather than the inverse"):

- Option A (20): A student might compute 4(0) + 2y = 10, get 2y = 10, then multiply by 2 instead of dividing: y = 20. This directly tests the misconception of using the same operation rather than the inverse.
- Option B (3): Perhaps from misreading or a different computational error. Maybe thinking 4+2=6, then 10-6=4... not obvious. Or substituting x=1 instead of x=0 and getting 4+2y=10, 2y=6, y=3.
- Option C (5): Correct.
- Option D (2.5): Could come from dividing 10 by 4 instead of 2, or some other partial approach. Maybe 10/4 = 2.5.

Comparing to calibration items: The equation solving here is straightforward, requiring substitution and one-step algebra. The table format adds a small layer of interpretation but the math is simple. The misconception (same operation instead of inverse) appeared in several calibration items at various difficulties.

The item is relatively easy -- it only requires substituting x=0 and solving 2y=10. However, distractor A (20) is well-designed for the target misconception. Looking at the calibration items, the simplest equation solving item had classical difficulty 0.167 and IRT b = -0.702. This item is similarly straightforward but has the added step of reading a table, so I'd expect it to be slightly harder but still on the easier side.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.25-0.30, IRT difficulty around -0.3 to 0.0. The discrimination should be moderate since it cleanly separates those who understand inverse operations. Guessing should be low since the distractors are meaningful.
