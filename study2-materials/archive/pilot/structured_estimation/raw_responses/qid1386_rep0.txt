This item asks students to add two algebraic fractions with the same denominator: 2/x + 3/x. The correct procedure is straightforward - since the denominators are the same, simply add the numerators: (2+3)/x = 5/x, which is answer B.

Looking at the distractors:
- A) 5x/x^2: This could result from multiplying numerator by x and denominator by x, essentially creating an equivalent but unsimplified fraction. It equals 5/x when simplified, so it's technically correct but not "as simply as possible." This is a plausible trap.
- C) 5/2x: This comes from adding the denominators (x+x=2x) while correctly adding numerators. This matches the tested misconception of adding both numerators and denominators.
- D) 6/x^2: This comes from multiplying the numerators (2*3=6) and multiplying the denominators (x*x=x^2), confusing addition of fractions with multiplication.

The misconception tested is "adds numerators and denominators" which maps to distractor C. This is a very common misconception with numerical fractions that transfers directly to algebraic fractions.

Comparing to calibration items: This is relatively straightforward algebraically. The concept is basic fraction addition with a common denominator, just using x instead of a number. The first calibration item (solving -5=p+10) had classical difficulty 0.167 and was quite easy. This item should be similarly easy or slightly harder because algebraic fractions can be intimidating, but the operation itself is trivial.

I estimate classical difficulty around 0.20-0.30. The algebraic notation adds some difficulty but the operation is simple. IRT difficulty should be low, around -0.3 to 0.1. Discrimination should be moderate-good since it cleanly separates those who understand fraction addition from those who don't.
