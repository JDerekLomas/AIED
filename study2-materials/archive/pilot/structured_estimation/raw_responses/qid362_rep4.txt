Item analysis: Finding the gradient from 4x + 3y = 5.

This is a standard GCSE topic -- rearranging a linear equation to find its gradient. The correct process yields y = (-4/3)x + 5/3, so gradient = -4/3 (option C).

Let me consider the population of UK secondary students (11-16). This topic is typically covered in Year 9-10, so younger students in the 11-16 range would struggle significantly. For the full age range, difficulty will be elevated partly due to students who haven't yet encountered this topic.

However, for students who have studied coordinate geometry, this is a fairly routine exercise. The main traps are:
1. Not changing the sign of 4x when rearranging (giving 4/3 -- option D)
2. Forgetting to divide by 3 (giving -4 -- option A)
3. Just reading the coefficient (giving 4 -- option B)

The structure of the distractors is elegant: they form a 2x2 matrix of (correct sign / wrong sign) x (divided by 3 / not divided). This means each distractor captures exactly one or two specific procedural errors.

Reflecting on the calibration set more carefully: all five anchors test algebraic manipulation misconceptions. The gradient from b=-0.702 to b=0.808 correlates with increasing procedural and conceptual demands. Where does this item fall?

It requires: (a) knowing what gradient means, (b) knowing y=mx+c form, (c) rearranging correctly with sign change, (d) dividing by 3 correctly, (e) identifying m. That's substantial prerequisite knowledge but routine procedural steps.

I think this is harder than the order-of-operations item (b=-0.245) because it requires domain-specific knowledge about gradients. It's probably comparable to or slightly harder than the factorising item (b=0.404) because while factorising is harder algebraically, the gradient concept adds an extra layer of required knowledge.

Estimate: classical difficulty 0.55 (slightly more than half incorrect), b = 0.55. I'm going slightly higher than my initial instinct because students who haven't reached this topic will essentially be guessing. Discrimination around 1.20 -- good but not exceptional because the item conflates two potential errors (sign and division) which could muddy the ability-response relationship. Guessing around 0.15 given that lower-ability students who haven't learned gradients would need to guess among four options.
