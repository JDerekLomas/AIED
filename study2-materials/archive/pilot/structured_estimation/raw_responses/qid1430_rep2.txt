Analyzing 2/7 + 1/7. This is adding fractions with a common denominator, which is the simplest possible fraction addition scenario. The answer is 3/7.

The misconception tested is "adds numerators and denominators," yielding 3/14 (option D). This is a well-documented misconception in mathematics education research, particularly prevalent among students who haven't developed a conceptual understanding of fractions as parts of a whole. If you think of fractions as "two separate numbers stacked," adding both makes intuitive (but incorrect) sense.

However, I need to consider that this is a diagnostic assessment for ages 11-16. Many of these students are well past the point where this was taught. The population taking this test likely skews toward students who need diagnostic support, which might inflate the error rate compared to the general population.

Thinking about the distractors more carefully:
- D (3/14) is quite plausible for students with the target misconception
- B (2/49) would require multiplying both parts, which is unlikely in an addition context
- A (2/7) doesn't follow any obvious computational path

Compared to calibration items: the equation solving items ranged from 0.167 to 0.569 in classical difficulty. This fraction item is conceptually simpler than all of them. But fraction misconceptions can be surprisingly persistent. I'll estimate around 0.20 classical difficulty -- maybe slightly higher than the simplest equation because fraction misconceptions are deeply ingrained for some students.

IRT difficulty: probably around -0.6 to -0.8. Discrimination: the item cleanly tests one concept, so moderate-high, maybe 1.2-1.4. Guessing should be low since students either know the rule or fall for the misconception.
