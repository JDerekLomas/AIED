Evaluating 5 + 4 x 3. This tests BIDMAS - specifically whether students multiply before adding.

The correct answer is B (17): do 4 x 3 = 12 first, then 5 + 12 = 17.
The misconception answer is A (27): do 5 + 4 = 9 first, then 9 x 3 = 27.

This is a very standard item that appears in virtually every BIDMAS lesson. Because it's so commonly encountered, many students will have seen near-identical problems and learned the correct procedure, even if they don't deeply understand why multiplication takes precedence. This "procedural familiarity" effect could make the item easier than one might expect from the strength of the underlying misconception alone.

On the other hand, the Eedi platform often serves diagnostic questions to students who are currently learning the topic, meaning the sample may include many students encountering BIDMAS for the first time. This could inflate the error rate.

Distractor C (60) requires multiplying all three numbers together, which is a strange operation. Distractor D (12) is just the multiplication without the addition. Neither is particularly compelling compared to A.

Thinking about the calibration data more carefully: the equation-solving items show a progression from easy (classical difficulty 0.167) to hard (0.569). The BIDMAS calibration item (0.134) was the easiest. This target item is even simpler than that calibration BIDMAS item (no fractions or decimals). But I should consider that the simplicity of the numbers might actually make the left-to-right trap MORE tempting - students might rush through without thinking.

Balancing these factors, I estimate classical difficulty around 0.18, IRT difficulty around -0.45. High discrimination because the item cleanly separates BIDMAS-aware from BIDMAS-unaware students. Very low guessing since students who lack the knowledge will systematically choose A, not guess randomly.
