Analyzing this order of operations item. The student must determine which operation to perform first in two separate expressions.

For Problem P (4 - 5 + 6): Addition and subtraction share the same precedence level, so we proceed left to right. The first operation is 4 - 5. This is a subtle point -- many students might think addition should come before subtraction.

For Problem Q (4 + 5 x 6): Multiplication takes precedence over addition per BIDMAS, so 5 x 6 is done first.

Answer B correctly identifies both.

Key distractor analysis:
- Option A: Gets P right (4-5 first) but gets Q wrong (4+5 first). This represents the classic BIDMAS misconception -- doing left-to-right regardless of priority. This is the target misconception distractor and should attract many students.
- Option C: Gets both wrong -- thinks you go right-to-left in P (5+6) and left-to-right in Q (4+5).
- Option D: Gets P wrong (5+6 first, perhaps thinking addition before subtraction) but gets Q right (5x6). This is interesting -- a student might know multiplication comes first but incorrectly think addition always comes before subtraction.

The item has a dual structure requiring two separate judgments, which increases cognitive load. However, no actual computation is required -- just identifying the correct first step.

Comparing to calibration: The similar BIDMAS item had difficulty 0.134. But that required actual computation with fractions and decimals. This item is purely about identifying order, which is more conceptual. The dual-problem format may increase errors. I'd place this around 0.25-0.30 difficulty.

The discrimination should be moderate-to-good since this cleanly tests BIDMAS understanding. Students who know the rules will get it right; those who don't will be drawn to A.
