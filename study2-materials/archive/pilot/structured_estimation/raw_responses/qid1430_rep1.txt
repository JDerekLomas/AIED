The target item is 2/7 + 1/7, a basic same-denominator fraction addition. The correct answer is C (3/7).

Let me think about how UK secondary students (ages 11-16) would perform. Fraction addition with like denominators is typically taught in primary school (Year 5-6) and reinforced in Year 7. By the time students are in secondary school, most should be able to handle this. However, the misconception being tested -- adding both numerators and denominators -- is a persistent one that even some older students exhibit when they haven't fully internalized the concept.

Distractor analysis:
- D (3/14) is the key distractor targeting the misconception. Students who add top and bottom get this.
- B (2/49) suggests a student multiplied instead of added, which is a less common error here.
- A (2/7) is strange -- perhaps a student who thinks you multiply numerators? Or just picks the first fraction.

Given the calibration set, this item is clearly on the easy end. The easiest calibration item had classical difficulty 0.167 (proportion incorrect) with b=-0.702. This fraction question is simpler in terms of procedural demands but the fraction misconception can be sticky. I think it's comparable -- maybe slightly easier.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.12-0.15, IRT difficulty around -1.0. The discrimination should be moderate to high since it's a clean conceptual test.
