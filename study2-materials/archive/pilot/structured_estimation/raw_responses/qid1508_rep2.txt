Evaluating the expression 3 + 6 / 2 + 1 with BIDMAS:
Step 1: 6 / 2 = 3
Step 2: 3 + 3 + 1 = 7 --> Answer A

The tested misconception is performing operations left to right without regard to operator precedence. This would yield: 3+6=9, 9/2=4.5, 4.5+1=5.5 --> Answer C.

This is a straightforward BODMAS question using small whole numbers. No fractions, decimals, or negative numbers are involved. The arithmetic itself is trivial once the student identifies which operation to do first.

Key consideration: how does this compare to the calibration items? The closest match is the BODMAS calibration item (0.4 - 1/5 x 3) with classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT b = -0.245. That item involved mixed number types (decimal and fraction) and multiplication, which arguably makes the arithmetic harder. However, that item might also make the priority more obvious because multiplication of a fraction is visually distinct from addition/subtraction.

In this target item, the expression reads very naturally as a left-to-right sequence of simple operations. The numbers are small and inviting. I suspect the left-to-right pull might be stronger here than in the calibration item, potentially making this slightly harder despite simpler arithmetic.

On the other hand, "3 + 6 / 2 + 1" is a textbook-standard BODMAS problem. Students who have been drilled on this will get it instantly. The population answering these diagnostic items likely includes a range from Year 7 to Year 11.

My estimates:
- Classical difficulty: 0.22 (somewhat harder than the calibration BODMAS item due to the seductive left-to-right flow)
- IRT difficulty: -0.05 (just below average difficulty)
- Discrimination: 1.35 (good but perhaps slightly lower than the calibration item because the simpler arithmetic means some weaker students might get lucky)
- Guessing: 0.08 (mostly students either know BODMAS or fall for C, but some random selection among A/D is possible)
