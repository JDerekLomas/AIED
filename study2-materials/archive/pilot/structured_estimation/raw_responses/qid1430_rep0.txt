This item asks students to add two fractions with the same denominator: 2/7 + 1/7. This is one of the most fundamental fraction operations -- when denominators are already the same, you simply add the numerators and keep the denominator. The answer is 3/7 (option C).

Looking at the distractors:
- A) 2/7: This could result from multiplying the numerators (2*1=2) and keeping the denominator, or just picking one of the fractions.
- B) 2/49: This looks like multiplying both numerators and both denominators (2*1)/(7*7), confusing addition with multiplication of fractions.
- C) 3/7: Correct. 2+1=3, keep denominator 7.
- D) 3/14: This is the tested misconception -- adding numerators AND denominators: (2+1)/(7+7) = 3/14.

The misconception of adding denominators is very common among younger students first learning fractions. However, this item is quite straightforward for anyone who has learned basic fraction addition. Compared to the calibration items, this should be easier than most. The first calibration item (solving -5=p+10) had classical difficulty 0.167 and IRT b=-0.702. This fraction item is arguably even simpler conceptually, but the fraction misconception is widespread enough that some students will fall for D.

I'd estimate classical difficulty around 0.15-0.20 (similar to the easiest calibration items). IRT difficulty probably around -1.0 to -0.5. Discrimination should be reasonable since it cleanly separates students who understand fraction addition from those who don't.
