This item asks students to find the missing value in: -3/4 * star = -1. To solve, students must divide both sides by -3/4, which is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal -4/3. So star = -1 / (-3/4) = -1 * (-4/3) = 4/3. The correct answer is A (4/3).

The tested misconception is "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer." A student with this misconception would correctly compute the magnitude (4/3) but think the answer should be negative, selecting B (-4/3).

Looking at the distractors:
- A: 4/3 (correct - negative times positive gives negative, matching -1)
- B: -4/3 (misconception target - student thinks two negatives make negative)
- C: 3/4 (student may just flip the sign of -3/4 without taking reciprocal)
- D: -3/4 (student may think the star is the same as the coefficient)

Comparing to calibration items: The factorising item testing the same misconception had classical difficulty 0.473 and IRT b=0.404. This item involves fraction manipulation AND negative number reasoning, which adds complexity. However, it's more direct - just one operation to undo. The fraction reciprocal aspect adds procedural demand beyond just the sign misconception.

I'd estimate this is moderately difficult. The combination of fractions and negatives is challenging for KS3/KS4 students. The distractors are quite plausible - B directly targets the misconception, C and D represent common partial-understanding errors.

I estimate classical difficulty around 0.50-0.55, IRT difficulty around 0.5, good discrimination since the misconception cleanly separates understanding levels, and modest guessing given four options with plausible distractors.
