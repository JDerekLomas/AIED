The target item presents 8 - 7 / 6^3 and asks which calculation should be done first. This tests BIDMAS/BODMAS awareness — specifically whether students know that indices (exponents) take priority over division and subtraction.

Let me think about the student population. UK secondary students aged 11-16 encounter order of operations early in KS3 (years 7-8). By the time they've had some teaching on this, most should know that brackets and indices come first. The acronym BIDMAS is widely taught.

The key misconception is "carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order." Option C (8-7) directly reflects this — a student reading left to right would start with subtraction. Option B (7 / 6) could attract students who know subtraction isn't first but miss that exponentiation precedes division. Option D is for students who fundamentally don't understand that order matters.

Comparing to the calibration anchor with the same misconception: 0.4 - 1/5 x 3. That item had classical difficulty 0.134. However, that required students to actually execute the operations and get a numerical answer, which is harder. This item merely asks identification of the first step, which is more straightforward.

But there's a counterargument: the presence of 6^3 might confuse some students who are less familiar with exponents, potentially making them overlook it and pick division instead. This could increase the error rate slightly.

I think this item is relatively easy. The question is very clear and direct. Students who know BIDMAS will immediately pick A. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.18 — slightly harder than the computation-based BIDMAS item because students need to specifically recognize exponents as higher priority than division, which is a finer distinction than multiplication before subtraction.

For IRT parameters: moderate-to-high discrimination since this cleanly tests one concept. Low guessing since the question format is straightforward.
