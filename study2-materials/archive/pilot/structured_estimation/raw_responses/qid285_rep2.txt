Target: Rearrange F = r * omega^2 to make omega the subject. Correct answer B: omega = sqrt(F/r).

This is a formula rearrangement problem involving two inverse operations: undoing multiplication (divide by r) and undoing squaring (take square root). The order matters conceptually but not algebraically — you could square root first then divide, though that's less standard.

Thinking about UK curriculum placement: changing the subject of a formula with powers appears in GCSE Higher tier, typically years 10-11 (ages 14-16). This is solidly within curriculum but at the more demanding end.

Distractor quality assessment:
- A is weak — rF^2 doesn't follow any logical error pathway that a partially-skilled student would make. It would only attract complete guessers. This weakens overall item quality.
- B is correct.
- C (sqrt(rF)) captures the "same operation" misconception well. A student who multiplies instead of divides would get rF under the radical.
- D (sqrt(F)/r) represents a different but realistic error: correctly square-rooting F but not understanding that r is also under the radical when you take the square root of F/r. Alternatively, the student divides by r as a separate step after rooting.

Given that one distractor (A) is essentially non-functional, the effective item is closer to a 3-option MCQ, which typically has higher guessing rates.

Looking at the calibration anchors:
- The easiest item (-5 = p+10) has classical difficulty 0.167.
- The hardest (inequality) has 0.569.
- This item is arguably the most abstract of all, with no numerical values at all. The squared term adds a layer.
- I'd place this around 0.55-0.65 classical difficulty, IRT b around 0.6-0.8.

Discrimination: With one weak distractor, discrimination may be slightly reduced. I'll estimate a around 1.0-1.2. Guessing: with effectively 3 plausible options and high difficulty, maybe c = 0.18.
