This item requires students to find x given three angles of a triangle expressed algebraically: 4x, 2x - 12, and 4x + 42. The key knowledge needed is that angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees.

Setting up the equation: 4x + (2x - 12) + (4x + 42) = 180. Combining like terms: 10x + 30 = 180. Then solving: 10x = 150, so x = 15.

The tested misconception is "uses the same operation rather than the inverse." A student who adds 30 instead of subtracting would get 10x = 210, giving x = 21 (option D). This is a very common error pattern.

Looking at the other distractors: x = 12.6 might come from setting the sum to 126 somehow or a decimal arithmetic error. x = 33 could arise from forgetting the constant terms and solving 10x = 330 or misreading the angle expressions.

Comparing to calibration items: The inequality problem (classical difficulty 0.569, IRT b = 0.808) involved similar algebraic manipulation with the same misconception. This triangle item adds geometric context (angle sum property) plus more complex expression combining, so I'd expect moderate-to-high difficulty. However, the angle sum rule is well-taught, so it may be somewhat accessible.

The distractors are reasonably plausible, especially D which directly maps to the tested misconception. The item requires multiple steps: recognizing angle sum, setting up equation, combining like terms, and solving. This puts cognitive load in a moderate-to-high range.

I estimate classical difficulty around 0.35-0.45, similar to the factorising item but perhaps slightly easier since the algebraic manipulation is more straightforward once the equation is set up.
