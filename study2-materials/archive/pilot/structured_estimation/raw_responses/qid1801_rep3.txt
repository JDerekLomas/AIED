Target: -5 < 2x + 1 < 5, correct answer B: -3 < x < 2.

Step-by-step solution: Subtract 1 throughout: -6 < 2x < 4. Divide by 2: -3 < x < 2.

The misconception being tested is applying the same operation rather than the inverse. In this context, a student might add 1 instead of subtracting it. If they add 1 to all parts: -4 < 2x < 6, then divide by 2: -2 < x < 3. This doesn't exactly match any distractor, though C (-2 < x < 2) picks up the -2 on the left side. Perhaps C is designed to catch a student who adds 1 on the left but correctly subtracts on the right, or who makes an arithmetic slip.

Thinking about difficulty relative to the calibration items - the factorising item (Tom and Katie) had classical difficulty 0.473 and involved recognizing that multiplying two negatives gives a positive. That requires conceptual understanding. This compound inequality requires procedural fluency with a slightly unfamiliar format. I'd place this at a similar or slightly higher difficulty level.

Key factors pushing difficulty up: compound inequality format (less commonly practiced), two-step process, need to track three expressions. Factors moderating difficulty: the operations themselves are simple (subtract 1, divide by 2), no sign changes or tricky division.

One important note: the correct answer B has -3 < x < 2, where the upper and lower bounds are not symmetric. Students who expect symmetry (since the original inequality is symmetric around 0 for the +-5) might be drawn to C (-2 < x < 2) which is symmetric. This makes C a strong distractor.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.50, IRT difficulty around 0.50, with moderate discrimination.
