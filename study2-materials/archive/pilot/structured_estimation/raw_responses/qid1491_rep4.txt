Analyzing (-2)^4 for UK secondary students.

I want to think about this from a curriculum perspective first. Powers and roots of negative numbers appear in the UK National Curriculum at KS3, typically Year 8. By Year 9-10 students should be fluent with this. Given the age range 11-16, younger students (Year 7-8) may not have encountered this yet, while older students should know it.

The item is testing a very specific and well-documented misconception: that the product of negative numbers is negative. With exponent 4, the student needs to recognize that an even number of negative factors produces a positive result. The brackets around -2 make it unambiguous that the entire quantity is being raised to the 4th power (as opposed to -(2^4), which would indeed be -16).

However, many students don't attend to the brackets carefully or don't understand their significance in this context. The notation (-2)^4 with explicit brackets should help, but the misconception is strong enough to override notational cues for many students.

Let me reconsider the difficulty level. Looking at the calibration set more holistically:
- Items with classical difficulty ~0.15-0.17 are straightforward procedural questions
- Items around 0.30 involve function machines (visual/conceptual)
- Items around 0.47-0.57 involve algebraic reasoning

This item falls in the conceptual understanding category. It's not purely procedural (you need to understand the sign rule), but it's also not deeply algebraic. I'd place it around 0.35-0.45.

One factor pulling difficulty down: the question is extremely clear and short. No reading comprehension burden, no complex setup. One factor pulling difficulty up: the misconception is very common and the primary distractor (-16) looks very natural.

I'll estimate classical difficulty at 0.40, IRT b around 0.15. For discrimination, the item should work well because it cleanly separates conceptual understanding from misconception. I'll estimate a around 1.50. The high discrimination reflects that this is a targeted diagnostic item.

Guessing should be quite low. A student who doesn't understand the concept will almost certainly choose A (-16) rather than randomly selecting C (16). The effective guessing rate for C is probably below 0.10.
