Let me analyze this item carefully. The question presents a diagram with a leftward arrow of value -24 and a smaller leftward arrow that is one-third its length. Tom claims -3 × (-8) = -24 and Katie claims (-24)/(-3) = -8. I need to determine who is correct.

First, checking Tom: -3 × (-8). Multiplying two negatives should yield a positive: -3 × (-8) = +24, not -24. So Tom is incorrect — he has applied the misconception that two negatives multiplied give a negative.

Next, checking Katie: (-24)/(-3). Dividing a negative by a negative should also yield a positive: (-24)/(-3) = +8, not -8. Katie has the same misconception applied to division.

So neither is correct, making D the right answer.

Now considering difficulty. This item requires students to:
1. Understand multiplication of negative numbers
2. Understand division of negative numbers
3. Interpret a diagram involving directed arrows
4. Evaluate two separate claims and synthesize

The misconception being tested (negatives multiplied give negatives) is very common among KS3/KS4 students. The item is somewhat tricky because BOTH Tom and Katie are wrong, and a student with the misconception would think both are correct (choosing C). The diagram adds an extra layer of cognitive load.

Comparing to the calibration item about factorising (same misconception, classical difficulty 0.473, b=0.404): this item involves a similar misconception but in a more direct arithmetic context. However, the "who is correct" format with both being wrong, plus the diagram, makes it moderately challenging. I'd estimate it's somewhat harder than the factorising item because students must check two computations and the "neither" answer is psychologically harder to select.

I estimate classical difficulty around 0.50-0.55, IRT difficulty around 0.5-0.7.
