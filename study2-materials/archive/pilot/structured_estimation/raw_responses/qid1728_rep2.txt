Analyzing the item: 3/4 - 1/4 × 1/5

The correct solution requires applying order of operations:
- Multiply first: 1/4 × 1/5 = 1/20
- Then subtract: 3/4 - 1/20. Common denominator is 20: 15/20 - 1/20 = 14/20 = 7/10
- Answer: C

The misconception-driven error (left-to-right computation):
- 3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2
- 1/2 × 1/5 = 1/10
- Answer: B

This item combines two skill areas: order of operations and fraction arithmetic. Students need both skills to succeed. Even a student who knows BODMAS might fail if they can't subtract fractions with different denominators.

Considering the distractors more carefully:
- A (2/16): Could arise from some incorrect cross-multiplication approach. Not strongly linked to a single misconception. Relatively implausible.
- B (1/10): Direct result of left-to-right processing. Very plausible.
- D (5/10): Equals 1/2. Could be a partial computation — a student who correctly identifies multiplication first might compute 1/4 × 1/5 = 1/20 but then incorrectly subtract by doing 3/4 - 1/20 as (3-1)/(4+20) or some other error. Or it might attract students who get 1/2 from left-to-right but express it as 5/10. Actually somewhat plausible.

The calibration item with the same misconception (order of operations with mixed decimals/fractions) had classical difficulty 0.134. This all-fractions version requires finding common denominators, which is an additional procedural demand. But the fractions are very simple (fourths and fifths). I'd estimate difficulty slightly higher, around 0.20.

Discrimination should be solid — the misconception creates a clear binary: either you know to multiply first or you don't. I'd estimate a similar or slightly lower discrimination compared to the calibration item (which was 1.55).
