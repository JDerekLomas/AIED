Item: T = k^4, find T when k = -3. Correct answer: A (81).

Let me approach this by thinking about the student population. UK secondary students ages 11-16 is a wide range. For 11-12 year olds, fourth powers of negative numbers would be quite challenging. For 15-16 year olds, this should be routine. The mixed-age population means we'll see a spread.

The misconception tested -- believing multiplying two negatives gives a negative -- applies here because students need to recognise that (-3)^4 involves an even number of negative factors. The specific error path to C (-81) is: "I know 3^4 = 81, and k is negative, so the answer must be negative."

But there's another interesting error path. Some students might not even compute 3^4 correctly. 3^4 = 81 requires knowing that 3*3=9, 9*3=27, 27*3=81. Students who make arithmetic errors or who confuse exponentiation with multiplication (3*4=12) would select B or D.

Looking at this from a difficulty standpoint: this item has TWO hurdles -- (1) correctly computing 3^4 = 81 and (2) getting the sign right. Students must clear both. This could make it harder than I'd initially think.

The comparable calibration item (Tom/Katie, same misconception) had difficulty 0.473. But that involved quadratic factorisation which is a harder topic. On the other hand, that item had a guessing parameter of 0.186, suggesting some low-ability students could guess correctly. Here, with four distinct numerical answers, random guessing gives 0.25.

I think the difficulty is moderate -- maybe 0.38. The two distinct error types (sign and operation confusion) each capture different students. Discrimination should be solid because the item cleanly separates conceptual understanding levels.
