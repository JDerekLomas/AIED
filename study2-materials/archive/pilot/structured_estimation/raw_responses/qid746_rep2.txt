Analyzing: 4 + 12 / (2+2) = ?

Correct solution path: Brackets (2+2)=4, then 12/4=3, then 4+3=7. Answer B.

This is a standard BIDMAS question. The presence of explicit brackets should cue students to evaluate them first. The key misconception is computing left to right: 4+12=16, 16/2=8, 8+2=10, yielding distractor A.

Thinking about the student population (UK ages 11-16): BIDMAS is a fundamental KS3 topic. By KS4, most students handle this correctly. The question is quite standard - it's the kind of thing you'd see in a Year 7/8 textbook. The numbers are deliberately simple so arithmetic isn't a barrier.

Comparing to calibration examples: The closest match is item 2 (order of operations with decimals/fractions). That had p_incorrect=0.134. This item is arguably easier because:
1. All whole numbers
2. Explicit brackets (no implicit priority reasoning needed)
3. Standard textbook format

But I should also consider that the 4 distractors spread students across different error types. Students who partially understand might still get confused. Distractor D (4) could attract students who group everything as a fraction.

I think this is on the easier side. Maybe 18% get it wrong. The IRT discrimination should be decent because BIDMAS knowledge is a fairly clean skill. I'll estimate b around -0.10, slightly easier than average. Low guessing since students tend to compute something systematically.
