Let me work through this item systematically. The equation is (x/3) - 5 = 12.

Tom's step: x/3 = 17. Adding 5 to both sides: (x/3) - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5, giving x/3 = 17. This is valid. Tom is correct.

Katie's step: x - 5 = 36. She appears to have multiplied both sides by 3, but only applied it to the x/3 term, not to the -5. Correct multiplication by 3 would yield: x - 15 = 36. Since she got x - 5 = 36, she did not properly distribute. Katie is incorrect.

Answer: A (Only Tom).

For difficulty estimation, I want to think about what makes this tricky for students. The "Who is correct?" format requires evaluating two claims independently, which is cognitively demanding. Students who are weaker at algebra might accept Katie's step because it "looks right" - multiplying x/3 by 3 gives x, and 12*3 = 36, so if you don't carefully check the -5 term, it seems fine.

Looking at the calibration set, the inequality problem (2n+3 <= 3n-7) had classical difficulty 0.569 and b = 0.808. That item required multi-step algebraic manipulation. This item is somewhat easier because students only need to verify steps, not generate them. But the evaluation of Katie's error requires careful attention.

The factoring Tom/Katie item had difficulty 0.473, b = 0.404. I think this item is comparable in difficulty - the fraction adds some complexity but the underlying algebra is more straightforward than factoring. I'll place it similarly.

Discrimination should be moderate-to-good since it separates students who understand equation manipulation from those who don't. The guessing parameter should be low-moderate since there are four options and "Both" is a strong attractor.
