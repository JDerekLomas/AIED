The target item requires adding 3/5 + 2/7. The correct answer is 31/35 (B).

Let me think about the cognitive demands. Students must: (1) interpret the visual diagram showing two fractions summing to a third, (2) recognize they need to add fractions with unlike denominators, (3) find LCD of 5 and 7 which is 35, (4) convert 3/5 to 21/35 and 2/7 to 10/35, (5) add to get 31/35.

The misconception being tested -- adding numerators and denominators -- is one of the most persistent fraction misconceptions in mathematics education. Research consistently shows this is extremely common, especially among students who haven't fully grasped the concept of equivalent fractions. Option C (5/12) directly embodies this misconception.

Looking at the distractors: Option A (11/35) has the right denominator but wrong numerator. Option D (5/35) has right denominator but adds only numerators. Option C (5/12) is the classic misconception. These are well-designed distractors that capture different partial understandings.

Comparing to calibration: the factorising item (classical difficulty 0.473) required understanding of expanding brackets and sign rules. Adding fractions with unlike denominators is a fundamental skill that many students struggle with, but it's a KS3 topic that should be well-practiced by KS4. I'd put this at moderate difficulty.

The visual presentation (circle pyramid) is a slight departure from standard "calculate 3/5 + 2/7" but is a common format in UK maths assessments, so transfer distance is low.

I estimate classical difficulty around 0.35, since fraction addition is a core skill but the misconception is strong. IRT difficulty perhaps slightly below average. Good discrimination expected because the item cleanly tests understanding of equivalent fractions.
