Item: 2 x 3^2. Correct answer: A (18).

The key knowledge being tested is BIDMAS/BODMAS -- specifically that indices (exponents) are evaluated before multiplication. A student who knows the rule computes 3^2 = 9 first, then 2 x 9 = 18.

The main distractor is C (36), from computing left to right: (2 x 3)^2 = 6^2 = 36. This is a very natural error for students who haven't internalized order of operations with exponents.

B (12) might come from 2 x 3 x 2, treating the squared symbol as "times 2." D (11) from 2 + 9 = 11, a simple operation confusion.

Calibration anchoring: The similar misconception item (order of operations, question 2) had 13.4% incorrect. But that involved fractions and decimals which are KS3/KS4 topics, suggesting a more advanced student cohort might have taken it. This item with whole numbers and a simple exponent would be given to a broader range of students.

The simplicity of the numbers actually makes the misconception MORE dangerous -- students rush through without thinking. I've seen research suggesting that simple-looking BODMAS items often have higher error rates than complex ones because students don't engage careful processing.

However, 3^2 is so commonly encountered (it's one of the first squares students learn) that many will get it right almost automatically: "three squared is nine, times two is eighteen."

Balancing these considerations, I estimate about 18-20% incorrect. This is a fairly easy item but not trivially so.

IRT difficulty: around -0.5 to -0.3
Discrimination should be solid since it's a clean diagnostic item.
Guessing should be minimal given the plausible distractors spread the guessing load.
