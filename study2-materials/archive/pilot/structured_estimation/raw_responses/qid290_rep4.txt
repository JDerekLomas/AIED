This item combines several mathematical ideas: counter-examples as a proof strategy, substitution into algebraic expressions, squaring decimals and negatives, and comparing the result to zero. Let me consider the difficulty from a student's perspective.

A Year 9-10 student encountering this question must:
1. Understand that a "counter-example" means finding one case where the expression is NOT positive
2. Substitute each given value into 2n^2 - 1
3. Correctly compute the squares (including negative numbers and decimals)
4. Determine which result is zero or negative

The correct answer B gives 2(0.5)^2 - 1 = -0.5. Students need to correctly square 0.5 to get 0.25, then compute 2(0.25) - 1 = -0.5.

The trap: options C and D feature negative inputs. Students who believe (-2)^2 = -4 (the tested misconception) would calculate C as 2(-4) - 1 = -9, which appears strongly negative. This makes C a very attractive distractor for students with this misconception. Similarly D would appear to give 2(-1) - 1 = -3.

Option A is interesting -- 2(3/4)^2 - 1 = 1/8, which is positive but small. Students who make arithmetic errors with fractions might get a negative result and pick this.

Comparing to calibration items: the factorising item testing the same misconception had classical difficulty 0.473. This item requires additional reasoning about counter-examples and more computation, so I expect it to be harder. But the computational steps are fairly straightforward once you know to substitute and evaluate.

I think this lands around 0.50-0.55 classical difficulty. The IRT difficulty should be moderate, around 0.45. Discrimination should be decent because the item cleanly separates students who understand squaring from those who don't -- I'll say about 1.35. Some guessing is likely since students confused by the counter-example framing might just pick randomly among the negative-looking options.
