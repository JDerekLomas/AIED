Let me analyze this item carefully.

The question tests understanding of order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEMDAS). The expression is:
1 + 2 × (3 - 4)

The correct answer is C (3-4) because brackets/parentheses must be evaluated first according to order of operations.

**Misconception being tested:** "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order"
- Students with this misconception would choose A (1+2) because it comes first when reading left to right.

**Analyzing the distractors:**
- A) 1+2: Attractive to students who work left-to-right
- B) 2×3: Attractive to students who know multiplication comes before addition but ignore brackets
- C) 3-4: CORRECT - brackets first
- D) "It doesn't matter": Attractive to students who don't understand order matters

**Comparing to calibration items:**
- The calibration item with the same misconception (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.245
- That item was harder because it required actual computation AND understanding of order of operations
- This item ONLY asks which calculation to do first - it's purely conceptual about order of operations

**Difficulty assessment:**
- This is a fundamental concept typically taught early in secondary school (Year 7-8)
- The question is very clear and direct
- Students who know BIDMAS will easily identify brackets first
- However, the misconception of left-to-right processing is common
- The presence of brackets makes this relatively straightforward for students who know the rule

**Key observations:**
- Low procedural demand - just identify the first step, no computation needed
- Clear visual presentation with brackets obvious
- The misconception tested is common but this is a basic application
- Distractor A is quite plausible for students with the left-to-right misconception
- Distractor B might catch students who remember "multiplication before addition" but forget brackets

Given this is a conceptual question about order of operations at its most basic level (with explicit brackets), I expect it to be relatively easy - easier than the calibration item testing the same misconception because that required actual computation.

I estimate classical difficulty around 0.15-0.25 (15-25% incorrect), IRT difficulty around -0.5 to -0.3, good discrimination since it clearly separates those who know BIDMAS from those who don't.
