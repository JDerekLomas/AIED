This item requires students to substitute x = 0.3 into the equation 2x + 3y = 12 and solve for y. The correct solution path is: 2(0.3) + 3y = 12, so 0.6 + 3y = 12, then 3y = 12 - 0.6 = 11.4, and y = 11.4/3 = 3.8 (answer D).

The tested misconception is "uses the same operation rather than the inverse." A student making this error might add 0.6 instead of subtracting it, getting 3y = 12.6, then y = 4.2 (answer C). Another common error is substituting incorrectly by using x = 0.3 directly without multiplying by 2 first: 12 - 0.3 = 11.7, 11.7/3 = 3.9 (answer B). Answer A (4.1) could arise from (12 + 0.3)/3 = 12.3/3 = 4.1, combining both errors.

Looking at the calibration examples, this item involves multiple concepts: substitution into a two-variable linear equation, decimal arithmetic, and multi-step algebraic rearrangement. The distractors are quite plausible because they are close in value (3.8 to 4.2) and each corresponds to a specific procedural error.

Compared to calibration items: the equation-solving items range from classical difficulty 0.167 (simple one-step) to 0.569 (inequalities with variables on both sides). This item involves substitution plus solving, with decimal arithmetic adding cognitive load. I'd place it around the factorising item difficulty level — roughly 0.40-0.50 classical difficulty.

The discrimination should be moderate to good since the distractors target specific misconceptions rather than random guessing. The guessing parameter should be relatively low since the numerical answers are specific.
