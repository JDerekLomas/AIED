This item requires students to match a graph of a negative quadratic with x-intercepts at (-5, 0) and (1, 0) to its equation in factored form.

The mathematical content involves: reading x-intercepts from a graph, understanding factored form of quadratics, and crucially, understanding how the sign of the leading coefficient determines whether the parabola opens up or down.

The correct answer is A: y = (1-x)(x+5). Expanding: -x^2 - 4x + 5, which has a negative leading coefficient matching the downward-opening parabola, and roots at x=1 and x=-5.

The primary distractor is C: y = (x-1)(x+5), which has the correct roots but opens upward (positive leading coefficient). Students who can read roots from the graph but don't attend to orientation will choose C. This is likely the most common error.

B and D both have x=5 as a root instead of x=-5, so students choosing these are misreading the graph or confusing signs in factors.

Thinking about the student population (UK ages 11-16): this topic typically appears in Year 10-11 (GCSE level). It's a standard GCSE-style question but requires connecting graphical and algebraic representations, which is known to be challenging. The subtle difference between (1-x) and (x-1) as a factor is a common source of confusion.

For calibration: the misconception "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer" appeared in the Tom/Katie item at difficulty 0.473/0.404. That item was purely algebraic. This item adds the graph-to-equation translation, which could make it harder. But the visual support of actually seeing the parabola might scaffold some students' reasoning.

I think this is a moderately hard item, perhaps around 0.50-0.60 classical difficulty. The discrimination should be decent but not exceptional - there's a clean conceptual split between A and C, but weaker students might guess between the four options somewhat randomly. The guessing parameter could be non-trivial since students might narrow to A vs C and then guess.
