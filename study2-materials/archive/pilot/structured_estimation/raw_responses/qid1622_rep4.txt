This question asks students to complete a table of values for 3x + 2y = 6. Specifically, find y when x = 0.

Substituting: 3(0) + 2y = 6 → 2y = 6 → y = 6/2 = 3. Answer is A.

Let me think about what makes this item potentially tricky:

1. Students need to understand the table-of-values format and realize the star means "find y when x=0."
2. They need to substitute x=0 into the equation.
3. They need to solve 2y = 6 using division.

The misconception tested is using the same operation rather than inverse. A student who multiplies instead of divides would get 2 × 6 = 12 (option D). But honestly, for 2y = 6, many students might just "see" that y = 3 without formally thinking about inverse operations — they recognize the multiplication fact. This could make the item easier than expected for the misconception it targets.

Distractor plausibility: D (12) targets the misconception directly. B (2) could attract students who confuse the coefficient with the answer or who compute 6/3. C (1.5 = 3/2) could attract students who somehow get the numbers reversed. I think B might actually be quite attractive — "2y = 6, y = 2" is a plausible error if students just grab the coefficient.

Comparing to calibration: The function machine item (difficulty 0.295) involved more complex reasoning with squaring and the visual complexity of diagrams. The simple equation items had difficulty 0.134-0.167. This item is algebraically simple but has the added table interpretation layer.

I'll place this around 0.25 for classical difficulty. Some students will be confused by the table format, and the distractors (especially B and D) are reasonably attractive.

For IRT parameters: difficulty around -0.05 (slightly easier than average), discrimination around 1.15 (moderate — the item tests substitution + solving but the x=0 case is almost too easy for strong discrimination), and low guessing since the distractors are designed to catch specific errors.
