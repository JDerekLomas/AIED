Analyzing the target item: students expand (2p-1)(3p-4) and must find the product of the two terms indicated by arrows, which are -1 and -4. The correct product is (-1)(-4) = +4, answer A.

Key considerations:

1. Mathematical content: This tests signed number multiplication within an algebraic bracket expansion context. The core skill is knowing that negative times negative equals positive. This is a fundamental rule that is taught early but remains a persistent source of error.

2. Distractor analysis:
   - A: +4 (correct: (-1)x(-4) = +4)
   - B: -4 (misconception: neg x neg = neg, or just multiplying magnitudes and keeping negative)
   - C: +5 (adding: (-1)+(-4)=-5... no, that's -5. Actually +5 could be |(-1)|+|(-4)| = 5 with positive sign)
   - D: -5 (adding the values: (-1)+(-4) = -5)

So B captures the primary misconception. D captures students who add instead of multiply. C is less obviously derived -- perhaps 1+4=5? The distractor set is quite effective.

3. Comparison with calibration items: The Tom/Katie item (same misconception) had difficulty 0.473. But that was a more complex reasoning task. This item is simpler in structure but the misconception is strong. I think a substantial fraction of students will choose B.

Given that the misconception "neg x neg = neg" is extremely common in this age group, and the item directly targets it with minimal other cognitive demands, I'd estimate classical difficulty around 0.43. The item is well-targeted for the middle of the ability distribution.

For IRT parameters: b around 0.30 (slightly above average difficulty), discrimination around 1.4 (good separation since it's a clean test of one concept), guessing around 0.12 (some students might guess if unsure about sign rules).
