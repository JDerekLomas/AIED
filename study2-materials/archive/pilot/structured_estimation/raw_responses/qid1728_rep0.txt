This item tests whether students respect the order of operations (BODMAS/BIDMAS) when working with fractions. The correct procedure is:

Step 1: Identify that multiplication takes priority over subtraction.
Step 2: Compute 1/4 × 1/5 = 1/20.
Step 3: Compute 3/4 - 1/20. To subtract these, find a common denominator: 3/4 = 15/20, so 15/20 - 1/20 = 14/20 = 7/10.

The key misconception is carrying out operations left to right: 3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2, then 1/2 × 1/5 = 1/10, which is distractor B. This is a very common error pattern among secondary students.

Looking at distractor A (2/16): this could arise from subtracting numerators and denominators incorrectly (3-1=2, 4×4=16 somehow), though it's less obviously derived. Distractor D (5/10 = 1/2) could come from students who do the left-to-right subtraction 3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 but then multiply 2/4 × 5 or make another error reaching 1/2.

Comparing to the calibration item with the same misconception (0.4 - 1/5 × 3), that had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT b = -0.245. This current item is entirely in fraction form, which adds procedural complexity — students must find common denominators. However, the numbers are simple. I'd expect this to be somewhat harder than the calibration item, perhaps classical difficulty around 0.20-0.25.

The discrimination should be moderate to good since the misconception cleanly separates students who know BODMAS from those who don't. The guessing parameter should be low since distractor B is very attractive to students with the misconception.
