Analyzing the item: "What answer would your calculator give if you typed in -6^2?"

The mathematical crux is operator precedence. In standard mathematical notation and on scientific calculators, exponentiation takes precedence over negation. So -6^2 is parsed as -(6^2) = -(36) = -36. The correct answer is D.

This is a fascinating item because it targets a misconception that persists even among adults. Many people instinctively read -6^2 as "negative six squared" = 36, when the convention is "the negative of six squared" = -36.

The calculator framing adds an important dimension. Students need to understand not just abstract mathematical convention but how a physical calculator implements it. This is a practical, applied question about order of operations.

Let me think about difficulty. Among the calibration items, the inequality (2n+3 <= 3n-7) had classical difficulty 0.569, which is the hardest calibration item. I think this -6^2 item is in a similar range. The misconception is extremely common -- I'd argue more common than the inequality errors. However, some students may have been explicitly taught about this calculator quirk.

I'll estimate classical difficulty at 0.55, meaning 55% get it wrong. That puts it as a moderately hard item. IRT difficulty around 0.55-0.65.

For discrimination: This item should discriminate well between students who deeply understand order of operations versus those with surface-level understanding. I'll estimate a = 1.30.

The guessing parameter should be quite low. Students who don't understand the convention will confidently choose C (36). There's little random guessing; errors are systematic. I'll put c at 0.05.
