The question presents two spinners (1-4 and 1-5) and asks for P(1 on both). The correct answer is 1/4 * 1/5 = 1/20 (answer B).

Let me think about what makes students get this wrong. The tested misconception is about adding fractions by adding numerators and denominators. A student who doesn't know to multiply probabilities might try to add 1/4 + 1/5 and incorrectly get 2/9 (option C) by adding tops and bottoms. Or they might think the sample space is 4+5=9 outcomes and pick 1/9 (option A).

Option D (2/20) is interesting - it could come from a student who correctly identifies 20 as the total outcomes but counts 2 favorable outcomes (getting 1 on spinner 1 OR spinner 2, confusing AND with OR).

This is a probability topic typically covered around Year 8-9 in UK curriculum. The multiplication rule for independent events is a standard topic but frequently confused. The visual element (spinners shown as diagrams) adds some complexity but also makes it more concrete.

I think this is a moderately difficult item. Probability is notoriously tricky for students. The misconception about adding vs multiplying probabilities is very common. I'd place this somewhat harder than the simple equation solving but not as hard as the inequality item.

Classical difficulty estimate: around 0.50. Many students struggle with combined probability. IRT difficulty probably around 0.4-0.5. Discrimination should be decent since the distractors target specific errors.
