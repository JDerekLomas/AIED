This question requires rearranging the sphere volume formula V = (4/3)pi*r^3 to make r the subject. The correct rearrangement yields r = cube_root(3V/(4pi)), which is option C.

Let me think about this from a student's perspective. A Year 10-11 student encountering this would need to:
1. Recall or recognize the sphere volume formula
2. Perform algebraic rearrangement with fractions
3. Apply the cube root as the inverse of cubing
4. Navigate complex symbolic expressions to identify the correct answer

The misconception "uses the same operation rather than the inverse" is particularly relevant here because there are TWO inverse operations needed: dividing instead of multiplying (handling the 4pi/3 coefficient) and cube-rooting instead of cubing. Either error leads to a different distractor.

What makes this especially challenging is that ALL four options involve cube roots (or at least option D involves a cube root of V), so students can't simply pick "the one with a cube root." They must carefully track which numbers go where in the fraction.

Thinking about the calibration set: the hardest item was the inequality (b=0.808, classical=0.569). This sphere rearrangement is more conceptually demanding because it combines 3D geometry knowledge with abstract algebraic manipulation. However, the fact that it's multiple choice with four options that a knowledgeable student could work through by checking provides some scaffolding.

I'd estimate this is quite difficult -- perhaps 0.75 classical difficulty. Many students either won't know the formula or will make errors in rearrangement. The IRT difficulty is likely around 1.4. Discrimination could be moderate to good since this cleanly separates students who understand formula rearrangement from those who don't. Some guessing is likely given the similar-looking options.
