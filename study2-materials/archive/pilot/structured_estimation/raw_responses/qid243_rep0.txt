This item asks students to solve a linear inequality: 3n + 2 >= 4n - 5. The correct answer is C (7 >= n).

To solve: subtract 3n from both sides to get 2 >= n - 5, then add 5 to both sides to get 7 >= n. Alternatively, subtract 4n from both sides: -n + 2 >= -5, then subtract 2: -n >= -7, then divide by -1 and flip: n <= 7, equivalent to 7 >= n.

The misconception tested is "uses the same operation rather than the inverse." A student making this error might add instead of subtract (or vice versa) when rearranging terms. For example, moving the +2 by adding 2 instead of subtracting, or moving the -5 by subtracting 5 instead of adding.

Looking at the distractors:
- A: -3 >= n. This could come from 3n + 2 >= 4n - 5 → subtracting 4n and subtracting 2: -n >= -7, then incorrectly dividing without flipping, but that gives n <= 7. Alternatively, a student who gets confused with signs: 2 - 5 = -3, n(4-3) = n, giving -3 >= n. This is plausible if a student subtracts constants incorrectly.
- B: 1 >= n. Possibly from 3 - 2 = 1 or some other arithmetic error.
- D: n >= 7. This flips the direction of the inequality, a common error when students don't track the variable side correctly.

Comparing to the calibration item "2n + 3 <= 3n - 7" (classical difficulty 0.569, b = 0.808), this item is structurally very similar — same misconception, same format, same number of steps. The coefficients differ slightly (3n vs 4n instead of 2n vs 3n) but the complexity is comparable. Distractor D (n >= 7) is quite attractive because students often default to writing n on the left side of the inequality, making this potentially tricky.

I'd expect this item to be of similar difficulty to the calibration item, perhaps marginally easier because the arithmetic (7) is a clean number and the steps are straightforward. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.52, IRT difficulty around 0.65.
