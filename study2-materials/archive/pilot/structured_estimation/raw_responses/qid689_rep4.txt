Solving 10 = 5/p for p. The correct answer is p = 0.5 (since 5/0.5 = 10).

This item tests whether students can manipulate equations where the unknown is in the denominator of a fraction. The core difficulty is that the "inverse" operation here isn't simply switching from + to - or * to /; students need to understand the relationship between division and the reciprocal.

Approach 1 (algebraic): Multiply both sides by p: 10p = 5. Then p = 5/10 = 0.5.
Approach 2 (reasoning): "What do I divide 5 by to get 10?" This requires understanding that dividing by a number less than 1 gives a larger result, which is counterintuitive for many students.

The answer p = 0.5 being less than 1 adds a layer of difficulty. Students often expect equation solutions to be "nice" whole numbers. Seeing 0.5 as an answer and trusting it requires confidence.

Distractor plausibility: B (50) and C (2) are both highly plausible. I'd argue C is especially attractive because 10 divided by 5 is a basic fact that students compute almost reflexively. B requires the student to multiply, which is a more deliberate (wrong) choice.

Calibration: Among the "same operation instead of inverse" items in the anchors:
- Simple linear (p+10=-5): 16.7% incorrect, b=-0.702
- Function machine (x^2+5=14): 29.5% incorrect, b=0.002
- Inequality (2n+3<=3n-7): 56.9% incorrect, b=0.808

This item's complexity is between the function machine and the inequality. The variable-in-denominator aspect is tricky but the numbers are simple. I'll estimate around 0.45 classical difficulty, b around 0.30.

Discrimination: The item has well-crafted distractors that should separate students who understand reciprocal relationships from those who don't. I'd estimate a around 1.25. For guessing, the "no solutions" option is weak enough that it won't attract much random guessing, so c is probably low, around 0.05.
