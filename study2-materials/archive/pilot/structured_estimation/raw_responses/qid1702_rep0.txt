Let me work through this item carefully.

The question asks students to find x when y = 0.5 in the equation 10x - 6y = 30.

Correct solution path:
1. Substitute y = 0.5: 10x - 6(0.5) = 30
2. Simplify: 10x - 3 = 30
3. Add 3 to both sides: 10x = 33
4. Divide by 10: x = 3.3

So C is correct.

Now let me analyze the distractors:
- D (2.7): This comes from adding 6(0.5) instead of subtracting, i.e., treating -6y as +6y or using the same operation rather than the inverse. 10x + 3 = 30 gives 10x = 27, x = 2.7. This directly tests the stated misconception.
- A (4.25): Could arise from misreading or a different computational error, perhaps 10x = 6(0.5) + 30 = 33, then dividing incorrectly, or from some other path. Actually 42.5/10 = 4.25 which could come from 10x - 6(0.5) = 30 being rearranged as 10x = 30 + 6 + 0.5*25... not obvious. More likely a distractor designed to catch a different error pattern.
- B (-4.25): Negative version suggesting sign confusion combined with the error above.

This item requires substitution into a linear equation and then solving for x - a multi-step algebraic process. The table format adds a small layer of interpretation. Students need to know how to substitute, multiply decimals, and solve a two-step equation.

Comparing to calibration items:
- The equation-solving items range from b = -0.702 (easy, p_incorrect = 0.167) to b = 0.808 (harder, p_incorrect = 0.569).
- This item involves substitution into a two-variable equation plus solving, which adds complexity beyond simple one-variable equations. The decimal arithmetic adds cognitive load.
- The table presentation is somewhat non-standard, adding transfer distance.
- I'd estimate this is moderately difficult, similar to the factorising item or the inequality item. Perhaps around 45-55% incorrect.

The misconception (using same operation rather than inverse) is well-tested and common, appearing in multiple calibration items. Distractor D should be quite attractive to students who make this error.
