Analyzing the item: Solve 20t - 5 = 0.

The correct solution path is:
20t - 5 = 0
20t = 5 (add 5)
t = 5/20 (divide by 20)
t = 1/4 (simplify)

This is a two-step linear equation with integer coefficients but a fractional solution. The misconception being tested -- using the same operation rather than the inverse -- could manifest in several ways here. A student might subtract 5 from both sides instead of adding, getting 20t = -5, leading to t = -1/4 (distractor D). Or they might not properly handle the division step.

Distractor analysis:
- A (t = 1/4): Correct
- B (t = 4): Most likely from computing 20 / 5 instead of 5 / 20. This is extremely plausible.
- C (t = -4): Same as B but with a sign error, perhaps from treating the -5 incorrectly
- D (t = -1/4): Correct magnitude, wrong sign -- from subtracting 5 instead of adding

The fractional answer is the main source of difficulty. In my experience, items where the correct answer is a simple fraction but an integer distractor exists tend to be harder than their algebraic complexity would suggest, because students are biased toward "clean" answers.

Calibrating against the anchor items: This feels comparable to the function machine item (classical difficulty 0.295, b = 0.002) -- both require understanding inverse operations in a context that adds a layer of complexity beyond the most basic equation. I'll estimate slightly higher difficulty due to the fractional answer.

I expect moderate discrimination -- the item should differentiate well between students who understand equation solving and those who don't, but the strong pull of distractor B might slightly reduce discrimination by catching some students who otherwise understand the concept but make a procedural error with fractions.
