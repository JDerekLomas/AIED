Expanding -5(m - 7): the student must distribute the -5 to both terms inside the bracket.

Step 1: -5 * m = -5m
Step 2: -5 * (-7) = +35 (this is where the misconception is tested)

Result: -5m + 35, which is option C.

The misconception "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer" would lead a student to compute -5 * (-7) = -35, giving -5m - 35 (option B).

I want to think carefully about how difficult this actually is. Expanding single brackets is a fundamental algebra skill taught around Year 7-8. By the time students encounter diagnostic assessments, many will have practised this. However, the negative coefficient makes it tricky. Research on signed number arithmetic shows error rates of 20-40% even among older secondary students when negatives are involved in multiplication.

Looking at the calibration anchor with the same misconception (Tom/Katie factorising, difficulty 0.473, b = 0.404): that item requires higher-order thinking (evaluating two factorised expressions, understanding that expanding them back should give the original). This item is purely procedural. I'd estimate it's notably easier.

The four options form a complete 2x2 grid of sign combinations for the two terms:
- A: +5m, +35 (both signs wrong on first term)
- B: -5m, -35 (misconception on second term)
- C: -5m, +35 (correct)
- D: +5m, -35 (opposite of correct on both)

This systematic distractor design is good for diagnosis but might slightly help savvy test-takers who notice the pattern. Discrimination should still be solid since the item cleanly separates those who know sign rules from those who don't.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.33, b around -0.05, with good discrimination.
