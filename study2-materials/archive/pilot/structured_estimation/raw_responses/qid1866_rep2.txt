Expression: 8 - 7 + 10 × 3

Step-by-step correct solution:
1. Apply multiplication first: 10 × 3 = 30
2. Then left to right: 8 - 7 + 30 = 31
Answer: B

This is a classic BODMAS/order of operations item. Let me think about how UK secondary students at different ability levels would approach this.

Lower-ability students (Year 7-8) who haven't internalized BODMAS will naturally read left to right: 8-7=1, 1+10=11, 11×3=33, choosing D. This is the target misconception.

Some students might partially apply BODMAS but make sign errors. For instance, computing 10×3=30 correctly but then doing 8 - 7 + 30 incorrectly as 8 - 37 = -29 (answer C). This represents a different misconception about the scope of the subtraction sign.

Answer A (36) seems least naturally derivable. It might catch students making multiple errors simultaneously.

Comparing to calibration examples: The equation-solving item (-5 = p + 10) had classical difficulty 0.167 and was relatively easy. The other BODMAS calibration item (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) had difficulty 0.134. Both are on the easier side.

This item should be comparable or slightly harder than the fraction-based BODMAS item because while the numbers are simpler, the expression length (four numbers, three operations) creates more opportunity for left-to-right processing. Also, the subtraction at the start combined with the multiplication at the end is a particularly effective trap.

I'll estimate slightly higher difficulty than the calibration BODMAS item - perhaps around 0.25. The presence of D as a very natural left-to-right answer makes it a strong distractor. But many students do learn BODMAS effectively, so the majority should get it right.
