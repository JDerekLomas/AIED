Let me analyze this item carefully.

The question asks students to identify which calculation correctly computes the mean of 0, 1, 3, 4, 7.

The correct answer is A: (1+3+4+7)/5 = 15/5 = 3

Wait, let me check this. The mean of 0, 1, 3, 4, 7 should be (0+1+3+4+7)/5 = 15/5 = 3.

Looking at option A: (1+3+4+7)/5 = 15/5 = 3. This is correct because adding 0 doesn't change the sum.

Option B: 0+1+3+4+7 ÷ 5 - if read left to right without order of operations, this would give 15/5 = 3. But with proper order of operations, this is 0+1+3+4+(7÷5) = 0+1+3+4+1.4 = 9.4, which is wrong.

Option C: (1+3+4+7)/4 = 15/4 = 3.75 - this incorrectly divides by 4 instead of 5 (perhaps thinking 0 doesn't count as a number).

Option D: None of them - incorrect since A is correct.

The misconception being tested is "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order." This relates to option B, where a student might think B is correct if they don't understand that division should be performed before addition.

Key concepts involved:
1. Understanding mean calculation (sum divided by count)
2. Order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)
3. Understanding that 0 counts as a data point
4. Fraction notation implies grouping

This is a relatively straightforward question about mean calculation combined with order of operations. The question is quite clear in asking which calculation gives the correct answer.

Distractor analysis:
- A is correct (0 doesn't affect sum, dividing by 5 is correct)
- B tests order of operations misconception
- C tests whether students think 0 shouldn't be counted
- D is for students who are confused

The misconception about order of operations is quite common. From the calibration example with the same misconception (0.4 - 1/5 × 3), that had classical difficulty of 0.134 and IRT difficulty of -0.245.

However, this question is a bit different because:
1. It requires understanding of mean calculation
2. It requires recognizing that 0 is still a data point
3. It requires understanding order of operations in option B

The question seems moderately easy because:
- Students familiar with mean calculation should recognize the correct formula
- Option A clearly shows the correct structure (sum in numerator, count in denominator)
- The presence of 0 in the data might cause some confusion

I estimate this item to be relatively easy, similar to the order of operations calibration item, perhaps slightly harder due to the additional concept of mean calculation.
