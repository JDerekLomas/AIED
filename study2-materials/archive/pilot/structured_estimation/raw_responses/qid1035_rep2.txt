Expanding -(2 - 3p). Let me think about what makes this tricky for students.

The operation is: multiply each term inside the bracket by -1.
- -1 * 2 = -2
- -1 * (-3p) = +3p
Result: -2 + 3p (answer D)

The critical step is the second multiplication where students must handle the double negative. Research consistently shows that negative number arithmetic is one of the most persistent difficulties in secondary mathematics.

Thinking about the student population (UK ages 11-16), expanding single brackets is typically introduced around Year 7-8. By the time students are in Year 9+, most should handle this. But the negative outside the bracket adds a layer that catches many students even at higher year groups.

Distractor analysis:
- B (-2 - 3p) is the most attractive wrong answer - it captures the exact misconception being tested. I expect this to be the most commonly selected wrong answer.
- A (2 - 3p) represents complete ignoring of the negative sign, which younger or weaker students might do.
- C (2 + 3p) is the least plausible as it requires an unusual error pattern.

I think this item is slightly easier than the factorising item (0.473 classical difficulty) because expanding is a more basic skill than factorising. But the negative sign complication pushes difficulty up. I'll estimate around 0.35-0.40 classical difficulty.

For discrimination, the item should discriminate well because it targets a specific, well-defined misconception. Students who understand negative multiplication will get it right; those who don't will systematically choose B. This clean separation should yield good discrimination, perhaps around 1.3-1.5.
