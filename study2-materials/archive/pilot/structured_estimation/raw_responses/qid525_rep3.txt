Item: 2 7/10 + 2 1/4 = ? (as mixed number). Correct answer: B) 4 19/20.

Let me think about this from a student perspective. A Year 7 or 8 student encounters this. They need to add mixed numbers with different denominators.

The whole number part is easy: 2+2=4. The fraction part requires finding a common denominator. 10 and 4... LCD is 20. So 7/10 = 14/20 and 1/4 = 5/20. Sum: 14/20 + 5/20 = 19/20. Final: 4 19/20.

Now, what proportion of 11-16 year olds would get this wrong? The adding numerators/denominators misconception is tested by distractor D (4 8/14). This misconception is very widespread, especially among younger students. But by KS4, most students should handle this. Given the Eedi platform likely tests a range of ages, I'd expect moderate difficulty.

One thing I notice: Option A (99/20) is actually the correct answer written as an improper fraction. A student could correctly compute 27/10 + 9/4 = 54/20 + 45/20 = 99/20 but then not convert to mixed number. Wait - the question says "leave your answer as a mixed number" and option A is not a mixed number. So this is more of a reading comprehension trap.

Actually, let me reconsider option C: 99/40. If a student converts to improper fractions (27/10 + 9/4) and then multiplies denominators to get 40 but somehow still gets 99 in the numerator... that would be 27*4=108 and 9*10=90, giving 198/40. That doesn't give 99/40 unless they halve it. Or maybe 99/40 comes from some other error path. It's a less natural distractor.

I think this item has moderate difficulty, maybe around 0.35 classical difficulty. The misconception is strong but the problem is standard. Discrimination should be decent given the well-targeted primary distractor.
