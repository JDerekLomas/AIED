Rearranging F = v^2/r for v requires two steps: multiply both sides by r to get v^2 = Fr, then take the square root to get v = sqrt(Fr), which is option C.

Let me consider the population taking this test. UK secondary students ages 11-16 -- the younger students (KS3) would likely not have encountered changing the subject of a formula with squared terms. This is solidly GCSE Higher tier content, typically Year 10-11 (ages 14-16). So a large portion of the 11-16 age range would find this very challenging or beyond their current learning.

Distractor quality: The options are cleverly constructed. Each wrong answer results from a specific procedural error. Importantly, none of the wrong answers could be arrived at by simple random arrangement of symbols -- they each correspond to a plausible mistake. This should give good discrimination.

However, I note that this formula (F = v^2/r, related to centripetal force) might be familiar from physics lessons, which could help some students. But the math assessment context means students must rely on algebraic skills rather than recalled formulas.

Calibration comparison: Among the five anchors, the items testing the same misconception show increasing difficulty with algebraic complexity. The simplest (solve p+10=-5) has classical difficulty 0.167. The inequality has 0.569. This item's algebraic demands (squared variable, fraction, square root) are comparable to or slightly beyond the inequality, so I'd place classical difficulty around 0.50-0.55.

Actually, reconsidering: rearranging a formula is a distinct skill from solving an equation with given numbers. The abstraction of working with letters only (no numerical substitution to check) may make it harder. But the item is quite standard for GCSE. I'll go with 0.50 as my estimate.
