The equation 12d - 3 = 0 is a standard two-step linear equation. Students must: (1) add 3 to both sides yielding 12d = 3, (2) divide by 12 yielding d = 1/4.

Key challenge: the answer is a fraction (1/4), which many students find unexpected or uncomfortable. Students who are used to getting integer answers may second-guess themselves or be drawn to the integer distractors (B: 4, C: -4).

Distractor analysis:
- d = -1/4 (option A): Likely from subtracting 3 from both sides (same operation as the -3 in the equation) getting 12d = -3, then correctly dividing. This directly tests the stated misconception.
- d = 4 (option B): Could arise from dividing 12 by 3, or from a student who thinks 12/3 = 4 without tracking the algebra properly.
- d = -4 (option C): A combination of errors.

The distractor d = -1/4 is particularly plausible because a student applying the misconception precisely would arrive at it. Option B (d = 4) is also attractive because it's a clean integer.

Calibration anchoring: The first calibration equation (-5 = p + 10) was one-step and had difficulty 0.167. This two-step item with a fractional answer should be harder. I'd place it around 0.25-0.30 classical difficulty. For IRT b, I'll estimate around -0.1, reflecting it's slightly below average difficulty. Discrimination should be solid given the well-designed distractors -- around 1.2-1.4. Minimal guessing expected.
