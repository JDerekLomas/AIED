Examining this item on rearranging the sphere volume formula to find the radius.

Starting from V = (4/3)pi*r^3, the student must isolate r:
- 3V = 4pi*r^3
- r^3 = 3V/(4pi)
- r = cube_root(3V/(4pi)) => Option C

I want to think carefully about who in the 11-16 age range would encounter this. The sphere volume formula is GCSE Higher tier content, typically taught in Year 10-11 (ages 14-16). Making a variable the subject of a formula is also a GCSE skill, but combining it with cube roots and the sphere formula makes this a higher-tier question.

One thing I notice: a student could potentially solve this without memorizing the formula if they recognize the structure of the options. Options A, B, C all have cube roots of fractions involving V and pi, differing only in where 3 and 4 appear and whether pi is in the numerator or denominator. A student who vaguely remembers V = (4/3)pi*r^3 might try to work backwards but easily confuse the positions of 3 and 4.

Option B (cube_root(4V/(3pi))) is an especially strong distractor because students might think: "V = (4/3)pi*r^3, so r^3 = V divided by pi times (4/3), giving 4V/(3pi)." This conflates division by pi with the fraction 4/3 in a plausible but wrong way.

Compared to calibration items, I note the inequality problem (b=0.808) requires multi-step algebra but with concrete numbers. This item is purely symbolic and involves a more complex formula. I'd place the difficulty higher.

However, I should consider that some students might use process of elimination or dimensional/structural reasoning. Still, I estimate around 65-75% incorrect. Let me settle on 0.70. IRT difficulty around 1.2. The discrimination should be reasonable -- perhaps 1.15 -- as this tests a genuine skill boundary. Guessing could be around 0.20 given four options that are hard to eliminate without knowledge.
