Let me analyze this item carefully. The question shows Isaac's working where 9y = ... becomes y = ..., and asks what operation (represented by a star) was applied to both sides. The correct answer is divide by 9.

Key considerations:

1. Conceptual demand: This tests a single, fundamental concept -- identifying the inverse of multiplication as division. No computation is required; the student simply needs to recognize the relationship between 9y and y.

2. Presentation format: The item uses a visual diagram showing two lines of working with a star symbol. This is a somewhat non-standard presentation compared to typical "solve the equation" items. Students need to interpret the diagram correctly before they can even engage with the mathematical content. This interpretive layer could cause some difficulty.

3. Distractor analysis:
   - Option A (+9): Additive operation, wrong type entirely. Weak distractor for most students.
   - Option B (x9): The "same operation" misconception -- multiplying by 9 instead of dividing. This is the targeted misconception and should be the most popular wrong answer.
   - Option C (/9): Correct.
   - Option D (-9): Subtractive operation, again wrong type. Could attract students who think "removing 9" means subtracting.

4. Calibration anchoring: The three calibration items testing this same misconception show a clear pattern -- difficulty increases with equation complexity. The simplest (single-step with negatives) was 0.167; moderate complexity was 0.295; multi-step inequality was 0.569. This item has arguably the least computational demand of any of them, but the visual interpretation requirement could offset that.

5. The misconception "uses the same operation rather than the inverse" is quite common among younger/weaker students. With 9y becoming y, a student with this misconception would choose x9 (option B).

I'm going to estimate classical difficulty around 0.22. The visual interpretation adds a small amount of difficulty beyond pure conceptual simplicity. IRT difficulty around -0.35, somewhat accounting for the presentation complexity. Good discrimination expected.
