This is a "think of a number" problem — a staple of UK maths education. The student must form an equation from a verbal description: start with n, subtract 6, divide result by 3, equals 21.

The correct representation is (n-6)/3 = 21, shown as a fraction in option A.

Thinking about what makes this item challenging: students need to understand that the fraction bar in option A acts as a grouping symbol, enclosing (n-6) in the numerator. They also need to distinguish this from option B, which looks superficially similar (n - 6 ÷ 3 = 21) but means something different due to order of operations.

The misconception being tested — left-to-right processing ignoring operator precedence — is extremely common among younger secondary students. Many students at age 11-13 would naturally write "n - 6 ÷ 3" thinking it means "subtract 6 first, then divide by 3" because that's the order stated in words. They don't yet fully grasp that written mathematical notation has its own precedence rules independent of reading order.

However, option A's fraction notation is a strong visual cue. Students who understand fractions should recognize that the entire (n-6) is being divided. So the question partly tests whether students can read mathematical notation correctly.

Option D is also a plausible distractor for students who get the operation order reversed (divide first, then subtract). Option C tests multiplication/division confusion.

Comparing with calibration: the factorising item (b = 0.404, classical = 0.473) is harder because it requires checking both Tom's and Katie's work. The inequality item (b = 0.808) involves multi-step algebraic manipulation. This item is primarily about translation/representation, which I'd place in the moderate range.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.28-0.32. The "think of a number" format is well-practiced, but the BIDMAS trap in option B will catch some students. Discrimination should be reasonable. Low guessing since the options look quite different from each other.
