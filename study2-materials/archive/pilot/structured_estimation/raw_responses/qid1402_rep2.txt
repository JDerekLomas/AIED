Analyzing the target item: "Which statement correctly describes 3 + ab?"

The expression 3 + ab means: first compute a * b, then add 3. The correct verbal description is A.

Distractor analysis:
- A (correct): "Add 3 to a multiplied by b" -- correctly identifies ab as the product, then adds 3.
- B: "Add a and b then add three" -- interprets ab as a + b. This is a notation misunderstanding (not the targeted misconception). Probably weak.
- C: "Add three to a and then multiply by b" -- interprets as (3 + a) * b. This IS the left-to-right misconception. Very plausible for students who don't respect BODMAS.
- D: "Add three to b and then multiply by a" -- interprets as (3 + b) * a. Similar to C but with reversed variable roles. Less natural reading.

The item is interesting because it doesn't require any calculation -- it's a pure test of whether students can parse algebraic notation. This is arguably harder than it looks because the verbal descriptions in options A and C are quite similar, and a student must carefully match the order of operations to the verbal phrasing.

However, looking at the calibration set, the comparable item (calibration 2, same misconception) had only 13.4% incorrect. That was a computation problem. For a conceptual interpretation problem like this, I think the difficulty could be a bit higher because students need to carefully parse language. Maybe around 0.25 incorrect.

On the other hand, option A is the first option and reads very naturally. Students who understand ab = a*b will immediately see A is correct without needing to analyze other options.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.22, placing the IRT difficulty around -0.10. Discrimination should be moderate -- perhaps around 1.3 -- because the verbal nature of the item introduces some noise (students might misread options even if they understand the math). Guessing is low.
