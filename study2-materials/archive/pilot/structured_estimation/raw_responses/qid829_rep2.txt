Analyzing (m-3)(m-2) expansion item.

The mathematical content: expanding two binomials with negative constants. The procedure requires four multiplications and combining like terms. The key challenge is correctly handling (-3)(-2) = +6.

Correct answer is A: m^2 - 5m + 6.

The misconception "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer" would lead to D: m^2 - 5m - 6. This is a very common and persistent misconception, particularly among students who are still developing fluency with signed number arithmetic.

Thinking about the student population (UK ages 11-16): Expanding double brackets is typically introduced around Year 8-9 and is a staple of GCSE maths. By the time students sit diagnostic assessments, many will have practiced this type of problem. However, the negative sign rule remains a stumbling block for weaker students even at GCSE level.

Comparing with calibration items:
- The simplest equation (-5 = p+10) had difficulty 0.167 -- very easy
- The BODMAS item had difficulty 0.134 -- also easy
- The function machine item: 0.295
- Tom/Katie factorising (same misconception): 0.473
- The inequality: 0.569

This item is procedurally simpler than the inequality but targets a specific conceptual pitfall. The Tom/Katie item tested the same misconception but in a more complex evaluative context. I'd place this item somewhere between the function machine and Tom/Katie items in difficulty.

One consideration: Answer B (m^2 - m - 6) looks like it could come from expanding (m-3)(m+2) or some partial error, which adds another attractive distractor beyond just D.

I estimate classical difficulty around 0.42. Students who know the procedure but stumble on the sign rule will select D. Some may make other errors leading to B or C. IRT difficulty around 0.30, discrimination around 1.25 (the item separates well on the sign-rule concept but some noise from other error types), guessing around 0.12.
