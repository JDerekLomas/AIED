Analysing (x-4)^2 expansion item. The key skill is recognising that squaring a binomial requires expanding as a product of two identical binomials: (x-4)(x-4).

Step by step: x*x = x^2, x*(-4) = -4x, (-4)*x = -4x, (-4)*(-4) = 16. Sum: x^2 - 8x + 16 = option A.

The misconception "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer" points to distractor D where (-4)*(-4) is computed as -16 instead of +16.

However, I want to think about how students actually approach this. Many UK secondary students learn the identity (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 but may not reliably apply it. A substantial proportion will simply square each term to get x^2 + 16 (option B) or x^2 - 16 (option C). These "missing the middle term" errors are arguably more common than the sign error in the constant term.

This means the item has three strong distractors, each capturing a distinct misconception. That's good for discrimination but also means more students will get it wrong. I'd put this as a moderately difficult item.

Calibration comparison: The inequality item (2n+3 <= 3n-7) has classical difficulty 0.569 and b=0.808. That involves multi-step algebraic manipulation. This item is probably somewhat easier since it's a single expansion, but the strong distractors pull difficulty up.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.48, b around 0.35. The discrimination should be good — around 1.3-1.5 — since this cleanly separates students who can expand binomials from those who can't. Guessing probability is moderate; with four options and strong distractors, random guessing is unlikely but some students may eliminate one or two options.
