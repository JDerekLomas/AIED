Let me analyze this item carefully.

The question asks students to identify which calculation should be done first in the expression 1+2×(3-4).

**Content Analysis:**
- This tests understanding of order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS)
- The correct answer is C (3-4) because brackets/parentheses take priority
- The misconception being tested is "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order"

**Distractor Analysis:**
- A) 1+2: This would be chosen by students who work left to right
- B) 2×3: This might be chosen by students who know multiplication comes before addition but ignore brackets
- C) 3-4: Correct - brackets first
- D) It doesn't matter: This shows fundamental misunderstanding of order of operations

**Comparison to Calibration Items:**
Looking at the calibration item with the same misconception:
- "0.4-1/5×3=" had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.245

This current item is actually MORE straightforward because:
1. It explicitly asks "which calculation should you do first" - a direct question about order of operations
2. The brackets are clearly visible
3. No actual computation is required - just identifying the first step

**Difficulty Assessment:**
- This is a fundamental order of operations question
- Brackets are the most commonly taught priority rule
- The question is very clear and direct
- Students who know BIDMAS will immediately see brackets = first
- However, the misconception (left-to-right) is common among weaker students

**Rating Considerations:**
- Concept complexity: Low - just order of operations (3)
- Procedural steps: Minimal - just identify first operation (2)
- Abstraction level: Fairly concrete - working with actual numbers (3)
- Prerequisite knowledge: Basic BIDMAS knowledge (3)
- Distractor plausibility: A is plausible for misconception holders, B less so (5)
- Misconception strength: Left-to-right is a common error (6)
- Question clarity: Very clear what's being asked (9)
- Cognitive load: Low - simple expression (2)
- Age appropriateness: Perfect for KS3 (ages 11-14) (9)
- Transfer distance: Standard textbook format (3)
- Visual complexity: Simple expression (2)
- Solution uniqueness: Need to understand brackets rule (7)

**Predictions:**
Given this is a simpler, more direct question than the calibration item testing the same misconception (which had 0.134 classical difficulty), I expect this to be even easier. The brackets are very obvious. However, the misconception is still somewhat prevalent.

I estimate:
- Classical difficulty: Around 0.15-0.20 (most students get this right)
- IRT difficulty: Around -0.8 to -0.5 (easier than average)
- Discrimination: Moderate - separates those who know BIDMAS from those who don't (around 1.2-1.4)
- Guessing: Low - students either know or don't know the rule (around 0.05)
