Let me analyze this item carefully. The equation is 2v - 5 = 6v - 3.

Jo says you can write: 2v - 8 = 6v. She appears to have tried to move the -3 from the right side to the left. The correct inverse operation would be to add 3 to both sides, yielding 2v - 5 + 3 = 6v, which gives 2v - 2 = 6v. Instead, Jo subtracted 3 from the left side (same operation rather than inverse), getting 2v - 5 - 3 = 2v - 8 on the left, while correctly eliminating -3 from the right to get 6v. So Jo's step is incorrect.

Paul says you can write: 2v = 6v - 8. He appears to have tried to move the -5 from the left side to the right. The correct inverse operation would be to add 5 to both sides, yielding 2v = 6v - 3 + 5 = 6v + 2. Instead, Paul subtracted 5 from the right side (same operation rather than inverse), getting 6v - 3 - 5 = 6v - 8. So Paul's step is also incorrect.

Both students demonstrate the same misconception: using the same operation instead of the inverse when rearranging an equation. The correct answer is D (Neither is correct).

This item is particularly challenging because:
1. Students must verify TWO separate claims, not just solve the equation themselves.
2. Both errors are plausible — the results "look right" superficially.
3. Many students who share the tested misconception will think both are correct (choosing C).
4. The "who is correct" format adds metacognitive demands.

Comparing to calibration items: The inequality item (b = 0.808, classical 0.569) tests the same misconception but only requires one verification. This item requires checking two claims, each involving the same misconception. I'd expect this to be harder than the inequality item. The factorising item (b = 0.404, classical 0.473) also requires evaluating two claims but involves a different misconception. This item should be comparable or slightly harder.

I estimate classical difficulty around 0.55-0.65 and IRT difficulty around 0.6-0.9. Discrimination should be moderate-to-good since understanding the inverse operation concept is key. Guessing is possible since students might randomly pick D.
