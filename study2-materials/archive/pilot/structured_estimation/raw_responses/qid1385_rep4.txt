Evaluating: 1/3 + 1/4 + 2/3 + 3/4 = ? with answer C (2).

The mathematical content here is straightforward fraction addition. What makes this item diagnostic is the careful construction of distractors that map to specific misconceptions.

Key observations:
1. The problem deliberately includes complementary fraction pairs (1/3, 2/3 and 1/4, 3/4). This is a slight transfer demand - students are used to adding fractions in order, not regrouping them.
2. The misconception distractor B (7/14) directly tests whether students add numerators and denominators separately.
3. The correct answer being a whole number (2) is somewhat unusual for a fraction addition problem, which could either help (students who check reasonableness) or hinder (students who expect fraction answers).

For the distractors: B is very strong because the "add tops and bottoms" misconception is one of the most documented errors in fraction arithmetic. A (7/12) represents a partial understanding - getting a common denominator but not converting numerators. D (28/12) suggests procedural errors in the conversion process.

Thinking about difficulty relative to calibration: The simple equation (-5=p+10) was 0.167 difficulty. That's algebraic manipulation which is arguably harder conceptually but involves fewer steps. This fraction problem has more computational steps but uses more basic concepts.

The four-fraction format increases cognitive load significantly compared to a two-fraction addition. Students need to hold multiple intermediate results. I think this lands around 0.40 classical difficulty - a substantial minority will make the numerator/denominator error or a computational mistake.

For discrimination: the item should discriminate moderately well. Students who understand fractions will get it right regardless of approach. Those who don't will fall for distractor B. But the clean answer of 2 might help some guessers. I'll estimate moderate guessing around 0.10.
