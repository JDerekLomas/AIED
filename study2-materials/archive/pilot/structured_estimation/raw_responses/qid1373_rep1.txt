This item requires expanding -3(m-2). The student needs to apply the distributive property with a negative multiplier across a subtraction inside brackets.

Key skills needed: distributive property, multiplying negative numbers, sign rules.

The correct answer D (-3m+6) requires knowing:
1. -3 times m gives -3m
2. -3 times -2 gives +6 (negative times negative = positive)

Distractor B (-3m-6) is the primary trap - students who think negative times negative equals negative will get -3*(-2) = -6 and choose B. This is a very common error, especially for students in Years 7-9.

Distractor A (3m+6) and C (3m-6) involve additionally getting the first term wrong (dropping the negative from -3m), which is less likely but possible.

Looking at the calibration: the same misconception was tested in the Tom/Katie factorising problem with difficulty 0.473. That problem required more reasoning (checking two factorisations). This problem is more direct but the negative arithmetic can trip students up.

I think this is moderately difficult. Many students struggle with sign rules when expanding brackets. The question is very clear and standard. I'd put classical difficulty around 0.35-0.45.

For discrimination, the item should discriminate well because it targets a specific, well-defined misconception. Students who understand sign rules will get it right; those who don't will likely pick B.
