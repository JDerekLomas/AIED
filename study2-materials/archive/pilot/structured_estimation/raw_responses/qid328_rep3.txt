This is a fraction addition problem: 2/9 + 1/3. The tested misconception is adding both numerators and denominators.

I want to think about the student population taking this test. These are UK secondary students ages 11-16 on a diagnostic assessment. Fraction addition is a Year 7 topic, so many students in this range should have mastered it. However, diagnostic assessments often surface persistent misconceptions even in older students.

The fact that the denominators are related (9 = 3 x 3) makes this one of the simpler cases of fraction addition. A student only needs to multiply the second fraction by 3/3. Compare this to, say, adding fractions with denominators 7 and 5 where the LCD is 35.

However, the "add numerators and denominators" misconception is incredibly robust. Even students who have been taught the correct procedure may revert to this error under time pressure or when not thinking carefully. Distractor B (3/12) will be very attractive to these students.

Distractor C (3/9) is interesting — it could catch students who know they need the same denominator but just add the numerators: they see the 9 and keep it, add 2+1=3. This is actually a less severe error than B since the student at least understands something about common denominators.

Distractor D (1/6) seems less plausible. I'm not sure what systematic error produces it.

Given the strong pull of the misconception but the relative simplicity of the problem, I estimate moderate-to-low difficulty. Perhaps 35% get it wrong — the misconception is very strong and B is very tempting. Actually, on reflection, since this is a diagnostic test and the misconception is being specifically tested, the distractors are designed to be maximally attractive. I'll estimate higher difficulty than a typical fraction addition problem.

For discrimination: this should discriminate well. Students who understand fraction addition will get it right; those who don't will choose B. Clean separation. I'll estimate discrimination around 1.3-1.5.
