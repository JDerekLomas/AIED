This item asks students to add four fractions: 1/3 + 1/4 + 2/3 + 3/4. The key insight is recognizing that 1/3 + 2/3 = 1 and 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, so the answer is 2. Students who don't regroup the fractions will need to find a common denominator of 12 and compute 4/12 + 3/12 + 8/12 + 9/12 = 24/12 = 2.

The misconception tested is "adds numerators and denominators separately." A student making this error would compute (1+1+2+3)/(3+4+3+4) = 7/14, which is distractor B. This is a very common misconception for younger students.

Distractor A (7/12) could come from adding only numerators: 1+1+2+3=7 over a common denominator of 12, but not adjusting numerators properly. Distractor D (28/12) might come from some partial correct work with errors.

Looking at calibration items: the equation -5=p+10 had classical difficulty 0.167 (easy). The fraction addition here requires knowledge of fraction addition which is a common stumbling block. I'd estimate this is moderate difficulty - harder than simple equation solving but the regrouping shortcut makes it accessible to stronger students.

The misconception of adding numerators and denominators is extremely common among weaker students, making distractor B very attractive. The question is clearly stated. The cognitive load is moderate - four fractions to track. This is solidly age-appropriate for KS3 (ages 11-14).

I estimate roughly 35-40% get it wrong. Many students will be drawn to B (7/14) or struggle with the common denominator approach. The discrimination should be decent since stronger students will spot the pairing trick.
