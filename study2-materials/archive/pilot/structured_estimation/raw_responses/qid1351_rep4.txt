Target: Solve -3 = p + 12. Answer: B, p = -15.

This is a basic one-step equation requiring the student to subtract 12 from both sides. The main challenge is working with negative numbers: -3 - 12 = -15.

I'll approach this by considering what proportion of UK secondary students (ages 11-16) across the full ability range would get this wrong. Solving simple linear equations is introduced around Year 7-8 and should be well-practiced by most students in the Eedi dataset. The Eedi platform tends to be used for diagnostic purposes, so the student population is broad.

Calibration item 1 is the closest match: -5 = p + 10, same misconception, same structure. It had 16.7% incorrect. The near-identical structure suggests very similar difficulty.

One thing I want to think about differently this time: the role of the specific distractors in shaping the parameters. In calibration item 1, the correct answer was C (p = -15). Here the correct answer is B (p = -15). The position of the correct answer in the option list can sometimes matter -- research suggests middle options are slightly more frequently chosen. But this effect is small for math items where students compute an answer and match it.

For discrimination, all three calibration items testing this misconception had a values between 1.05 and 1.32. The simpler items (1 and 3) had higher discrimination, suggesting cleaner measurement. This simple item should discriminate well.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.15-0.20, anchoring tightly to calibration item 1. IRT difficulty should be in the -0.5 to -0.8 range. Discrimination around 1.2-1.5. Guessing near zero since students compute specific values.
