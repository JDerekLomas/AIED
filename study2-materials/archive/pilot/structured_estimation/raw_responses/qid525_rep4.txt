Target: 2 7/10 + 2 1/4, mixed number answer. Correct: B) 4 19/20.

I want to focus on the distractor structure and what it tells us about expected difficulty.

Distractor D (4 8/14) is the misconception distractor - adding num+num and den+den. This will attract a significant portion of students, particularly those in Years 7-8 who are still developing fraction understanding. Research by Siegler and others suggests this misconception can affect 30-40% of students at certain ages.

Distractor A (99/20) catches a different error - correct computation but wrong format. This is interesting because a student could know fraction arithmetic perfectly but lose marks on the "mixed number" instruction. This might catch about 10-15% of students.

Distractor C (99/40) is the weakest distractor. I'm trying to figure out the error path... if you convert to improper fractions: 27/10 + 9/4. If you then cross-multiply incorrectly or multiply both denominators to get 40 and add numerators directly (27+9=36, not 99)... actually 99/40 doesn't follow an obvious error path. Maybe it's meant to be 99/20 with an extra denominator error. This probably won't attract many students.

Given that D is a strong attractor and A catches a secondary error, I expect this item to be moderately difficult. Looking at calibration, the factorising item (which also tests a common misconception with good distractors) had classical difficulty 0.473. I think this fraction item is slightly easier because the procedure is more straightforward, but the misconception pull is very strong.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.40, IRT difficulty near 0.20. Discrimination should be solid - fraction misconceptions clearly separate stronger from weaker students. Maybe around 1.3-1.4. Guessing should be low since D is such a strong attractor for students who don't know the correct method - they won't be randomly guessing.
