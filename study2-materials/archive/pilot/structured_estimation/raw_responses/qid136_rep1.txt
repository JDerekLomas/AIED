The target item requires students to find two numbers whose product is -24. This tests understanding of signed number multiplication rules.

Evaluating the options:
A) (-3)(-8) = 24, not -24. This is the key distractor for students who believe neg x neg = neg.
B) (-4)(6) = -24. Correct answer.
C) (-10)(-14) = 140. Wrong on both sign and magnitude. Weak distractor.
D) (-3)(9) = -27. Right sign but wrong product. Tests computation errors.

The misconception "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative" is quite common among younger secondary students. The item is well-designed because option A has factors that actually produce 24 in magnitude, making it very tempting for students with this misconception.

Looking at the calibration set, the factorising item testing the same misconception had difficulty 0.473 (IRT b = 0.404). That item was more complex because it embedded the misconception within algebraic factorisation. This item is more direct -- pure arithmetic with signed numbers -- so should be noticeably easier.

However, the directness of the question means students either know the sign rules or they don't, which could make discrimination moderate to high. The strong distractor A should pull misconception-holders reliably.

I'd estimate classical difficulty around 0.30-0.35, placing it between the easier calibration items and the factorising item. IRT difficulty probably near 0.0 to 0.2.
