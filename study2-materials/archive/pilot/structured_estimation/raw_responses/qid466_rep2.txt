The target item: -3/4 * star = -1. Solve for star.

Solution path: star = -1 / (-3/4) = -1 * (-4/3) = 4/3. Answer A.

Let me think about this from a student perspective. A Year 8 or 9 student encountering this needs to:
- Recognize this as a missing factor problem
- Know how to divide by a fraction (multiply by reciprocal)
- Correctly handle the signs: negative divided by negative = positive

The misconception "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative" is strong among younger secondary students. Research consistently shows sign rules are a persistent source of error. A student holding this misconception would compute the magnitude correctly as 4/3 but then reason: "negative times something equals negative... so the something must also be negative" - choosing B.

However, there's an interesting subtlety. Some students might reason backwards: "What do I multiply -3/4 by to get -1?" They might try each answer mentally. If they try A (4/3): -3/4 * 4/3 = -12/12 = -1. This verification approach could help some students get it right even without fully understanding sign rules, which could make the item slightly easier than expected.

Looking at calibration: the factorising item with the same misconception had b=0.404. This item is more procedurally straightforward (one step vs. expanding brackets) but the fraction arithmetic adds difficulty. I'll estimate similar difficulty, maybe slightly higher around b=0.35-0.45.

Discrimination: The item should discriminate well because the key misconception creates a clean binary - you either understand negative * negative = positive, or you don't. I estimate a ~ 1.3-1.4.

Guessing: With four options, chance is 0.25, but the distractors are well-designed so informed guessing is limited. I'd estimate c around 0.10.
