T = k^4 where k = -3. The answer is 81 (A) since (-3)^4 = 81.

I want to think carefully about what proportion of the 11-16 UK student population gets this wrong. The item sits at the intersection of two skills: exponentiation and signed number arithmetic.

For the sign issue: research consistently shows that even secondary students struggle with powers of negative numbers. The "even power = positive" rule is often taught but poorly retained. Students who remember "negative times negative is positive" for two factors may not extend this reasoning to four factors. They might think: "two negatives make a positive, but then multiplying by another negative makes it negative again, and one more negative... I'm confused, probably negative." This confusion is very real.

For the computation: 3^4 isn't a commonly memorised power (unlike 2^4=16 or 3^2=9 or 3^3=27). Students need to compute it, which adds cognitive load.

Distractor analysis: The B/D options (12/-12) come from 3*4 or -3*4. This is actually a very common error -- confusing "to the power of 4" with "times 4." In my experience, this error is just as common as the sign error, maybe more so among lower-ability students.

So we have roughly three groups getting it wrong:
1. Sign error -> C (-81): maybe 15-20% of students
2. Operation confusion -> B (12) or D (-12): maybe 15-20% of students
3. Combined errors or random guessing

This suggests classical difficulty might be quite high -- perhaps 0.40-0.45. But then again, higher-ability students should breeze through this, so perhaps it's not that bad.

Let me anchor more carefully. The simple equation -5=p+10 had difficulty 0.167. That's very easy. The inequality had 0.569. This item is somewhere in between. I'll estimate 0.42.

For IRT difficulty, mapping 0.42 to b: looking at the calibration, 0.473 maps to b=0.404 and 0.295 maps to b=0.002. Linear interpolation suggests 0.42 maps to roughly b=0.30.

Discrimination: this should be moderate to good. The item clearly separates students who understand exponentiation of negatives. I'll say 1.20.
