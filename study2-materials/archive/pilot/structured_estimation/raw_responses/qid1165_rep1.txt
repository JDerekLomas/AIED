The target item presents (x-8)(x-2) and asks what happens when you multiply the two constant terms indicated by arrows: -8 and -2. The correct answer is +16 (option B), because negative times negative equals positive.

Let me consider each distractor's appeal:
- A) -10: Sum of -8 and -2. A student confusing addition with multiplication might pick this.
- B) +16: Correct answer.
- C) -6: Perhaps (-8) - (-2) = -6, or some confused subtraction.
- D) -16: The primary misconception trap -- correctly computing 8x2=16 but failing to apply the negative x negative = positive rule.

Option D is highly plausible for students with the target misconception. Option A could catch students who confuse the operations entirely. This makes the distractors reasonably effective.

Comparing to the calibration item with the same misconception (Tom/Katie factorising, classical difficulty 0.473, b=0.404): that item required checking two different factorisations and understanding the product of binomials more holistically. This item is more targeted -- just one multiplication. However, the context of bracket expansion might confuse some students about what operation to perform.

I think the difficulty is moderate. Many students at KS3/KS4 level struggle with the sign rule for multiplication of negatives. The visual element (arrows) should help clarity but also adds a layer of interpretation. I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.35, slightly easier than the Tom/Katie item since the cognitive demand is lower.

Discrimination should be moderate to good -- this is a clean test of one specific concept. Guessing is probably low since the misconception strongly pulls students toward D.
