This item asks students to solve a linear equation with the variable on both sides: 12d - 3 = 6d + 3. The correct solution requires:
1. Subtract 6d from both sides: 6d - 3 = 3
2. Add 3 to both sides: 6d = 6
3. Divide by 6: d = 1

The misconception tested is "uses the same operation rather than the inverse." A student making this error might add 6d instead of subtracting it, or subtract 3 instead of adding it, leading to incorrect values.

Looking at the distractors:
- A) d=0: Could arise from various arithmetic errors, e.g., if a student tries 12(0)-3 = -3 and 6(0)+3 = 3, this doesn't check out, so it's a weak attractor unless students guess.
- B) d=1: Correct. 12(1)-3=9, 6(1)+3=9. Checks out.
- C) d=-1: Could come from a sign error during rearrangement.
- D) d=1/3: Could arise from dividing 6 by 18 instead of 6 by 6, perhaps from adding coefficients incorrectly (12d+6d=18d).

Comparing to calibration items: The first calibration item (-5=p+10, correct C) had classical difficulty 0.167 and IRT b=-0.702. That's a simpler one-step equation. The inequality item (2n+3 <= 3n-7) had difficulty 0.569 and b=0.808 - that's harder due to inequality handling and variable on both sides.

This target item has variables on both sides like the inequality item, but without the inequality complication. It involves larger coefficients (12d, 6d) which adds some cognitive load. I'd estimate it falls between the simpler equations and the inequality - moderate difficulty. Perhaps classical difficulty around 0.35-0.45, IRT b around 0.2-0.5.

The discrimination should be reasonable since it tests a clear algebraic skill. The distractors are moderately plausible - d=1/3 and d=-1 could trap students with procedural errors. Guessing is likely low since students who understand the procedure will get it right.
