Let me analyze this item carefully.

The question asks for the 15th term of the sequence defined by u_n = 1 - 3n.

**Correct solution:**
u_15 = 1 - 3(15) = 1 - 45 = -44

So the correct answer is A) -44

**Misconception being tested:** "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order"

If a student does this incorrectly:
- They might calculate (1 - 3) × 15 = -2 × 15 = -30 (This gives answer D)

Let me check the other distractors:
- B) -46: This could come from 1 - 3(15) = 1 - 45 = -44, but getting -46 might be an arithmetic error (perhaps -45 - 1 = -46 if they subtract 1 instead of adding)
- C) -14: This could come from 1 - 15 = -14 (ignoring the coefficient 3 entirely)
- D) -30: As analyzed, this comes from (1-3) × 15 = -30, which is the left-to-right error

The misconception tested (left-to-right operations) directly leads to distractor D.

**Analyzing the item characteristics:**

1. **Concept complexity:** This involves understanding sequence notation (u_n), substitution, and order of operations. Moderate complexity (about 4-5).

2. **Procedural steps:** Substitute n=15, multiply 3×15, subtract from 1. About 3 steps (3-4).

3. **Abstraction level:** Uses algebraic notation for sequences, which is moderately abstract (5-6).

4. **Prerequisite knowledge:** Need to know sequence notation, substitution, order of operations, negative numbers (5).

5. **Distractor plausibility:** D is very plausible for the misconception. B and C are less directly tied to common errors but could catch arithmetic mistakes (6-7).

6. **Misconception strength:** Order of operations errors are common, especially with expressions like 1-3n where students might read it left-to-right (6-7).

7. **Question clarity:** Very clear question - straightforward substitution task (9).

8. **Cognitive load:** Moderate - need to hold the formula, substitute, and compute with negatives (5).

9. **Age appropriateness:** Sequences with nth term formulas are typically KS3/KS4 content, very appropriate (9).

10. **Transfer distance:** This is a fairly standard presentation of finding a term in a sequence (3-4).

11. **Visual complexity:** Simple algebraic notation, no diagrams (3).

12. **Solution uniqueness:** Students need to understand both substitution and order of operations to get the right answer (7).

**Difficulty prediction:**
Comparing to the calibration items:
- The order of operations item (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) had classical difficulty of 0.134 and IRT difficulty of -0.245
- This item tests a similar misconception but in a different context (sequences)
- The sequence context adds some complexity
- I estimate this to be slightly harder than the calibration order of operations item

Classical difficulty: Around 0.25-0.35 (proportion incorrect)
IRT difficulty: Around 0.0 to 0.3
IRT discrimination: Should be moderate to good, around 1.2-1.5
Guessing: Low, around 0.05-0.15
