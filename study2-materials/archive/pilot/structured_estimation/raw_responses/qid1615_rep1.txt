Analyzing this item: "I think of a number, take away six, divide by three, get 21." Students must select the equation that matches.

The correct answer A shows (n-6)/3 = 21 using fraction notation, which naturally groups the numerator. This is a forming-equations task combined with order-of-operations understanding.

Key analysis of each option:
- A (correct): Fraction bar groups n-6 as numerator, divided by 3. Matches the word problem exactly.
- B: n - 6 ÷ 3 = 21. Written without grouping, so BIDMAS says divide 6 by 3 first. This is the primary misconception trap — students who read left-to-right and don't realize the notation doesn't match their intended meaning.
- C: 3(n-6) = 21. Multiplying instead of dividing. Less common error but tests inverse operation confusion.
- D: n/3 - 6 = 21. Operations in wrong order — divides n by 3 first, then subtracts 6.

The misconception tested is "carries out operations left to right regardless of priority order." Option B is the primary misconception distractor. But option D could also attract students who understand grouping is needed but get the sequence wrong.

Looking at the calibration set, the BIDMAS item had b = -0.245, which was relatively easy. But that was a computation task. This forming-equations task requires more abstract thinking — translating words to symbols. I'd place this somewhat harder.

The question wording is clear and follows a very standard "I think of a number" format common in UK maths. Most students at KS3 would have encountered this type of question.

I estimate classical difficulty around 0.35 — about a third of students get it wrong. The item should discriminate well because the distractors target specific, identifiable errors. Guessing is unlikely to be a major factor given the distinct options.
