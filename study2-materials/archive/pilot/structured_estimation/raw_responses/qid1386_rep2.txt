Analyzing 2/x + 3/x with answer B (5/x).

This is the simplest form of algebraic fraction addition - same denominators. In numerical terms, this is equivalent to 2/7 + 3/7 = 5/7, just with x instead of a specific number. Students who understand that fractions with the same denominator are added by keeping the denominator and adding numerators will find this trivial.

The misconception tested is "adds numerators and denominators." Looking at the distractors:
- C (5/2x) directly reflects this misconception: numerators 2+3=5, denominators x+x=2x
- A (5x/x^2) might come from an unnecessary cross-multiplication approach where a student treats the fractions as having different denominators
- D (6/x^2) suggests multiplication rather than addition of the fractions

Key consideration: algebraic fractions are typically introduced around Year 9-10 in UK curriculum (ages 13-15). For younger students this would be very hard; for older students who've been taught the topic, it's routine.

The presence of the variable x makes this harder than a pure numerical fractions question, even though the mathematical operation is identical. Students may overthink because "algebra looks hard."

However, option A being an equivalent unsimplified form is notable - it could attract students who do the right operation but via an unnecessarily complex method. The question says "as simply as possible" which should steer them to B.

I think this is on the easier side overall. Classical difficulty around 0.20-0.25. Many students will recognize same-denominator addition even with variables. But a non-trivial minority will fall for C (the tested misconception).

For IRT: relatively easy (negative b), good discrimination since it tests a specific skill cleanly, low guessing since the correct answer is obviously simpler than the others.
