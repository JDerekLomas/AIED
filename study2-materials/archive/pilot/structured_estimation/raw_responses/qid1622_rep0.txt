The target item asks students to substitute x=0 into the equation 3x + 2y = 6 and solve for y. When x=0, the equation becomes 2y = 6, so y = 3 (option A).

This is a relatively straightforward substitution and solving task. The misconception tested is "uses the same operation rather than the inverse" — a student making this error might divide 6 by 2 incorrectly or apply addition instead of division, though the distractors suggest other errors too.

Looking at the distractors:
- A) 3 — correct: 2y=6, y=3
- B) 2 — could come from reading the coefficient of y, or dividing 6 by 3 instead of 2
- C) 1.5 — could come from dividing 3 by 2, mixing up which coefficient to use
- D) 12 — could come from multiplying 6 by 2 instead of dividing (the tested misconception — using multiplication instead of division as inverse)

The distractors are reasonably plausible. Option D directly targets the misconception of using the same operation rather than inverse. Option B is a common confusion error. The item involves a table of values which adds some visual/contextual complexity but the actual math is basic.

Comparing to calibration items: The first calibration item (solve -5=p+10) had classical difficulty 0.167 and similar misconception. That was pure equation solving. This item requires substitution first, then solving, making it slightly harder. But the substitution step is trivial (x=0 zeroes out the first term). I'd estimate this is similar in difficulty to the first two calibration items, perhaps slightly easier than the function machine item (0.295).

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.25-0.30, as the table format and two-step nature add modest complexity.
