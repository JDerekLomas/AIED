The question presents y=(x-8)(x-6) and asks where the curve intercepts the y-axis. The y-intercept is found by setting x=0: y=(0-8)(0-6)=(-8)(-6)=48. So the answer is C: (0,48).

Let me consider each distractor's appeal:
- D: (0,-48) is the most dangerous distractor. Students who think negative times negative equals negative will get this. This is the tested misconception and it's quite common among younger students.
- B: Students who think "intercepts" means where the brackets equal zero might pick the values 8 and 6 but place them on the y-axis incorrectly.
- A: (0,-14) could come from subtracting/adding -8+-6=-14 rather than multiplying.

This question requires two pieces of knowledge: (1) understanding that y-intercept means x=0, and (2) correctly multiplying two negative numbers. The combination of these two requirements makes this moderately challenging.

Comparing with the calibration: the Tom/Katie factorising item testing the same misconception had difficulty 0.473. However, that item required understanding factorisation AND checking both claims. This item has a more straightforward procedure (just substitute x=0) but the multiplication of negatives is the key barrier.

I think this is slightly easier than the factorising item because the procedure is more direct. Many students at KS3/4 level know to substitute x=0 for y-intercepts. The main stumbling block is the negative multiplication.

I'd estimate classical difficulty around 0.42-0.48, similar to the factorising calibration item.
