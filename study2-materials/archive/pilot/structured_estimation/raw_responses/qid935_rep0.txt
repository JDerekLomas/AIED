Let me analyze this item step by step.

The student is given the equation 2j - k = -10 and told k = 8. They need to find j.

Substituting: 2j - 8 = -10
Adding 8: 2j = -2
Dividing by 2: j = -1

So the correct answer is D (j = -1).

Now let me consider how students might arrive at each distractor:

A) j = 1: A student might substitute k = 8 to get 2j - 8 = -10, then incorrectly add to get 2j = -2, but then lose the negative sign, getting j = 1. Or they might do -10 + 8 = -2 but then divide incorrectly.

B) j = 9: This could come from 2j - 8 = -10, then using the same operation (subtracting 8 instead of adding): 2j = -10 - 8 = -18... that gives j = -9, not 9. Alternatively, a student might ignore the negative and compute (10 + 8)/2 = 9.

C) j = -9: From subtracting 8 instead of adding: 2j = -10 - 8 = -18, then j = -9. This is the misconception being tested - using subtraction (same operation) instead of addition (inverse operation).

D) j = -1: Correct.

The misconception tested is "uses the same operation rather than the inverse." Distractor C directly maps to this - subtracting 8 instead of adding 8. Distractor B (j = 9) could be the same error but also dropping the negative.

Comparing to calibration items:
- The equation-solving items with this same misconception ranged from easy (0.167 classical difficulty for the simple p + 10 = -5) to hard (0.569 for the inequality).
- This item involves simultaneous equations context (added complexity), substitution, and negative numbers. The combination of substitution into an equation plus negative arithmetic puts this at moderate-to-hard difficulty.
- The context of simultaneous equations adds some cognitive load and prerequisite knowledge, even though the actual solving step is straightforward.
- The negative numbers throughout make sign errors very likely, increasing difficulty.

I'd estimate this is moderately difficult, perhaps around 0.40-0.50 classical difficulty. The simultaneous equations framing adds transfer distance. The distractors are reasonably plausible especially C (direct misconception) and B (sign error variant).

For IRT parameters, comparing to calibration: the factoring item with 0.473 classical difficulty had b = 0.404. I'd estimate this around b = 0.3 to 0.5. Discrimination should be moderate to good since it targets a specific misconception cleanly - perhaps around 1.2. Some guessing is possible but the distractors are targeted, so guessing parameter maybe 0.10.
