This item presents an equation-solving scenario where Isaac goes from x + 7 = ... to x = ..., and students must identify the operation applied to both sides. The correct answer is -7 (option D).

Let me think about what makes this item distinctive. Rather than asking students to solve an equation, it asks them to reason about the process of solving -- a metacognitive or procedural-awareness task. Students must read the visual representation of working, understand the arrow-and-star notation, and connect the transformation from "x + 7" to "x" with the subtraction operation.

This metacognitive framing could cut both ways. On one hand, students who mechanically solve equations correctly might struggle to articulate what operation they used. On the other hand, the visual scaffold makes the relationship very explicit -- you can almost read it as "what do you do to get rid of the +7?"

Calibration anchoring:
- The easiest same-misconception item (p + 10) was 0.167 classical difficulty. That required actual computation.
- This item requires no computation, just operation identification.
- But the unusual presentation format could confuse some students.

I think the presentation factor is meaningful. The image-based format with "star" notation is not standard textbook fare, which could add difficulty for lower-ability students who are unfamiliar with this representational style. This might push difficulty slightly higher than pure content would suggest.

For distractors: A (+7) is the clear misconception trap. B and C involve multiplication/division which are categorically wrong operations for an additive context. Students who understand addition/subtraction but not inverse operations would pick A. Students who are completely lost might pick B or C, functioning somewhat like guessing.

My estimate: classical difficulty around 0.12-0.20, IRT difficulty around -0.5 to -0.9. Discrimination should be solid (1.2-1.5) since it cleanly separates understanding of inverse operations. Low guessing probability.
