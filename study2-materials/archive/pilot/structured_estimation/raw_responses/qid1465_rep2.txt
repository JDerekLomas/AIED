Item: 3 - 5 + 4 × 2. The student must apply order of operations (BIDMAS). Multiplication first: 4 × 2 = 8. Then left to right: 3 - 5 + 8 = -2 + 8 = 6. Answer A.

Thinking about the student population (UK ages 11-16, diagnostic assessment):

The misconception "carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order" is one of the most common errors in early secondary maths. Distractor B (4) perfectly captures this: 3-5=-2, -2+4=2, 2×2=4.

However, I want to consider whether the negative numbers in this problem add difficulty beyond just BIDMAS. A student might correctly identify that multiplication comes first (4×2=8) but then struggle with 3 - 5 + 8. Some might compute 3 - (5+8) = 3-13 = -10 (distractor D), confusing the order of addition and subtraction. This means the item tests two things: BIDMAS priority AND correct handling of addition/subtraction left to right.

Distractor C (-12) is less obviously derivable and probably attracts fewer students.

Given the dual challenge (BIDMAS + negative number arithmetic), I think this item might be slightly harder than the pure BIDMAS calibration example. The calibration item 0.4 - 1/5 × 3 had difficulty 0.134, but that involved fractions/decimals which might actually help students recognize the need for careful ordering. Here, the simplicity of the numbers might make students more careless.

I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.20-0.25, accounting for the combined BIDMAS and sign errors. IRT difficulty near 0.0.
