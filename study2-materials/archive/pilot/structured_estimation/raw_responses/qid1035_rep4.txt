Analyzing -(2 - 3p). Correct answer: D (-2 + 3p).

This tests expanding brackets with a negative multiplier, specifically targeting the misconception that multiplying two negatives gives a negative.

Let me approach this by thinking about what makes items discriminate well vs poorly. A good discriminating item cleanly separates students by ability. Here, the key question is whether the misconception (double negative -> negative) correlates strongly with overall math ability.

I think it does: understanding of negative number operations is foundational, and students who master it tend to be stronger overall. This suggests decent discrimination.

Now for difficulty estimation. Let me anchor to the calibration items more carefully:

- The simplest calibration item (solve -5 = p + 10) has classical difficulty 0.167 - very easy.
- The order of operations item has 0.134 - also easy.
- The function machine item: 0.295.
- The factorising item (same misconception): 0.473.
- The inequality item: 0.569.

Expanding -(2 - 3p) is conceptually simpler than factorising but involves the same tricky misconception. I'd place this between the function machine item and the factorising item. My estimate: classical difficulty around 0.35.

For IRT difficulty, the function machine was at 0.002 and factorising at 0.404. Splitting the difference but closer to the function machine since this is more procedural: maybe 0.15.

Discrimination: The calibration items range from 1.05 to 1.55. This item has clean distractor design targeting a specific misconception, which should help discrimination. I'll say 1.50.

Guessing: The distractors are all plausible systematic errors, so random guessing is unlikely to dominate. But some students might use process of elimination (knowing the answer should have -2 narrows to B or D). This partial knowledge could inflate the guessing parameter slightly. I'll estimate 0.05.
