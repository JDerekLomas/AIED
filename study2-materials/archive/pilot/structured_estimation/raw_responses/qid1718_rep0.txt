This item asks students to expand (x-3)^2. The correct answer is D: x^2 - 6x + 9. The misconception tested is "believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer," which would lead students to choose A: x^2 - 6x - 9 (getting -9 instead of +9 for the (-3)(-3) term).

Looking at the distractors:
- A: x^2 - 6x - 9 — student expanded correctly but thought (-3)(-3) = -9. This directly tests the misconception.
- B: x^2 - 9 — difference of squares error, student treated (x-3)^2 as x^2 - 3^2. Very common error.
- C: x^2 + 9 — student squared each term separately but got the sign right on 9. Missing the middle term.
- D: x^2 - 6x + 9 — correct.

This is a standard GCSE-level algebra item. Expanding brackets with squared binomials is typically taught around Year 9-10. The distractors are quite plausible — B in particular is an extremely common error pattern.

Comparing to calibration items: The factorising item (Tom and Katie) tested the same misconception and had classical difficulty 0.473, IRT b=0.404. This item is similar in concept but asks for expansion rather than factorisation. Expansion is generally slightly easier than factorisation, but the squared binomial adds complexity. The distractor B (difference of squares) is very tempting and could pull many students away.

I'd estimate this is moderately difficult — perhaps slightly harder than the Tom/Katie item because there are two strong distractors (A for the tested misconception, B for the difference of squares error). I'll estimate classical difficulty around 0.45-0.50, IRT difficulty around 0.35.
