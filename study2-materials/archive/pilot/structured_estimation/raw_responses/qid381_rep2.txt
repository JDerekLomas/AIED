I need to analyze this formula rearrangement item. The question gives students A = (1/2)(b x h) and asks them to make h the subject.

The correct procedure:
Step 1: A = (1/2)bh
Step 2: 2A = bh (inverse of multiplying by 1/2 is multiplying by 2)
Step 3: h = 2A/b (inverse of multiplying by b is dividing by b)

Answer: B

Let me think about what makes this item tick from a difficulty standpoint. Formula rearrangement is a topic many students find challenging, particularly when fractions are involved. The (1/2) in the formula creates an additional layer of complexity because students must recognize that to "undo" multiplying by 1/2, they must multiply by 2 (not divide by 2).

Distractor analysis:
- A: h = (1/2)(bA) -- This is a crude swap. Students who pick this likely have minimal understanding of algebraic rearrangement. They might think "put A where h was."
- C: h = A/(2b) -- This is the key distractor tied to the misconception. The student divides by 2 instead of multiplying by 2. This is a very tempting error because many students see "divided by 2" in the original and think they should keep dividing by 2 when isolating h.
- D: All incorrect -- a safety net for confused students.

Considering the calibration set, formula rearrangement with fractions is a mid-to-upper difficulty topic. The misconception tested is the same as several calibration items. The calibration items range from 0.167 to 0.569 in classical difficulty. This item involves a formula context (applied algebra) plus fraction manipulation, which I think puts it firmly in the 0.40-0.55 range.

I'll note that the triangle diagram adds minimal complexity since students should be very familiar with triangle area. The visual is actually helpful rather than confusing.

For discrimination, the item should discriminate well because option C captures the specific misconception effectively. I estimate a moderate-to-good discrimination parameter.
