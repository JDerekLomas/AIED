Let me analyze this item carefully.

The question asks students to convert the expression 2 ÷ (3 + a × b) into proper algebraic notation (fraction form).

First, let me understand what the correct answer should be:
- The expression is 2 ÷ (3 + a × b)
- Following order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), inside the parentheses: a × b is done first, then +3
- So the denominator is (ab + 3) or equivalently (3 + ab)
- The answer should be 2/(ab + 3) which is option C: 2/(ab+3)

Now let me analyze each distractor:
- A) 2/3 + ab: This would result from ignoring the parentheses entirely and doing operations left to right: 2÷3 first, then treating +a×b separately
- B) 2/(b(a+3)): This suggests doing 3+a first, then multiplying by b - which is left-to-right within the parentheses
- C) 2/(ab+3): CORRECT - multiplication before addition in the denominator
- D) 2/(a×b+3): This is actually mathematically equivalent to C, but uses × symbol instead of juxtaposition. The question asks for "correct algebraic convention" - in algebra, we typically write ab not a×b

Wait, this is interesting. D is mathematically correct but doesn't follow algebraic convention (implicit multiplication). So the question is testing both order of operations AND algebraic notation conventions.

The misconception tested is "Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order" - this would lead students to choose B (doing 3+a first, then ×b).

Comparing to calibration items:
- The calibration item with the same misconception (0.4 - 1/5 × 3) had classical difficulty 0.134 and IRT difficulty -0.245
- This current item seems more complex because it involves algebra and understanding both BIDMAS and algebraic conventions

The question requires:
1. Understanding order of operations
2. Understanding division as fraction notation
3. Understanding algebraic convention (ab vs a×b)

The distractors are quite plausible:
- A targets students who ignore parentheses
- B targets the specific misconception (left-to-right within parentheses)
- D is a trap for students who understand order of operations but don't know algebraic convention

This adds complexity because even students who understand BIDMAS might choose D if they don't realize algebraic convention prefers implicit multiplication.

Let me rate the dimensions:
- Concept complexity: Involves BIDMAS, fraction notation, algebraic conventions - moderate (5)
- Procedural steps: Identify operations, apply BIDMAS, convert to fraction, check convention - about 3-4 steps (4)
- Abstraction level: Working with variables, abstract notation (6)
- Prerequisite knowledge: BIDMAS, fraction notation, algebraic conventions (5)
- Distractor plausibility: All distractors target specific errors, D is particularly tricky (7)
- Misconception strength: Left-to-right is common but the main trap (D) is about convention (6)
- Question clarity: Clear what's being asked (8)
- Cognitive load: Multiple things to track (5)
- Age appropriateness: Suitable for KS3/KS4 (9)
- Transfer distance: Slightly unusual format - converting arithmetic to algebra (5)
- Visual complexity: Multiple fractions to compare (5)
- Solution uniqueness: Need to fully understand to distinguish C from D (7)

For predictions:
- This seems moderately difficult due to the D distractor being mathematically equivalent but notationally incorrect
- Classical difficulty: probably around 0.35-0.45
- IRT difficulty: around 0.2-0.4
- Discrimination: should be reasonable as it tests specific understanding (1.2-1.4)
- Guessing: low, as there's specific reasoning needed (0.1)
