ANSWER: B

My thinking: You have to follow BIDMAS, so you do the division and multiplication first before the addition. $18 \div 2$ is $9$, and $2 \times 2$ is $4$. Then you just add them together ($9 + 4$) to get $13$. I almost just worked from left to right, which would have given me $22$, but I remembered the order of operations!
