ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one looks right because you have to do the times first anyway, so moving the numbers around doesn't change that you do $2 \times 1$ and then add the $3$. 

But for Tom, I don't think you can just swap the numbers like that because the minus is attached to the $1$, and if you move things around it gets confusing. Usually, you have to do it in the order it's written, so $3+2$ is $5$, then take away $1$ is $4$. If you do it his way, $3-1$ is $2$, then plus $2$ is $4$ as well... wait, maybe it is C? No, I'll stick with B because my teacher said you can't just swap plus and minus whenever you want.
