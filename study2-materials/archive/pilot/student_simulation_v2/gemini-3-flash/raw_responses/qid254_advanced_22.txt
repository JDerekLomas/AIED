ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one of the values is 0, it still counts as a member of the data set, so the sum $(0+1+3+4+7)$ must be divided by 5. Option A is correct because adding 0 doesn't change the numerator, and the denominator correctly accounts for all five values. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (only the 7 would be divided by 5), and Option C incorrectly divides by 4.
