ANSWER: B

So, I need to put 0.3 into the formula. $3 \times 0.3$ is 0.9, and then I have to square it because of the little 2. $9 \times 9$ is 81, so I thought it might be A, but then I remembered $3 \times 3$ is 9 and $9 \times 3$ is 27. If you do $0.3 \times 3$ you get 0.9, and $0.9 \times 0.3$ is $0.27$.
