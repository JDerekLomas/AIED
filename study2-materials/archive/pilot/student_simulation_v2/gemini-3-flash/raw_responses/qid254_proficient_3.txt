ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a value in the set, so you have to divide by 5. B is wrong because without brackets you'd only divide the 7 by 5, and C is wrong because it only divides by 4. So A is the right way to do it.
