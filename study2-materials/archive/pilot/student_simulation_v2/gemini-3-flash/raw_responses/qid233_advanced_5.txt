ANSWER: C

**Explanation:** In algebra, we follow the order of operations (BIDMAS). Multiplication comes before addition, so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. The expression inside the bracket is therefore $3 + ab$ (or $ab + 3$). The division sign is replaced by a fraction bar, with 2 as the numerator and the entire expression from the bracket as the denominator. C is the only option that follows the convention of removing the multiplication sign and correctly structuring the fraction.
