ANSWER: B

I did the 4 + 12 first which is 16, then I did the plus in the brackets which is 4. Then I just did 16 divided by 4 which is 4, but that didn't feel right because of the brackets rule. So I tried it the other way: 2 + 2 is 4, then 12 divided by 4 is 3, then 4 + 3 is 7. That's one of the answers so it must be that one.
