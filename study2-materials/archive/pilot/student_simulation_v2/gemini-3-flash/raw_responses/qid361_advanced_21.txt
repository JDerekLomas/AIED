ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the correct order of operations. By putting the addition of 4 inside the brackets before multiplying the entire result by 7, she accurately represents the "finally multiply by 7" step. Paul's expression is incorrect because, according to BIDMAS, the multiplication by 7 would only apply to the division part, leaving the +4 at the end unaffected.
