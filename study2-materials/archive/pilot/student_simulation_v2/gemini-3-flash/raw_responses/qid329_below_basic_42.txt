My teacher said that when you have minus and divide, you just do them in the order they're written from left to right. Katie's one looks better because she's kept the numbers together but just swapped them around, and usually in maths it doesn't matter which way round you put things, like 2+3 is the same as 3+2. Tom's one has brackets and brackets always make things more complicated and confusing.
