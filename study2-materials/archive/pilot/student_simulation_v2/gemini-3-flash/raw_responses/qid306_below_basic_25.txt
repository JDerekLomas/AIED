ANSWER: C

I think it's C because you always just do the numbers in the order they come, so for Problem P you'd usually do the 4-5 bit first, but my teacher said something about BIDMAS and the add comes before the take away, so I picked the 5+6 one. And for Q, you just do 4+5 first because it's the start of the sum.
