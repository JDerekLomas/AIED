ANSWER: A

I remember BIDMAS from school, and the D comes before the S. This means you have to do the divide part first before you do the takeaway. Tom has put brackets around the divide bit to show you do it first, so he's right. Katie has swapped the numbers around, and you can't really do that with subtraction because it changes the answer.
