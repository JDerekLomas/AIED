ANSWER: D

I think it's D because you have to do the bit in the brackets first. 16 minus 6 is 10, then add 4 makes 14. Then you just divide the 14 by 2 which is 7. I tried the others but they didn't seem right, like in A I got 11 because 6 plus 4 is 10, then half of that is 5, and 16 take away 5 is 11.
