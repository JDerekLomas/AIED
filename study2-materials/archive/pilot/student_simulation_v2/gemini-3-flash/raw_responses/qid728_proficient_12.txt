ANSWER: D

I looked at the original BIDMAS order and realized that $16 - 6 + 2$ would give $12$, which is too high. I tried putting the brackets around the whole first section to see what happened: $(16 - 6 + 4)$ gives $14$, and then dividing that by $2$ gives $7$, which works perfectly. I initially glanced at A, but $16 - 5$ is $11$, so that wasn't it.
