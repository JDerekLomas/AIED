ANSWER: C

Both are correct because they are demonstrating the commutative property. In Tom's case, addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS (or BODMAS), so they are processed from left to right. Changing the order to $3 - 1 + 2$ still yields $4$. In Katie's case, multiplication must be done first regardless of the layout ($2 + 3$ or $3 + 2$), and since addition is commutative, the order of the terms doesn't change the result of $5$.
