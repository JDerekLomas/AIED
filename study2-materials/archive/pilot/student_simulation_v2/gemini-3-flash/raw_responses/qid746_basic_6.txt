ANSWER: B

I did the 4 + 12 first because it's at the start, which is 16. Then I added the numbers in the brackets, 2 + 2, which is 4. Then I just did 16 divided by 4, and that gave me 4, but that's D. 

Wait, my teacher said something about doing the brackets first. So 2 + 2 is 4. Then I just did 4 + 12 which is 16, and 16 divided by 4 is still 4. 

Oh, hold on, I remember BIDMAS. Brackets first, then divide. So 12 divided by 4 is 3. Then I have to add the 4 at the front. 4 plus 3 is 7. That's B.
