ANSWER: C

I picked C because you always have to do the plus bits first. In P, I saw the 5 and 6 have a plus between them so you do that, and in Q the 4 and 5 have a plus so you do that first. I know there's a rule called BIDMAS but I can't remember if add or take away comes first, so I just go with the pluses.
