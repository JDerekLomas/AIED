ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the exact order of operations described. By putting the $+ 4$ inside the large brackets, she ensures that the final step (multiplying by $7$) applies to the entire result. Paul is incorrect because his expression only multiplies the division part by $7$, leaving the $+ 4$ at the end, which violates the "finally multiply by $7$" instruction.
