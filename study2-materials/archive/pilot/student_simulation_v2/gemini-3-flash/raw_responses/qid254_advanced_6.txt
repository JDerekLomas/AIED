ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one of the values is 0, it must still be included in the count. There are 5 numbers in the data set (0, 1, 3, 4, and 7). Adding 0 doesn't change the numerator, so $1+3+4+7$ is correct for the sum, and it must be divided by 5.

Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), as only the 7 would be divided by 5. Option C is a common mistake where the 0 is ignored in the count.
