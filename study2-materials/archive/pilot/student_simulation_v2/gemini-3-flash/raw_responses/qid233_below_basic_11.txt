ANSWER: A

I think it's A because I remember my teacher saying that divide means you have to put the first number on top of a fraction line. I saw the 2 and the 3 at the start so I picked the one that had 2 over 3. Plus, the $ab$ at the end looks like the $a \times b$ part because you just take the times sign out in algebra.
