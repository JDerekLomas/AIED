ANSWER: B

I did the 4 + 12 first which is 16, and then I did the brackets 2 + 2 which is 4. Then I just did 16 divided by 4 which is 4, but that didn't seem right because of the order of operations stuff my teacher said. So I tried doing 12 divided by 2 which is 6, plus the other 2 is 8, plus 4 is 12. But actually, if I do the brackets first like you're supposed to, that's 4. Then I did 12 divided by 4 which is 3, and 4 plus 3 is 7. That's one of the answers so it's probably that one.
