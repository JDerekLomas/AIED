ANSWER: C

**Explanation:** In algebra, we follow the order of operations (BIDMAS). We multiply $a$ and $b$ first, writing it as $ab$ without the multiplication sign. This product is then added to $3$, giving the denominator $ab + 3$. The division symbol is replaced by a fraction bar, with $2$ as the numerator. This results in $\frac{2}{ab+3}$.
