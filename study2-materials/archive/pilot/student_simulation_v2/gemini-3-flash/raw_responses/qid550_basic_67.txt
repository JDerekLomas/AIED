ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one is definitely right since 3 + 2 is 5 and then times 1 is 5, and the other side is 2 times 1 which is 2, then plus 3 is 5. But Tom is wrong because you have to do the plus first in BIDMAS, so 3 + 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side he's trying to do 3 takeaway 1 first which is 2, then plus 2 is 4, but you aren't allowed to swap the numbers around like that.
