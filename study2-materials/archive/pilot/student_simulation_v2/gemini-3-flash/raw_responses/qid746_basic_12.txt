ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 first which is 16, then I did the bit in the brackets which is 4. Then I just did 16 divided by 4, so it's 7. Wait, no, 16 divided by 4 is 4. So I'll go with D.

Actually, my teacher said to do the division first. 12 divided by 2 is 6, then plus 4 is 10, then plus 2 is 12. So it must be C.

Wait, I’ll try again. 4 plus 12 is 16. Then 2 plus 2 is 4. 16 divided by 4 is 4.

Actually, I’ll pick B because 12 divided by 4 is 3, and then 4 plus 3 is 7. That sounds right
