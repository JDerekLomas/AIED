I used BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction). Multiplication comes before addition and subtraction in the order of operations, so you have to calculate $8 \times 7$ first before doing the rest of the sum. If you just went from left to right, you'd get it wrong.
