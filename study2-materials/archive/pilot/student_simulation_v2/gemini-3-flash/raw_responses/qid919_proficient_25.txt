ANSWER: B

My thinking: I need to square the $x$ value first and then multiply it by 3. So, $0.3^2$ is $0.09$ (because $3 \times 3 = 9$ and there are two decimal places). Then I just do $3 \times 0.09$, which gives $0.27$. I almost picked D because I thought $0.3^2$ was $0.9$, but then I remembered the decimal rule.
