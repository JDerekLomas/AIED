A) Only Jo

My thinking: Jo’s one looks right because it puts everything inside the big brackets with the 7 on the outside. When you multiply by 7 at the very end, it has to happen to everything that came before it. Paul’s one has the +4 outside the big brackets, so you would only multiply the divide bit by 7 and forget about the 4. Jo's fraction thing is a bit confusing but it keeps the -5 and the 8 together like the question says.
