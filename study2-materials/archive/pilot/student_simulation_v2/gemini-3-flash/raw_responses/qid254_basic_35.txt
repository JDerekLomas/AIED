ANSWER: A

To find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so you have to divide by 5. You don't need to put the 0 on top because adding 0 doesn't change the total, but you still have to count it as one of the numbers. B is wrong because you'd have to do the division before the adding.
