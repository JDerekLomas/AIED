B

I think it's B because Paul's one looks more like the normal way you write a divide sign, and the +4 is at the end of the sentence so it should be at the end of the sum like he wrote it. Jo's one has a big fraction which looks too complicated and I think the 7 is supposed to be times the whole thing but Paul's one just makes more sense when you read it across.
