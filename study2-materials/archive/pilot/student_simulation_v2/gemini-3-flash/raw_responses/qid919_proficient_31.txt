ANSWER: B

My thinking: I need to square the $x$ value first because of BIDMAS. So, $0.3^2$ is $0.09$ (since $3 \times 3 = 9$ and I need two decimal places). Then I just multiply that by 3, which gives $0.27$. I almost went for D because I thought $0.3^2$ might be $0.9$, but then I remembered the decimal place rule.
