ANSWER: A

I remember BIDMAS from school, so you have to do the divide part before the takeaway. Tom has put brackets around the divide bit which means you do it first anyway, so it's the same thing. Katie has swapped the numbers around, and you can't do that with subtraction because you'd get a different answer.
