B

My thinking: For Problem Q, you have to follow BIDMAS, so multiplication comes before addition, meaning you do $5 \times 6$ first. For Problem P, since addition and subtraction have the same priority, you just work from left to right, so you do $4 - 5$ first. I nearly went for D because I saw the plus sign in P, but then I remembered the left-to-right rule.
