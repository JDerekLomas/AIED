My thinking: For Problem Q, you have to follow BIDMAS, so multiplication definitely comes before addition, meaning you do $5 \times 6$ first. For Problem P, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work from left to right. That means you do $4 - 5$ first. I know some people think you have to do addition first because 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS, but my teacher said you just go in order when it's just plus and minus.
