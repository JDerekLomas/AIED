ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 which is 16, then I divided it by the first 2 I saw to get 8, then I took away the other 2 because it's in brackets and that gave me 6, but 7 is the closest one to that so I picked B. Also, 12 divided by 4 is 3 and 4 plus 3 is 7, but I can never remember if you do the plus or the divide first.
