ANSWER: B

I did the plus bits first because I'm better at adding up. 4 plus 12 is 16, and 2 plus 2 is 4. Then I just did 16 divided by 4, which is 4. Oh wait, I see 7 is an option, so maybe I should have done 12 divided by 4 first? 12 divided by 4 is 3, and then 4 plus 3 is 7. That sounds more like the BODMAS thing we did in class.
