ANSWER: A

My thinking: Tom is correct because of BIDMAS/BODMAS. Division has a higher priority than subtraction, so you have to calculate $0.2 \div 0.3$ first before subtracting it from $0.1$. Putting brackets around the division just makes that order explicit, which is what Tom did. Katie is wrong because she changed the order of the terms, and subtraction isn't commutative ($a - b$ isn't the same as $b - a$).
