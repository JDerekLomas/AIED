ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one of the values is 0, it still counts as a data point, so there are 5 numbers in total. Adding 0 doesn't change the numerator, so $1+3+4+7$ is the correct sum, and dividing by 5 gives the correct mean. B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), and C incorrectly divides by 4.
