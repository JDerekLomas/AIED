ANSWER: D

I think it's D because the numbers are in the wrong order. My teacher says you have to do the sums in the order they are written, so if you swap the numbers around like Tom and Katie did, it's not the same anymore. Plus, Katie's one has a times sign and a plus sign, and BIDMAS is really confusing but I know you're not allowed to just move the numbers wherever you want.
