ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one is definitely right since you have to do the times first because of BIDMAS, and she's just swapped them around. But Tom's one looks wrong because you're supposed to do the sum in the order it's written, and if you move the take away 1 to the middle, it changes the sum.
