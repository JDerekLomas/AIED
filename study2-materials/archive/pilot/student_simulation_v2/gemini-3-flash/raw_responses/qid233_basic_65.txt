ANSWER: C

My thinking: I know that in algebra you don't really use the divide sign, you use a fraction line instead. So the 2 goes on the top and the rest goes on the bottom. Also, my teacher said you shouldn't use the times sign between letters, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. I wasn't sure if the 3 or the $ab$ comes first, but C looks the most like a proper algebra answer.
