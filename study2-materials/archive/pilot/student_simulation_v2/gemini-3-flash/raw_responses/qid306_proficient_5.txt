My thinking: For Problem Q, you definitely have to do the multiplication first because of BIDMAS/BODMAS. For Problem P, since addition and subtraction have the same priority, you just work from left to right, so you do 4 - 5 first. I know some people think addition comes before subtraction because the 'A' is before the 'S' in BIDMAS, but my teacher said you just go in order of how they appear!
