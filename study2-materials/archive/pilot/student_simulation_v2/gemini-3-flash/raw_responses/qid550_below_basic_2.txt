ANSWER: D

I think it's D because you aren't allowed to just swap the numbers around like that in maths. My teacher said the order matters because of BIDMAS, and since Tom moved the minus sign and the 1, it changes the sum. Katie swapped the 3 and the 2 around as well, and you usually have to do the plus last, so moving it to the end feels wrong. They both look like they're breaking the rules.
