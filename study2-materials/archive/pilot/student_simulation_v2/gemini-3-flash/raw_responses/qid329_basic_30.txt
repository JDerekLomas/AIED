ANSWER: A

I think it's Tom because of BIDMAS. You have to do the divide part first even if it's at the end of the sum, so putting the brackets around it like Tom did shows that's the bit you do first. Katie just swapped the numbers around, and you can't really do that with take-away because it changes the answer.
