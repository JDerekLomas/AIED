ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 first which is 16, and then I did the brackets 2 plus 2 which is 4. Then I just did 16 divided by 4, and that equals 4. Wait, I think I did that wrong because my teacher said you have to do the divide before the plus, so 12 divided by 4 is 3, and then 4 plus 3 is 7. So it's B.
