ANSWER: C

Both of them are right because you can just move the numbers around as long as you keep the symbols with them. For Tom, 3 + 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side, 3 - 1 is 2, plus 2 is 4, so they match. Katie is just doing 3 + 2 which is 5, then times 1 is 5. On her other bit, 2 times 1 is 2, plus 3 is 5. So they both get the same answers.
