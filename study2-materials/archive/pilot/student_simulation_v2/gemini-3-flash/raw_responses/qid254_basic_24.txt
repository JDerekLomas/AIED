ANSWER: A

My teacher said that to find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so you have to divide by 5. C is wrong because it divides by 4. I thought it might be B, but if you type that into a calculator it only divides the 7 by 5, not the whole thing. A is right because you add the numbers (the zero doesn't change the sum anyway) and divide by the 5 numbers.
