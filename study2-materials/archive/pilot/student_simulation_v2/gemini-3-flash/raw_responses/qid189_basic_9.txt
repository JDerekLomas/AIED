ANSWER: C

I think it's C because the question says $n$ is 15, so I did $1 - 3$ which is $-2$, and then I multiplied that by 15. $2 \times 15$ is 30, so it must be $-30$, but that wasn't an option for the steps I did, so I just took the $1$ and the $3$ and the $15$ and tried to take them away. $15 - 1$ is 14, so $-14$ looks right.
