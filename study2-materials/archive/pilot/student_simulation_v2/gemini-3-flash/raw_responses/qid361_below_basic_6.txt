I think it's Paul because his one looks more like the actual steps in the question. Jo's one has that big line like a fraction and I don't really get how fractions work with normal take-away sums. Paul put the "plus 4" at the end which is the last thing you do before the times 7, so it just looks right. Plus, I remember my teacher saying you always do the bit in the brackets first.
