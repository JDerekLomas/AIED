ANSWER: C

I think it's C because they are both just swapping the numbers around and it doesn't change the answer. 

For Tom, 3 + 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side, 3 minus 1 is 2, then plus 2 is also 4. 

For Katie, it's the same thing. 2 times 1 is 2, then add 3 is 5. Even if you swap it, you still do the times bit first because of BIDMAS, so 2 times 1 is 2, plus 3 is 5 again. So they are both right.
