ANSWER: B

My thinking: Since the equation is $y = 3x^2$, I need to square the $x$ value first and then multiply by 3. $0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.09$, and then $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. I almost went for $0.81$ because I thought about squaring $(3 \times 0.3)$, but BIDMAS says I have to do the power before the multiplication.
