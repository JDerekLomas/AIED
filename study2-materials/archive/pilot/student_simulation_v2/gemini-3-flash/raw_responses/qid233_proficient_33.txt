ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $3 + ab$ is inside the brackets, the division line (the vinculum) has to go under the $2$ and over the whole expression $ab + 3$. D is wrong because it still has the multiplication sign, and A is wrong because it looks like you're only dividing the $2$ by $3$.
