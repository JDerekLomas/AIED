ANSWER: A

I picked A because in the first one you just do it in the order it's written, so 4 take away 5. And for the second one, I always just go from left to right as well, so you'd do the 4 plus 5 first before doing the times bit. My teacher said something about BIDMAS but I can't remember if plus or times comes first, so I just do it in order.
