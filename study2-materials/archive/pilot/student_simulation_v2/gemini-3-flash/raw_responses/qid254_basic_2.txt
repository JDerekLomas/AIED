ANSWER: A

My teacher said that to find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so you have to divide by 5. You don't really need to add the 0 because it doesn't change the total, but you still have to count it as one of the numbers, so that's why it's A. I didn't pick B because if you put that in a calculator it only divides the 7 by 5.
