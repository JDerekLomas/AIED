ANSWER: A

I think it's Jo because she used the brackets correctly to show that the whole part inside (including the +4) gets multiplied by 7 at the end. Paul’s version looks a bit wrong because the +4 is outside the main brackets, so you'd only be multiplying the division part by 7 and then adding 4 last, which isn't what the question says to do.
