ANSWER: B

I think it's B because you just go across the line. 4 plus 12 is 16, then you divide that by 2 which is 8, and then add the other 2 to get 10... wait, I did it again and got 7 because I remembered my teacher saying something about the brackets first. 2 plus 2 is 4, then 4 plus 12 is 16, and 16 divided by 4 is 4? No, that's not right. I'll just go with 7 because 12 divided by 2 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 1... I don't know, 7 just looks like the right sort of answer for these ones.
