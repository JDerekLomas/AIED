ANSWER: C

**Explanation:** In algebra, we write $a \times b$ as $ab$ and use a fraction bar instead of the division sign. The brackets mean that the entire $(3+ab)$ part is the denominator. I almost chose A because it looked simpler, but then I realized the 2 has to be divided by the *whole* expression, not just the 3. C is the neatest way to write it.
