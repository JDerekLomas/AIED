ANSWER: B

I did the 4 + 12 first which is 16, and then I did the plus in the brackets which is 4. So it's just 16 divided by 4 which is 4. Wait, no, my teacher said you have to do the divide before the plus. So 12 divided by 2 is 6, then 6 plus 2 is 8, and 4 plus 8 is 12. But the brackets are there, so I'll do 4 plus 12 is 16 and then 16 divided by 2 is 8, plus 2 is 10. Actually, if I just do it in order it's 16 divided by 4 which is 4. But 7 looks like it could be right if I do 12 divided by 4 is 3, and then add the 4
