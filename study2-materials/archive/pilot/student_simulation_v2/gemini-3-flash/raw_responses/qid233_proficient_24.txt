ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we should use a fraction bar for division and remove the multiplication signs between letters. In the brackets, \(a \times b\) becomes \(ab\), and because it's being divided into 2, the whole \((3 + ab)\) should go on the bottom of the fraction. C is the only one that does both correctly; D still has the multiplication sign, and A looks like the division only applies to the 3.
