ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression correctly follows the order of operations described. By putting the entire expression `((n-5)/8 + 4)` inside the brackets, she ensures that the final step (multiplying by 7) applies to the result of everything that came before. 

Paul is incorrect because, according to BIDMAS/BODMAS, his expression would mean you multiply by 7 *before* adding 4. For his to be correct, he would need an extra set of outer brackets around the addition.
