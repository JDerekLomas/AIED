A) Only Jo

I think it's Jo because the question says the very last thing you do is multiply by 7. In Jo's one, the 7 is outside the big brackets, so it multiplies everything inside. But in Paul's one, the +4 is just stuck on the end outside the brackets, so you'd only multiply the middle bit by 7 and then add 4 last, which is the wrong way round.
