ANSWER: A

My thinking is that BIDMAS (or BODMAS) says you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom's version uses brackets to show exactly that—doing the $0.2 \div 0.3$ first and then subtracting it from $0.1$. Katie's version has changed the order of the numbers around the subtraction sign, and since subtraction isn't commutative, her expression would give a different (positive) result. So, Tom is right about how the operations are grouped.
