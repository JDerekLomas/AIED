Both Tom and Katie are correct because they are demonstrating the commutative property of addition. 

Tom's statement holds because addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS/order of operations; treating the expression as $3 + 2 + (-1)$ allows the terms to be reordered. Katie's statement is also correct because multiplication is performed before addition in both cases ($3+2$ vs $2+3$), and addition itself is commutative.
