**Explanation:**
According to the BIDMAS/BODMAS rules, division must be performed before subtraction. Tom’s statement correctly identifies that the division $(0.2 \div 0.3)$ is an isolated term that is subtracted from $0.1$. Katie is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative; $a - b$ is not the same as $b - a$. Therefore, only Tom is correct.
