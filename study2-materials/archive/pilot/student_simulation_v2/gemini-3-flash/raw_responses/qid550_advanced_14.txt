ANSWER: C

Both are correct because of the properties of operations. Tom is correct because addition and subtraction have the same priority and are associative/commutative when you treat the minus sign as adding a negative number ($3 + 2 + (-1) = 3 + (-1) + 2$). Katie is correct because the commutative property of addition allows you to swap the terms $3$ and $(2 \times 1)$ without changing the result.
