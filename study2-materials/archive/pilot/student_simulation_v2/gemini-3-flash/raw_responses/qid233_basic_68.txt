ANSWER: C

My thinking: I know that in algebra, you don't really use the 'divide' sign, you usually make it into a fraction with a line. And when you have letters like $a \times b$, you just squash them together to make $ab$. The brackets mean the whole $3+ab$ bit has to be on the bottom together, so it must be C. A looks wrong because the 2 is only over the 3, and D still has the times sign in it which my teacher says we shouldn't use anymore.
