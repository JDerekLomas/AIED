ANSWER: A

My thinking is that to find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so I need to divide by 5. Even though the first number is a 0, it still counts as one of the numbers. I didn't pick B because my teacher said if you don't use a fraction bar or brackets, the division only happens to the last number.
