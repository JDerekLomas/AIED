ANSWER: A

My thinking: According to BIDMAS, you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom's equation is correct because putting brackets around the $(0.2 \div 0.3)$ doesn't change anything; it just highlights that the division happens first. Katie is wrong because she swapped the order of the subtraction around, which would give a different result (one would be negative and the other positive).
