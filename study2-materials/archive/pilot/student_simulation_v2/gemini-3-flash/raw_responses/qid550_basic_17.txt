ANSWER: C

I think they're both right because for Tom, it doesn't matter what order you do the plus and minus in, 3 plus 2 is 5 then take away 1 is 4, and 3 take away 1 is 2 then plus 2 is also 4. And for Katie, the times bit is the same both ways and then you just add the 3, so it's just swapping the order of the sum.
