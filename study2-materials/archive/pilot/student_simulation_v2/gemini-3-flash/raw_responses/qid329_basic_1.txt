A) Only Tom

My teacher said we have to use BIDMAS, and the D comes before the S. That means you have to do the divide part before the take away part. Tom put brackets around the divide to show you do it first, so that makes sense. Katie just swapped the numbers around, but you can't really do that with subtraction because it changes the answer.
