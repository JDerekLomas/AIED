A

The answer is A because of BIDMAS. We always do the division before the subtraction, so Tom is right to put the brackets around the $0.2 \div 0.3$ part to show that it happens first. Katie is wrong because you can't just swap the order of the numbers in subtraction (it isn't commutative), so $0.1$ minus the result isn't the same as the result minus $0.1$.
