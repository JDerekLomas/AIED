ANSWER: A

I think it's A because I remember that divide signs usually turn into those fraction lines, and the 2 is at the start so it goes on top. The $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$ because you're meant to take the times sign out when you do algebra. I wasn't sure what to do with the plus 3, so I just put it at the end.
