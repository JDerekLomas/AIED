ANSWER: B

So I need to do $3$ times $0.3$ and then square it. $3$ times $0.3$ is $0.9$, and then $0.9$ times $0.9$ is $0.81$, but that's not right because the squared is only on the $x$. If I do $0.3$ times $3$ it's $0.9$, and then $0.9$ times $3$ is $2.7$, but there's a decimal so it must be $0.27$.
