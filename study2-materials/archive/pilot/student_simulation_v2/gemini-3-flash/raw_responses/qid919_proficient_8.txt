ANSWER: B

My thinking: I need to square the $x$ value first because of BIDMAS. So, $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$. Then I multiply that by 3, and $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. At first I almost picked D because I thought $3 \times 3^2$ is 27, but then I remembered the decimal point needs to move two places since it's $0.3$ squared.
