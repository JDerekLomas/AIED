I used BODMAS for this one. You have to do the brackets first, so $2 + 2 = 4$. Then you do the division before the addition, so $12 \div 4 = 3$. Finally, $4 + 3 = 7$. 

(I almost did $4 + 12$ first because it's at the start, which would have given me $16 \div 4 = 4$, but I remembered the order of operations just in time!)
