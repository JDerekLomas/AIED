ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as one of the values in the set, so you have to divide by 5. Option A is correct because adding 0 doesn't change the top number, but it keeps the correct total of 5 numbers. I almost picked B, but then I remembered that without brackets, you'd only divide the 7 by 5 because of BIDMAS.
