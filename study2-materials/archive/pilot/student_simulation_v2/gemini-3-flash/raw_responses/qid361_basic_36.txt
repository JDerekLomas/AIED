A) Only Jo

My thinking: You have to do the +4 bit before you multiply the whole thing by 7. In Jo’s one, the 7 is outside the big brackets so it multiplies everything inside. In Paul’s one, the 4 is just stuck on the end, so I think you'd only multiply the middle bit by 7 and then add 4 at the very end, which is wrong.
