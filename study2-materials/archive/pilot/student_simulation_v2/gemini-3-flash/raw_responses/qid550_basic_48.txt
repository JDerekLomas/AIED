ANSWER: C

I think it's C because they are both right. For Tom, 3 plus 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side, 3 take away 1 is 2, plus 2 is 4, so that's the same. For Katie, you have to do the times first because of BIDMAS. 2 times 1 is 2, then add 3 is 5. It's the same numbers just swapped around, so it must be both.
