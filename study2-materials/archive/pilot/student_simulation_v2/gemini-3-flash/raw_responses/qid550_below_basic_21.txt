ANSWER: B

I think it's B because in maths you have to do the times tables first because of BIDMAS. Katie has the times bit in both of hers so that's probably right. Tom's one looks wrong because he moved the numbers around and you can't just swap a take-away and a plus like that, it changes the sum.
