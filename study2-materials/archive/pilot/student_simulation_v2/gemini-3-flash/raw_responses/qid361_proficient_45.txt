ANSWER: A

My thinking is that Jo has followed the order of operations correctly. You start with $n-5$, divide that whole bit by 8, then add 4, and finally the brackets show that the *entire* result is multiplied by 7. Paul's version is wrong because he only multiplies the first part by 7; his $+4$ is outside the final brackets, so he wouldn't be multiplying the 4 by 7 at the end like the question says to do.
