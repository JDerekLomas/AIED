ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the order of operations perfectly. You subtract 5 first $(n-5)$, divide that whole bit by 8, add 4 to the result, and then the big brackets mean the final multiplication by 7 applies to everything. Paul's version is wrong because he didn't put the $+4$ inside the brackets, so according to BIDMAS, you'd multiply by 7 before adding the 4, which isn't what the question says to do.
