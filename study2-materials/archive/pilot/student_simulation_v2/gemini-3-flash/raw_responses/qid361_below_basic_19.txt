ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one has the divide sign and the question says to divide. Jo's one just looks like a fraction and I don't really like fractions, they're confusing. Also, you have to add 4 at the end and Paul put +4 at the end of his line, but Jo put it inside the brackets which looks wrong.
