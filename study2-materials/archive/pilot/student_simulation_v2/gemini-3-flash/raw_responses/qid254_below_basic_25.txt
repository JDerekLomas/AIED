ANSWER: C

I think it's C because you have to add up the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are four numbers (1, 3, 4, and 7) and the 0 doesn't really count as a number when you're adding, so you divide by 4. A looks wrong because it has a 5 at the bottom but only four numbers on top.
