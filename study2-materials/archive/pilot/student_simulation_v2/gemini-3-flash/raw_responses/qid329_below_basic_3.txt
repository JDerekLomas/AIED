B

I think it's B because when you have a minus sign and a divide sign, you're supposed to just do the sum from left to right. Katie swapped the numbers around but she kept the divide bit, and it looks more like a proper sum when you put the bigger numbers first. Tom's one has brackets and those always make the answer different, so I don't think his can be right.
