ANSWER: A

I think it's A because of BIDMAS. You have to do the divide part before the take away, so the brackets in Tom's one show that you do the $0.2 \div 0.3$ first, which is what the rule says. Katie's one is wrong because she swapped the numbers around and you can't just move the $0.1$ to the end.
