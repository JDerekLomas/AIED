A

**Explanation:**
According to the standard order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), division must be performed before subtraction. Tom is correct because he has used brackets to show that the division part ($0.2 \div 0.3$) is grouped together and subtracted from $0.1$, which is exactly how the original expression is evaluated. Katie is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative; $a - b$ is not the same as $b - a$.
