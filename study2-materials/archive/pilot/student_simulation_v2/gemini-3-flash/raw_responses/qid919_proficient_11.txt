ANSWER: B

My thinking was to just plug 0.3 into the formula $y = 3x^2$. First, I did $0.3^2$, which is $0.09$ (since $3 \times 3 = 9$ and there are two decimal places). Then I multiplied $0.09$ by $3$ to get $0.27$. I almost picked D because I briefly thought $0.3^2$ was $0.9$, but then I remembered the decimal point rule.
