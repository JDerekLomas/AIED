Both Tom and Katie are correct because they are demonstrating the commutative property of addition.

In Tom's case, addition and subtraction have the same priority in the order of operations (BIDMAS), so they are worked from left to right. However, if you treat the subtraction as adding a negative number, $3 + 2 + (-1)$ is the same as $3 + (-1) + 2$. Both expressions equal 4.

In Katie's case, multiplication must be done before addition. In both of her expressions, you must calculate $2 \times 1$ first. This results in $3 + 2$ and $2 + 3$ respectively, which both equal 5.
