ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the order of operations described in the word problem. The large brackets ensure that the final step (multiplying by 7) applies to the entire result of the previous steps, including the addition of 4. Paul’s expression is incorrect because, without outer brackets, the multiplication by 7 would only apply to the division part, leaving the +4 on its own at the end.
