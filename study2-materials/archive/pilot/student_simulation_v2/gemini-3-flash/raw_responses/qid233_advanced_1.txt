ANSWER: C

**Explanation:** In algebra, we follow the order of operations (BIDMAS). We first simplify the term inside the brackets: $a \times b$ is written as $ab$, and then we add the 3. The division symbol $\div$ is replaced by a fraction bar, with the 2 as the numerator and the entire expression $(ab + 3)$ as the denominator. This gives us $\frac{2}{ab+3}$. Choice D is incorrect because it still uses the $\times$ symbol, which isn't the standard algebraic convention.
