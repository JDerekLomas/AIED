ANSWER: B

So, I need to put the 0.3 where the $x$ is. I did $3 \times 0.3$ first which is 0.9, and then I have to square it. $9 \times 9$ is 81, but because it's decimals it must be smaller, so I thought it was A, but then I remembered the squared is only for the $x$. So I did $0.3 \times 0.3$ which is 0.09, and then $3 \times 9$ is 27. I'm not sure where the point goes but 0.27 looks the most right.
