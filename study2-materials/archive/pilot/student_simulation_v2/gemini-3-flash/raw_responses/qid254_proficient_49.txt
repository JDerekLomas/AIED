ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a piece of data, so there are 5 numbers in total. Adding the 0 doesn't change the top of the fraction, so $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ is correct. B is wrong because of BIDMAS (it would only divide the 7 by 5), and C is wrong because it divides by 4 instead of 5.
