A) Only Jo

My thinking: You have to follow the order of the steps. Jo put the brackets around the whole thing before multiplying by 7, which makes sense because the "multiply by 7" part is the very last thing you do. Paul's one looks wrong because the +4 is outside the big brackets, so you wouldn't multiply it by the 7.
