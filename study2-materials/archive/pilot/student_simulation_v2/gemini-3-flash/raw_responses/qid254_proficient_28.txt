ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a value in the set, so there are 5 numbers in total. Adding 0 doesn't change the top of the fraction, so $(1+3+4+7)$ is the same as $(0+1+3+4+7)$, and then you divide by 5. B is wrong because of BIDMAS (it would only divide the 7 by 5), and C is a classic trick where you forget to count the zero.
