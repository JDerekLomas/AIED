ANSWER: C

Algebraic convention requires us to remove the multiplication symbol between variables ($ab$ instead of $a \times b$) and write divisions as fractions. Since the entire expression $(3 + ab)$ is inside the brackets and follows the division sign, it must become the denominator of the fraction. Therefore, $2 \div (3 + ab)$ is written as $\frac{2}{3 + ab}$, which is equivalent to $\frac{2}{ab + 3}$.
