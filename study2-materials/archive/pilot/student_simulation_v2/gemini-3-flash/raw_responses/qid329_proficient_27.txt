ANSWER: A

My thinking is that BIDMAS (or BODMAS) says you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom's version just puts brackets around the division part, which doesn't change the order of the calculation, so he's definitely right. Katie has swapped the order of the subtraction around, and since subtraction isn't commutative, her version would give a different (positive) result.
