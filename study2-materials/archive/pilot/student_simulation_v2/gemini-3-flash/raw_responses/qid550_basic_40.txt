ANSWER: C

I think they are both right because you just have to do the same numbers. For Tom, 3 + 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side, 3 - 1 is 2, then add 2 is also 4, so that's the same. For Katie, you have to do the times first because of BIDMAS. 2 x 1 is 2, then add 3 is 5. It doesn't matter which way round you write it, the 2 x 1 is still 2, so they both get 5. They are both correct.
