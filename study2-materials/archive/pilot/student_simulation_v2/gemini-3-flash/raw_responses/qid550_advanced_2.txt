ANSWER: C

Both are correct because they are demonstrating the **commutative property** of addition. In Tom's case, addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS/BODMAS, so $3 + 2 - 1$ is the same as $3 - 1 + 2$ (both equal 4). In Katie's case, while the multiplication must be done first ($2 \times 1 = 2$), the addition can be written in any order ($3 + 2$ or $2 + 3$), both resulting in 5.
