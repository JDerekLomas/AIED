ANSWER: C

Both are correct because of the properties of addition and multiplication. Tom is correct because addition and subtraction have the same priority in the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), so $3+2-1=4$ and $3-1+2=4$. Katie is correct because of the commutative property of addition; in both cases, you perform the multiplication first ($2 \times 1 = 2$) and then add the $3$, resulting in $5$ both times.
