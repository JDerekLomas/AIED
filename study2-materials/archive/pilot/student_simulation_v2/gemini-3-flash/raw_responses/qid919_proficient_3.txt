ANSWER: B

My thinking: I need to square the $x$ value first because of BIDMAS. So, $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$. Then I just multiply that by 3, and $3 \times 0.09$ is $0.27$. You have to be careful with the decimal places; I almost picked D because I thought of $3 \times 9$, but $0.09$ means the answer needs two decimal places.
