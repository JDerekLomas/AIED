ANSWER: B

So, I need to put the 0.3 where the $x$ is. I did $3 \times 0.3$ first which is 0.9, and then I have to square it. $9 \times 9$ is 81, so I thought it might be A, but then I remembered the 3 is at the front. If I do $0.3 \times 0.3$ that’s $0.09$, and then $3 \times 9$ is 27, so it must be 0.27.
