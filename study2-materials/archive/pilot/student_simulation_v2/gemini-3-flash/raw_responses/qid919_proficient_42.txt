ANSWER: B

My thinking: Since the equation is $y = 3x^2$ and $x = 0.3$, I need to square the $x$ first. $0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.09$. Then I multiply that by 3, and $3 \times 0.09$ is $0.27$. At first I almost picked D because I thought of $3 \times 3^2$ being 27, but the decimal point needs to move two places because of the squaring.
