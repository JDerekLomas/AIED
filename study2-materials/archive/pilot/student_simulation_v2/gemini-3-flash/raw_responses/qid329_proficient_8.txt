ANSWER: A

My thinking is that BIDMAS (or BODMAS) says you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom's version just puts brackets around the division, which doesn't actually change the order of the calculation, so his identity is correct. Katie has swapped the order of the subtraction around, and since subtraction isn't commutative (like $5-2$ isn't the same as $2-5$), her version would give a different answer.
