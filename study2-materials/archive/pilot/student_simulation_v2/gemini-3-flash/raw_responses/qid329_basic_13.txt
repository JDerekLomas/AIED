ANSWER: A

I remember BIDMAS from school, which says you have to do division before subtraction. Tom put the brackets around the division part, which is what you'd do first anyway, so his looks right. Katie's one is wrong because she swapped the order of the numbers around, and you can't just do that with a minus sign.
