**Explanation:** Both are correct because they are applying the commutative property. In Tom's case, addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS/order of operations, so $3 + 2 - 1$ and $3 - 1 + 2$ both equal $4$. In Katie's case, the multiplication must be done first regardless of the written order, so both sides equal $5$.
