**Explanation:**
Tom is correct because of BIDMAS/BODMAS rules. Division has a higher priority than subtraction, so you have to calculate $0.2 \div 0.3$ first. Putting brackets around that part of the expression doesn't change the value; it just makes the order of operations explicit. Katie is wrong because subtraction isn't commutative—you can't just swap the order of the terms around the minus sign like that.
