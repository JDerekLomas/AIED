ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one looks right since you have to do the times first in BIDMAS, so 2 times 1 is 2, then add 3. But Tom is wrong because you can't just swap the numbers around like that when there's a minus; you have to do it in the order it's written, and 5 minus 1 isn't the same as 3 minus 3.
