ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 which is 16, then I divided that by 2 which is 8, and then I took away the other 2 because it's in brackets and that gave me 6, but 7 is the closest one to that so I picked B. Also, I remember my teacher saying something about dividing and 12 divided by 2 is 6, so 7 just looked like the right sort of answer.
