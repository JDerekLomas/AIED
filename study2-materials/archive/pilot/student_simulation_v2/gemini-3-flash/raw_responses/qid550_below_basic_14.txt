ANSWER: D

I think it's D because you aren't allowed to just swap the numbers around like that. My teacher said you always have to do it in the exact order it's written, like BIDMAS, so if you move the 3 or the 1 to a different place it changes the whole sum and makes it wrong. They both look like they are cheating by moving the bits they like to the front.
