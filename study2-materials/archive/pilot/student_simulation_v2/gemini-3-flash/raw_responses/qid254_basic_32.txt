ANSWER: A

My teacher said the mean is when you add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so I have to divide by 5. C is wrong because it divides by 4, and B looks wrong because you have to do the adding first before the dividing. Even though the 0 isn't in the plus bit for A, adding 0 doesn't change the total anyway, so it should still work.
