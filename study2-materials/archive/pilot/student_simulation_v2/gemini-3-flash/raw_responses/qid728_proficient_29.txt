ANSWER: D

I followed BIDMAS. First, I looked at what was inside the brackets: $16 - 6 + 4 = 14$. Then I divided that by $2$, which gives $7$. A and B give different answers ($11$ and $12$), and C is just the same as the original calculation without brackets because you'd do the division first anyway.
