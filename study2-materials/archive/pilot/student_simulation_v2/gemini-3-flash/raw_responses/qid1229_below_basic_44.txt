ANSWER: C

Well, I know that 6 times 2 is 12, but it's got that little 2 at the top so that means you have to times it by itself. So 6 times 6 is 36. Since there is a minus sign there, I remember my teacher saying that two minuses make a plus, so the minus just disappears and it becomes a normal 36.
