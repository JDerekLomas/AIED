A) Only Jo

My thinking: Jo’s one looks right because it has the big brackets around everything before you multiply by 7. Paul’s one has the +4 at the very end outside the brackets, so you would do the times 7 before you add the 4, but the question says you add 4 first and "finally" multiply by 7. Also, the fraction line means divide, so Jo's bit in the middle is correct.
