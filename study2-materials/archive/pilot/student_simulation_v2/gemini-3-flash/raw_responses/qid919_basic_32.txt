ANSWER: B

So I need to do $3$ times $0.3$ and then square it. $3$ times $0.3$ is $0.9$, and then $0.9$ times $0.9$ is $0.81$, but wait, the $3$ is at the front so maybe I do $0.3$ times $3$ which is $0.9$ and then times it by $0.3$ again? I'll go with B because $3$ times $3$ is $9$ and $9$ times $3$ is $27$, and there's a decimal point.
