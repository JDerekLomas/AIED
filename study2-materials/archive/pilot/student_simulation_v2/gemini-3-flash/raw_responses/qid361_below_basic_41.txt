ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one looks more like the instructions. Jo's one has that line like a fraction and I don't really like fractions, they're confusing. Paul used the divide sign which is what the question said to do. Also, the 4 is at the end of Paul's one and the last thing it says to do is add 4 before you times it, so that makes more sense to me.
