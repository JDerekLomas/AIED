A) Only Jo

My thinking: Jo’s one looks right because the big bracket goes around everything before the times 7 at the end. In the question, you have to add 4 and *then* multiply by 7. Paul’s one has the 4 outside the brackets, so you would only be multiplying the middle bit by 7 and then adding 4 last, which is the wrong order. Jo's fraction thing is just a fancy way of saying divide, so that bit's okay.
