B

I think it's B because Katie just swapped the numbers around, and usually in maths you can do things in any order. Tom put brackets in and that always makes things more complicated and changes the answer, so he's probably wrong. Plus, 0.1 is smaller than 0.2 so you have to put the bigger number first like Katie did.
