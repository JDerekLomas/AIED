ANSWER: B

I used BIDMAS for this one. You have to do the division and the multiplication before the addition. So, $18 \div 2$ is $9$, and $2 \times 2$ is $4$. Then you just add them together: $9 + 4 = 13$. If you just went from left to right without thinking about the order of operations, you'd probably get a different answer, but BIDMAS says division and multiplication come first.
