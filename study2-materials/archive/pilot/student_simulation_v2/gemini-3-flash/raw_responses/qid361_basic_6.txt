A) Only Jo

My thinking: You have to do the brackets first. Jo's one has the big brackets around the adding 4, so you do the whole middle bit and then multiply everything by 7 at the end, which is what the question says. Paul's one doesn't have the 4 inside the brackets, so you'd only multiply the dividing bit by 7 and then add 4 last, which is the wrong order.
