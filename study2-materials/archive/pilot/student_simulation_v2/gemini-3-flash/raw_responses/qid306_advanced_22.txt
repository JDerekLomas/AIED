ANSWER: B

**Explanation:**
For Problem P, addition and subtraction have equal priority in the order of operations (BIDMAS), so we work from left to right, meaning $4 - 5$ is done first. For Problem Q, multiplication has a higher priority than addition, so $5 \times 6$ must be calculated before the addition.
