ANSWER: D

I think it's D because the numbers are in the wrong order. My teacher says you have to do BIDMAS, and if you move the numbers around it changes the sum. In the first one, Tom moved the 1 and the 2, so that must be wrong. And Katie swapped the 3 and the 1, so that's probably wrong too. You aren't allowed to just swap things about like that.
