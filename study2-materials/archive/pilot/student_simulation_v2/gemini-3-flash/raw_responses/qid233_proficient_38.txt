ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $(3 + ab)$ is all inside the brackets after the division sign, it has to go on the bottom of the fraction. I just swapped $3 + ab$ to $ab + 3$ because it looks neater that way, and C is the only one that gets rid of the multiplication sign properly. D still has the '$\times$' in it, which isn't standard.
