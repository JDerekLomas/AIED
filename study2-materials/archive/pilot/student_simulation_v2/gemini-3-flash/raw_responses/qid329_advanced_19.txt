A

**Explanation:**
According to the standard order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), division must be performed before subtraction. Tom’s statement correctly represents this by placing the division in brackets, showing it is calculated first. Katie’s statement is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative; $a - b$ is not the same as $b - a$. The original expression results in a negative value ($0.1 - 0.6\dot{6}$), whereas Katie's rearrangement would result in a positive value.
