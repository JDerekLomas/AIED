B

My thinking: For Problem Q, you have to do the multiplication first because of BIDMAS/BODMAS rules (Multiply before Add). For Problem P, since addition and subtraction have the same priority, you just work from left to right, so you do $4 - 5$ first. I nearly went for D because I saw the plus sign in P, but then I remembered you don't always do addition before subtraction; it's just whichever comes first in the sum.
