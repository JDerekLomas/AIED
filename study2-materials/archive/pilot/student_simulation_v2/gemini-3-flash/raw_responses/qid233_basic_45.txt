ANSWER: C

My thinking is that with algebra you have to put the letters together, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Then because it's $2$ divided by the whole bracket, you have to draw a big line and put the $2$ on top of the other bits to show the division. C looks right because the $ab$ is joined up and it's under the $2$.
