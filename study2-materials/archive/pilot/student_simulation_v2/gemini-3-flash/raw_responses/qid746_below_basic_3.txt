ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 which is 16, then I divided that by 2 to get 8, then I added the last 2 on the end which makes 10, but that wasn't one of the options. So I tried it again and just did 12 divided by 2 is 6, then plus 1 is 7. I'm not really sure about the brackets but 7 is there so I'll go with B.
