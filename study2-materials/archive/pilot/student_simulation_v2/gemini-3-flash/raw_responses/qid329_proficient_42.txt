ANSWER: A

My thinking is that BIDMAS (or BODMAS) says you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom's version just puts brackets around the division part, which doesn't actually change the calculation; it just makes the order of operations clearer. Katie is definitely wrong because she swapped the order of the subtraction, and $0.1$ minus something isn't the same as that thing minus $0.1$.
