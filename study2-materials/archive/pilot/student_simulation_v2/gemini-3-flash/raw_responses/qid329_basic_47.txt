ANSWER: A

I remembered BODMAS (or BIDMAS) from school, and the D comes before S, so you have to do the divide part before the subtract part. Tom put the brackets around the divide bit which is what you'd do first anyway, so that makes sense. Katie swapped the numbers around, but you can't really do that with minus sums because it changes the answer.
