A) Only Jo

My thinking was that Jo’s expression follows the order of operations correctly for the steps described. You start with $n-5$, divide the whole thing by $8$, add $4$ to that result, and then the brackets ensure the $7$ multiplies everything at the end. Paul’s version is wrong because he didn't put the $+4$ inside the final set of brackets, so his version would only multiply the division part by $7$ instead of the final result.
