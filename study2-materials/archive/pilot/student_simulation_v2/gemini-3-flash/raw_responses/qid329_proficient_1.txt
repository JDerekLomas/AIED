ANSWER: A

My thinking: According to BIDMAS, you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom's equation is correct because putting brackets around the $(0.2 \div 0.3)$ just reinforces that order. Katie is wrong because she changed the order of the numbers—subtraction isn't commutative, so $a - b$ isn't the same as $b - a$. The only tricky bit was the decimals, but the logic of the operation order stays the same.
