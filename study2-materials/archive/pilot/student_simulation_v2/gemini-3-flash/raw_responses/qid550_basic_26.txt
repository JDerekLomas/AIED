ANSWER: C

My thinking is that for Tom, 3 + 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side, 3 - 1 is 2, then add 2 is also 4, so he's right. For Katie, you have to do the times first because of BIDMAS. So 2 x 1 is 2, plus 3 makes 5. On the other side, 2 x 1 is 2, plus 3 is also 5. Since they both get the same answer on both sides, they are both correct.
