Both Tom and Katie are correct because they are demonstrating the **commutative property** of addition. 

In Tom's case, addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS/BODMAS and are processed left-to-right. Treating the expression as $3 + 2 + (-1)$, the terms can be reordered without changing the result ($4$). 

In Katie's case, multiplication has a higher priority than addition. In both versions of her identity, the multiplication ($2 \times 1$) must be performed first. Therefore, both sides simplify to $3 + 2$, which equals $5$.
