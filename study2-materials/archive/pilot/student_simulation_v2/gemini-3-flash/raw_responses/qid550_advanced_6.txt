Both Tom and Katie are correct because they are demonstrating the **commutative property** of addition. 

In Tom's case, addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS/order of operations. You can treat the expression as a sum of directed numbers: $(+3) + (+2) + (-1)$. Since the order of addition doesn't matter, $(+3) + (-1) + (+2)$ results in the same value (4).

In Katie's case, the multiplication must be performed first regardless of its position in the expression. Both sides simplify to $3 + 2 = 5$. She has simply swapped the order of the two terms being added ($3$ and the product $2 \times 1$).
