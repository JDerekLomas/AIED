C

**Explanation:** Both are correct because they are applying the commutative property. Tom is treating the expression as a sum of directed numbers, \(3 + 2 + (-1)\), which can be reordered without changing the result (both equal 4). Katie is correctly identifying that addition is commutative (\(a + b = b + a\)), where \(a\) is 3 and \(b\) is the product \(2 \times 1\); the order of the terms being added doesn't change the sum.
