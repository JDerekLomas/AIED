B

I think it's B because when you do takeaways it doesn't really matter which way round the numbers go, and Katie's one looks more right because you usually put the bigger numbers first. Plus, I remember my teacher saying something about switching things around in maths, and 0.2 and 0.3 are bigger than 0.1.
