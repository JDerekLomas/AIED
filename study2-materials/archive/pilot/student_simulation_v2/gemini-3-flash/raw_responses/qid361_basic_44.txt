A) Only Jo

I think it's Jo because the question says the last thing you do is multiply by 7. In Jo's one, the big brackets mean you do the whole middle bit first and then times everything by 7 at the end. Paul's one has the +4 outside the big brackets, so I think you'd do the multiplying before adding the 4, which is the wrong way round.
