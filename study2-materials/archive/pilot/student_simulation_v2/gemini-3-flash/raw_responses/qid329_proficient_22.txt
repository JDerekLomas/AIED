ANSWER: A

My thinking is that BIDMAS (or BODMAS) rules say we have to do division before subtraction. Tom has put brackets around the division part, which doesn't actually change the calculation but correctly shows the order you have to do it in. Katie has swapped the order of the numbers around, and since subtraction isn't commutative, \(0.1 - 0.66...\) is definitely not the same as \(0.66... - 0.1\). One would be negative and the other positive. So only Tom is right.
