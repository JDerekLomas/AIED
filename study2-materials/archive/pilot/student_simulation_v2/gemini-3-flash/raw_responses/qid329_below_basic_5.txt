ANSWER: B

I think Katie is right because usually in maths you just read the numbers from left to right. Plus, I remember my teacher saying something about how you can swap numbers around in a sum and it stays the same, so it's probably B. 0.1 minus 0.2 seems like it would be a weird minus number anyway, so putting the 0.2 first looks more like a normal take-away.
