ANSWER: C

My thinking is that both are correct because of how BIDMAS (or order of operations) works. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work left to right. $3+2-1 = 4$ and $3-1+2 = 4$, so they are equivalent. For Katie, you have to do the multiplication first regardless of the order they are written in. $3 + (2 \times 1) = 5$ and $(2 \times 1) + 3 = 5$. Since both sides equal the same thing in both cases, both Tom and Katie are right.
