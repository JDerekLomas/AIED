A

**Explanation:** To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one of the values is 0, it must still be included in the count. There are 5 numbers in the set ($0, 1, 3, 4, 7$), so we divide the sum by 5. Since $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$ is the same as $1 + 3 + 4 + 7$, option A correctly represents the calculation. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), as only the 7 would be divided by 5.
