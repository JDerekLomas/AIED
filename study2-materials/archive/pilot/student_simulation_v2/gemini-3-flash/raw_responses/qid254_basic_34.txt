ANSWER: A

My thinking: To find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list because you have to count the zero. C is wrong because it divides by 4. B looks okay but my teacher says you have to do the adding first before the dividing, and A has the line which means the whole top bit is divided by 5. I didn't include the 0 on the top of the fraction because adding 0 doesn't change the sum anyway.
