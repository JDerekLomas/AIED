ANSWER: B

So, I need to put the 0.3 where the $x$ is. That means it's $3 \times 0.3^2$. If I do $3 \times 0.3$ first, that's $0.9$, and then $0.9$ squared is $0.81$, so it could be A. But then I remembered you have to do the squared bit first because of BIDMAS. $3 \times 3$ is 9, so $0.3 \times 0.3$ must be $0.9$. Then $3 \times 0.9$ is $2.7$, but there's a lot of decimal places, so it's probably $0.27$.
