ANSWER: B

My thinking: Since the equation is $y = 3x^2$, I need to square the $x$ value first. $0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.09$. Then I just multiply that by 3, so $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. You have to be careful not to do $3 \times 0.3$ first and then square it, because that would give you $0.81$ (A), but BIDMAS says indices come before multiplication.
