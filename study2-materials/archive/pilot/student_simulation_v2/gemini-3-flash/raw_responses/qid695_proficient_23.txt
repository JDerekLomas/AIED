ANSWER: B

I used BIDMAS for this one. You have to do the division and the multiplication first before the addition. So, $18 \div 2$ is $9$, and $2 \times 2$ is $4$. Then you just add them together ($9 + 4$) to get $13$. If you just went from left to right without thinking, you'd get a different answer, but I'm pretty sure you have to do the operations in that order.
