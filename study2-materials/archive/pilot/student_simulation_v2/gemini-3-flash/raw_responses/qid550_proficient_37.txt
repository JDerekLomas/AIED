My thinking is that both of them are correct because they're just swapping the order of the terms but keeping the signs with the numbers. For Tom, $3+2-1$ is 4, and $3-1+2$ is also 4, so that works. For Katie, even though there's multiplication, BODMAS says you do the $2 \times 1$ first in both versions, and adding 3 gives 5 both ways. Since they both end up with the same result on both sides of the identity symbol, they're both right.
