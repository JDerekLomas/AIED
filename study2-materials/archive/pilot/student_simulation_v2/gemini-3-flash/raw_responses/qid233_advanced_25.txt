ANSWER: C

**Explanation:** In algebra, we follow the order of operations (BIDMAS). Multiplication comes before addition, so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. This is then added to $3$ to form the denominator. Since the division sign applies to the entire expression in the brackets, it is written as a fraction: $\frac{2}{ab+3}$. Choice D is incorrect because we avoid using the "$\times$" symbol in final algebraic conventions.
