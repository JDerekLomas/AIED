I think Katie is right because usually you just work from left to right. 0.1 minus 0.2 is -0.1, and then you divide that by 0.3. Katie has the divide part first but she kept the 0.1 at the end which looks more like how you'd swap it around to make it easier. Tom's one has brackets and those usually change the answer, so his is probably wrong.
