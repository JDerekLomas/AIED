A) Only Jo

I think it's A because Jo has put the whole bit inside the big brackets. The question says you have to add 4 and *then* multiply by 7 at the very end, so the 7 needs to be outside everything. Paul's one looks wrong because the +4 is outside the brackets, so you'd do the multiplying before the adding and get a different answer.
