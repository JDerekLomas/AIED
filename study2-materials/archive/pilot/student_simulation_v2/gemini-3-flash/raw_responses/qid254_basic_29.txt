ANSWER: A

My teacher said that for the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list. I didn't include the 0 in the top part because adding 0 doesn't change the total, so $1+3+4+7$ is the same as $0+1+3+4+7$. B looks wrong because you have to do the adding before the dividing.
