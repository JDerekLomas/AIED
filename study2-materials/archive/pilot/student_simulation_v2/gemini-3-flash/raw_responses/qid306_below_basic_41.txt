ANSWER: A

I picked A because you always just read from left to right like when you're reading a book. In Problem P, the 4 and 5 come first, and in Problem Q, the 4 and 5 are also at the start, so you just add them together first. I know there's that BIDMAS thing but I can never remember if the plus or the times comes first so I just do it in order.
