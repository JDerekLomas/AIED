ANSWER: C

I used BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction) to work this out. Since there aren't any brackets, Multiplication comes before Addition or Subtraction, so you have to do $8 \times 7$ first. It's a bit of a trick because your eyes want to just go from left to right and do $10 - 8$, but that would give you the wrong answer.
