B

I think it's B because Katie's one is definitely right since you have to do the times first anyway because of BIDMAS, and it doesn't matter which way you write it. But for Tom, I think he's wrong because you have to do the plus before the minus in the order they come, so if you swap the numbers around it changes the sum.
