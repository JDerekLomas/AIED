ANSWER: A

I picked A because the question has a 2 and then a 3, and A is the only one that looks like a normal fraction with 2 over 3. I also know that in algebra you just squish the letters together, so I put the $a$ and $b$ at the end. C and D look way too complicated with all that stuff under the line.
