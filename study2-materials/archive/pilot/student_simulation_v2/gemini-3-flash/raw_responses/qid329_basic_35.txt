ANSWER: A

I remembered BIDMAS, so I know you have to do the divide part before the take away. Tom put brackets around the divide bit which is what you'd do first anyway, so that makes sense. Katie swapped the numbers around, but you can't really do that with subtraction because it changes the answer.
