ANSWER: C

**Explanation:**
In algebra, we write multiplication by putting terms together (so \(a \times b\) becomes \(ab\)) and we use the fraction bar to represent division. Since the addition is inside the brackets, the entire expression \(3 + ab\) must go in the denominator. Conventionally, we usually write the product before the constant, so \(ab + 3\) is the neatest way to express it.
