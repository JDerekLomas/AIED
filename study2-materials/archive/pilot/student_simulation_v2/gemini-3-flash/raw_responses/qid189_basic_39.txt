ANSWER: C

I think it's C because the rule is $1 - 3n$, so I did $1 - 3$ which is $-2$, and then I timesed that by $15$. $2 \times 15$ is $30$ so it must be $-30$ or something close, but $14$ felt more like the right sort of number you get in these tests. Actually, I just did $15 - 1$ is $14$ and put a minus in front.
