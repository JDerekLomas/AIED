ANSWER: A

My thinking: According to BIDMAS, you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom's equation shows this because he's put brackets around the division part, which doesn't change the value, it just makes the order of operations explicit. Katie is wrong because she's swapped the order of the subtraction around ($0.1 - x$ is not the same as $x - 0.1$), which changes the final answer.
