ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression correctly applies the final "multiply by 7" to the entire previous result using the outer brackets. Paul's expression is incorrect because, according to the order of operations (BIDMAS), he would multiply by 7 *before* adding the 4, which changes the sequence of the operations.
