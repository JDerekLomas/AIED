ANSWER: D

I think it's D because in BIDMAS you have to do the adding before the taking away, so Tom must be wrong because he changed the order. And for Katie, the 2 and 1 are at the end but then they moved to the front, and the numbers usually have to stay in the same place for it to be the same sum. None of them look right to me.
