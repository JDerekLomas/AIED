ANSWER: A

I know that in algebra, when you have letters next to each other like $ab$, it means they are multiplied, so that part makes sense. Then for the first bit, $2 \div 3$ is just the same as the fraction $\frac{2}{3}$, so I just put them together. I'm not really sure what to do with the brackets, but A looks like the simplest way to write it.
