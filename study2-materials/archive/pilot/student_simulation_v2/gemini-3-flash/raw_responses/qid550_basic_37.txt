ANSWER: C

My thinking: For Tom, 3 plus 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side, 3 take away 1 is 2, then plus 2 is 4. So they are both 4. For Katie, you have to do the times first because of BIDMAS. 2 times 1 is 2, then add 3 makes 5. It's the same on both sides just swapped around, and since both sides equal 5, they are both right.
