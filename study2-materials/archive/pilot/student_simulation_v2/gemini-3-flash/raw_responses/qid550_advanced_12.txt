ANSWER: C

Both are correct because of the commutative property. Tom is right because addition and subtraction are at the same level in BIDMAS/order of operations; as long as you keep the negative sign with the 1, you can reorder them ($5-1 = 4$ and $2+2 = 4$). Katie is right because addition is commutative ($3+2=5$ and $2+3=5$), and the multiplication ($2 \times 1$) must be completed first in both instances regardless of its position in the sum.
