A) -44

**Thinking:** I know that $n$ is the number of the term, so I put 15 where the $n$ is. That gives me $1 - 315$. But $3$ and $15$ next to each other means times, so $3 \times 15$ is $45$. Then I have to do $1 - 45$. Since $45$ is bigger than $1$, it must be a minus number, and $45$ take away $1$ is $44$, so it's $-44$.
