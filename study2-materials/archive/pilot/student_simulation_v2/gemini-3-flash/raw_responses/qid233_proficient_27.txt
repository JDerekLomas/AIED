ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $(3 + ab)$ is all inside the brackets after the division sign, it has to go on the bottom of the fraction. I just swapped the $3$ and the $ab$ around because $ab + 3$ is the same as $3 + ab$. Option D still has the $\times$ sign in it, so that's not fully simplified.
