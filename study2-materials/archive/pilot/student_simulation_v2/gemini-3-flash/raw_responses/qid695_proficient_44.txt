ANSWER: B

I used BIDMAS for this one. You have to do the division and multiplication before the addition. So, $18 \div 2 = 9$ and $2 \times 2 = 4$. Then you just add them together, $9 + 4 = 13$. If you just went from left to right without thinking about the order of operations, you'd get a different answer, but I'm pretty sure B is right.
