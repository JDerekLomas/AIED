ANSWER: C

My thinking: For Tom, 3 plus 2 is 5, then take away 1 makes 4. On the other side, 3 take away 1 is 2, then add 2 makes 4 as well. They are the same. For Katie, you have to do the times bit first because of BIDMAS. So 2 times 1 is 2, then add 3 is 5. On the other side, 2 times 1 is 2, and adding 3 still makes 5. So they are both right.
