ANSWER: A

I think it's A because I put the 15 where the $n$ is. So it's $1 - 3$ which is $-2$, and then I times that by 15. Wait, no, I did $3 \times 15$ which is 45, and then I did $1 - 45$. I used my fingers to count back from 1 and got 44, but since it's taking away a big number it has to be minus, so -44.
