ANSWER: C

I think they are both right because in the first one, you're just swapping the numbers around and it's all plus and minus, so $3+2-1$ is $4$ and $3-1+2$ is also $4$. Then for Katie, you have to do the times first because of BIDMAS, so $2 \times 1$ is $2$, and then add the $3$ which makes $5$. It doesn't matter if the $3$ is at the front or the back, you still do the multiplying part first, so they both get the same answer.
