A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in the question. You have to take the number ($n$), take away 5, then divide by 8, then add 4. Jo's one has the $+4$ inside the big brackets with the 7 on the outside, which means you multiply the whole thing by 7 at the end like the question says. Paul's one has the $+4$ on the outside, so you'd do the multiplying before adding the 4, and that's the wrong order.
