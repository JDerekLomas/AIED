ANSWER: B

My thinking was to follow BIDMAS. First, I did the brackets $(2+2) = 4$. Then I did the division, so $12 \div 4 = 3$. Finally, I added that to the $4$ at the start, which gives $7$. If you just went from left to right without thinking about the order of operations, you'd get a different answer, but I'm pretty sure division comes before addition!
