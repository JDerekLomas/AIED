ANSWER: C

My thinking: I know that in algebra you don't really use the divide sign, you use a fraction bar instead. The 2 is at the start so it goes on top. Then for the bottom bit, $a \times b$ is just written as $ab$ because you take the multiply sign out. I chose C because it has the $ab$ together and the 3 is there too, it doesn't matter if the 3 is at the end or the start of the bottom bit. A looked wrong because the line didn't go under everything.
