**Explanation:**
According to the standard order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), division must be performed before subtraction. Tom’s statement correctly identifies that the division $(0.2 \div 0.3)$ is a single term that is subtracted from $0.1$. Katie is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative; $a - b$ is not equivalent to $b - a$.
