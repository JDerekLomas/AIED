ANSWER: B

I did the plus bits first because I'm better at adding up. 4 plus 12 is 16, and then 2 plus 2 is 4. So then it's just 16 divided by 4, which is 4. But then I remembered my teacher saying we have to do the brackets first. 2 plus 2 is 4, then I did 12 plus 4 which is 16, and 16 divided by 4 is still 4. Wait, I'll try just going left to right. 4 plus 12 is 16, divided by 2 is 8, plus 2 is 10. That's A.
