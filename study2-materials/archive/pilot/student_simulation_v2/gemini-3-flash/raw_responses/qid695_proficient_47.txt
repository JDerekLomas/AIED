ANSWER: B

My thinking was to use BIDMAS. You have to do the division and the multiplication first before the addition. So, $18 \div 2 = 9$ and $2 \times 2 = 4$. Then you just add those together, $9 + 4 = 13$. If you just went from left to right without thinking about the order of operations, you'd probably get it wrong!
