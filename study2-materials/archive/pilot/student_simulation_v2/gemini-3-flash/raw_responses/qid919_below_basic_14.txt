ANSWER: B

I think it's B because I know 3 times 3 is 9, and then if you do 9 times 3 again you get 27. I saw the 0.27 and it looked like the right kind of number because it has the 27 in it. I always get confused with the little 2 at the top but I remember my teacher saying something about multiplying it by itself.
