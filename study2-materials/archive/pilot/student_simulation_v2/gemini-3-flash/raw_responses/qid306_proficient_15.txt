ANSWER: B

For Problem P, addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS, so you just work from left to right, meaning you do $4 - 5$ first. For Problem Q, you have to do the multiplication before the addition, so you do $5 \times 6$ first. I almost picked D because I saw the addition sign in P and thought "A comes before S", but then I remembered they're actually equal priority!
