ANSWER: B

I did the 4 + 12 first which is 16, and then I did the 2 + 2 in the brackets which is 4. Then I just did 16 divided by 4, so the answer is 4. Wait, I think I have to do the brackets first because of BIDMAS. 2 + 2 is 4, then 12 divided by 4 is 3. Then I add the 4 at the start, so 4 + 3 is 7.
