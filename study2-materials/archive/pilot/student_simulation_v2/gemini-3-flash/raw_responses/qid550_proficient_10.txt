My thinking is that both are correct because of the order of operations (BIDMAS). For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work from left to right. $3+2-1 = 4$ and $3-1+2 = 4$, so those are equal. For Katie, you have to do the multiplication first. So $3 + (2 \times 1) = 5$ and $(2 \times 1) + 3 = 5$. Since both sides equal 5, she's right too. It's basically just the commutative property showing that the order of the terms doesn't change the result as long as you keep the signs with the right numbers.
