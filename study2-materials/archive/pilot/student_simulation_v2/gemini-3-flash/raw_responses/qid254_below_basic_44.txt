ANSWER: C

Well, there are 4 numbers (1, 3, 4, and 7) because 0 doesn't really count as anything, does it? So you have to add them up and then divide by 4 because that's how many there are. A looks wrong because it has a 5 at the bottom and I don't know why you'd use 5. B just looks like a long line of numbers and usually, these questions have a fraction bar. So C must be right.
