ANSWER: A

I picked A because you always just read the sum from left to right like you're reading a book. For Problem P, the 4 and 5 are at the start so you do that first. Then for Problem Q, the 4 and 5 are also at the start, so you add them up before you do the times bit. C and D look way too complicated.
