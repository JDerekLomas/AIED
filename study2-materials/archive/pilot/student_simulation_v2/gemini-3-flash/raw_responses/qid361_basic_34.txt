A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in order. You do the number takeaway 5 first, which is (n-5). Then you divide that bit by 8, which Jo wrote as a fraction. Then you add 4 to that whole thing and multiply everything by 7 at the end. Jo's one has the big brackets around the +4 part, so the 7 multiplies all of it. Paul's one has the +4 outside at the end, so you'd only multiply the middle bit by 7 and then add 4 last, which is wrong.
