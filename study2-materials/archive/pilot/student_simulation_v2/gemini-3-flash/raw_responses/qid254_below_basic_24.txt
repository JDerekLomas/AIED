ANSWER: C

I think it's C because you have to add up the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are four numbers (1, 3, 4, and 7) and the 0 doesn't really count as a number when you're adding, so you divide by 4. A can't be right because you wouldn't divide by 5 if there's only four numbers that have a value.
