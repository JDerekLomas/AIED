ANSWER: B

I used BIDMAS for this one. You have to do the division and the multiplication first before you do the addition. So, $18 \div 2$ is $9$, and $2 \times 2$ is $4$. Then you just add them together ($9 + 4$) to get $13$. It's easy to accidentally just work from left to right and get $22$, but you've got to follow the order of operations.
