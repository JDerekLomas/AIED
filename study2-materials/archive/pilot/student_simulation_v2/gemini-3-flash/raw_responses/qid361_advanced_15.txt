ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because their expression follows the order of operations described in the problem. The large brackets ensure that the entire result of the previous steps (subtracting 5, dividing by 8, and adding 4) is multiplied by 7. 

Paul is incorrect because his expression only multiplies the division part by 7 and adds the 4 at the very end, which violates the instruction to "finally multiply by 7."
