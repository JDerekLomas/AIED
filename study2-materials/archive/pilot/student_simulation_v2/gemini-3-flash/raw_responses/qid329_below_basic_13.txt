I think it's Katie because in maths you usually just go from left to right, but Tom put those brackets in which changes things. Katie's looks better because she's kept the numbers the same but just swapped them around, and usually it doesn't matter what way round you put the take-away and the divide. 0.1 and 0.2 are basically the same anyway.
