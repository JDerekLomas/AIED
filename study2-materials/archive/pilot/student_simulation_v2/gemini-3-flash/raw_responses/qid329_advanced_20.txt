A

**Explanation:**
According to the standard order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), division must be performed before subtraction. Tom’s statement correctly represents this by grouping the division in brackets, showing that $0.2 \div 0.3$ is subtracted from $0.1$. Katie’s statement is incorrect because she has changed the order of the terms; subtraction is not commutative ($a - b \neq b - a$), so $0.1 - (0.2 \div 0.3)$ does not equal $(0.2 \div 0.3) - 0.1$.
