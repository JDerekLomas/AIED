ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one has the divide sign ($\div$) and the question says "divide by 8". Jo's one has a line like a fraction and I don't really like fractions, they're confusing. Also, Paul's one just looks more like the order the words are in, and 7 is at the front and then the 4 is at the end which makes sense because you add 4 and then times by 7.
