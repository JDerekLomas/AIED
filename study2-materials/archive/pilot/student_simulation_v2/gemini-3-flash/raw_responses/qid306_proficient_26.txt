My thinking: For Problem Q, you have to follow BIDMAS, so multiplication comes before addition, meaning you do $5 \times 6$ first. For Problem P, since addition and subtraction have the same priority, you just work from left to right. I know some people think 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS so you should add first, but my teacher said you just go across the row, so $4 - 5$ is the first step.
