A

**Explanation:**
According to the rules of BIDMAS (or BODMAS), division must be performed before subtraction. Therefore, the expression $0.1 - 0.2 \div 0.3$ is evaluated as $0.1 - (0.2 \div 0.3)$. Tom is correct because he preserves the order of operations and the signs. Katie is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative; $a - b$ is not the same as $b - a$. She has effectively changed the sign of the terms.
