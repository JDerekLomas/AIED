ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as one of the values in the set, so there are 5 numbers in total. Adding 0 doesn't change the top of the fraction, but you still have to divide by 5. B is wrong because of BIDMAS (you'd only divide the 7 by 5), and C is a common mistake where people forget to count the zero.
