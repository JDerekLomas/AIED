ANSWER: B

I did the 4 + 12 first which is 16, and then I did the brackets 2 + 2 which is 4. Then I just did 16 divided by 4 which is 4, but that didn't seem right because of the order of operations thing our teacher told us. So I tried it again doing 12 divided by 2 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus the other 2 is 12. But actually, if you do the brackets first like BIDMAS says, it's 4. Then 12 divided by 4 is 3. Then you just add the 4 at the start, so 4 + 3 makes 7.
