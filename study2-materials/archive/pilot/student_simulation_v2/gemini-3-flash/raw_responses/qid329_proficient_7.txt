ANSWER: A

My thinking is that BIDMAS (or BODMAS) says you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom's version with the brackets shows exactly that—the $0.2 \div 0.3$ part happens first, and then it's subtracted from $0.1$, which is the correct order. Katie has just swapped the numbers around, which changes the result from a negative to a positive, so she's definitely wrong.
