ANSWER: D

I think it's D because the numbers are in the wrong order. My teacher says you have to do the sums in the order they are written, so if you move the 1 or the 3 to a different place, it changes the answer. In the first one, Tom moved the minus 1 to the middle, and in the second one, Katie put the 3 at the end, so they must be wrong.
