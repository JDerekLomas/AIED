ANSWER: C

I think it's C because a minus and a minus make a plus, and 6 times 2 is 12, but wait, 6 squared is 36. Since it's a minus number times itself, the minus signs cancel out and it becomes a positive 36. I remember my teacher saying something about brackets but I usually just pick the positive one if it's there.
