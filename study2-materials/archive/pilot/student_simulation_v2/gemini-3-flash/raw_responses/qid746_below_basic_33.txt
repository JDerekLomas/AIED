ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 which is 16, then I divided that by 2 to get 8, and then plus the other 2 makes 10, but that didn't feel right. So I just did 4 + 12 is 16 and 2 + 2 is 4, then I took them away and got 12. But actually, I remember my teacher saying you do the divide bit first, so 12 divided by 2 is 6, and 6 plus 1 is 7. I think B looks like the right sort of answer.
