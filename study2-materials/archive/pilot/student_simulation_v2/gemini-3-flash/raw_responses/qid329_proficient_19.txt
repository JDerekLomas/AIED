A

**Explanation:**
Tom is correct because of the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule. Division has a higher priority than subtraction, so you have to calculate $0.2 \div 0.3$ first. Adding the brackets doesn't change the value; it just makes the order of operations explicit. Katie is wrong because she swapped the order of the terms, and subtraction isn't commutative ($a - b$ isn't the same as $b - a$). Since only Tom's statement is a true identity, the answer is A.
