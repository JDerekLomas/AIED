ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a value in the set, so there are 5 numbers in total. You don't need to write the "0+" in the numerator because it doesn't change the sum, but you definitely have to divide by 5. B is wrong because of BIDMAS (it would only divide the 7 by 5), and C is wrong because it only divides by 4.
