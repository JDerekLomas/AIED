A) Only Tom

My thinking: In BIDMAS, division comes before subtraction. Tom's expression shows that you have to do the $0.2 \div 0.3$ first, which is correct because the brackets just reinforce the standard order of operations. Katie's expression swaps the numbers around, and subtraction isn't commutative ($a-b$ isn't the same as $b-a$), so she's wrong.
