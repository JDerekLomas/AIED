ANSWER: B

My thinking: I know you have to do the plus part first because it's at the beginning. 4 plus 12 is 16. Then I did the bit in the brackets, 2 plus 2 is 4. So then it's just 16 divided by 4, which is 4. Oh wait, my teacher said something about BIDMAS and doing the divide first. If I do 12 divided by 4 it's 3, and then 4 plus 3 is 7. I'll go with 7.
