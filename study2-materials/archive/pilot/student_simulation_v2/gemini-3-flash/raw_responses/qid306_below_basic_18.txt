ANSWER: A

I picked A because you always just do the sums in the order they're written from left to right. For the first one, 4 takeaway 5 is at the start, and for the second one, 4 plus 5 is at the start, so you have to do those bits first. I remember my teacher saying something about BIDMAS but I can't really remember what it means so I just do whichever one comes first.
