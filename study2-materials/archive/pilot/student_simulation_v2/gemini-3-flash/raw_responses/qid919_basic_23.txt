ANSWER: B

So, I need to put 0.3 where the $x$ is. $3 \times 0.3$ is $0.9$, and then if I square that ($0.9 \times 0.9$) I get $0.81$, but that's not right because the squared is only on the $x$. If I do $3 \times 0.3$ it's $0.9$, and $0.9 \times 3$ is $2.7$, but there's a 3 there twice... I think you just do $3 \times 3$ which is 9, and then $9 \times 0.3$ is 2.7, but since it's $0.3$ it must be $0.27$ because of the decimal point.
