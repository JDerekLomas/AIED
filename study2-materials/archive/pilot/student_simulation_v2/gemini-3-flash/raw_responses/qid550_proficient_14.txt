Both are correct. For Tom’s statement, addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS/BODMAS, so you just work from left to right. $3+2-1 = 4$ and $3-1+2 = 4$, so they are equivalent. For Katie, even though there’s a multiplication, the order of the terms doesn't change the result because addition is commutative. In both of her expressions, you'd do the $2 \times 1$ first anyway, and then add the $3$, so both sides equal $5$.
