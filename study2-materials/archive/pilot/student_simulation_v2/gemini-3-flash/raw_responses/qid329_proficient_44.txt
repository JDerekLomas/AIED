ANSWER: A

My thinking: According to BIDMAS, you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom's equation is correct because putting brackets around the $(0.2 \div 0.3)$ doesn't change anything; it just shows that the division happens first anyway. Katie is wrong because she swapped the order of the terms around, and subtraction isn't commutative, so $0.1 - x$ isn't the same as $x - 0.1$.
