A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in order. You start with $n$, then take away $5$, so that's $(n-5)$. Then you divide that by $8$, which Jo wrote as a fraction. Then you add $4$ to the whole thing. Jo put the brackets around all of that and then the $7$ on the outside to multiply it all at the end. Paul put the $+4$ on the outside of the big brackets, so you'd multiply by $7$ before adding $4$, which is the wrong way round.
