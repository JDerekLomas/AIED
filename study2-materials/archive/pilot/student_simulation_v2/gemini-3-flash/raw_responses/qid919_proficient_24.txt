ANSWER: B

My thinking: I just need to plug $x = 0.3$ into the equation $y = 3x^2$. First, I square $0.3$, which is $0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09$. Then I multiply that by $3$, and $3 \times 0.09$ gives $0.27$. I have to be careful not to do $3 \times 0.3$ first and then square it, because BIDMAS says you do the indices before the multiplication.
