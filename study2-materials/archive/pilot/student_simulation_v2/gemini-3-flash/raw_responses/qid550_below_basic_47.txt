ANSWER: D

I think it's D because you have to do the sums in the order they are written. My teacher says BIDMAS means you do things in a certain order, and Tom has moved the numbers around so the 1 is in the middle instead of at the end. Katie has also swapped her numbers around, and you aren't allowed to just change the order of a sum because it makes it a different question. None of them look right to me.
