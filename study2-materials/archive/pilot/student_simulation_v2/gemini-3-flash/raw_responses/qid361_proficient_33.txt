ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows all the steps in order. She has the subtraction in brackets, then the division, and crucially, the +4 is inside the final set of brackets to be multiplied by 7. Paul’s version is wrong because his +4 is outside the main brackets, so he’d only be multiplying the division part by 7 and not the 4.
