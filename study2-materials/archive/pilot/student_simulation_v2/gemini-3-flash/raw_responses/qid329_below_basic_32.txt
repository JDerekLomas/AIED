ANSWER: B

I think it's Katie because you're supposed to read the sum from left to right, but the 0.1 is at the start so it doesn't really matter where it goes as long as the numbers stay the same. Tom's one has brackets and brackets always make the answer bigger or different, so that's probably wrong. Katie just swapped them around which usually works in adding, so it's probably B.
