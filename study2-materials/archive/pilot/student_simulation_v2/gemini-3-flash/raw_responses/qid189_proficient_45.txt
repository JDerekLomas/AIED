A) -44

**Thinking:** To find the 15th term, you just need to substitute $n=15$ into the formula. So it's $1 - 3 \times 15$. $3 \times 15$ is 45, and then $1 - 45$ gives $-44$. You have to be careful with the signs, but as long as you don't accidentally do $3 \times 15 - 1$, it's quite straightforward.
