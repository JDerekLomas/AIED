ANSWER: D

I think it's D because you're not allowed to just swap the numbers around like that in maths. I remember my teacher saying you have to do the sums in a specific order (BIDMAS), and if you move the numbers to different places, the answer usually changes. Tom has put the minus in a different spot and Katie has moved the times table part, so they're probably both wrong.
