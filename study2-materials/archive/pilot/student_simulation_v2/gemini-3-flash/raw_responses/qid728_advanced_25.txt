ANSWER: D

Thinking: I need to get the result to be 7. Using BIDMAS, if I put brackets around the entire subtraction and addition part, I get $(16 - 6 + 4)$, which simplifies to $(10 + 4) = 14$. Then, dividing that by 2 gives me $14 \div 2 = 7$. None of the other options work: A gives 11, B gives 12, and C is just the standard order of operations which gives 12.
