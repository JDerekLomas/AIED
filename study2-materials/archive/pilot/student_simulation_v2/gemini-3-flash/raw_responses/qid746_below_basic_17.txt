ANSWER: B

I think it's B because 4 plus 12 is 16, and then you divide it by 2 which is 8, and then take away the other 2 or something? Actually, I just did 4 + 12 which is 16, then 2 + 2 is 4, and 16 divided by 4 is 4... wait, no, I'll just go with 7 because 12 divided by 2 is 6, and 6 plus 1 is 7. I always get mixed up with the brackets.
