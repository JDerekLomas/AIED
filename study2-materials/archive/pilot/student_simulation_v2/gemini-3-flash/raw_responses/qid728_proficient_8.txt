ANSWER: D

I looked at the options and did the BIDMAS for each. For D, you do the brackets first: $16 - 6$ is $10$, plus $4$ is $14$. Then you just divide by $2$ at the end, which gives $7$. A looked like it might work at first, but $10$ divided by $2$ is $5$, and $16 - 5$ is $11$, so it had to be D.
