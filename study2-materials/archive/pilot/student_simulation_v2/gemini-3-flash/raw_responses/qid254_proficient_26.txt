A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a piece of data, so you have to divide the sum by 5. Option A is right because adding 0 doesn't change the top number, but it correctly shows the division by 5. Option B is wrong because of BIDMAS (it would only divide the 7 by 5).
