ANSWER: A

My teacher said that for the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list. I didn't include the 0 in the top part because adding 0 doesn't change the sum, but I still have to divide by 5 because the 0 counts as one of the numbers. B looks wrong because you'd only divide the 7 by 5 if you put it in a calculator like that.
