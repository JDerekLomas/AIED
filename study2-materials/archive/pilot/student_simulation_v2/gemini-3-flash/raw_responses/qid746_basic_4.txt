ANSWER: B

I did the plus at the beginning first because it's at the start of the sum, so 4 + 12 is 16. Then I did the brackets which is 2 + 2 = 4. So then it's just 16 divided by 4, which is 4. Oh wait, I remember my teacher saying something about BIDMAS and that you have to do the divide before the add. So 12 divided by 4 is 3, then 4 + 3 is 7. I'll go with 7.
