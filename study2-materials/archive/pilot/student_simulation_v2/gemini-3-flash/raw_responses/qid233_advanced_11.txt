ANSWER: C

Algebraic convention dictates that we remove the multiplication symbol between variables ($a \times b$ becomes $ab$) and use a fraction bar instead of the division symbol. Since the entire expression $(3+ab)$ is inside the brackets, it must form the denominator. Convention also typically lists the variable term before the constant, making $\frac{2}{ab+3}$ the most standard form.
