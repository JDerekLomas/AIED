ANSWER: C

My thinking is that both are correct because of how BIDMAS works. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work left to right. $3+2-1 = 4$ and $3-1+2 = 4$, so they are equivalent. For Katie, the multiplication must happen first in both cases ($2 \times 1 = 2$), and then you add the $3$, which gives $5$ for both expressions. Since the order of the terms doesn't change the final result in these specific examples, both statements are true.
