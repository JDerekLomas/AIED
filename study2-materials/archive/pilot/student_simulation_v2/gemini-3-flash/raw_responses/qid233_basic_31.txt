ANSWER: C

My thinking is that the division sign means it should be a fraction, so the 2 goes on top. I know that in algebra you don't use the times sign, you just squash the letters together, so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. I picked C because it has the 2 on top and the $ab$ together, and I just swapped the $3$ and the $ab$ around because it's still the same thing. A is wrong because the line doesn't go under everything.
