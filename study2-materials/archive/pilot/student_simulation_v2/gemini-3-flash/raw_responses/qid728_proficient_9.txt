ANSWER: D

I looked at the options and used BIDMAS (order of operations). If you put the brackets around the first three numbers like in D, you get (16 - 6 + 4), which is 10 + 4 = 14. Then you just divide the whole thing by 2 to get 7. I almost went for A because it looked like it might work, but 16 - 5 is 11, so it had to be D.
