ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add all the numbers together and divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a value in the set, so there are 5 numbers in total. Adding the 0 doesn't change the top of the fraction, but you still have to divide by 5. B is wrong because without brackets the division would only apply to the 7, and C is wrong because it only divides by 4.
