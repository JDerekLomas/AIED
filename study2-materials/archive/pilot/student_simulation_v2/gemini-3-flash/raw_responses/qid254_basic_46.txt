ANSWER: A

My teacher said that for the mean you add them all up and divide by how many there are. There are five numbers, but one is a zero so you don't really need to add it, but you still have to divide by 5. B looks wrong because you'd only divide the 7 by 5 if you put it in a calculator like that. C is wrong because it only divides by 4.
