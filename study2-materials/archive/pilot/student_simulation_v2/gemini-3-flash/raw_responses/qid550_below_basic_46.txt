ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one looks right because of BIDMAS. You have to do the timesing first, and in her one the 2 x 1 is there in both. Tom's one is wrong because he moved the numbers around and the minus is in the wrong place now, and usually when you change the order of the take-away it gives you a different answer.
