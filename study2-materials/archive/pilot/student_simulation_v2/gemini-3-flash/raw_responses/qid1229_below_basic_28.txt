ANSWER: C

Well, I know that 6 times 2 is 12, but it's got that little 2 at the top which means you times it by itself. So 6 times 6 is 36. Since there's a minus sign at the start, I remembered my teacher saying that two minuses make a plus, so it has to turn into a positive number. That's why it's 36.
