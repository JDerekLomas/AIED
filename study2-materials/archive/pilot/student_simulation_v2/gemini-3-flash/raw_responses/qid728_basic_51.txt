ANSWER: D

I think it's D because you do the bit in the brackets first. 16 minus 6 is 10, then you add 4 which makes 14. Then you just divide the 14 by 2 at the end and that gives you 7. 

I tried A as well but I got 11 because 6 plus 4 is 10, then 10 divided by 2 is 5, and 16 take away 5 is 11. D is the only one that works out as 7.
