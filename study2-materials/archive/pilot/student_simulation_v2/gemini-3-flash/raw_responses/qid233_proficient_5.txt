ANSWER: C

My thinking was that in algebra, you don't usually use the $\times$ or $\div$ symbols. You write multiplications like $a \times b$ as $ab$, and divisions as a fraction. Since the $3 + ab$ is inside the brackets, it all has to go on the bottom of the fraction. I almost picked D because it's the same thing, but then I remembered my teacher saying we have to drop the multiplication signs for it to be "correct" algebraic convention.
