ANSWER: C

Algebraic convention dictates that we remove the multiplication symbol between variables (so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$) and use a fraction bar instead of the division symbol. Since the entire expression $(3 + ab)$ is inside the brackets, it must form the denominator of the fraction. $C$ is the only option that correctly follows these rules.
