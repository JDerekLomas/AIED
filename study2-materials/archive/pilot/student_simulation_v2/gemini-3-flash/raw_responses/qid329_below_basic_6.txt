B

I think it's B because when you do takeaways it doesn't really matter which way round the numbers go, like how 2 - 1 is basically the same as 1 - 2. Also, the first one has brackets and brackets always make the answer bigger or change it, so Katie's one looks more like the normal way you'd write it out.
