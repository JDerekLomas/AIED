**Thinking:**
To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one of the values is $0$, it must be included in the count. There are 5 numbers in the set ($0, 1, 3, 4, 7$). Adding $0$ to the numerator doesn't change the sum, so $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ is mathematically equivalent to $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), as only the 7 would be divided by 5.
