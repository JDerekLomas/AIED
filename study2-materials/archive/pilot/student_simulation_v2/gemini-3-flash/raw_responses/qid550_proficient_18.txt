My thinking: Both are correct. Tom's one works because addition and subtraction are at the same level in BIDMAS, so you can reorder them as long as you keep the signs with the numbers (like $3 + 2 - 1 = 4$ and $3 - 1 + 2 = 4$). Katie's one is just showing that the order you write the terms doesn't matter as long as you still do the multiplication before the addition, which is true because addition is commutative ($5 = 5$).
