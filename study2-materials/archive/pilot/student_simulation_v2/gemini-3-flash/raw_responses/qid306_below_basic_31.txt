ANSWER: A

I picked A because you always just do the sums from left to right, don't you? In Problem P, the 4 and 5 are at the start so you do that first. Then in Problem Q, the 4 and 5 come first again, and 4 plus 5 is 9, so you'd do that before the times bit. My teacher said something about BIDMAS but I can never remember if the plus or the times comes first, so I just go across the page.
