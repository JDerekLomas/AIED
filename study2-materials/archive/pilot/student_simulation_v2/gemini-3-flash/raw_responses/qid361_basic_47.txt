A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in the question. You start with $n-5$, then divide that whole bit by 8, then add 4. Jo's one has the $+4$ inside the big brackets, so it all gets multiplied by 7 at the end like the question says. Paul's one has the $+4$ on the outside, so you'd only multiply the middle bit by 7 and add the 4 last, which feels wrong.
