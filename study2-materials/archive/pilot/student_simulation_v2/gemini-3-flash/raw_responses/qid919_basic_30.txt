ANSWER: B

So, I need to put the 0.3 where the $x$ is. That makes it $3 \times 0.3^2$. I know $3 \times 3$ is 9, so $3 \times 0.3$ is 0.9. Then I just have to square that, and $9 \times 9$ is 81, so it must be something with an 8 and a 1, but then I saw 0.27 and remembered that $3 \times 3 \times 3$ is 27, and there are decimals, so B looks the most right.
