ANSWER: B

My thinking: I need to square the $x$ value first because of BIDMAS. So, $0.3^2$ is $0.09$ (since $3 \times 3 = 9$ and I need two decimal places). Then I multiply that by $3$, and $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. I almost picked D because I thought $0.3^2$ was $0.9$, but then I remembered that $0.3 \times 0.3$ is a much smaller number.
