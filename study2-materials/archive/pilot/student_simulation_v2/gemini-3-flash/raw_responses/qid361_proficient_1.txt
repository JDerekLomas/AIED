A) Only Jo

My thinking was that both might be right at first, but when I looked closer at Paul's version, he didn't put brackets around the $(n - 5) \div 8 + 4$ part. Because of the order of operations (BIDMAS), in Paul's expression you would multiply by 7 *before* adding the 4, but the question says you have to add 4 first and "finally" multiply by 7. Jo's version uses the big brackets correctly to make sure the 7 multiplies everything at the end.
