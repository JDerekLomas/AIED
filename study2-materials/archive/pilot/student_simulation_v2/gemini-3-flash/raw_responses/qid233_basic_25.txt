ANSWER: C

My thinking is that when you write maths in algebra, you don't use the divide sign, you use a fraction bar instead. So the 2 goes on the top and everything in the brackets goes on the bottom. Also, you don't need the times sign between letters, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. I put the $ab$ first because it looks more like the stuff we do in class, so $ab+3$ is the same as $3+ab$.
