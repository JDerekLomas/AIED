My thinking is that both of them are correct. Tom's one works because addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS, so you just work from left to right. $3+2-1=4$ and $3-1+2=4$ as well, so it's fine. Katie is also right because she's just swapped the order of the addition. Even though you do the multiplication first ($2 \times 1 = 2$), both sides end up being $3+2=5$. It’s basically just the commutative law.
