ANSWER: A

I think it's A because I remember my teacher saying that divide means you have to put things in a fraction, and the 2 is at the start so it goes on top. Then for the bottom bit, I just wrote it out normally but took the brackets away because you don't usually need them in the final answer. The $ab$ part looks right because you're supposed to stick the letters together when you times them.
