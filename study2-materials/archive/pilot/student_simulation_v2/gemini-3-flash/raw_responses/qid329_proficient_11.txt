ANSWER: A

My thinking: According to BIDMAS, you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom has put brackets around the division part, which doesn't actually change the calculation, it just shows the order you'd do it in anyway. Katie has swapped the order of the terms around, and since subtraction isn't commutative (like $5-3$ isn't the same as $3-5$), her statement is wrong.
