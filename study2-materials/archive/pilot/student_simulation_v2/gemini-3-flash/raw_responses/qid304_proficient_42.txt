ANSWER: C

I used BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction). Since the brackets are first in the hierarchy, you have to work out the bit inside them before doing anything else. It's tempting to want to do the multiplication first because that comes before addition, but the brackets always take priority.
