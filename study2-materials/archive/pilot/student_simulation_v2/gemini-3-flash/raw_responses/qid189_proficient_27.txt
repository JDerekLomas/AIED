ANSWER: A

I just need to substitute $n = 15$ into the formula. So, $1 - 3 \times 15$. I know $3 \times 15$ is $45$, and then $1 - 45$ gives me $-44$. You have to be careful not to accidentally do $3 \times 15 - 1$ and get $44$, but since the $3n$ is being subtracted from $1$, it's definitely negative.
