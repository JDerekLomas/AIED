ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a value in the set, so there are 5 numbers in total. Adding the 0 doesn't change the top of the fraction, but you still have to divide by 5. B is wrong because of BIDMAS (it would only divide the 7 by 5), and C is a classic mistake because people forget to count the zero.
