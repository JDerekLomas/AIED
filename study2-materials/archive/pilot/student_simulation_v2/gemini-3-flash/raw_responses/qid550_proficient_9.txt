ANSWER: C

My thinking: Both of them are correct because they are just changing the order of the terms while keeping the signs with the numbers. For Tom, $3+2-1$ is 4, and $3-1+2$ is also 4. For Katie, even though you have to do the multiplication first because of BIDMAS, it doesn't matter if the $2 \times 1$ is at the beginning or the end—both sides equal 5. They've basically just swapped the parts around but kept the values the same.
