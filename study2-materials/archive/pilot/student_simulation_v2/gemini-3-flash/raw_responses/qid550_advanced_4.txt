ANSWER: C

Both Tom and Katie are correct. In Tom’s case, addition and subtraction have the same priority in the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), so they can be reordered as long as the sign stays with the number ($+2$ and $-1$). In Katie’s case, the multiplication must be performed first regardless of the order in which the terms are written ($3 + 2 = 5$ and $2 + 3 = 5$). Both expressions are identities.
