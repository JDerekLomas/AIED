I think it's Jo because she used the brackets correctly to show that the "multiply by 7" happens at the very end to the whole expression. Paul's version looks wrong because, with the way he wrote it, you'd only multiply the division part by 7 and then add the 4 afterwards, instead of adding 4 first and then multiplying everything by 7.
