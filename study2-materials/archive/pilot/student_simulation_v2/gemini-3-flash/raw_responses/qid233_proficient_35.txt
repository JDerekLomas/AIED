ANSWER: C

**My thinking:**
First, I know that in algebra we don't use the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Looking at the brackets, the division applies to the whole thing $(3 + ab)$, so it needs to be written as a fraction with $2$ on the top and the entire expression from the brackets on the bottom. I almost went for A, but then I realized the line has to go under the whole $3 + ab$, not just the $2$ and the $3$. So, C is the most correct way to write it.
