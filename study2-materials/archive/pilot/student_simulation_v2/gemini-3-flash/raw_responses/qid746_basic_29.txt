ANSWER: B

I did the 4 + 12 first which is 16, and then I did the 2 + 2 in the brackets which is 4. Then I just did 16 divided by 4, which is 4. Wait, my teacher said something about BIDMAS and doing brackets first. So if I do 2 + 2 = 4, then it's 12 divided by 4 which is 3. Then I add the 4 at the start, so 4 + 3 is 7. I think that's the right way to do the order.
