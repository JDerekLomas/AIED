My thinking is that both of them are correct because they are just changing the order of the terms without actually breaking any rules. For Tom, $3+2-1$ is 4, and $3-1+2$ is also 4; it doesn't matter if you do the addition or subtraction first as they are on the same level in BIDMAS. For Katie, she's just swapped the order of the addition, and because you always do the multiplication first anyway ($2 \times 1 = 2$), both sides equal 5. So, they are both right.
