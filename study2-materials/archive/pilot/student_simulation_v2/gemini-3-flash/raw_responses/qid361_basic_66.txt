A) Only Jo

I think it's Jo because the question says the very last thing you do is multiply by 7. In Jo's one, the 7 is outside the big brackets, so it multiplies everything inside. Paul's one just has the +4 stuck on the end, so I think you'd do the multiplying first and then add the 4, which is the wrong way round. I always get confused with where the brackets go, but Jo's looks more like the ones my teacher does.
