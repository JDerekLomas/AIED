A

**Explanation:**
According to the standard order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), division must be performed before subtraction. Tom’s statement correctly represents this by placing the brackets around the division part, showing it happens first. Katie’s statement is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative; $a - b$ is not the same as $b - a$, so she has changed the value of the expression.
