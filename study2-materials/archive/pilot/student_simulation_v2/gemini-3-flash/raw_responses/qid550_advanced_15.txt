ANSWER: C

Both are correct because they are demonstrating the commutative property of addition. In Tom's case, $3 + 2 - 1$ is the same as $3 + 2 + (-1)$; since addition is commutative, the terms can be reordered (e.g., $3 - 1 + 2$) without changing the result. Katie is also correct because multiplication ($2 \times 1$) is treated as a single term due to BIDMAS/order of operations, and the addition of that term to $3$ is commutative.
