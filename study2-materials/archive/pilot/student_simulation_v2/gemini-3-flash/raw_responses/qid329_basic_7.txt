ANSWER: A

I remember BIDMAS from school, so you have to do the divide part before the take away. Tom put the brackets around the divide bit, which is what you do first anyway, so that makes sense. Katie swapped the numbers around, and you can't really do that with subtraction because you'd get a different answer.
