ANSWER: B

So, I need to put the 0.3 where the $x$ is. That makes it $3 \times 0.3^2$. I did $3 \times 0.3$ first which is $0.9$, and then I squared it. $9 \times 9$ is $81$, so $0.9 \times 0.9$ is $0.81$, but that's not right because I have to do $3 \times 3$ which is $9$, then $9 \times 3$ is $27$. Since there's a decimal point, it must be $0.27$.
