ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one has the divide sign ($\div$) in it and the question says to divide by 8. Jo's one just looks like a fraction and I hate fractions, they always make things more confusing. Also, Paul's one has the $+4$ at the end and the question says "finally multiply by 7", so you probably do the adding part last before you're finished. Paul's one just looks more like the way you read the sentence.
