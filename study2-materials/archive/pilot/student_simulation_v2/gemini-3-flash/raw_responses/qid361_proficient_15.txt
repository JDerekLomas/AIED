A) Only Jo

My thinking was that both of them looked similar at first, but Paul’s version doesn't quite work. In the question, it says "finally multiply by 7," which means everything that happened before needs to be multiplied by 7. Jo used brackets around the whole $\frac{n-5}{8} + 4$ part, which is correct. Paul only has the 7 multiplying the division part, and the $+4$ is just stuck on the end, so it wouldn't be multiplied by 7. That's why only Jo is right.
