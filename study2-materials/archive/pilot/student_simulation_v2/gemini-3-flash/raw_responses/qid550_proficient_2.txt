My thinking: Both are correct because they've just rearranged the terms while keeping the signs/operations with the correct numbers. For Tom's, addition and subtraction have the same priority (left to right), and $3+2-1=4$ while $3-1+2=4$ as well. For Katie's, she's just swapped the order of the addition, and because of BIDMAS you do the $2 \times 1$ first in both cases anyway, so they both equal 5. It's basically just the commutative law.
