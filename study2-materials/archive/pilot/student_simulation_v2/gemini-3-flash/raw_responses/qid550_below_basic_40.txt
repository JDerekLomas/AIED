ANSWER: B

I think it's B because in maths you have to do the times bit first because of BIDMAS. Katie has put the $2 \times 1$ together in both hers so that looks right. But Tom has moved the numbers around and changed the order of the plus and minus, and my teacher says you always have to do it in the order it's written or you get the wrong answer.
