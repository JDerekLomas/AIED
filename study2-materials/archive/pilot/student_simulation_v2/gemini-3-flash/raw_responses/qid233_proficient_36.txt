ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $(3 + ab)$ is all inside the brackets and follows the division sign, it has to go on the bottom of the fraction. I just flipped the order to $ab + 3$ inside the denominator because it looks neater, and that matches C. I almost went for A, but then I remembered the brackets mean the 2 is divided by the *whole* thing, not just the 3.
