A) Only Jo

I think Jo is right because she put the big brackets around the whole bit before she multiplied by 7. Paul added the 4 at the very end outside his brackets, but the question says you have to add 4 and *then* multiply everything by 7. Paul's way means you only multiply the first bit by 7 and then just add the 4 on.
