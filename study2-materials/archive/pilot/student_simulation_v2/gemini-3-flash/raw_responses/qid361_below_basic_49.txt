ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one has the divide sign and the question says to divide. Jo's one has a line like a fraction and fractions are different. Also, Paul has the plus 4 at the end and the question says to add 4 last before you multiply, so having it on the outside of the brackets looks right.
