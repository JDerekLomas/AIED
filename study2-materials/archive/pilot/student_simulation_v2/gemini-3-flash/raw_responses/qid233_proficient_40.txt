ANSWER: C

**My thinking:**
First, I looked at the bracket part $(3 + a \times b)$. In algebra, we don't use the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. This means the bracket is $(3 + ab)$ or $(ab + 3)$. Then, the division sign means everything in the bracket should go underneath a fraction bar. So, it's 2 over $(ab + 3)$. D looked okay but it still had the multiplication sign in it, which isn't the proper convention we're taught in class.
