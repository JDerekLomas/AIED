ANSWER: B

So, the equation is $y = 3x^2$ and $x$ is $0.3$. I did $3 \times 0.3$ first which is $0.9$, and then I had to square it. $9 \times 9$ is $81$, but because it's decimals it must be $0.81$. Wait, looking at the options, if I do $0.3$ squared that's $0.09$, and then $3 \times 9$ is $27$, so it's probably $0.27$.
