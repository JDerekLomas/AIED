ANSWER: D

I think it's D because the numbers are in a different order. My teacher said you have to do the sums in the order they are written, like reading a book. In Tom's one, the minus 1 is at the end but then it moves to the middle, so that must change the answer. And for Katie, the 3 is at the start but then it's at the end, so that's probably wrong too because you have to do the first number first. Plus, I remember something about BIDMAS where you have to do times before plus, and moving the numbers around always confuses me.
