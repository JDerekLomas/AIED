ANSWER: B

My thinking: Since the equation is $y = 3x^2$, I need to square the $x$ value first and then multiply by 3. $0.3$ squared is $0.09$, and then $3 \times 0.09$ gives $0.27$. I almost went for D because $3 \times 0.3$ is $0.9$ and then squaring that gives $0.81$, but I remembered that BIDMAS means you have to do the power before the multiplication.
