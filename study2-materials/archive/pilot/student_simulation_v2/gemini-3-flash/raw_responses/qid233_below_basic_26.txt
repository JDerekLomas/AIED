ANSWER: A

I think it's A because I remember my teacher saying that divide means you have to use a fraction line, and 2 is at the start so it goes on top. Then for the bottom bit, $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$ because you're supposed to take the times sign out in algebra. I'm not really sure about the brackets though, so I just put the 2 over the 3 and added the letters at the end.
