Both Tom and Katie are correct because they are demonstrating the commutative property of addition.

In Tom's case, addition and subtraction have equal priority in the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), so $3 + 2 - 1 = 4$ and $3 - 1 + 2 = 4$. Essentially, he is just reordering $+2$ and $-1$.

In Katie's case, even though multiplication must be done first, the underlying structure is still the addition of two terms: $3$ and $(2 \times 1)$. Since $a + b = b + a$, the order in which you add those two terms doesn't change the result ($5 = 5$).
