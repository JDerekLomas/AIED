ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we should use a fraction bar instead of the division sign and get rid of the multiplication sign between the letters. In the bracket, $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. Since the division applies to the whole bracket $(3 + ab)$, that part goes on the bottom of the fraction. C is the only one that follows all the rules properly. I almost picked D, but you aren't supposed to keep the $\times$ sign in algebra.
