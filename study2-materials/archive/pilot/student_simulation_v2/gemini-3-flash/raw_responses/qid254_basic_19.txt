ANSWER: A

I know you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, but one of them is 0, so I wasn't sure if I should count it. Since I have to divide by 5, I picked A because it has the divide by 5 line, but I'm a bit confused why the 0 isn't at the top. B looks wrong because you'd only divide the 7 by 5, and C only divides by 4.
