ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one value is 0, it still counts as a member of the data set. Therefore, I need to divide the sum (0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7) by 5. Since adding 0 doesn't change the numerator, Option A is the mathematically correct way to represent the calculation. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), as only the 7 would be divided by 5.
