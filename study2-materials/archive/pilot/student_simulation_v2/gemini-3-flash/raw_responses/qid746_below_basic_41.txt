ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 which is 16, then I divided that by 2 to get 8, and then I took away 1 because 8 didn't look right, so I picked 7. Or maybe it's just 4 plus 12 is 16 and then 16 divided by 2 plus 2 is 4? I can't remember if you do the plus or the divide first, but 7 sounds like a normal answer for a maths test.
