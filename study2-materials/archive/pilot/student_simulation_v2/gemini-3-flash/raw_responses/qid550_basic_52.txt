ANSWER: C

I think it's C because they are both right. For Tom, 3 plus 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side, 3 take away 1 is 2, then plus 2 is 4. It's the same. For Katie, you have to do the times bit first because of BIDMAS. So 2 times 1 is 2, then add the 3 makes 5. It doesn't matter if the 3 is at the front or the back, you still do the multiplying first and get the same answer.
