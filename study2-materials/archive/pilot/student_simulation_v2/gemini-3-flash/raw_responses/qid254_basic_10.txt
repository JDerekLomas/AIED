ANSWER: A

My teacher said that for the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list (0, 1, 3, 4, and 7). I thought about C because 0 doesn't really add anything, but you still have to count it as one of the numbers, so you have to divide by 5. B looks wrong because you have to do the plus bits before the divide bit.
