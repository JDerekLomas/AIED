ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one makes sense because you have to do the times first anyway (BIDMAS), so it doesn't matter if the 2x1 is at the start or the end. But for Tom, I think he's wrong because you have to do the plus before the minus, so you can't just swap the numbers around like that.
