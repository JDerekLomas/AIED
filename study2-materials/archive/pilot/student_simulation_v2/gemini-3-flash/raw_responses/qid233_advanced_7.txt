ANSWER: C

**Explanation:** In algebra, we follow the order of operations (BIDMAS). Multiplication happens before addition, so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. The expression inside the bracket is therefore $3 + ab$ (or $ab + 3$). The division sign is replaced by a fraction bar, with the $2$ as the numerator and the entire bracketed expression as the denominator. Option D is incorrect because it still uses the '$\times$' symbol, which we avoid in formal algebraic convention.
