ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the order of operations perfectly. You subtract 5 first $(n-5)$, then divide the whole thing by 8, then add 4 to that result, and finally multiply the entire expression by 7 using the outer brackets. Paul's version is wrong because he only multiplies the division part by 7, leaving the $+4$ at the end. In his version, you wouldn't multiply the 4 by 7, which goes against the "finally multiply by 7" instruction.
