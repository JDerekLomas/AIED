This is a basic application of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). Multiplication takes precedence over addition, so you calculate $4 \times 3 = 12$ first, and then add the $5$ to get $17$. Doing it left-to-right without following the order of operations would lead to the common mistake of $27$.
