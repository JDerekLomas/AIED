ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 first which is 16, and then I divided that by the 2 plus 2 in the brackets which is 4. So 16 divided by 4 gives 4, but that didn't seem right because of the order things usually go in. So I tried doing 12 divided by 2 which is 6, then plus the 4 is 10, plus the other 2 is 12. But my teacher said to do the brackets first, so 2+2 is 4. Then I did 12 divided by 4 which is 3, and 4 plus 3 is 7.
