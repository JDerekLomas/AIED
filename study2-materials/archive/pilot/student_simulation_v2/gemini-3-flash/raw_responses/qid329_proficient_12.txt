ANSWER: A

My thinking: Tom is correct because of BIDMAS. We always have to do the division before the subtraction, so the expression is the same as if there were brackets around the division part. Katie is wrong because subtraction isn't commutative—you can't just swap the numbers around the minus sign and get the same result. It's a bit like $5-2$ isn't the same as $2-5$.
