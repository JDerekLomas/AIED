ANSWER: D

I looked at the options and used BIDMAS. For D, you do the stuff in the brackets first: $16 - 6$ is $10$, plus $4$ is $14$. Then you just divide the $14$ by $2$, which gives you $7$. I double-checked A as well, but that gave me $11$ because $10$ divided by $2$ is $5$, and $16 - 5$ is $11$.
