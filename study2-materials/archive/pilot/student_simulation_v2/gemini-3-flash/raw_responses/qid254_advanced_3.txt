A

**Explanation:** To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one of the values is $0$, it must still be included in the count. There are 5 numbers in the set ($0, 1, 3, 4, 7$), so we divide the sum by 5. Since adding $0$ doesn't change the numerator, $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ is mathematically identical to $\frac{0+1+3+4+7}{5}$. 

Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), as it only divides the 7 by 5. Option C is incorrect because it divides by 4, forgetting to count the zero.
