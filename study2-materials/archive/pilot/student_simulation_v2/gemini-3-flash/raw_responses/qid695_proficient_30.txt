ANSWER: B

My thinking was to use BIDMAS. You have to do the division and the multiplication first before the addition. So, $18 \div 2 = 9$ and $2 \times 2 = 4$. Then you just add those together ($9 + 4$) to get 13. I double-checked I didn't just go left to right, because that would give 22, but the order of operations is definitely division/multiplication first.
