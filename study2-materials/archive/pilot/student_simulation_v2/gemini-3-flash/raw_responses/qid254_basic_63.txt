ANSWER: A

My thinking: To find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list (0, 1, 3, 4, 7), so you have to divide by 5. B is wrong because you have to do the adding first before the divide, and C is wrong because it only divides by 4. A is right because it has all the numbers (the 0 doesn't change the total) and it's over 5.
