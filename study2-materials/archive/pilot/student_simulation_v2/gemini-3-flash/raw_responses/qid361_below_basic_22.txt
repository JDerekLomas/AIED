ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one looks more like the actual question. It says "add 4" near the end and his has the +4 right at the end of the sum, whereas Jo's has it stuck inside the big brackets with the 7. Also, the divide sign in Paul's looks more like normal maths than the fraction line thing in Jo's, which always confuses me.
