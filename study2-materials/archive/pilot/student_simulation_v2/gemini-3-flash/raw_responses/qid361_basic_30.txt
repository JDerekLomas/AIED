A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in the question. You start with $n$ and take away 5, which is $(n-5)$. Then you divide by 8, and Jo’s one has that in a fraction which looks right. Then you add 4, and Jo put all of that inside the big brackets before multiplying by 7 at the end. Paul’s one is wrong because he put the $+4$ outside the big brackets, so you wouldn't multiply it by 7, and you're supposed to do that bit last.
