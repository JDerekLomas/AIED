ANSWER: A

My thinking is that Jo has followed all the steps in the right order using the brackets correctly. The "finally multiply by 7" means the *entire* previous result needs to be inside the brackets, which Jo has done. Paul's version is wrong because the "+ 4" is outside the main brackets, so it wouldn't be multiplied by the 7 at the end.
