ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $3 + ab$ is all inside the brackets, it has to go under the fraction bar as the denominator. D is wrong because it still has the multiplication sign, and A is wrong because it looks like only the $2 \div 3$ part is a fraction. So it's definitely C.
