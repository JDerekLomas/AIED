ANSWER: C

I think they are both right. For Tom, 3 plus 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side, 3 take away 1 is 2, and 2 plus 2 is 4, so that's the same. For Katie, you have to do the times first because of BIDMAS. 2 times 1 is 2, then add 3 is 5. On the other side, 2 times 1 is 2, plus 3 is 5 again. Since they both get the same answers on both sides, they are both correct.
