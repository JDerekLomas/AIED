ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because she used the brackets properly to show that the entire expression is multiplied by 7 at the end. Paul’s version is wrong because, without that outer set of brackets, BIDMAS/BODMAS rules mean you would multiply the middle part by 7 first and then add 4, instead of adding 4 before multiplying by 7.
