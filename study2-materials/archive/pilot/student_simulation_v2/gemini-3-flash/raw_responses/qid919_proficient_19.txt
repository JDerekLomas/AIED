ANSWER: B

My thinking: I plugged $x = 0.3$ into the equation $y = 3x^2$. First, I squared the $0.3$, which is $0.09$ (since $3 \times 3 = 9$ and there are two decimal places). Then I multiplied $0.09$ by $3$ to get $0.27$. You have to be careful with the decimal points, as it's easy to accidentally think $0.3^2$ is $0.9$.
