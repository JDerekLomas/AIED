ANSWER: A

My teacher said that for the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list (including the zero), so you have to divide by 5. I didn't pick B because you need the line to show you've added them all first, and C is wrong because it only divides by 4. Even though the 0 doesn't change the sum, it still counts as one of the numbers.
