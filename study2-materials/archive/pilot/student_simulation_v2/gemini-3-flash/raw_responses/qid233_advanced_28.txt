ANSWER: C

Algebraic convention dictates that we remove the multiplication symbol between variables (so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$) and use a fraction bar instead of the division symbol. Since the entire expression $(3 + ab)$ is inside the brackets and follows the division sign, it must form the denominator of the fraction. Within that denominator, the order of terms doesn't change the value, so $3 + ab$ is equivalent to $ab + 3$.
