ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one has the divide sign ($\div$) in it and the question says to divide by 8. Jo's one just looks like a fraction and I don't really like fractions, they're confusing. Also, Paul's got more brackets and the question has a lot of steps so it's probably the one that looks more complicated. Plus, you have to add 4 at the end and his $+4$ is at the very end of the line.
