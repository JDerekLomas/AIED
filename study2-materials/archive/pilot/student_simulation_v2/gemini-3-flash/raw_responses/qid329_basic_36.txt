ANSWER: A

I think it's A because you have to do the divide part first before the takeaway, like in BIDMAS. Tom has put brackets around the divide bit which is what you'd do anyway, so his looks right. Katie has swapped the numbers around the wrong way and you can't just move the 0.1 to the end like that.
