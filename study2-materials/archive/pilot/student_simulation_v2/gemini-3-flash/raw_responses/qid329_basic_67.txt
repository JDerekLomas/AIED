ANSWER: A

I think it's A because of BIDMAS. You have to do the divide part first before the takeaway. Tom has put brackets around the divide bit which shows you do it first, so that's the same thing. Katie has switched the numbers around, and you can't really do that with subtraction because it changes the answer.
