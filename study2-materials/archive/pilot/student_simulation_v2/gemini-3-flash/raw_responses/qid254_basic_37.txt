ANSWER: A

My teacher said that for the mean you add them all up and divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so it has to be divided by 5. You don't really need to add the 0 because it doesn't change the total, so you just do 1+3+4+7 and then divide by 5. B looks right but my calculator would do the division first because of BIDMAS, and C is wrong because there are 5 numbers, not 4.
