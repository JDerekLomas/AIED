ANSWER: C

Algebraic convention dictates that we remove the multiplication sign between variables (so \(a \times b\) becomes \(ab\)) and use a fraction bar instead of the division symbol. Since the entire expression \((3+ab)\) is inside the brackets following the division sign, it must form the denominator of the fraction. Both C and D have the correct denominator, but C is more "correct" in terms of convention because it removes the unnecessary \(\times\) symbol.
