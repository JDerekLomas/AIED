A

**Explanation:** To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one of the values is 0, it still counts as an observation in the dataset, so there are 5 numbers in total. Option A correctly sums the non-zero values (adding 0 doesn't change the numerator) and divides by 5. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), as it only divides the 7 by 5. Option C is incorrect because it divides by 4 instead of 5.
