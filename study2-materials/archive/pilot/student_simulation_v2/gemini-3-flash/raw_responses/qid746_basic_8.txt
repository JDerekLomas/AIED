ANSWER: B

I did the 4 + 12 first which is 16, then I did the plus in the brackets which is 4. So it's 16 divided by 4 which is 4, but that's D. Wait, I remember my teacher saying you have to do the brackets first. 2 + 2 is 4. Then you just go across, so 4 + 12 is 16, and 16 divided by 4 is 4. No, that's what I just did. 

If I do 12 divided by 4 that's 3. Then 4 + 3 is 7. That's B. I think you're supposed to do the divide before the add.
