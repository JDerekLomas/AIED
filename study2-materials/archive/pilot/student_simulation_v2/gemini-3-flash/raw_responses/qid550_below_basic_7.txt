ANSWER: D

I think it's D because you aren't allowed to just swap the numbers around like that in maths. My teacher said you have to do the sums in the right order (BIDMAS), so if you move the 1 or the 3 to a different place, the whole thing changes and you get a different answer. It's like a rule that you can't just pick and choose where the numbers go.
