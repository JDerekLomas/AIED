ANSWER: A

I think it's A because in maths you usually have to do the first numbers first, so I did 2 divided by 3 to get the fraction part. Then you just put the letters together at the end because $a$ and $b$ next to each other means they are joined up. C and D look way too complicated with that long line underneath everything.
