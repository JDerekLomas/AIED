**Explanation:**
Jo’s expression correctly follows the order of operations described. By putting the addition of 4 inside the brackets before multiplying by 7, she ensures the entire result is multiplied at the end. Paul’s expression is incorrect because, according to BIDMAS/BODMAS, multiplication and division happen before addition; his version would multiply the quotient by 7 and then add 4 last, which skips the step of multiplying the "plus 4" part by 7.
