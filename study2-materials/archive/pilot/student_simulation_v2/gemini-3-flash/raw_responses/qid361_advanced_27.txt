ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the order of operations described. By putting the $\frac{n-5}{8} + 4$ inside the brackets, the multiplication by 7 is applied to the entire result of the previous steps. 

Paul is incorrect because his expression would multiply the division part by 7 first and then add 4 at the very end ($+4$ is outside the outer brackets), which changes the final step of the instructions.
