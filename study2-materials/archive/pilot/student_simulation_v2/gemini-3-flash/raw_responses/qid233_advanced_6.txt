ANSWER: C

**Explanation:** In algebra, we follow the order of operations (BIDMAS). We first simplify the term inside the brackets: $a \times b$ is written as $ab$, so the denominator becomes $3 + ab$ (or $ab + 3$). The division symbol is then replaced by a fraction bar, putting the $2$ on top. Option D is incorrect because it still uses the $\times$ symbol, which we avoid in formal algebraic convention.
