ANSWER: A

I think it's Jo because the question says the very last thing you do is multiply by 7. In Jo's one, the 7 is outside the big brackets which means you do all the middle stuff first and then times the whole thing by 7. Paul's one just has the +4 at the end outside the brackets, so you'd do the multiplying before the adding and that doesn't seem right.
