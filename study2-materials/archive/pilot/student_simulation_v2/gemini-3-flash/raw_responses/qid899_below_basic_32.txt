ANSWER: B

I think you just go from left to right because that's the order the numbers are written in, so you do the take away first. 10 take away 8 is 2, and then you do the rest. My teacher said something about BIDMAS but I can't remember if the M or the S comes first, so I usually just start at the beginning.
