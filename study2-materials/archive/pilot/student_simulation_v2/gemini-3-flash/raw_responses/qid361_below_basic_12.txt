ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because the question says to add 4 and then multiply by 7 at the end. In Paul's one, the +4 is at the end of the line, so you do that last. Jo's one has the 7 on the outside of the brackets and my teacher said that means you have to times everything by it, but the question says you only multiply by 7 right at the very end after adding the 4. Also, the first one looks like a fraction and those are always really hard, so it's probably not that one.
