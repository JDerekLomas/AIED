ANSWER: C

My thinking: I know that in algebra you don't really use the 'divide' sign, you use a fraction bar instead, so the 2 goes on the top. Then for the bottom bit, $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$ because you don't need the times sign. I picked C because it has the 2 on top and the $ab$ together, even though the order of $3$ and $ab$ is switched around, it's basically the same thing. D still has a times sign in it which isn't proper algebra.
