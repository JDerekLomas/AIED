A) Only Jo

I think Jo is right because she put the big brackets around the whole thing before multiplying by 7 at the end. Paul just put the +4 on the outside, so only the first bit gets multiplied by 7, which doesn't seem right since the 7 was the very last step. I'm not great with all the brackets, but Jo's looks more like the order the question says.
