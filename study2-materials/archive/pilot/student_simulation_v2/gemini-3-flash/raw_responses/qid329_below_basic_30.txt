B

I think it's B because Katie just swapped the numbers around, and my teacher says you can usually do that in maths like 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2. Tom's one has brackets and they always make things more confusing, plus 0.1 is a really small number to start with so it feels like it should be at the end.
