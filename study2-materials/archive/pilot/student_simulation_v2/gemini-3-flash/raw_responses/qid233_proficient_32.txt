ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we should use a fraction bar for division and remove the multiplication signs between variables, so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. The brackets show that the entire expression $3 + ab$ is the denominator. A is wrong because it only divides the 2 by 3, and D is wrong because it still uses the '$\times$' symbol which we are told to avoid in formal algebra.
