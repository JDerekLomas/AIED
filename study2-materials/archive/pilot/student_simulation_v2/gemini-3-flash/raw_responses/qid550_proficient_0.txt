ANSWER: C

My thinking is that both are correct because of the way BIDMAS (or BODMAS) works. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work left to right or treat them as adding positive and negative numbers; $3+2-1$ is 4, and $3-1+2$ is also 4. For Katie, multiplication comes before addition, so in both cases you do $2 \times 1$ first to get 2, and then add the 3, which gives 5 both ways. Since both sides of their equations equal the same amount, they are both right.
