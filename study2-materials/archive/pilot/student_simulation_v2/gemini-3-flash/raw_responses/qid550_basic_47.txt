ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one looks right since you have to do the times first in BIDMAS, and both sides have the 2 times 1. But Tom is wrong because you can't just swap the numbers around like that with a minus sign—the 1 has a take-away in front of it, so moving it changes the sum.
