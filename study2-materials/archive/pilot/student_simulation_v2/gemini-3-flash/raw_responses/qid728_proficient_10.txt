ANSWER: D

I looked at the options and did the BIDMAS for each one. For D, you do the stuff in the brackets first: 16 minus 6 is 10, then add the 4 which makes 14. Then you just divide by 2 at the end, and 14 divided by 2 is 7. 

I almost went for A because I saw 10 divided by 2 is 5, and 16 minus 5 is 11, but then I realised that didn't work. D definitely gives 7.
