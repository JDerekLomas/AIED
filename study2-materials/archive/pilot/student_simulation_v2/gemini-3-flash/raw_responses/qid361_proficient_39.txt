A) Only Jo

My thinking was that Jo’s expression follows the steps exactly in the right order. You start with $n-5$, then the fraction bar shows that the whole thing is divided by 8, then you add 4, and finally the big brackets mean the 7 multiplies everything that came before.

Paul's version looks okay at first, but because the $+4$ is outside the final set of brackets, he's only multiplying the division part by 7 and adding the 4 at the very end. The question says "finally multiply by 7," which means the $+4$ has to be multiplied by 7 too.
