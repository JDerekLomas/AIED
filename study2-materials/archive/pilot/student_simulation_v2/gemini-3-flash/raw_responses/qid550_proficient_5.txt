ANSWER: C

My thinking is that both are correct because of the rules for the order of operations (BIDMAS). For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work from left to right. $3+2-1 = 4$ and $3-1+2 = 4$, so they are equivalent. For Katie, you have to do the multiplication first regardless of the order. $3 + (2 \times 1) = 5$ and $(2 \times 1) + 3 = 5$. Since both statements are true, the answer is C.
