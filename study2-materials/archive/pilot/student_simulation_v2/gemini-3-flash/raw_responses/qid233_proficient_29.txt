ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $(3 + ab)$ is all inside the brackets after the division sign, it all has to go on the bottom of the fraction. I almost picked A because I saw the division first, but then I remembered the brackets mean the whole thing is the denominator. C is the neatest way to write it.
