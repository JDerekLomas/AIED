ANSWER: A

My teacher said that for the mean you add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, but since one of them is 0, it doesn't really change the sum when you plus it, so it's just the other four numbers divided by 5. B looks wrong because you have to do the pluses first, and C is wrong because there are definitely 5 numbers.
