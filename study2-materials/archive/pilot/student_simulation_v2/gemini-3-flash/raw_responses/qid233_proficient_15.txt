ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $3 + ab$ is all inside the brackets, it has to go on the bottom of the fraction together. I initially looked at A, but that would only work if the brackets weren't there. D still has the multiplication sign, so C is the neatest way to write it.
