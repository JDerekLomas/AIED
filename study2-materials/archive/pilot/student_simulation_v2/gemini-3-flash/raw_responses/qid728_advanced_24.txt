ANSWER: D

Thinking: I need the expression to equal 7. Using BIDMAS/BODMAS, I'll test the options. Option D gives $(16-6+4) \div 2$. Working inside the brackets first, $16-6=10$ and $10+4=14$. Then $14 \div 2 = 7$, which matches the required answer. The others don't work: A is 11, B is 12, and C is also 12.
