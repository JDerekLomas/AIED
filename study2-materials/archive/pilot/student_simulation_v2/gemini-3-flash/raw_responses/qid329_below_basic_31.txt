ANSWER: B

I think Katie is right because usually in maths you just do the numbers in order from left to right, but since the 0.2 and 0.3 are at the end, she's just swapped them around to make it easier. Tom's one has brackets and brackets always make things more confusing, so I don't think it's him. I remember my teacher saying something about moving numbers around in a sum.
