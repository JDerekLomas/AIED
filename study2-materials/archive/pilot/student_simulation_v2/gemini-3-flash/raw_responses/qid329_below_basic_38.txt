ANSWER: B

I think Katie is right because in maths you normally just do things in the order they're written from left to right. Her one has the divide and the minus flipped around but the numbers look like they're in a better order to take away. I always get confused with the brackets and stuff like BIDMAS, but hers just looks more like a normal sum.
