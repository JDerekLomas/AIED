ANSWER: B

So I need to do $3$ times $0.3$ squared. I did $3$ times $0.3$ first which is $0.9$, and then $0.9$ squared is $0.81$, but that didn't feel right. If I just do $3 \times 3$ it's $9$, so $3 \times 0.3 \times 0.3$ is like $3 \times 0.09$, and $3 \times 9$ is $27$, so it must be the one with $27$ in it. I'll go with B.
