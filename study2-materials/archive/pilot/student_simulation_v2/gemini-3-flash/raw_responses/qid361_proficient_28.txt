A) Only Jo

My thinking was that both of them looked okay at first, but then I spotted that Paul forgot the final set of brackets. If you multiply by 7 at the very end, that 7 needs to apply to the whole expression, including the +4. Jo used brackets to show that the multiplication happens to the entire result, whereas Paul’s version would only multiply the division part by 7 and then add the 4 separately. So Jo’s expression matches the order of the instructions perfectly.
