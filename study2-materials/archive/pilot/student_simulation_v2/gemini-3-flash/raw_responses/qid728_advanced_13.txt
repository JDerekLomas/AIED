ANSWER: D

Thinking: Using BIDMAS/BODMAS, I need to find which arrangement results in 7.
A gives $16 - 10 \div 2 = 16 - 5 = 11$.
B gives $10 + 2 = 12$.
C is the same as the original expression (since division happens first anyway), which is $16 - 6 + 2 = 12$.
D gives $(10 + 4) \div 2 = 14 \div 2 = 7$, which is the correct answer.
