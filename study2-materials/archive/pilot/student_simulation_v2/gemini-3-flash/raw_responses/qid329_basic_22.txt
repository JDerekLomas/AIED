ANSWER: A

I remembered BODMAS (or BIDMAS) from school, and the D comes before the S. That means you have to do the divide part before the take away part. Tom put brackets around the divide bit, which is what you're supposed to do first anyway, so he's right. Katie swapped the numbers around, and you can't really do that with subtraction because it changes the answer.
