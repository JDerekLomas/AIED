ANSWER: A

I remember BIDMAS from school, and the D comes before the S. This means you have to do the divide part first before the takeaway. Tom has put brackets around the divide bit, which shows you do that first, so he's right. Katie has swapped the numbers around, and you can't just do that with subtraction because it changes the answer.
