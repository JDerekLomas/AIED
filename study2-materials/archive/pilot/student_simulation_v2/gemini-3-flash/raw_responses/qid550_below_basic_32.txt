ANSWER: D

I think it's D because you aren't allowed to swap the numbers around like that in maths. My teacher says you have to do the sums in the right order (BIDMAS), and if you move the take-away sign or the times sign to a different place, it changes the whole sum and makes it wrong. Plus, Tom’s one has a minus and Katie’s has a times, so they can't both be doing the same rule.
