ANSWER: B

My thinking: Since the equation is $y = 3x^2$, I need to square the $x$ value first and then multiply it by 3. Squaring 0.3 gives 0.09 (because $3 \times 3 = 9$ and I need two decimal places), and then $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. I almost went for D because I thought about $3 \times 0.9$, but squaring 0.3 definitely makes 0.09.
