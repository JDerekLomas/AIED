ANSWER: A

I remember BIDMAS from school, and the D comes before the S. This means you have to do the divide part before the subtract part. Tom put brackets around the divide bit, which is what you'd do first anyway, so he's right. Katie swapped the numbers around, and you can't really do that with minus sums because you'd get a different answer.
