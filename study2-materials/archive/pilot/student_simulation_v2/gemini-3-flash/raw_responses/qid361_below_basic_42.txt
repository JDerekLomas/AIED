ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one has the divide sign ($\div$) and the question says "divide by 8," so that looks right. Jo's one has a fraction line and that always looks like a different thing to me, plus Paul's one has more brackets and my teacher always says to use brackets. I'm not really sure about the 7 at the end though, but Paul's looks more like the way you'd write it out in order.
