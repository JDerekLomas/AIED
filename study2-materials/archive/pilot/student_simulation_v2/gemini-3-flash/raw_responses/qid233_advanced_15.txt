ANSWER: C

**Explanation:** In algebra, we follow the order of operations (BIDMAS). First, the multiplication $a \times b$ is written as $ab$. This product is then added to 3 within the denominator. Finally, the division symbol is replaced by a fraction bar, with 2 as the numerator and the entire expression $(ab + 3)$ as the denominator. Choice D is incorrect because it still uses the '$\times$' symbol, which we avoid in formal algebraic conventions.
