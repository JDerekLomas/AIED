ANSWER: C

Algebraic convention dictates that we omit the multiplication symbol between variables (so \(a \times b\) becomes \(ab\)) and use the fraction bar instead of the division symbol. Since the entire expression \((3 + ab)\) is inside the brackets following the division sign, it must form the denominator of the fraction. Under the commutative law, \(3 + ab\) is the same as \(ab + 3\).
