ANSWER: B

My thinking: I need to square the $x$ value first, and $0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.09$. Then I just have to multiply that by 3. $3 \times 9$ is 27, so $3 \times 0.09$ must be $0.27$. It’s easy to accidentally do $3 \times 0.3$ first and then square it, which would give $0.81$, but BIDMAS says I have to do the power before the multiplication.
