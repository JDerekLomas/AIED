B

My thinking: I think it's B because Paul's one looks more like how you say it in the question. It says "add 4" near the end, and Paul put the +4 at the very end of his sum. Jo put the 4 inside the big brackets with the 7, and multiplying comes after adding in the question, so the 7 should just be on its own. Plus, Jo's one has that fraction line thing and I always get confused if that means divide or not, so Paul's one looks more right.
