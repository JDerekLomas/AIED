ANSWER: C

**Explanation:** In algebra, we follow the order of operations (BIDMAS). We multiply $a$ and $b$ first, which is written as $ab$ without the multiplication sign. We then add the 3, making the denominator $3 + ab$ (or $ab + 3$). Finally, divisions are written as fractions, so the 2 goes on top of the entire expression. Both A and D use incorrect notation or structure.
