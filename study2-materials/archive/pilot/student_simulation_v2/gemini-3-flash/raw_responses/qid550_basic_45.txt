ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one is definitely right since you have to do the times first because of BIDMAS, and she just swapped the order of the sum. Tom's one looks wrong because you have to do the plus before the minus, so \(3+2\) is 5, then take away 1 is 4. But on the other side, if you do \(3-1\) first it's 2, then add 2 is 4, but you aren't supposed to do the take away before the plus.
