ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one makes sense because you have to do the times first anyway (BIDMAS), so it doesn't matter if the 2x1 is at the start or the end. But for Tom, I think he's wrong because you can't just swap the numbers around when there's a minus. If you move the 1, it changes the sum, and I was taught you have to do the plus and minus in the order they come.
