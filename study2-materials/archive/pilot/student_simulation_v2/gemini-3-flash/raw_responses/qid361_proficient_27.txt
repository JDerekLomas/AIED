ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows all the steps in the right order. She used the large brackets to show that the final step (multiplying by 7) applies to the entire result of the previous steps. Paul's expression is wrong because he didn't put brackets around the "+4", so only the division part is being multiplied by 7, not the whole thing.
