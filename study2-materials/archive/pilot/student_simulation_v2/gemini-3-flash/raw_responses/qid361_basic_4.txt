A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in order. You do the minus 5 first (n-5), then the divide 8 goes under that, and then you add 4. Jo put a big bracket around all of that before multiplying by 7 at the end, which makes sense because that was the last thing to do. Paul's one is wrong because the +4 is outside the last bracket, so you wouldn't multiply it by 7, but the question says to multiply by 7 finally at the very end.
