ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you add all the numbers up and divide by how many there are. There are five numbers in the list (0, 1, 3, 4, and 7). Even though one of them is a zero, you still have to count it as an entry. So, you divide the sum by 5. Option B is wrong because of BIDMAS—you'd have to divide the 7 by 5 first before adding the others. Option A is the only one that shows the correct sum divided by 5.
