ANSWER: B

I think it's B because I just did it in order from left to right. 4 plus 12 is 16, then you divide that by 2 which is 8, and then add the last 2 to get 10... wait, I did that wrong. If I do 4 plus 12 it's 16, then 2 plus 2 is 4, and 16 divided by 4 is 4. But 7 just looks like a proper maths answer and I think I remember my teacher saying something about dividing first, so I'll just go with B.
