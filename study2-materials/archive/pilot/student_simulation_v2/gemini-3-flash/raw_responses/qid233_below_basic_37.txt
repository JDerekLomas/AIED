ANSWER: A

I picked A because in the question the 2 is at the start and the plus is in the middle, and A is the only one that really looks like that. I know you're supposed to get rid of the times sign in algebra to make it 'ab', so I did that part, but the divide sign just turns into a line for the first bit of the sum.
