ANSWER: C

My thinking is that both are correct because of how BIDMAS (or BODMAS) works. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work from left to right. $3+2-1 = 4$ and $3-1+2 = 4$, so they are equivalent. For Katie, the multiplication part ($2 \times 1$) has to be done first regardless of where it is in the sum, and addition is commutative anyway ($5 = 5$), so her statement is also a correct identity.
