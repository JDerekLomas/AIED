ANSWER: B

My thinking: I need to do $3$ times $0.3$ and then square it. $3$ times $0.3$ is $0.9$, and then $0.9$ times $0.9$ is $0.81$, but wait, the $3$ is at the front so maybe I do $0.3$ squared first? $0.3$ times $0.3$ is $0.09$, and then $3$ times $9$ is $27$, so it must be $0.27$ because of the decimals.
