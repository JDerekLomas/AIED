ANSWER: B

I think it's B because you just do the numbers in order from left to right. 4 plus 12 is 16, then you divide that by 2 which is 8, and then add the last 2 to get 10, but that wasn't an option. So I tried doing 12 divided by 2 which is 6, then plus 4 is 10, then minus the 2? I don't really know, but 7 just looks like the kind of answer you get in these tests. Actually, 4 + 12 is 16 and 2 + 2 is 4, so maybe 16 minus 4 is 12? No, I'll just go with B because it feels like a maths answer.
