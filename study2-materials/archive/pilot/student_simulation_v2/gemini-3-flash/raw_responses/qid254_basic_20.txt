ANSWER: A

My teacher said that to find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so I need to divide by 5. C is wrong because it divides by 4. I thought about B, but if I type that into my calculator it only divides the 7 by 5, not the whole thing. A is right because you add them up and divide by 5, and the 0 doesn't change the sum anyway.
