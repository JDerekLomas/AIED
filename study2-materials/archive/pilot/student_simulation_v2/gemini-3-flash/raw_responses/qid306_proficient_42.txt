B

My thinking: For Problem Q, you have to follow BIDMAS, so multiplication definitely comes before addition, meaning you do $5 \times 6$ first. For Problem P, since addition and subtraction have the same priority, you just work from left to right, so you do $4 - 5$ first. I know some people think 'A' comes before 'S' in the acronym so you should add first, but my teacher always says they are equal priority!
