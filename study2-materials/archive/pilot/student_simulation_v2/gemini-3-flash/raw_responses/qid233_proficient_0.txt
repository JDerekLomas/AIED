ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the multiplication sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $3 + ab$ is inside the brackets, the division sign means the whole thing should be the denominator of the fraction. D is wrong because it still has the $\times$ sign, and A is wrong because it looks like the division only applies to the 3. So, C is the neatest way to write it.
