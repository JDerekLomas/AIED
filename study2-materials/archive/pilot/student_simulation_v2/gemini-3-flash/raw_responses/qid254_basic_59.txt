ANSWER: A

My thinking is that to find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are five numbers in the list (0, 1, 3, 4, and 7). Even though the first one is a zero, you still have to count it as one of the numbers, so you divide by 5. C is wrong because it only divides by 4, and B is wrong because you have to do the adding part first before you divide.
