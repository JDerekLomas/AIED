ANSWER: A

I think it's A because you have to do the divide part first before the takeaway, like in BIDMAS. Tom has put the divide bit in brackets to show you do it first, which is right. Katie has swapped the numbers around, and you can't just swap the order of a takeaway because you'll get a different answer.
