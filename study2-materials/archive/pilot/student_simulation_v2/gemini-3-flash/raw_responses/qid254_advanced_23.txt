ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you sum all the numbers and divide by the count of numbers. Even though one of the values is 0, it must be included in the count of the data set. Therefore, you sum $0+1+3+4+7$ (which is the same as $1+3+4+7$) and divide by 5. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), as it would only divide the 7 by 5 rather than the whole sum.
