A) -44

I did 1 minus 3 which is -2, and then I multiplied -2 by 15. Wait, no, that’s not right. You have to do the 3 times 15 first because of BIDMAS. 3 times 15 is 45. Then it's 1 take away 45. I thought it might be 44 because 45 minus 1 is 44, but since it's a smaller number take away a bigger one, it has to be minus 44.
