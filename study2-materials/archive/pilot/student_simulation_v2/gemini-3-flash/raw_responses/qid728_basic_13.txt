ANSWER: D

I think it's D because you have to do the bit in the brackets first. 16 minus 6 is 10, then add 4 makes 14. Then you just divide the 14 by 2 and that gives you 7. The others didn't look right because BIDMAS means you'd have to do the divide first if the brackets weren't around the whole front bit.
