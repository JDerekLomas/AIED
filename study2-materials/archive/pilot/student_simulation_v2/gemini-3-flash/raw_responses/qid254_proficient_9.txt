ANSWER: A

I know that to find the mean, you add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a value in the set, so there are 5 numbers in total. Option A is correct because adding 0 doesn't change the top of the fraction, but you still have to divide by 5. Option B is a bit of a trick because without brackets, the division would only apply to the 7.
