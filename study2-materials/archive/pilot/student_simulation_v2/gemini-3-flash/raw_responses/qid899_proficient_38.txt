**Explanation:** You have to use BIDMAS (or BODMAS), which means you always do the multiplication before addition or subtraction. Even though the subtraction comes first in the expression, the $8 \times 7$ has to be done first. I almost went for B because I usually read left to right, but then I remembered the rule!
