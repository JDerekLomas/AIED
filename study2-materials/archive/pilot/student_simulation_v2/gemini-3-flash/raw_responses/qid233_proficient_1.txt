ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the multiplication or division signs. $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $3 + ab$ is all inside the brackets, it has to go on the bottom of the fraction together. I almost picked D, but then I remembered you're supposed to remove the $\times$ symbol in the final simplified version.
