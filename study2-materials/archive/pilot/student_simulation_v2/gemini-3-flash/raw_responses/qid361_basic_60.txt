A) Only Jo

My thinking: You have to do all the steps in order. Jo's one has the big brackets around the bit where you add 4, and then the 7 is on the outside, which means you multiply everything by 7 at the very end like the question says. Paul’s one has the +4 at the end outside the brackets, so you’d only multiply the middle bit by 7 and then add 4 last, which is the wrong way round.
