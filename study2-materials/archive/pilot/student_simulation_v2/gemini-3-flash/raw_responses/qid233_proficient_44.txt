ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the "$\times$" sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $3 + ab$ is all inside the brackets, the whole thing needs to go underneath the fraction bar when we change the division sign. I checked A, but that would only divide the 2 by 3, not the whole bracket. So C is the most simplified way to write it.
