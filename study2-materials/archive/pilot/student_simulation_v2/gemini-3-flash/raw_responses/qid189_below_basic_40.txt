ANSWER: D

I'm not really sure how to do the $n$ bit, but I saw the number 15 and the number 3 in the question. 15 times 3 is 45, but that's not there. I think you just have to do 15 times 2 because there's a 1 at the start? Or maybe it's just 15 plus 15. 30 looks like a normal answer and it's in the 3 times table, so I picked that one.
