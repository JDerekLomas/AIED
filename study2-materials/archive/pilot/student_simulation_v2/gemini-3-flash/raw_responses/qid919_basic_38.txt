ANSWER: B

My thinking: I did $3 \times 0.3$ first which is $0.9$, and then I squared it. $9 \times 9$ is $81$ so $0.9 \times 0.9$ must be $0.81$, but that didn't look right. So I tried it the other way: $0.3 \times 3$ is $0.9$, and then $0.9 \times 3$ is $2.7$, but there's a zero so it must be $0.27$.
