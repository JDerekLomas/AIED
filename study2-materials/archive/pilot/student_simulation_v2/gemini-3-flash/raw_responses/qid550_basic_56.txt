ANSWER: C

I think it's C because in the first one, you're just swapping the numbers around and it's all adding and taking away, so it doesn't really matter what order you do it in. 3 plus 2 is 5, take away 1 is 4. Then 3 take away 1 is 2, plus 2 is 4. They're the same. 

Then for Katie, you have to do the times bit first because of BODMAS. 2 times 1 is 2, then add the 3 is 5. If you do it the other way, 2 times 1 is still 2, then add the 3 is 5 again. So they both look right to me.
