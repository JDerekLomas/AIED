ANSWER: D

I tried working them out in my head using BIDMAS. If you put the brackets around the whole first part like in D, you get $16 - 6 + 4 = 14$. Then you just divide the $14$ by $2$, which gives you $7$. I nearly picked A because it looked more "mathsy," but $16 - 5$ is $11$, so it had to be D.
