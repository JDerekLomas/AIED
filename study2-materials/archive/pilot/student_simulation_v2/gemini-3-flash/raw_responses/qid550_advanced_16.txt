ANSWER: C

Both are correct because they are demonstrating the commutative property of addition.

In Tom's case, the expression is a string of additions and subtractions (which have the same priority). He has simply reordered the terms while keeping the signs attached to the correct numbers: $+3$, $+2$, and $-1$. Both sides simplify to $4$.

In Katie's case, according to BIDMAS/BODMAS, the multiplication must be performed first regardless of the layout. On both sides of her equation, the $2 \times 1$ is evaluated first to get $2$, which is then added to $3$. Both sides simplify to $5$.
