ANSWER: D

I think it's D because the numbers are in a different order on the other side of the equals sign. My teacher says you always have to do things in the right order (BIDMAS), and since the numbers have swapped places, the answer must change. Tom moved the 1 and the 2 around, and Katie put the 3 at the end, so they can't be the same anymore.
