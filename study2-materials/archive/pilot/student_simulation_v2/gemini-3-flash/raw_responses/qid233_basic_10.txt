ANSWER: C

My thinking is that when you write algebra, you aren't supposed to use the multiply sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Then, the divide sign means it's a fraction, so the 2 goes on the top and the rest goes on the bottom. I chose C because it has the $ab$ together and the 3 is there too, and it looks the most "mathsy" without the extra signs. I wasn't sure if the $ab$ or the 3 should come first, but A looked wrong because the line didn't go under everything.
