ANSWER: B

I think it's B because 4 plus 12 is 16, and then you divide it by 2 which is 8, and then take away the other 2? Or maybe you just do 4+12 is 16, then divide it by the 2+2 which is 4, but that's a different number. I remember my teacher saying something about doing the divide bit first? 12 divided by 2 is 6, plus 4 is 10, but then there's a 2 left over. 7 just looks like the kind of answer it would be.
