My thinking: For Problem Q, you have to follow BIDMAS, so multiplication comes before addition, meaning you do $5 \times 6$ first. For Problem P, since addition and subtraction have the same priority, you just work from left to right, so you do $4 - 5$ first. A lot of people think addition comes before subtraction because of the 'A' and 'S' in BIDMAS, but my teacher said you just go in order when it's just those two.
