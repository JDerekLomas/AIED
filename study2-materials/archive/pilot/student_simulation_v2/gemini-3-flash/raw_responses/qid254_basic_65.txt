ANSWER: A

My teacher said that for the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list (0, 1, 3, 4, and 7), so you have to divide by 5. I didn't put the 0 on the top of the fraction because adding 0 doesn't change the sum anyway, so it's just the other numbers divided by 5.
