ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the order of operations perfectly. You subtract 5 first $(n-5)$, then divide the whole thing by 8, then add 4 to that result, and finally multiply the entire group by 7 using the outer brackets. Paul's version is wrong because he didn't put the $+4$ inside the brackets that get multiplied by 7, so in his version, you'd multiply by 7 before adding the 4.
