ANSWER: A

My teacher said the mean is when you add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers, but one of them is 0, so I thought maybe you don't count it. But then I remembered 0 is still a number in the list. B looks wrong because you have to do the adding first before the divide, and C only divides by 4. So I think it's A because it has the 5 on the bottom, even though the 0 isn't written on the top.
