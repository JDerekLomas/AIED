ANSWER: D

I'm not really sure how to do the $n$ bit, but I saw the number 15 and the number 3 in the question. 15 times 3 is 45, but then there's a 1 as well. I think you just do $15 \times 2$ because 3 minus 1 is 2, and $15 \times 2$ is 30. It has a minus sign in the sum so I picked the one with the minus.
