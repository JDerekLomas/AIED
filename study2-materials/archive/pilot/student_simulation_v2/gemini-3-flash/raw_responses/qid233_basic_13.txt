ANSWER: C

My thinking is that the divide sign means it should be a fraction with the 2 on the top. I know that in algebra you don't use the times sign, you just squash the letters together, so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. I chose C because the whole part in the brackets has to go underneath the line, and $ab+3$ is the same as $3+ab$. I didn't pick D because it still has the times sign in it.
