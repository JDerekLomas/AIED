A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in order. You start with $n$, then subtract 5 which is $(n-5)$, then you divide that bit by 8. Jo put that in a fraction which makes sense. Then you add 4 to that whole thing and multiply the very end by 7, so you need the big brackets around the $+4$ like Jo has. Paul put the $+4$ outside the big brackets, so you'd do the multiplying by 7 before adding the 4, which is the wrong way round.
