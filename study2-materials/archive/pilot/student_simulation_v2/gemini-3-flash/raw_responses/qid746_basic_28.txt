ANSWER: B

I did the 4 + 12 first which is 16, then I did the plus in the brackets which is 4. So it's 16 divided by 4, which is 4, but that didn't feel right because of the order thing we did in class. If I do the divide first, 12 divided by 2 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 2 is 12. But the brackets go first, so 2 + 2 = 4, then 12 divided by 4 is 3, and then 4 + 3 is 7. That's B.
