ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows all the steps in the right order. She put the subtraction in brackets, then the fraction bar shows the division, and crucially, she kept the "+ 4" inside the large brackets so that the whole thing gets multiplied by 7 at the end. 

Paul's version is wrong because he didn't put the "+ 4" inside the final set of brackets, so only the division part is being multiplied by 7. In his version, you'd add the 4 right at the very end, which isn't what the question says to do.
