ANSWER: C

Both of them are right because in the first one, you've got a 3, a 2, and a 1, and you're just doing them in a different order but it's the same numbers. 3 plus 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side, 3 take away 1 is 2, plus 2 is 4, so that's the same. 

Katie is right too because you have to do the times bit first because of BIDMAS. 2 times 1 is 2, then add the 3 makes 5. It doesn't matter if the 3 is at the front or the back, you still do the multiplying first and then add the 3, so they both equal 5.
