ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $(3 + ab)$ is all inside the brackets after the division sign, it all has to go on the bottom of the fraction. I almost picked A because I saw the division first, but the brackets mean the 2 is divided by the whole thing. C looks right because it has the $ab$ together and everything is under the fraction bar.
