ANSWER: A

I picked A because you always just read the sum from left to right. In the first one, the 4 and 5 are at the start, so you do them first. In the second one, it's the 4 and 5 again because they come before the 6. I think I remember something about BIDMAS but I usually just do the numbers in the order they're written so I don't get mixed up.
