A) Only Jo

I worked it out step-by-step: first you have $n-5$, then you divide that whole thing by $8$, then add $4$. Jo’s expression has the $+4$ inside the big brackets, so it gets multiplied by $7$ at the very end, which is what the question says. Paul’s one is wrong because the $+4$ is outside his brackets, so he wouldn't be multiplying it by the $7$.
