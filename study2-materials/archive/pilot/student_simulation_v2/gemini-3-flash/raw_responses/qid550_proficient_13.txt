ANSWER: C

My thinking is that both are correct because of the way addition and multiplication work. For Tom's, even though there's a minus sign, you can think of it as adding a negative number, so $3 + 2 + (-1)$ is the same as $3 + (-1) + 2$. Since addition and subtraction have the same priority in BIDMAS, you just work left to right or reorder them as long as the sign stays with the number. For Katie's, multiplication has to happen first anyway ($2 \times 1 = 2$), so both sides of her equation just end up being $3 + 2$ or $2 + 3$, which are obviously the same.
