ANSWER: A

My thinking: Tom is correct because of BIDMAS. Division always comes before subtraction, so $0.1 - 0.2 \div 0.3$ is the same as $0.1 - (0.2 \div 0.3)$. Katie is wrong because she swapped the order of the numbers around the minus sign, and subtraction isn't commutative (you can't just swap them like you can with addition).
