ANSWER: D

I think it's D because the numbers are in a different order. My teacher said you have to do the sums in the order they are written, so if you swap the 2 and the 1 around like Tom did, it must change the answer. And for Katie, I remember BIDMAS means you have to do the times bit first, so if you move the 3 to the end it's probably wrong too. None of them look right to me.
