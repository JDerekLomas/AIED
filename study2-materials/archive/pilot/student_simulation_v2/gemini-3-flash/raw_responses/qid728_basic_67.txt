ANSWER: D

I think it's D because you have to do the bit in the brackets first. 16 minus 6 is 10, then you add the 4 to get 14. Then you just divide that by 2 and 14 divided by 2 is 7. I tried the others but they didn't seem right, like in A I got confused with the 6 plus 4 being 10 then dividing by 2 to get 5, then 16 take away 5 is 11. D is the only one that made 7 when I did it.
