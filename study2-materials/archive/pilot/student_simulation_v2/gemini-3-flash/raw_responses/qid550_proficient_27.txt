My thinking: Both of them are correct because they are just rearranging the terms while keeping the correct signs. For Tom, $3 + 2 - 1$ is $4$, and $3 - 1 + 2$ is also $4$ (since addition and subtraction have the same priority, you just work from left to right). For Katie, she's just swapped the order of the addition. Even though you have to do the multiplication first ($2 \times 1 = 2$) because of BIDMAS, both sides of her equation equal $5$. They've basically just used the commutative law.
