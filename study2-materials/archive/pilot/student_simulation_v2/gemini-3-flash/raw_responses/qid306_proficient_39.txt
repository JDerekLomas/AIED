My thinking: For Problem Q, you have to follow BIDMAS, so multiplication comes before addition, meaning you do $5 \times 6$ first. For Problem P, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work from left to right. Even though 'A' comes before 'S' in BIDMAS, you don't actually do the addition first if the subtraction is on the left, so you start with $4-5$.
