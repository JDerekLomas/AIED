ANSWER: A

I picked A because you always just do the first two numbers you see, like reading a book. For Problem P, you just do 4 take away 5 first because they are at the start. Then for Problem Q, I think you do 4 plus 5 first because it's the first bit of the sum. My teacher said something about BIDMAS but I can't remember if the plus or the times comes first, so I just did it in order.
