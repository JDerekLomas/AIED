ANSWER: B

I used BIDMAS for this one. You have to do the division and the multiplication before the addition. So, $18 \div 2 = 9$ and $2 \times 2 = 4$. Then you just add them together, $9 + 4 = 13$.

If you just go from left to right without thinking about the order of operations, you'd get 22, but I'm pretty sure that's a trap.
