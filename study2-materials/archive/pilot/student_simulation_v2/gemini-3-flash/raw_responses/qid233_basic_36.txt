ANSWER: C

My thinking is that the divide sign means it has to be a fraction, so the 2 goes on the top. I know in algebra you don't use the times sign, you just squash the letters together, so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. It doesn't matter if it's $3 + ab$ or $ab + 3$, so C looks right because D still has the times sign in it.
