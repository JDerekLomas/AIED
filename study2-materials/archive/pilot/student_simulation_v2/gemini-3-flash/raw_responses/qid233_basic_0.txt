ANSWER: C

My thinking: I know that in algebra you don't really use the divide sign, you use a fraction bar instead, so the 2 goes on the top. Then for the bottom bit, I remembered that $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$ because you don't need the times sign. I chose C because $ab+3$ is the same as $3+ab$, just written the normal way round. A looked wrong because the line didn't go under everything.
