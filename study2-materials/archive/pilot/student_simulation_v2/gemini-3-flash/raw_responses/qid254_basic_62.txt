ANSWER: A

My teacher said the mean is when you add all the numbers up and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, but one is a zero so it doesn't really add anything to the top part, but you still have to divide by 5. B is wrong because you have to do the adding first before the divide.
