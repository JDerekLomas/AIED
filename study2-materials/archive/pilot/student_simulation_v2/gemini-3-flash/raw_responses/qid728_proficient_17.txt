ANSWER: D

I tried putting the brackets in different places to see which one worked with BIDMAS. For D, you do the bit inside the brackets first: $16 - 6$ is $10$, then add the $4$ to get $14$. Then you just divide by $2$ at the end, which gives $7$. A looked a bit tricky because $10$ divided by $2$ is $5$, and $16 - 5$ is $11$, so that didn't work.
