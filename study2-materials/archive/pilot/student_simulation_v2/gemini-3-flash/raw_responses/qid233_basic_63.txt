ANSWER: C

I know that in algebra you don't really use the divide sign, you use a fraction bar instead. So the 2 goes on top and the rest goes on the bottom. You also don't need the times sign between the letters, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. I chose C because it puts it all under the 2, and $ab+3$ is the same as $3+ab$. I didn't pick A because that looks like the 3 is the only thing being divided.
