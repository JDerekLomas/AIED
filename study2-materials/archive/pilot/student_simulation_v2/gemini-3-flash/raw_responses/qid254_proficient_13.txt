ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a value in the set, so there are 5 numbers in total. You divide the sum by 5, which is what option A does (since adding 0 doesn't change the top part). Option B is wrong because without brackets, you'd only divide the 7 by 5 because of BIDMAS.
