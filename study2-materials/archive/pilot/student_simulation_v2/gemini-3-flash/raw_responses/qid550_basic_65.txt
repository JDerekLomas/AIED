ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one looks right since you always have to do the times first because of BIDMAS, and she's kept the numbers together. But for Tom, I think he's wrong because he's moved the numbers around and you aren't allowed to just swap the plus and the minus like that, you have to do them in the order they're written.
