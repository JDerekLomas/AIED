ANSWER: B

I think it's B because in maths you have to do the times bit first because of BIDMAS. Katie's one has a times sign in it and the numbers are just swapped around, so it looks like it would be the same. Tom's one is wrong because you aren't allowed to just move the take away sign like that; you have to do it in the order it's written, and 3 plus 2 is 5, then take 1 is 4. But 3 take 1 is 2, then plus 2 is 4... wait, that's the same, but my teacher said you always have to do it in order, so Tom's probably a trick. Katie's looks more like the rules we did.
