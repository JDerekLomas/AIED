B

I think it's B because when you have a take away and a divide, you just do it in the order it's written. Katie's one looks right because 0.2 and 0.3 are bigger than 0.1, so you'd have to put them first or the answer would be a minus number and we haven't really done much of those yet. Tom's just looks confusing with the brackets.
