ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the multiplication or division signs. First, I simplified $a \times b$ to $ab$. Since the $(3 + ab)$ is all inside the bracket, it becomes the denominator of the fraction when you divide 2 by it. Option D still has a multiplication sign, and A and B have moved things around incorrectly. So, it must be C.
