ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 first which is 16, and then I did the brackets 2 plus 2 which is 4. Then I just did 16 divided by 4 which is 4, but that didn't feel right because the 12 is next to the divide sign. So I did 4 plus 12 is 16, then 16 divided by 2 is 8, plus the other 2 is 10. But then I remembered my teacher saying you have to do the divide before the plus, so I did 12 divided by 4 (from the brackets) which is 3, and then 4 plus 3 is 7.
