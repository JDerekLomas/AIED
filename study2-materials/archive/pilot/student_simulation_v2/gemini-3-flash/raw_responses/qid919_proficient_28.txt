ANSWER: B

My thinking: Since the equation is $y = 3x^2$, I need to square the $x$ value first. $0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.09$. Then I just need to multiply that by 3, and $3 \times 0.09$ gives $0.27$. I double-checked the decimals because sometimes I put the point in the wrong place and might have picked D by mistake, but $0.27$ looks right.
