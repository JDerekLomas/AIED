ANSWER: A

My teacher said that for the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers, but one of them is a zero so it doesn't really add anything to the top part, but you still have to divide by 5 because it's in the list. B looks wrong because you'd only divide the 7 by 5 if you put it in a calculator like that.
