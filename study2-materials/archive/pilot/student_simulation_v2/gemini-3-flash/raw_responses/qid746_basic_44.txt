ANSWER: B

I did the 4 + 12 first which is 16. Then I did the bit in the brackets, 2 + 2 is 4. So then it's just 16 divided by 4, which is 4. Wait, I think I have to do the divide bit first because of BIDMAS. If I do 12 divided by 4, that's 3. Then I add the 4 at the start, so 4 + 3 is 7. That's one of the answers so it's probably B.
