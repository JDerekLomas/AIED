ANSWER: B

I used BIDMAS for this one. You have to do the division ($18 \div 2 = 9$) and the multiplication ($2 \times 2 = 4$) first, before you do the adding in the middle. So, $9 + 4$ gives you 13. I almost just worked from left to right, which would have given me 22, but I remembered the order of operations!
