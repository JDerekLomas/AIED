A) Only Jo

I think Jo is right because she put the big brackets around the whole bit with the +4 before multiplying by 7 at the end. Paul's one looks wrong because he put the 4 outside the brackets, so you'd only multiply the first bit by 7 and then add the 4 last, which isn't what the question says. Jo's fraction line is a bit confusing but it's basically the same as dividing.
