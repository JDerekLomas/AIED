ANSWER: B

So, I need to put the 0.3 where the $x$ is. That means it's $3 \times 0.3^2$. If I do 3 times 0.3 first, I get 0.9. Then 0.9 squared is $0.9 \times 0.9$, which is 0.81. But wait, I remember my teacher saying you have to do the power first because of BIDMAS. So, $0.3 \times 0.3$ is 0.09. Then $3 \times 0.09$... well, $3 \times 9$ is 27, so I think it's 0.27.
