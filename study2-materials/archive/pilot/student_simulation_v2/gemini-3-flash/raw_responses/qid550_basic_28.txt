ANSWER: C

My thinking: I think they are both right. For Tom, 3 + 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side, 3 - 1 is 2, then add 2 is 4. So that one works. For Katie, I know you have to do the times first because of BIDMAS. So 2 x 1 is 2, then add 3 is 5. On the other side it's the same, 2 x 1 is 2, plus 3 is 5. Since both sides equal the same thing in both examples, they are both correct.
