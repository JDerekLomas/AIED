ANSWER: B

I did the 4 + 12 first which is 16, then I did the plus in the brackets which is 4. Then I just did 16 divided by 4 and that gives 4, but that’s not right because I remembered my teacher said you have to do the divide before the add. So I did 12 divided by 2 which is 6, then plus 2 is 8, and then add the 4 at the start makes 12. But wait, if I do the brackets first like BIDMAS says, 2 + 2 is 4. Then 12 divided by 4 is 3. Then 4 + 3 is 7. So it’s 7.
