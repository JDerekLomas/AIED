ANSWER: C

I think it's C because in both ones they are just swapping the numbers around but keeping the signs. For Tom's, 3 plus 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side, 3 take away 1 is 2, then plus 2 is also 4, so he's right. For Katie, you have to do the times first because of BIDMAS, so 2 times 1 is 2, then add 3 is 5. It's the same on both sides of her equals sign as well.
