**Explanation:** Jo’s expression correctly follows the order of operations described. By placing the "add 4" inside the parentheses with the rest of the expression, the final "multiply by 7" is applied to the entire result. Paul’s expression is incorrect because, according to BIDMAS/BODMAS, the multiplication by 7 would only apply to the division part, leaving the +4 at the end to be added separately.
