ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one has a times sign and you have to do BIDMAS. My teacher says you always have to do the multiplying first so that one looks more like a proper rule. Tom's one just looks wrong because he's swapped the numbers around and you aren't allowed to just change the order of a takeaway. Plus, 3 + 2 is 5, but 3 - 1 is 2, so they can't be the same.
