ANSWER: C

My thinking: I know that in algebra you don't really use the divide sign, you use a fraction bar instead, so the 2 goes on the top. Then for the bottom bit, $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$ because you take out the times sign. I chose C because $ab+3$ is the same as $3+ab$, just written the normal way with the letters first. I nearly picked A but then I thought the line has to go under everything in the brackets.
