ANSWER: D

I think it's D because in BIDMAS you have to do the adding before the taking away. For Tom, he's moved the numbers around so the 1 is in the middle, and you aren't allowed to just swap them like that because the minus is attached to the 1. For Katie, you have to do the times first because M comes before A, and she's changed the whole sum around as well which usually means it's wrong. Maths rules are really strict about the order you write things in, so they are probably both breaking a rule.
