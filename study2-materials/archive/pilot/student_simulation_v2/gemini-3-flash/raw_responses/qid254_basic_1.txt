ANSWER: A

My teacher said that to find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so I need to divide by 5. C is wrong because it divides by 4. I thought about B, but the 0 doesn't really change the sum, and A looks more like the fractions we do in class where the whole top bit gets divided.
