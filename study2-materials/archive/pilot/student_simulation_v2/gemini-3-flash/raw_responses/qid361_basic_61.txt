A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in order. You do n minus 5 first, then put it over 8 to divide it. Then you add the 4. Because you have to multiply the *whole* thing by 7 at the end, you need the big brackets around everything before the 7. Paul’s one is wrong because the 4 is outside the last bracket, so you wouldn't multiply the 4 by 7.
