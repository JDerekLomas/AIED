ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. Even though one of the numbers is 0, it still counts as a value in the set, so there are 5 numbers in total. You divide the sum (15) by 5. Option B looks okay at first, but because of BIDMAS, you’d divide the 7 by 5 before adding the rest, which is wrong. So A is the only one that works.
