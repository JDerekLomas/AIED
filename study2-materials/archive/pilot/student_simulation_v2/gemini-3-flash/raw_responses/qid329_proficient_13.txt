ANSWER: A

My thinking: According to BIDMAS, you have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom is correct because putting brackets around the $(0.2 \div 0.3)$ doesn't actually change the calculation; it just highlights that the division happens first. Katie is wrong because she swapped the order of the numbers around the subtraction sign, and subtraction isn't commutative (like $5 - 2$ isn't the same as $2 - 5$).
