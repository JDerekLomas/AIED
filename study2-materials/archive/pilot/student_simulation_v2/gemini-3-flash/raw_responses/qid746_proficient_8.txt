I used BIDMAS, so I did the brackets first: $2 + 2 = 4$. Then I did the division: $12 \div 4 = 3$. Finally, I added the $4$ at the front, so $4 + 3 = 7$. If you don't follow the order of operations and just go left to right, you'd get a different answer, but I'm pretty sure division comes before addition!
