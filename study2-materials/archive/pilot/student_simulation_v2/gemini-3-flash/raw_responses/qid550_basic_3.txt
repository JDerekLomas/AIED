ANSWER: C

I think they are both right because in the first one, it doesn't matter if you do the take away or the plus first, you still get the same answer (4). In Katie's one, BIDMAS says you have to do the times part first anyway, and \( 2 \times 1 \) is just 2, so both sides are basically just \( 3 + 2 \) which is 5. They've just swapped the numbers around but kept the signs with them.
