ANSWER: C

My thinking is that when you write algebra, you don't really use the times sign anymore, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Then, the divide sign means the same as a fraction line. I saw $3 + ab$ was inside the brackets, so that whole bit has to go on the bottom of the fraction. I nearly picked A, but then I remembered the line means divide the whole thing.
