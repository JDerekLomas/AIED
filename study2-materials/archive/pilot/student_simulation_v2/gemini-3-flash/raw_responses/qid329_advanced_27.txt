A

**Explanation:**
According to the rules of BIDMAS/BODMAS, division must be performed before subtraction. Tom is correct because his use of brackets explicitly shows the division $(0.2 \div 0.3)$ being prioritized, which matches the standard order of operations. Katie is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative; $a - b$ is not equivalent to $b - a$. She has swapped the terms around the subtraction sign, which changes the result.
