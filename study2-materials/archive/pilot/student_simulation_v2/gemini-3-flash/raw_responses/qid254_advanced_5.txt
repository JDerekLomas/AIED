A

**Explanation:** To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one value is 0, it still counts as a member of the data set, so you must divide the sum by 5. Since adding 0 doesn't change the numerator, $\frac{1+3+4+7}{5}$ is mathematically correct. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), as only the 7 would be divided by 5.
