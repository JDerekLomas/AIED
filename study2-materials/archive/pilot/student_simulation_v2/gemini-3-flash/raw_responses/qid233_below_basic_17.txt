ANSWER: A

I think it's A because I remember my teacher saying that divide means you have to put the first number on top of a fraction line. I saw the 2 and the 3 at the start so I picked the one that had 2 over 3. I also know that when you have letters you just push them together so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$.
