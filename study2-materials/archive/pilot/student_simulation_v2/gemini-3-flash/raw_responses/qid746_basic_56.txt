ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 first which is 16, then I did the bit in the brackets which is 4. Then 16 divided by 4 is 7. No wait, 16 divided by 4 is 4, so it’s D.

Actually, wait, my teacher said to do the divide first. 12 divided by 2 is 6, plus 2 is 8, then plus 4 is 12. So it’s C.

I'll go with B because 4 + 12 is 16 and then 16 divided by 2 is 8 and 8 minus 1... no, I'll just do 4 + 12 divided by 4. 12 divided by 4 is 3, then 4 + 3 is 7. That sounds right.
