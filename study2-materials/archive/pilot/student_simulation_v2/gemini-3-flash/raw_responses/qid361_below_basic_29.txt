ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one looks more like the actual question. You have to do the divide by 8 part first which he put in the little brackets, and then you add the 4 at the end. Jo's one has a big bracket around the 4 as well and that looks really confusing with the fraction thing, so I don't think that can be right. Plus, 7 times 4 is 28 and that wasn't in the question.
