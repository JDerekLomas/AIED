ANSWER: A

I think it's A because I remember my teacher saying that divide means you write it like a fraction, and the 2 is at the beginning so it goes on top. Then for the other bit, I know you're supposed to just put the letters together to make them "stick," so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. I wasn't sure about the brackets but A looks the most like the normal way to write it.
