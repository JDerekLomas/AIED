ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 which is 16, and then I divided that by 2 which is 8, and then I did the plus 2 at the end so it’s 10. But then I saw the brackets and I remember my teacher saying you have to do the brackets first, so 2 plus 2 is 4. Then I just did 12 divided by 4 which is 3, and 4 plus 3 is 7. I think it's B because 7 is a prime number and we were doing those last week.
