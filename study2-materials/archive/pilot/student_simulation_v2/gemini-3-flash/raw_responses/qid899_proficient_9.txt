I used BIDMAS (or BODMAS), which is what we're taught in school for the order of operations. Multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, so you have to do $8 \times 7$ before doing anything with the 10 or the 6. It’s a bit of a trick because your brain wants to just work from left to right!
