I used BIDMAS for this one. You have to do the division and the multiplication before the addition. So, $18 \div 2$ is $9$, and $2 \times 2$ is $4$. Then you just add them together ($9 + 4$) to get $13$. 

If you just went from left to right without thinking about the order of operations, you'd get $22$, but I'm pretty sure that's a trap!
