ANSWER: C

I think they are both right because in the first one, you're just swapping the numbers around and $3+2$ is $5$, then take away $1$ is $4$, and $3-1$ is $2$ plus $2$ is also $4$. Then for Katie, you have to do the times first because of BIDMAS, and $2 \times 1$ is $2$, then plus $3$ is $5$, and it's the same on both sides just in a different order.
