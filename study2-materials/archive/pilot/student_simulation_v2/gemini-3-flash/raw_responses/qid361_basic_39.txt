A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in the question. You have to do the $n - 5$ first, then divide the whole thing by 8, then add 4. Jo's one has the $+4$ inside the big brackets, so it gets multiplied by 7 at the very end like the question says. Paul's one has the $+4$ outside the brackets, so the 7 wouldn't multiply it, and that doesn't seem right.
