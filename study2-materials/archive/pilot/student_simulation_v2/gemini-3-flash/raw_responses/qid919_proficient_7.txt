ANSWER: B

My thinking: I need to square $0.3$ first and then multiply it by 3. $0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.09$ (since $3 \times 3 = 9$ and there are two decimal places). Then $3 \times 0.09$ is $0.27$. I almost went for D because I thought about $3 \times 0.9$, but then I remembered to square the decimal properly!
