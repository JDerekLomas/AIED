ANSWER: D

I think it's D because you have to do the bit in the brackets first. 16 minus 6 is 10, then add the 4 makes 14. Then you just divide the 14 by 2 and that gives you 7. If you don't put the brackets there, you'd have to do the divide first because of BIDMAS and that gets a different number.
