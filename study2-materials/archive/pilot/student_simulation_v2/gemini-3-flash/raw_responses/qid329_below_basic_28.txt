ANSWER: B

I think Katie is right because usually in maths you just read the numbers from left to right, but since there's a divide and a minus, you have to swap them around to make it work. 0.2 and 0.3 are the bigger numbers so they should probably go first anyway. Tom's one has brackets and brackets always make things more complicated than they need to be.
