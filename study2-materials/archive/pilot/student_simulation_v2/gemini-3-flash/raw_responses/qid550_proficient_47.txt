ANSWER: C

My thinking is that both are correct because of the rules for the order of operations (BIDMAS). For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work from left to right; $3+2-1=4$ and $3-1+2=4$. For Katie, multiplication comes before addition, so in both cases you do $2 \times 1$ first and then add the $3$, which gives $5$ both ways. Since both sides of their equations equal the same thing, they are both right.
