ANSWER: C

My thinking is that when you write algebra, you don't use the times sign, you just squash the letters together, so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. Then, the divide sign means it's a fraction, so the 2 goes on the top and everything in the brackets goes on the bottom. I chose C because $ab$ and 3 are both under the line. I didn't pick A because the 3 is meant to be part of the bottom bit, not a separate number.
