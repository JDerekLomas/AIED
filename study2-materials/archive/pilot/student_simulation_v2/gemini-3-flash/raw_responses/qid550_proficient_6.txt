ANSWER: C

My thinking is that both are correct because of how BIDMAS works. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just go left to right; $3+2-1 = 4$ and $3-1+2 = 4$, so they are equivalent. For Katie, you have to do the multiplication first either way. $3 + (2 \times 1) = 5$ and $(2 \times 1) + 3 = 5$, so that's also correct. It's basically just the commutative property.
