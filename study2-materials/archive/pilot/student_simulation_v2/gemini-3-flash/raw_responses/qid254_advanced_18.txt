ANSWER: A

To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one value is 0, it still counts as a member of the data set, so there are 5 numbers in total. Therefore, the calculation is $(0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7) \div 5$, which is equivalent to option A. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), as only the 7 would be divided by 5.
