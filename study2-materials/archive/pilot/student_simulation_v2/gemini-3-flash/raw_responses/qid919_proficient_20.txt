ANSWER: B

My thinking: Since the equation is $y = 3x^2$, I need to square the $x$ value first and then multiply by 3. $0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.09$, and then $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. I almost went for A or D because I got a bit confused with the decimal points at first, but $0.27$ makes the most sense.
