A

**Explanation:**
According to the rules of BIDMAS/BODMAS, division must be performed before subtraction. Tom is correct because his use of brackets explicitly shows the division $(0.2 \div 0.3)$ being calculated first, which is equivalent to the original expression. Katie is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative; $a - b$ is not the same as $b - a$. Changing the order of the terms as she did changes the value of the expression.
