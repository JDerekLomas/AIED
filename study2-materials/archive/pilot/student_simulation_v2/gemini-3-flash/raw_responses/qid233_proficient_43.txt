ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we should use a fraction bar for division and remove the multiplication signs between variables. In the original expression, the $a \times b$ part becomes $ab$. Since the $3 + ab$ is all inside the brackets, it has to go together on the bottom of the fraction. I almost picked D, but then I remembered that we aren't supposed to keep the $\times$ symbol in algebra.
