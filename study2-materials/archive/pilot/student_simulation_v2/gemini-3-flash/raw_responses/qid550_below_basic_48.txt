ANSWER: D

I think it's D because the numbers are in a different order in both of them. My teacher said you have to do the BIDMAS thing, and if you move the numbers around it changes the answer. In the first one, the minus is at the end but then it moves to the middle, so that must be wrong. And in the second one, the times is at the end but then it's at the start, so that probably changes it too. I normally just pick D when they both look a bit dodgy.
