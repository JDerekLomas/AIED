ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the order of the instructions exactly as they are written. You start with $n$, subtract 5, divide that whole thing by 8, add 4 to that result, and then the brackets ensure the final multiplication by 7 applies to everything.

Paul's version is wrong because he didn't put brackets around the $+4$ part, so only the division part is being multiplied by 7. In his version, the 4 is just added at the very end.
