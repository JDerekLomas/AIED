My thinking: For Problem Q, you definitely have to do the multiplication first because of BIDMAS/BODMAS. For Problem P, since addition and subtraction have the same priority, you just work from left to right, so you do 4 - 5 first. I sometimes get confused and think addition comes before subtraction because the 'A' is before the 'S' in BIDMAS, but my teacher said you just go left to right when it's just those two.
