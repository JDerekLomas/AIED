My thinking: Both of them are correct. Tom’s one works because addition and subtraction are on the same level in BIDMAS, so you can do them in any order as long as the sign stays with the number (like +2 and -1). Katie’s one is just the commutative law for addition; she's just swapped the 3 and the (2 x 1) blocks around, which doesn't change the result.
