A) Only Jo

I think Jo is right because she put the brackets around everything before multiplying by 7 at the end. Paul just added the 4 on the outside, so only the first bit gets multiplied by 7 and that doesn't seem right. Fractions are just the same as dividing anyway, so Jo's one looks like the steps in the question.
