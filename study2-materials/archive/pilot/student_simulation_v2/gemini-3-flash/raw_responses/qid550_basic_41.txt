ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one looks right since you have to do the times first anyway (BIDMAS), so the order doesn't change the answer. But for Tom, I think if you move the numbers around like that it changes the sum because the minus is in a different place, and 3 minus 1 is 2, then plus 2 is 4, but the first bit is 5 minus 1 which is 4... wait, they are both 4, but you aren't allowed to just swap them like that in school, so I'll stick with Katie.
