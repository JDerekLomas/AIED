B

I think it's Paul because his one has the divide sign and the question says to divide by 8. Jo's one has a fraction line and that always looks like a different topic we haven't done yet. Paul's one also has the +4 at the end and the question says to add 4 and then multiply, so I think you just put them in that order.
