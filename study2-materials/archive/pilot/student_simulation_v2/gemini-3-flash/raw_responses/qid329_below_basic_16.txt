B

I think it's B because in the question the 0.1 is at the start, and Katie has just moved it to the end. My teacher said something about the order not mattering when you move numbers around, and her way looks more like a normal take-away sum. Tom's one just has extra brackets that weren't there before, so that looks wrong.
