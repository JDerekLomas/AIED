I think it's Paul because his one looks more like the actual question. You've got the $n$ minus 5 in brackets, then the divide 8 and the add 4, and the 7 is at the front because you multiply it at the end. Jo's one has that big line and the 4 is inside the brackets which looks weird. Paul's one just follows the order better.
