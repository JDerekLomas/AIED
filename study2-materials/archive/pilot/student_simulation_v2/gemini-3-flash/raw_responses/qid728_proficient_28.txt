ANSWER: D

I looked at the others first: A gives 11, B gives 12, and C is just the normal order of operations which gives 12 as well. For D, you do the bits in the brackets first (16 minus 6 is 10, then add 4 to get 14), and then 14 divided by 2 is 7. I almost went for A because I saw the 6 and 4 and thought "that's 10", but I remembered BIDMAS and realised D works perfectly.
