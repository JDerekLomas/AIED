ANSWER: C

**Explanation:** In algebra, we usually write \( a \times b \) as just \( ab \), and division is shown using a fraction bar. Since the brackets tell us that the whole of \( (3 + ab) \) is the denominator, C is the best fit. I did double-check A, but that would only be right if it was just the 2 being divided by 3, not the whole expression.
