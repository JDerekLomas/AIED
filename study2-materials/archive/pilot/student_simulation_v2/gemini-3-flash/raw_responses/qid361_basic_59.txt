A) Only Jo

My thinking: You have to do the divide by 8 part first before you add the 4, and Jo’s one has the +4 inside the big brackets with the 7 on the outside, which means you multiply everything by 7 at the very end like the question says. Paul's one has the +4 at the end outside the brackets, so you'd do the multiplying by 7 and then add the 4 last, which is the wrong way round.
