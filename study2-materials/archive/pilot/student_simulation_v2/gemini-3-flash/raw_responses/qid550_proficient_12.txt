My thinking: Both of them are correct. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority in BODMAS, so you just work from left to right. $3+2-1 = 4$ and $3-1+2 = 4$. For Katie, the multiplication part ($2 \times 1$) always stays as $2$ regardless of whether it's written before or after the $+3$, so both sides equal $5$. They are just swapping the order of the terms, which is fine as long as the signs stay with the right numbers.
