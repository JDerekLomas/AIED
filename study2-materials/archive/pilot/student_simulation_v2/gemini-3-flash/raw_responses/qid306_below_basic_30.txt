ANSWER: C

I picked C because you always have to do the plus bits first. In the first one, 5+6 looks easier to do than 4 minus 5 because you can't really do 4 take away 5. Then in the second one, I just did the plus first again because it comes first in the line. I always get confused with the BODMAS thing but I think you just go left to right and do the adding.
