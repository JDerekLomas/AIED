ANSWER: C

Well, I know that 6 times 2 is 12, but it's got that little 2 at the top so it means timesing it by itself. 6 times 6 is 36. Since there's a minus sign at the start, and I remember my teacher saying that two minuses make a plus, the minus just sort of disappears when you square it. So it must be 36.
