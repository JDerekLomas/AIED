ANSWER: C

I thought because the rule is $1 - 3n$, I should do $1 - 3$ first which is $-2$, and then multiply that by $15$ to get the answer. 15 times 2 is 30, so I got $-30$, but that wasn't there exactly. Then I tried just doing $15 - 1$ which is $14$ and putting a minus on it because the sequence is going down.
