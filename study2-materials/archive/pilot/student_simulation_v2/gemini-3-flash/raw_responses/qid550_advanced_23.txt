ANSWER: C

Both are correct because they are demonstrating the commutative property of addition. In Tom's case, $3+2-1$ is the same as $3+(-1)+2$, so the order of the terms doesn't matter as long as the negative sign stays with the $1$. In Katie's case, she is correctly treating the product $(2 \times 1)$ as a single term due to BIDMAS/order of operations, and then swapping the order of the addition.
