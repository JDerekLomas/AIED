ANSWER: A

My thinking: To find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list (0, 1, 3, 4, and 7). Even though the first one is a zero, you still have to count it, so you divide by 5. B looks right but my teacher says you have to use a fraction line or brackets because of BIDMAS, otherwise you'd only divide the last number. C is wrong because it only divides by 4. So it must be A.
