ANSWER: A

I picked A because you always just do the math from left to right, like how you read a book. So for Problem P you do 4 minus 5 first because it's at the start, and for Problem Q you do 4 plus 5 first because that's also at the start. I know there's a rule called BIDMAS but it's really confusing and plus comes before times in the word anyway.
