ANSWER: B

I did the plus bits first because I'm better at those. 4 plus 12 is 16, and 2 plus 2 is 4. Then I just did 16 divided by 4 which is 4. Wait, that's D.

Actually, our teacher said something about brackets being first. So 2 plus 2 is 4. Then I just did 4 plus 12 which is 16, and 16 divided by 4 is 4. 

Wait, if I do the middle bit, 12 divided by 4 is 3. Then 4 plus 3 is 7. That's B. I think it's B because of the BIDMAS rule thing.
