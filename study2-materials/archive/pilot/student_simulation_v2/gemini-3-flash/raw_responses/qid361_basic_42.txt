A) Only Jo

I think Jo is right because she put the brackets around everything before multiplying by 7 at the end. Paul's one looks wrong because the +4 is outside the big brackets, so you would only multiply the first bit by 7 and then add the 4 last, but the question says adding 4 comes before the multiplying. Jo's fraction thing looks a bit confusing but it keeps the subtract 5 and divide 8 together properly.
