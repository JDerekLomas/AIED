A

**Explanation:** To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one value is 0, it still counts as a data point, so you must divide the sum by 5. Since $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$ is the same as $1 + 3 + 4 + 7$, option A correctly shows the sum divided by the count of 5. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), as it only divides the 7 by 5.
