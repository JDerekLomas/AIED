ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one looks more like the actual question. It says "add 4" near the end and his has the +4 at the very end of the line, whereas Jo's has it stuck inside the big brackets. Also, Jo's looks like a fraction and fractions are always really confusing, so I usually pick the one that uses the normal divide sign.
