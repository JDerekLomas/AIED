ANSWER: B

I think it's B because Katie's one is definitely right since 2 times 1 is just 2, and adding 3 makes 5 on both sides. But for Tom, I think the order matters because you're meant to do the adding before the taking away. On the left it's 3 plus 2 which is 5, then minus 1 is 4. But on the right, if you do 1 plus 2 first it's 3, then 3 minus 3 is 0, so they aren't the same.
