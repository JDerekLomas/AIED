ANSWER: C

My thinking is that with algebra, you're supposed to put the letters together to show they are timesing, so $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. Then because the $2$ is being divided by the whole bracket, it has to go on top of a fraction line with everything else underneath. I chose C because $ab+3$ is the same as $3+ab$, just written in a different order. I almost picked A, but then I remembered the line has to go under everything.
