ANSWER: B

For Problem P, addition and subtraction have equal priority, so you follow the order of operations from left to right, meaning you calculate \( 4-5 \) first. For Problem Q, according to BIDMAS/BODMAS, multiplication takes precedence over addition, so you must calculate \( 5 \times 6 \) first.
