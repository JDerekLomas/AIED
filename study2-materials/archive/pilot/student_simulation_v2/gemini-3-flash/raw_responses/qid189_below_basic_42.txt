ANSWER: C

I think it's C because the question has a 1 and a 3 in it, and if you just put them together it looks like 13. Then there's a 15 in the question too, and 14 is the number right next to 15 so it's probably that one. Plus, most of the answers have a minus sign so I picked the one with a minus.
