ANSWER: C

Both are correct because of the properties of addition and multiplication. Tom is using the fact that addition and subtraction are at the same level in the order of operations (BIDMAS), so $3 + 2 - 1 = 4$ and $3 - 1 + 2 = 4$. Katie is showing that addition is commutative ($a + b \equiv b + a$); in both cases, you perform the multiplication $2 \times 1$ first, then add the 3.
