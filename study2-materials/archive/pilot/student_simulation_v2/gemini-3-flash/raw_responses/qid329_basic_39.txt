ANSWER: A

I remember BIDMAS from school, and the D comes before the S. This means you have to do the division part before you do the takeaway. Tom has put the brackets around the division to show you do it first, so that looks right. Katie has swapped the numbers around, and you can't just swap a takeaway like that or you'll get a different answer.
