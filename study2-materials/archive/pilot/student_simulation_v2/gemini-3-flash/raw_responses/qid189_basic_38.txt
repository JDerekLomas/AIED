A

I thought the answer was A because you have to do 1 minus 3, which is -2, and then you times it by 15. So 2 times 15 is 30, but it's minus, then I added the 14? Wait, no, I just did 3 times 15 which is 45, and then you take away the 1 because it's 1 minus 45. 45 take away 1 is 44, so it must be -44.
