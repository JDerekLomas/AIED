A) Only Jo

I think Jo is right because she put the big brackets around the whole bit with the +4. The question says to add 4 and then "finally" multiply by 7, so the 7 has to multiply everything that came before it. Paul's one looks wrong because the +4 is outside at the end, so you'd only be multiplying the first part by 7 and not the 4.
