ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one has the divide sign ($\div$) in it and the question says divide. Jo's one just looks like a fraction and fractions are really hard. Also, Paul's one has more brackets and the question has a lot of steps, so you probably need more brackets to show all the bits. I remember my teacher saying you do the stuff in the brackets first so that's why I picked B.
