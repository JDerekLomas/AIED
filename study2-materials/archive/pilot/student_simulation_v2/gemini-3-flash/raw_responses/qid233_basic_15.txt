ANSWER: C

My thinking: I know that in algebra you don't really use the 'divide' sign, you usually write it like a fraction. The 2 is at the front so it goes on top. Then I remember my teacher saying that when you multiply letters like a and b, you just squash them together to make 'ab' and get rid of the times sign. C looks the neatest because it's got the 2 on top and the ab together at the bottom.
