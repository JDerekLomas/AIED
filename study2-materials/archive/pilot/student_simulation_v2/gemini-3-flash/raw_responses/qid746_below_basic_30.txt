ANSWER: B

I think it's B because I just did it in order from left to right. 4 plus 12 is 16, and then I divided that by the first 2 which makes 8, and then I wasn't sure what to do with the last bit but 8 minus 1 or something is 7. Wait, 16 divided by 2 is 8, then plus the other 2 is 10, but 7 just looks more like a proper maths answer. Actually, I'll go with B because 4+12 is 16 and 2+2 is 4, and 16 minus 9 is 7? I don't know, I just picked B because I recognise it from another sum.
