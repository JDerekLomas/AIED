ANSWER: A

My teacher said that to find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so I need to divide by 5. I didn't include the 0 in the top part because adding 0 doesn't change the sum, so 1+3+4+7 is the same thing. B looks wrong because you have to do the plus bits first before the divide.
