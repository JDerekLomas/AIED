ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 which is 16, then I divided that by 2 to get 8, and then I took away the other 2 because it was at the end, so that makes 6. But 7 is the closest one to that so I think it’s B. Or maybe you just add them all up? 4 + 12 is 16, then 2 + 2 is 4, and 16 minus 4 is 12, but B just looks like the right sort of answer for these ones.
