B

I used BIDMAS for this one. You have to do the division and the multiplication first before you do the adding. So, $18 \div 2$ is $9$, and $2 \times 2$ is $4$. Then you just do $9 + 4$, which gives $13$. If you just went from left to right, you'd get a different answer, but my teacher always says to follow the order of operations.
