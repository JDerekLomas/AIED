ANSWER: C

I thought it meant you do 1 takeaway 3 first, which is -2, and then you times that by the n number. So -2 times 15 is -30, but that wasn't an option at first, then I realised I might have to take away another 1? No, wait, if I do 1 minus 15 that's -14, and that is an answer, so it must be that one.
