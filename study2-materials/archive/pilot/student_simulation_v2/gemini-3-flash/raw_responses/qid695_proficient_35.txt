ANSWER: B

I used BIDMAS for this one. You have to do the division and the multiplication before the addition. So, $18 \div 2 = 9$ and $2 \times 2 = 4$. Then you just add them together, $9 + 4 = 13$. I almost just worked from left to right which would have given 22, but I remembered the order of operations!
