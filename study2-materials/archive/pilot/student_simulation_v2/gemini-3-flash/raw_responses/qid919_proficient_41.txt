My thinking: Since the formula is $y = 3x^2$, I need to square the $x$ value first. $0.3 \times 0.3$ is $0.09$. Then I multiply that by 3, which gives $0.27$. I almost went for $2.7$ because I sometimes get the decimal place wrong when squaring, but $3 \times 0.1$ would be $0.3$, so $0.27$ sounds right for $0.3^2$.
