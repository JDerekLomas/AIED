ANSWER: A

I think it's A because I remember my teacher saying that divide means you write it like a fraction, and the 2 is at the start so it goes on top. Then for the rest of it, you just write the letters next to each other because you don't need the times sign in algebra. I just put the 3 underneath the 2 because it's the next thing in the sum.
