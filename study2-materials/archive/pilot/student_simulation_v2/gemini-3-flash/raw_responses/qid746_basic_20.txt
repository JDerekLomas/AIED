ANSWER: B

I did the 4 + 12 first which is 16, and then I did the plus in the brackets which is 4. So it's just 16 divided by 4 which is 4... wait, no, my teacher said you have to do the divide before the plus. So 12 divided by 2 is 6, then 6 plus 2 is 8, then 4 plus 8 is 12. But that's not right either because of the brackets. If I do the brackets first it's 4, then 12 divided by 4 is 3, then 4 plus 3 is 7. That's B.
