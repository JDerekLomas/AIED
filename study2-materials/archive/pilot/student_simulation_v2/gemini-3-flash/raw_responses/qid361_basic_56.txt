A) Only Jo

My thinking: I followed the steps in the question. You have to take the number ($n$), take away 5, then divide that whole bit by 8, then add 4. Jo put the $+4$ inside the big brackets with the 7 outside, which makes sense because the multiplying by 7 happens "finally" at the very end. Paul put the $+4$ outside the brackets, so you wouldn't multiply it by 7, and that doesn't seem right.
