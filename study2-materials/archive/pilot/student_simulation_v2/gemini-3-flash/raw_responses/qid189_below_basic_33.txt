ANSWER: D

I'm not really sure how to do the $n$ thing, but I saw the number 15 and the number 3 in the question. 15 times 3 is 45, but that wasn't there. Then I thought maybe you just do 15 times 2 because of the 1? But I settled on D because 15 plus 15 is 30 and it has a minus sign like the one in the sum.
