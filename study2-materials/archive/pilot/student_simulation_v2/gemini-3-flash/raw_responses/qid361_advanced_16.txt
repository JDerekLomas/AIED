ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the order of operations described in the word problem. By putting the $(n-5)/8 + 4$ inside the brackets, the multiplication by 7 applies to the entire result of the previous steps. Paul’s expression is incorrect because he failed to put brackets around the "add 4" step, meaning only the division part is multiplied by 7, leaving the 4 as a separate term at the end.
