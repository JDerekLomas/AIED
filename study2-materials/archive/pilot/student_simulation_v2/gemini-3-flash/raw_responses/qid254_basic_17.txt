ANSWER: A

My teacher said that to find the mean you add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list (0, 1, 3, 4, 7). Even though zero doesn't change the sum, it still counts as a number in the list, so you have to divide by 5. In C it only divides by 4, and B looks wrong because you have to do the adding first before the dividing.
