ANSWER: A

My teacher said that for the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list. Even though one is a zero, you still have to count it, so you divide by 5. C is wrong because it only divides by 4. I didn't pick B because if you type that into a calculator without brackets, it only divides the last number by 5, and the fraction line in A means you do the adding first.
