ANSWER: C

Both of them are right because you can just move the numbers around as long as you keep the same symbols with them. For Tom's one, $3+2$ is 5, then minus 1 is 4. On the other side, $3-1$ is 2, plus 2 is also 4. Katie's one is just the same thing but swapped round, and $2 \times 1$ is just 2 anyway, so $3+2$ is 5 and $2+3$ is 5. They both work out the same.
