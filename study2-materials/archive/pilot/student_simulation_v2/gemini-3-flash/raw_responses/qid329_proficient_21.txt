A) Only Tom

My thinking: In the order of operations (BIDMAS), division always comes before subtraction. Tom is correct because putting the brackets around the division part shows that you do $0.2 \div 0.3$ first, which is what would happen anyway. Katie is wrong because she swapped the order of the subtraction around; $a - b$ isn't the same as $b - a$, so her expression would give a different answer.
