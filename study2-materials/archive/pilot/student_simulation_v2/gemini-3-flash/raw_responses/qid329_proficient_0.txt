A) Only Tom

My thinking: In the order of operations (BIDMAS), division always comes before subtraction. Tom is correct because putting the brackets around the division part just shows what you'd calculate first anyway, so the expression stays the same. Katie is wrong because you can't just swap the order of subtraction around like that; $0.1$ minus a number is definitely not the same as that number minus $0.1$. It would change the sign of the answer.
