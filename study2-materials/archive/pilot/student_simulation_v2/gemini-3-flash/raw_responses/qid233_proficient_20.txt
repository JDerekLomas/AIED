ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $3 + ab$ is all inside the brackets, it has to go on the bottom of the fraction together. I initially looked at A, but that would mean only the $2$ is being divided by $3$, which is wrong because of the brackets. C is the neatest way to write it.
