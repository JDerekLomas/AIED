**Explanation:**
Tom is correct because of the BIDMAS (or BODMAS) rules we learned in school. Division always takes priority over subtraction, so $0.2 \div 0.3$ must be calculated first. Adding brackets around that part of the expression doesn't change the value; it just makes the order of operations explicit. Katie is wrong because subtraction isn't commutative—you can't just swap the order of the terms around the minus sign like that, as it would change the result from a negative to a positive.
