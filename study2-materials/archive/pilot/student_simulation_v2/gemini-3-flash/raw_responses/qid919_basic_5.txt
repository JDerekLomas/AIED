ANSWER: B

So, I need to put the 0.3 where the $x$ is. That makes it $3 \times 0.3^2$. I know $3 \times 0.3$ is $0.9$, and then I have to square it, so $0.9 \times 0.9$ is $0.81$. But wait, the 3 is at the front, so maybe I do $0.3 \times 3$ first to get $0.9$, then times it by 0.3 again? $0.9 \times 0.3$ is $0.27$. That's one of the answers, so it's probably that.
