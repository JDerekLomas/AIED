ANSWER: C

My thinking: I know that in algebra you don't really use the divide sign, you use a fraction line instead. The 2 is at the start so that goes on top. Then for the bottom bit, I remembered that you don't need the times sign between letters, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. It doesn't really matter if it's $3 + ab$ or $ab + 3$, but C looked the most like the ones we do in class. A is wrong because the line doesn't go under everything.
