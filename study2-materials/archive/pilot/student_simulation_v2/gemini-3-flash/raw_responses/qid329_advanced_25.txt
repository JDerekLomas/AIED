A

**Explanation:**
According to the BIDMAS/BODMAS order of operations, division must be performed before subtraction. Therefore, the expression $0.1 - 0.2 \div 0.3$ is equivalent to $0.1 - (0.2 \div 0.3)$, making Tom correct. Katie is incorrect because subtraction is not commutative; $a - b$ is not the same as $b - a$.
