ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the order of operations described in the question. The "finally multiply by 7" applies to the entire previous result, which Jo represents correctly by placing the $+4$ inside the outer brackets. Paul’s expression is incorrect because, without those outer brackets, the multiplication by 7 would only apply to the division part, leaving the $+4$ at the end to be added last.
