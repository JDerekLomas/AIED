ANSWER: A

I think it's A because Jo has put the $+4$ inside the big brackets, so the whole thing gets multiplied by $7$ at the end, which is what the question says to do ("finally multiply by 7"). Paul's version looks wrong because his $+4$ is outside the brackets, so only the division part is being multiplied by 7, and the 4 would just be added on at the very end.
