ANSWER: C

My thinking is that for Tom, 3 + 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side, 3 take away 1 is 2, and then add 2 is 4, so they are the same. For Katie, you do the add first so 3 + 2 is 5, then times 1 is 5. On the other side, 2 times 1 is 2, then add 3 is 5. Since both sides match for both people, they are both right.
