ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $3 + ab$ is all inside the brackets, it has to go under the fraction bar as the denominator. D is wrong because it still has the multiply sign, and A is wrong because it looks like only the 2 is being divided by 3, rather than the whole expression. C is the neatest way to write it.
