A) Only Tom

My teacher said we have to use BIDMAS, and the D comes before S, so you have to do the divide part before the take away. Tom has put brackets around the divide bit, which is what you do first anyway, so it's the same thing. Katie has swapped the numbers around, and you can't just swap the order of a take away because you'd get a different answer.
