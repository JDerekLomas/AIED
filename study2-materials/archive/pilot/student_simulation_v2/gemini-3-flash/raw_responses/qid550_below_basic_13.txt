ANSWER: D

I think it's D because the numbers have been swapped around and mixed up. My teacher told us about BIDMAS and said you have to do things in a specific order, so if you move the numbers into a different place, the answer will probably change. Tom's one looks wrong because he's put the minus in the middle and then moved it, and Katie's looks like she's trying to trick us by putting the times at the end. They both look like they've broken the rules.
