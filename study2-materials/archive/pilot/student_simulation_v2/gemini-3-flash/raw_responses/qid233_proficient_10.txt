ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we should use a fraction bar for division and remove the multiplication symbols between variables. In the original expression, $a \times b$ becomes $ab$. Since the $3 + ab$ is all inside the brackets, it has to go together on the bottom of the fraction. I almost went for D, but then I remembered that you’re supposed to hide the $\times$ sign when writing it properly.
