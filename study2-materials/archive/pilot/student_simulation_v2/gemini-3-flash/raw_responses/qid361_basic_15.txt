A) Only Jo

I think Jo is right because she put the big brackets around the whole thing before multiplying by 7 at the end. Paul just has the +4 stuck on the outside, so if you did his one, you'd multiply the fraction by 7 first and then add 4, but the question says to add 4 and *then* multiply by 7. Jo's one keeps it all together properly.
