ANSWER: C

**Explanation:** In algebra, we follow the order of operations (BIDMAS). We multiply $a$ and $b$ first, writing it as $ab$ without the multiplication sign. This is added to 3 to get the denominator $(ab + 3)$. The division is then written as a fraction, putting the 2 on top. C is the only option that follows these conventions correctly.
