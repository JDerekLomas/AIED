ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $(3 + ab)$ is all inside the brackets and comes after the division sign, the whole expression needs to go on the bottom of the fraction. I almost picked A because it looked simpler, but then I realized the brackets mean the 2 is being divided by the entire sum, not just the 3.
