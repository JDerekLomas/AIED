ANSWER: A

I think it's Jo because the question says to "finally multiply by 7", which means the very last thing you do is multiply the whole result by 7. Jo has put the +4 inside the big brackets, so it gets multiplied by the 7. Paul's version would mean you only multiply the division part by 7 and then add the 4 at the end, which doesn't follow the order in the question.
