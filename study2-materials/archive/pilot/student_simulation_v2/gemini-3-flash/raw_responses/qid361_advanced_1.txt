ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the order of operations described. By putting the $(n-5)/8$ and the $+4$ inside the outer brackets, she ensures that the entire result of the previous steps is multiplied by 7. Paul's expression is incorrect because he failed to put brackets around the $+4$, meaning only the division part is multiplied by 7, leaving the $+4$ at the end.
