ANSWER: B

My thinking: I need to square the $x$ value first and then multiply it by 3. So, $0.3^2 = 0.3 \times 0.3$, which is $0.09$. Then, $3 \times 0.09 = 0.27$. I have to be careful not to just do $3 \times 0.3$ and then square it, because that would give a different answer, and I also need to make sure the decimal point is in the right place for $0.3$ squared.
