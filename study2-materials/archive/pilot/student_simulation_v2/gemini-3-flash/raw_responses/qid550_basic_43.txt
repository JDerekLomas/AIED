ANSWER: C

I think they are both right because in the first one, you just have plus and minus, and $3+2-1$ is $4$, and $3-1+2$ is also $4$. Then for Katie, you have to do the times first because of BIDMAS, so $2 \times 1$ is $2$, and then plus $3$ makes $5$. Both sides of her sum work out as $5$ as well, so they both said things that are true.
