ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the order of operations described in the word problem. By putting the $(n-5)/8 + 4$ inside the brackets, the "multiply by 7" applies to the entire result of the previous steps. 

Paul is incorrect because his expression only multiplies the first part by 7 and adds the 4 at the very end ($+4$ is outside the main brackets), which misses the final instruction to multiply the *entire* result by 7.
