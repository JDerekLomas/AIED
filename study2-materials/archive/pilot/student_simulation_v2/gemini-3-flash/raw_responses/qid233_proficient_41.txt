ANSWER: C

My thinking was that in algebra, you don't usually use the $\times$ sign for multiplying variables, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. The $\div$ sign means the same as a fraction bar, and since the brackets are around the $(3 + ab)$, that whole part has to go on the bottom of the fraction. I just swapped the $3$ and the $ab$ around because $ab + 3$ looks more standard than $3 + ab$, but it means the same thing. D is wrong because it still has the $\times$ symbol in it.
