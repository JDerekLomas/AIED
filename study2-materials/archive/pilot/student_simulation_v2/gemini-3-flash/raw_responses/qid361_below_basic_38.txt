ANSWER: B

I think it's Paul because his one has the divide sign ($\div$) and the question says divide, so that makes more sense. Jo's one has a fraction line and those are always really hard and confusing. Also, the 7 and the 4 are at the ends of Paul's bit which is the same order as the words in the question.
