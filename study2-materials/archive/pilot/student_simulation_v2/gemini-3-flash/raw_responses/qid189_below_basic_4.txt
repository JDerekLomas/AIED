ANSWER: D

I'm not really sure how to do the $n$ bit, but I saw the number 15 and the number 3 in the question. 15 times 3 is 45, but that wasn't there. Then I thought maybe you just do 15 times 2 because of the 1 and the 3? Or I just picked 30 because it's in the 3 times table and it looked like the most normal number.
