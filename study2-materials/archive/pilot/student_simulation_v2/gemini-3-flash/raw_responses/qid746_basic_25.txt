ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 first which is 16, then I did the bit in the brackets which is 4. So then it's just 16 divided by 4, which is 4. Wait, no, I think you have to do the divide before the plus because of BIDMAS, but the brackets come first anyway. So 2 plus 2 is 4, then 12 divided by 4 is 3. Then I just added the 4 from the start, so 4 plus 3 is 7.
