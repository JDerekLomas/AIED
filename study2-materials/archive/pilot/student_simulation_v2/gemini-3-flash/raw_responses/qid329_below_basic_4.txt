ANSWER: B

I think Katie is right because in maths you usually just do the sums in the order they're written from left to right. Tom put those brackets in which makes it look all confusing and change things, but Katie just swapped the numbers around which looks more like how you'd normally solve it. Plus, 0.2 and 0.3 are bigger than 0.1 so it makes more sense to put them at the start.
