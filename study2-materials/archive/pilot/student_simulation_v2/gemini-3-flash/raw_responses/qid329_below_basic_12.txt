My teacher said that when you do take-away and divide, you just go from left to right because that's the order they are in the sum. Tom put brackets around the end part which changes it, but Katie just swapped the numbers around and usually in maths it doesn't matter which way round they go, like 2 plus 3 is the same as 3 plus 2. So I think Katie's way looks more right.
