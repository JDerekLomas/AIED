ANSWER: C

I think it's C because the rule is $1 - 3n$, so I did $1 - 3$ which is $-2$. Then I needed the 15th term, so I did $-2 \times 15$ and that gave me $-30$. But then I saw $-14$ and thought maybe you just do $1$ minus $15$ because $n$ is $15$, and that's $-14$. That looks more like the other numbers.
