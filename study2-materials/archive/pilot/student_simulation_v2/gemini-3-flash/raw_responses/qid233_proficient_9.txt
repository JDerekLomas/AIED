ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we write $a \times b$ as just $ab$ and use a fraction bar for division. Looking at the brackets, the $3 + ab$ is all on the bottom of the fraction. I almost went for A, but then I realized the 2 is being divided by the *whole* thing in the brackets, not just the 3. So C is the correct way to write it.
