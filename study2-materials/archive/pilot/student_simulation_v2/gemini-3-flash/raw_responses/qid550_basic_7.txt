B

I think it's B because Katie's one is definitely right since you have to do the times first anyway (BIDMAS), so it doesn't matter which way you write it. But Tom is wrong because if you move the numbers around like that, it changes the sum. In his second one, you'd do 3 minus 1 first which is 2, then add 2 to get 4, but the first one is 5 minus 1 which is 4... wait, they both equal 4? Now I'm confused, but usually you aren't allowed to just swap minuses and pluses around like that, so I'll stick with Katie.
