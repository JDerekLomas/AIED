ANSWER: A

My thinking: Jo’s expression follows the order of the instructions perfectly. You start with $n-5$, divide that whole bit by 8, then add the 4 inside the brackets before multiplying the entire thing by 7. Paul’s version is wrong because he didn't put the "+ 4" inside the main brackets, so the 7 is only multiplying the division part and not the 4.
