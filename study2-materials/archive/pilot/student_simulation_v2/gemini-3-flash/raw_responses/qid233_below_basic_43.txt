ANSWER: A

I picked A because the question has a 2 and then a divide sign, and in A it has 2 over 3 which looks like a fraction. I know $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$ because you're supposed to take the times sign out, so that bit looked right. I wasn't sure what to do with the brackets but A looked the neatest.
