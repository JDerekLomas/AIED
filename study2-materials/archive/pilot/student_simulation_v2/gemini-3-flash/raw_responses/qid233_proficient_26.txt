ANSWER: C

My thinking: Algebraic convention means we don't usually write the '$\times$' sign, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Since the $(3 + ab)$ is all inside the brackets after the division sign, it all has to go on the bottom of the fraction. I just swapped the order to $ab + 3$ because it looks neater that way. A is wrong because it looks like only the 2 is being divided by 3, and D still has the multiplication sign in it.
