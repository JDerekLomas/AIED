ANSWER: A

Jo is correct because her expression follows the order of operations described. By putting the addition of 4 inside the brackets before multiplying by 7, she ensures the final multiplication applies to the entire previous result. Paul's expression is incorrect because, according to BIDMAS/BODMAS, he would multiply 7 by the quotient first and then add 4 at the very end, failing to multiply the 4 by 7.
