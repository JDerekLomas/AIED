ANSWER: A

I think Jo is right because the brackets go around the whole thing before you multiply by 7 at the end. Paul's one looks wrong because the +4 is just hanging off the end, so you'd only multiply the middle bit by 7 and not the 4. Also, Jo used a fraction line for dividing which is what my teacher does.
