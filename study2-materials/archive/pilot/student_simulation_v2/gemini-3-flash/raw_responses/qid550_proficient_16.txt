ANSWER: C

My thinking is that both are right because of how the order of operations works. For Tom, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work from left to right. $3+2-1=4$ and $3-1+2=4$, so they are equivalent. For Katie, multiplication always comes before addition (BIDMAS), so in both her cases you do $2 \times 1$ first and then add the $3$, which gives $5$ both ways. Since the order you write the terms doesn't change the result in these specific examples, they are both correct.
