A

The answer is A because of BIDMAS. We always have to do the division before the subtraction. Tom has put brackets around the division part, which doesn't actually change the value of the expression, it just makes the order more obvious. Katie has swapped the order of the terms around the minus sign, which you can't do because subtraction isn't commutative. $0.1 - 0.66...$ is definitely not the same as $0.66... - 0.1$.
