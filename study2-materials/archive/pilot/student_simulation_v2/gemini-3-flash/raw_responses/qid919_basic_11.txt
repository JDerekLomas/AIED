ANSWER: B

So, I need to put the 0.3 where the $x$ is. That makes it $3 \times 0.3^2$. I did $3 \times 0.3$ first which is $0.9$, and then I squared it. $9 \times 9$ is 81, so $0.9 \times 0.9$ must be $0.81$ or $0.27$ if you just do $3 \times 9$. I think it's $0.27$ because 0.3 squared is $0.09$ and then times 3 is $0.27$.
