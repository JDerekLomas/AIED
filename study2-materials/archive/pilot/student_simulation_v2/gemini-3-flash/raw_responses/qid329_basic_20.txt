ANSWER: A

I think it's A because you have to do the divide part first before the takeaway, like in BIDMAS. Tom has put brackets around the divide bit which is what you'd do anyway. Katie has swapped the numbers around, but you can't really do that with subtraction because $0.1 - 0.2$ isn't the same as $0.2 - 0.1$.
