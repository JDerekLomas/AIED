ANSWER: A

My teacher said that for the mean you add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so I need to divide by 5. C is wrong because it divides by 4. I thought it might be B, but the 0 doesn't really change the sum when you add it, so A looks right because it has the 5 on the bottom.
