My thinking: For Problem Q, you have to do the multiplication first because of BIDMAS/BODMAS, so that's definitely $5 \times 6$. For Problem P, addition and subtraction have the same priority, so you just work from left to right. That means you do $4 - 5$ first. I know some people think addition always comes before subtraction because 'A' is before 'S' in the acronym, but my teacher said you just go in order when it's just those two.
