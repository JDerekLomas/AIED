ANSWER: A

I picked A because you always just do the first two numbers you see, like reading a book from left to right. So for P, you do 4 minus 5 first. For Q, you do 4 plus 5 first because that’s the first sum there. Plus, 4 plus 5 is 9, and I know my 9 times tables a bit better than the other ones.
