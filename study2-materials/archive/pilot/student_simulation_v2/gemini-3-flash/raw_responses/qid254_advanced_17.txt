A

**Explanation:** To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one value is 0, it still counts as one of the 5 numbers in the data set. Adding 0 doesn't change the numerator, so $1+3+4+7$ is correct, and dividing by 5 accounts for all data points. Option B is wrong due to the order of operations (BIDMAS), as only the 7 would be divided by 5.
