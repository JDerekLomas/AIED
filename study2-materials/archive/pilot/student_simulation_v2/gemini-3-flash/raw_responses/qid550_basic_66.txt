B

I think it's B because Katie's one looks right since you have to do the times first in BIDMAS, and she’s just swapped the 3 and the 2 around. But for Tom, I don't think you can just move the numbers like that because the minus is attached to the 1, and if you change the order of adding and taking away it usually messes up the answer.
