ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 first which is 16, then I did the bit in the brackets 2 plus 2 is 4. Then I just did 16 divided by 4 which is 4. Wait, my teacher said something about BIDMAS so I should do the divide bit first? 12 divided by 2 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus another 2 is 12? No, that's not right. 

I'll just do the brackets first like we were told. 2 + 2 is 4. Then I'll do 12 divided by that 4, which is 3. Then 4 + 3 is 7. That's one of the answers.
