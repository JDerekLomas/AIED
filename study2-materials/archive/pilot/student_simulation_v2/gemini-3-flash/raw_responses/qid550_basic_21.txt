ANSWER: C

I think it's C because they are both right. For Tom, 3 plus 2 is 5, then take away 1 is 4. On the other side, 3 take away 1 is 2, then plus 2 is also 4, so they match. For Katie, you have to do the times first because of BIDMAS. 2 times 1 is 2, then add 3 makes 5. It's the same on both sides of her equals sign, just the other way round, so they are both correct.
