**Explanation:** Tom is right because of BIDMAS/BODMAS. Division has to be done before subtraction, so the expression $0.1 - 0.2 \div 0.3$ is the same as doing the $0.2 \div 0.3$ part first and then taking it away from $0.1$. Katie is wrong because she swapped the order of the subtraction, and $a - b$ isn't the same as $b - a$.
