ANSWER: A

I picked A because you always just do the sums from left to right, like how you read a book. So for Problem P you do 4 minus 5 first because it's at the start, and for Problem Q you do the 4 plus 5 first. I know there's that BIDMAS thing but I can never remember if the plus or the times comes first, so I just go in order.
