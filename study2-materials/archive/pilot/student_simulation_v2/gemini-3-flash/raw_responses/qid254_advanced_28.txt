A

**Explanation:** To find the mean, you sum all the values and divide by the total count of numbers. Even though one value is 0, it still counts as a member of the data set, so you must divide by 5. Option A is correct because $0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 7$ is the same as $1 + 3 + 4 + 7$. Option B is incorrect due to the order of operations (only the 7 would be divided by 5), and Option C incorrectly divides by 4.
