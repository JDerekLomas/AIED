ANSWER: A

My teacher said that for the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list. I didn't think the 0 mattered because it doesn't add anything to the total, but you still have to count it as one of the numbers, so you divide by 5. B looks wrong because you'd only be dividing the 7 by 5, not the whole lot.
