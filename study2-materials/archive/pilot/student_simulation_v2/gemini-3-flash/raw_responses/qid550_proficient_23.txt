My thinking is that both of them are correct because they are just changing the order of the terms while keeping the signs the same. For Tom, $3 + 2 - 1 = 4$ and $3 - 1 + 2 = 4$, so that works. For Katie, BIDMAS means you do the multiplication first anyway, so $3 + 2 = 5$ and $2 + 3 = 5$. It’s basically just the commutative property.
