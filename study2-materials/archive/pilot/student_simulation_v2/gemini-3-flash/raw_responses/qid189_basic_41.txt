A) -44

**Thinking:** I know I have to swap the $n$ for 15, so I did $1 - 3 \times 15$. My teacher says you have to do the times part first (BIDMAS), and $3 \times 15$ is 45. So then it's $1 - 45$. Since you're starting at 1 and taking away a big number, you go past zero into the negatives, which gives -44.
