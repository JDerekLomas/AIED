ANSWER: A

My teacher said that to find the mean you have to add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are. There are 5 numbers in the list, so you have to divide by 5. I didn't include the 0 in the top part because adding 0 doesn't change the sum anyway, so A must be right. B looks wrong because you'd only be dividing the 7 by 5, not the whole thing.
