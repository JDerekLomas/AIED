A) Only Jo

My thinking was that Jo’s expression follows the steps in the right order. You start with $n-5$, divide the whole thing by 8, then add 4 to that result, and finally the brackets show you multiply everything by 7. Paul’s one looks okay at first, but because he didn't put the $+4$ inside the final set of brackets, the BIDMAS rules mean you would multiply by 7 before adding the 4, which isn't what the question says to do.
