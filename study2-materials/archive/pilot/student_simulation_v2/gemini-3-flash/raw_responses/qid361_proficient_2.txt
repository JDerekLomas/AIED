ANSWER: A

I think it's Jo because she used the brackets correctly to show that the final step is to multiply everything by 7. Paul's version looks like you only multiply the division part by 7 and then add 4 at the very end, which would give a different answer. Jo's fraction notation also makes it clear that the subtract 5 happens before the divide by 8.
