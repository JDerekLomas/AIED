ANSWER: C

My thinking is that when you write algebra, you're supposed to put letters together to show they are being timesed, so $a \times b$ just becomes $ab$. Then the divide sign means it’s like a fraction. I chose C because the 2 is on the top and the whole bracket bit $(3 + ab)$ goes on the bottom, though I wasn't sure if the $ab$ or the 3 should come first. I didn't pick D because my teacher says we aren't supposed to use the $\times$ cross anymore.
