ANSWER: B

I did 4 plus 12 which is 16, and then I divided that by the first 2 I saw to get 8, but that wasn't there. So I just did 12 divided by 2 which is 6, and then added the other 2 to get 8, but then I saw the 4 at the start and the 4 at the end and got confused. I picked B because 7 is a lucky number and it looks like it might be right if you do the take away version.
