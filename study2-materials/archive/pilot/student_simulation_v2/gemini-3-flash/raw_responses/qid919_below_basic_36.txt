ANSWER: C

I think it's C because I know you have to do something with the 3 and the 0.3. I tried doing 3 times 3 which is 9, but that's not there, so then I thought maybe you just times them all together? 3 times 0.3 is 0.9, and then if you double it because of the little 2, you get 1.8. It's the only one that looked like a normal number I've seen before.
