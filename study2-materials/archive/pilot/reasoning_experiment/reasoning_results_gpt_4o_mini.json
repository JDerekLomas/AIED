I would estimate that around 25-30% of students might select this option.\n\n**Option D analysis: \\( \\frac{28}{12} \\)**  \n- **Misconception/Error:** This option could arise from a misunderstanding of how to combine fractions or from multiplying the numerators and denominators incorrectly. Students might mistakenly think they need to multiply instead of add, leading to a large numerator and denominator.\n- **Plausibility:** This is less plausible than the other options, as it requires a significant misunderstanding of fraction addition.

I would estimate that about 15-20% of students might choose this option.\n\n**Option D analysis:**\n- **Equation:** \\( \\frac{n}{3}-6=21 \\)\n- **Explanation:** This option incorrectly suggests that the number \\( n \\) is first divided by three and then six is subtracted from that result. This does not represent the problem correctly.\n- **Misconception/Error:** Students selecting this option may misunderstand the sequence of operations entirely, thinking that the division applies to \\( n \\) rather than the result of \\( n - 6 \\).\n- **Plausibility:** This option is less likely to be chosen since it diverges significantly from the problem's structure. I would estimate that only about 5-10% of students would select this option.\n\n## Step 2: Estimate Distribution\n\nBased on the analysis above, here are the estimated percentages for each option:\n\nA: 55%  \nB: 25%  \nC: 15%  \nD: 5%  \n\nThese estimates sum to 100% and reflect the likelihood of each response based on common student misconceptions and understanding of the problem."

        "raw_response": "## Step 1: Analyze Each Option\n\n**Option A analysis:**\n- **Correct Answer:** \\( 2 \\times 3^{2} = 2 \\times 9 = 18 \\)\n- **Misconception/Error:** Students who select this option likely understand the order of operations and correctly compute the exponent before multiplying. They recognize that \\( 3^2 \\) equals \\( 9 \\) and then multiply by \\( 2 \\).\n- **Plausibility:** This option is expected to be selected by students who have a solid grasp of basic arithmetic and the order of operations. Given that this is the correct answer, I would estimate that a significant portion of students, perhaps 40-50%, would choose this option.\n\n**Option B analysis:**\n- **Incorrect Answer:** \\( 2 \\times 3^{2} = 2 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 12 \\) (misunderstanding of exponentiation)\n- **Misconception/Error:** Students who select this option may mistakenly think that \\( 3^2 \\) means to multiply \\( 3 \\) by \\( 2 \\) instead of squaring it. This is a common error among students who are still developing their understanding of exponents.\n- **Plausibility:** This option is likely to attract students who have not fully grasped the concept of exponentiation. I would estimate that around 25-30% of students might choose this option due to this misconception.\n\n**Option C analysis:**\n- **Incorrect Answer:** \\( 2 \\times 3^{2} = 2 \\times 9 = 36 \\) (incorrect multiplication)\n- **Misconception/Error:** Students who select this option may misinterpret the multiplication step, possibly multiplying \\( 2 \\) by \\( 3^2 \\) incorrectly or confusing the order of operations. They might also be miscalculating \\( 2 \\times 9 \\) as \\( 36 \\), which indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of multiplication.\n- **Plausibility:** This option is less likely than Option B, but still plausible for students who struggle with basic multiplication or order of operations. I would estimate that about 10-15% of students might choose this option.\n\n**Option D analysis:**\n- **Incorrect Answer:** \\( 2 \\times 3^{2} = 11 \\) (random choice or misunderstanding)\n- **Misconception/Error:** Students selecting this option may not have performed any calculations or may have guessed. This answer does not relate logically to the problem, indicating a lack of understanding of the operations involved.\n- **Plausibility:** This option is the least plausible as it does not reflect any common mathematical errors. I would estimate that only about 5-10% of students would select this option, likely due to guessing.\n\n## Step 2: Estimate Distribution\n\nBased on the analysis above, here are the estimated percentages for each option:\n\nA: 45%  \nB: 30%  \nC: 15%  \nD: 10%  \n\nThese percentages sum to 100% and reflect a reasonable distribution based on common student misconceptions and understanding of the problem."
