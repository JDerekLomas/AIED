Some students might also miscalculate the sum of the fractions, leading them to this answer. I estimate about 10% of students would select this option.\n\n2. **Option B (\\( \\frac{7}{14} \\))**: This option may appeal to students who simplify incorrectly or misinterpret the addition of fractions. Students may mistakenly think that adding the numerators and denominators directly gives a valid fraction. This option is less plausible than A, but still reasonable enough to attract some students. I estimate about 20% would choose this option.\n\n3. **Option C (2)**: This is the correct answer, but it may also be a choice for students who miscalculate the fractions and arrive at a whole number through a misunderstanding of the addition process. Given that it is the correct answer, I estimate that about 50% of students would select this option, as many may recognize that the sum of the fractions exceeds 1 and thus could lead to a whole number.\n\n4. **Option D (\\( \\frac{28}{12} \\))**: This option is likely to attract students who might multiply the fractions incorrectly or misinterpret the problem as requiring multiplication instead of addition.

The addition of fractions can lead to a common error where students miscalculate the common denominator or the resulting numerator.\n\n3. **Option C ( \\( \\frac{2}{9} \\)) - 20%:** This option may appeal to students who correctly multiply \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) but then mistakenly add the result to \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) without finding a common denominator. This reflects a misunderstanding of how to properly add fractions with different denominators.\n\n4. **Option D ( \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\)) - 10%:** This option is less likely to be chosen as it does not closely resemble any common errors made in the addition or multiplication process. It may attract a small percentage of students who are confused about the operations altogether or miscalculate both steps.\n\nOverall, the estimates reflect common misconceptions and error patterns observed in middle school mathematics, particularly regarding the order of operations and the addition of fractions."

This error is plausible, especially among students who are still developing their algebraic manipulation skills.\n\n3. **Option C (45%)**: This is the correct answer and is likely to be chosen by students who understand the rearrangement process well. However, since many middle school students struggle with algebraic manipulation, this option will still be the most selected but not overwhelmingly so.\n\n4. **Option D (20%)**: This option indicates a misunderstanding of how to isolate \\( v \\).

This could stem from students incorrectly adding the two numbers (-1 and -4) instead of multiplying them, which is a common mistake when students confuse addition and multiplication.\n\n4. **Less Likely Error (D: -5)** - I estimate that only 10% of students would choose this option. This choice may arise from a misunderstanding of the operation or a miscalculation, but it is less plausible than the other options since it does not directly relate to the numbers involved in the multiplication.\n\nOverall, the distribution reflects a mix of correct understanding and common misconceptions that students might have when dealing with multiplication of negative numbers."

I estimate that about 40% of middle school students would select this option. This reflects a reasonable understanding of factoring quadratic expressions, especially if they have been taught the method of finding two numbers that multiply to -6 and add to -1.\n\n2. **Common Misconception (B)**: Option B, \\( (x-3)(x-2) \\), is a common error. Students might mistakenly think that both factors should be negative or miscalculate the sum and product required for factoring. I estimate that around 30% of students would choose this option due to this misconception.\n\n3. **Plausibility of Incorrect Options (C and D)**: Options C and D both involve positive factors, which is less likely to be chosen by students who are familiar with the signs needed for the correct factorization.

Option A is the correct representation of this operation. Many students at this level can follow the order of operations and understand that the expression \\( \\frac{n-6}{3} \\) correctly reflects the sequence of operations described in the problem.\n\n2. **Option B**: This option uses the division symbol but may confuse students who are less familiar with the notation. The expression \\( n-6 \\div 3=21 \\) might be interpreted as dividing \\( n-6 \\) by 3, which is correct in terms of the operation but is less commonly written this way.

This error often arises from students mistakenly adding instead of following the order of operations. They might compute \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) and then incorrectly interpret \\( 3^2 \\) as just \\( 3 \\) instead of \\( 9 \\), leading to \\( 2 \\times 3 + 3 = 12 \\).\n\n3. **Less Likely Error (C: 36)**: I estimate that 15% of students will select this option.
