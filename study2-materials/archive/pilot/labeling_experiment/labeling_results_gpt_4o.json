They might add \\(1+1+2+3 = 7\\) and \\(3+4+3+4 = 14\\), then simplify incorrectly or make an error in simplification. This option is plausible for students who are not confident in fraction addition, but it doesn't directly match the common mistake, so it might not be the most popular incorrect choice.\n\n- **Option B (\\(\\frac{7}{14}\\))**: This option is similar to A, but it represents a simplified version of \\(\\frac{7}{14}\\), which equals \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Students might choose this if they simplify incorrectly or if they are guessing. It's less likely than A because it involves an additional step of simplification, which might not occur to all students.\n\n- **Option C (2)**: This is the correct answer. Students who correctly find a common denominator and add the fractions will choose this. However, given the complexity of the task and common difficulties with fractions, not all students will arrive at this answer. Still, a significant portion of students who have been taught fraction addition well should be able to solve this correctly.\n\n- **Option D (\\(\\frac{28}{12}\\))**: This option represents the sum of the fractions without simplification. Students might arrive at this answer if they correctly find a common denominator (12) and add the fractions but forget or fail to simplify. This is a common error pattern, as students often struggle with the simplification step after correctly performing the addition.\n\nOverall, the distribution reflects the likelihood of students making specific errors or correctly solving the problem, based on common misconceptions and error patterns in fraction addition."

However, many students struggle with order of operations, so not all will arrive at this answer.

This reflects a common misconception of ignoring the order of operations, so I estimate 25% will choose this option.\n\n- **Option C (\\(\\frac{2}{9}\\))**: This could result from students who multiply the fractions first, \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{6}\\), but then incorrectly add \\(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{6}\\) by adding numerators and denominators directly, leading to \\(\\frac{2}{9}\\). This reflects a misunderstanding of fraction addition, so I estimate 20% will choose this option.\n\n- **Option D (\\(\\frac{1}{15}\\))**: This option might attract students who incorrectly multiply all terms together, \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{18}\\), and then make a further error in simplifying or calculating. This is less common, so I estimate 15% will choose this option."

However, given the common misconceptions and errors at this level, not all students will select the correct answer. I estimate that around 40% will choose this option.\n\n- **Option B (-4):** This is a plausible distractor because students often forget the rule about multiplying two negative numbers and may incorrectly assume the product is negative. This misconception is quite common, so I estimate that about 30% of students might choose this option.\n\n- **Option C (+5):** This option might attract students who mistakenly add the absolute values of the numbers being multiplied instead of multiplying them. While this is less likely than the sign error, it is still a possible mistake. I estimate that about 15% of students might choose this option.\n\n- **Option D (-5):** Similar to option C, this choice might attract students who both add the absolute values and apply the incorrect sign.

Therefore, I estimate that about 40% of students will select this option.\n\n- **Option B: \\( (x-3)(x-2) \\)**  \n  This option is a plausible distractor because students often confuse the signs when factoring.

Given the common error of misidentifying signs, I estimate that about 25% of students might choose this option.\n\n- **Option C: \\( (x+3)(x+2) \\)**  \n  This option might attract students who mistakenly add the constant term's factors instead of subtracting or those who misapply the signs entirely. Since both signs are incorrect, students who choose this option likely have a fundamental misunderstanding of the factoring process. I estimate that about 20% of students might select this option.\n\n- **Option D: \\( (x+3)(x-2) \\)**  \n  This option is less plausible because it does not correctly factor the quadratic expression in terms of signs or numbers.
