The item evaluates algebraic manipulation and the understanding of inverse operations within the context of linear equations. It specifically tests whether students can identify valid partial steps (dividing both sides by 8) versus common errors (dividing one side and multiplying the other by the same value). Based on the calibration items, this structure typically attracts students who struggle with the "balance" model of equations, leading to a moderate difficulty level and high discrimination.
