The item evaluates the ability to identify valid intermediate algebraic steps involving inverse operations (division) and multiplicative reasoning. I analyzed the specific errors made by the characters: Tom uses the same operation (division by 5) on the right side instead of the inverse, while Katie correctly divides both sides by 8. This format increases cognitive load compared to a standard calculation by requiring the evaluation of two distinct logical claims. Based on the calibration examples, items involving algebraic manipulation and "who is correct" formats typically show moderate difficulty and high discrimination.
