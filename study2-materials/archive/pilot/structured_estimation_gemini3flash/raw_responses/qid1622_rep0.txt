The item assesses the ability to substitute a value into a linear equation with two variables. The student must recognize that when $x=0$, the equation simplifies to $2y=6$. This requires understanding of algebraic notation, substitution, and solving a basic one-step equation. The distractors target common errors, such as using the coefficient of $x$ (3) or performing incorrect inverse operations. The visual format of a table is a standard presentation for this topic in the UK curriculum.
