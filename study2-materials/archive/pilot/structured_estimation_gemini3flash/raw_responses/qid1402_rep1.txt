The item assesses basic algebraic notation and the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). The primary challenge lies in the student's ability to recognize that multiplication is implied by the juxtaposition of 'a' and 'b' and that this operation takes precedence over the addition of 3. Distractors B, C, and D are highly plausible for students who struggle with the left-to-right processing bias or misunderstand algebraic syntax. Based on the provided calibration examples, items involving order of operations and basic algebraic manipulation typically show moderate difficulty but high discrimination, as they clearly separate students who understand structural rules from those who apply arithmetic rules linearly.
