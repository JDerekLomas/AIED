The item evaluates the application of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically within the context of fraction arithmetic. The student must prioritize multiplication over addition, requiring a two-step procedural execution: multiplying two unit fractions and then adding the result to another fraction with a different denominator. The distractors are highly diagnostic: Option B represents a left-to-right processing error, while others likely stem from common fraction addition/multiplication errors. Based on the calibration examples involving similar order-of-operation misconceptions, this item is likely to have a low proportion correct due to the compounding difficulty of fraction manipulation and the strong pull of the left-to-right processing heuristic.
