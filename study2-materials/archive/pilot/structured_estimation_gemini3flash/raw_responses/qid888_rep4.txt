The item assesses the expansion of a quadratic expression with two negative constants. The primary cognitive challenge lies in the application of the distributive property (FOIL method) combined with integer arithmetic, specifically the rule that multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive product. Based on the calibration examples, items involving negative number misconceptions in algebraic contexts typically show moderate difficulty and high discrimination. The distractors are highly plausible as they target common errors in term summation (-5 - 7 vs -5 + 7) and sign multiplication (-5 * -7).
