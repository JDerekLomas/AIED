The item assesses the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically regarding the priority of division over subtraction and the non-commutative property of subtraction. Students must recognize that the original expression matches Tom's parenthetical grouping because division is performed first, whereas Katie's reordering is mathematically incorrect. The cognitive demand is moderate as it requires evaluating two separate statements involving decimals, though the actual calculation is bypassed by the conceptual nature of the question.
