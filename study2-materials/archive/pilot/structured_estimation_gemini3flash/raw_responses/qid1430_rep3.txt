The item assesses the most fundamental aspect of fraction arithmetic: adding fractions with a common denominator. This is a primary school level skill (Key Stage 2) being tested within a secondary school diagnostic context. The cognitive demand is very low, as it requires only a single addition of numerators while maintaining the denominator. The primary distractor (D) targets the extremely common misconception of adding both numerators and denominators, which is a persistent error even into early secondary years. Given the simplicity of the task compared to the calibration examples, I anticipate a high proportion correct and a very low IRT difficulty. The discrimination is expected to be moderate to high because this specific misconception clearly separates students who understand the concept of a fractional unit from those who do not.
