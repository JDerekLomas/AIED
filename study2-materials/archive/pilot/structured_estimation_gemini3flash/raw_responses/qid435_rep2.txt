The item evaluates the application of order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) combined with directed number arithmetic across four distinct expressions. The primary cognitive demand stems from managing multiple negative signs and the specific misconception regarding the product of two negatives. Based on the calibration examples, items involving multi-step negative integer arithmetic tend to have moderate difficulty and high discrimination as they effectively separate students with robust procedural fluency from those with fragile conceptual understanding.
