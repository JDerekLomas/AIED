The item assesses the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). I have evaluated the complexity of the operations, noting that it requires three distinct steps: addition within brackets, division, and final addition. The distractors are highly effective because they map directly to common procedural errors, such as working strictly left-to-right (A) or ignoring brackets (C). Based on the calibration examples for similar arithmetic and order-of-operation tasks, I have estimated the difficulty and discrimination parameters, accounting for the fact that while the concepts are foundational, the specific left-to-right misconception remains persistent among lower-attaining students in the 11-16 age range.
