The item assesses basic order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) by asking for the first step rather than the final result. While the concept is foundational for UK secondary students, the "left-to-right" misconception is extremely common and persistent. The inclusion of parentheses makes the first step explicitly defined, which usually increases the proportion of correct answers compared to multi-step calculations, though the presence of "1+2" at the start remains a strong distractor for lower-ability students.
