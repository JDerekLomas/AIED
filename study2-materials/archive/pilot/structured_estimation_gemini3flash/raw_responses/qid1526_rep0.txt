The item assesses the addition of fractions with unequal denominators ($3/5 + 2/7$), a fundamental skill in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum. The reasoning follows that students must identify the need for a common denominator (35), convert both fractions ($21/35$ and $10/35$), and sum the numerators. The distractors are highly diagnostic: Option C targets the most common misconception (adding numerators and denominators), while Option A represents a subtraction error or calculation slip. Given the prevalence of the additive misconception in this age group, the classical difficulty is expected to be moderate, with a standard discrimination profile.
