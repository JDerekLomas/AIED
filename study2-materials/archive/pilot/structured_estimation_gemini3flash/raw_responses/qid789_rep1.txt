The item assesses fundamental fraction addition and simplification, which are core skills for the lower end of the 11-16 age range. The reasoning involves identifying that while the calculation itself is straightforward (adding numerators with a common denominator), the requirement to provide the answer in "simplest form" adds a secondary procedural step that differentiates students who can perform basic operations from those who understand equivalent fractions. The misconception of adding both numerators and denominators is highly prevalent in this cohort, making Distractor A particularly attractive, while Distractor B captures students who forget to simplify. Given the commonality of these errors, the item is expected to have a moderate difficulty level despite its conceptual simplicity.
