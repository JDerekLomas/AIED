<chain_of_thought>
The item assesses the application of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically involving fractions. The primary challenge is resisting the left-to-right calculation (Addition before Multiplication), which leads to distractor B. The calculations themselves involve finding common denominators and basic multiplication, which are foundational skills for the 11-16 age group. Based on the calibration examples for similar order-of-operation errors, this item likely has a low proportion correct due to the commonality of the misconception, but a moderate IRT difficulty.
