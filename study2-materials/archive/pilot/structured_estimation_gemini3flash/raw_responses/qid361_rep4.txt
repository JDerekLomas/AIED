The target item tests the ability to translate a multi-step verbal description of operations into a correct algebraic expression, specifically focusing on the use of brackets and the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). 

Jo's expression correctly uses a fraction bar to group $(n-5)$ and large brackets to ensure the final multiplication by 7 applies to the entire previous result. Paul's expression fails because the final "+ 4" is outside the multiplication by 7, which violates the sequence "finally multiply by 7".

Comparing this to the calibration examples:
1. It is more complex than the simple linear equation (Item 1) because it involves nested operations.
2. It is similar to Item 2 (order of operations) but uses algebraic notation rather than just arithmetic.
3. It shares structural similarities with Item 3 (function machines/inverse operations) but focuses on the construction of the expression rather than solving.
4. The misconception "left to right regardless of priority" is strong here. Many students will see Paul's expression and think it follows the verbal flow correctly without realizing the multiplication by 7 should distribute or be applied last to the *sum*.

The "Only Jo/Only Paul/Both/Neither" format typically has a higher guessing parameter than standard 4-choice questions because "Both" is a very attractive distractor for students who see two plausible-looking expressions. Paul's expression looks "correct" to a student who reads left-to-right and doesn't understand that $7(\dots)+4$ means the 4 is added after the multiplication.

I expect the difficulty to be moderate to high (classical difficulty around 0.35-0.45) because while the steps are clear, the notation for Paul's answer is a common trap.
