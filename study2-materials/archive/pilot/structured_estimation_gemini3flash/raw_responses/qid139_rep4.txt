The item assesses a specific sub-step of binomial expansion: multiplying two negative constants. I evaluated the cognitive load as low due to the single-operation focus, but noted high distractor plausibility because the misconception (negative times negative equals negative) is a persistent error in this age group. The visual prompt reduces the abstraction of the expansion process, leading to a prediction of moderate difficulty and high discrimination.
