The item assesses the ability to translate a concrete visual representation (cups and counters) into formal algebraic notation and solve the resulting linear equation. The visual model explicitly shows the subtraction of "x" from both sides (removing one cup) and then the subtraction of "2" from both sides (removing two counters), which maps directly to the steps of solving $x+4=2x+2$. Distractors B, C, and D capitalize on the common misconception of adding terms (e.g., $1x+2x=3x$ or $4+2=6$) instead of performing inverse operations. While the visual prompt provides a strong scaffolding effect, the transition from diagram to symbolic notation increases the cognitive load compared to a purely symbolic problem. Based on the provided calibration items, this item appears moderately difficult because it requires interpreting a specific visual model alongside formal algebra.
