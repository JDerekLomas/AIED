The item involves solving a double inequality, which requires applying inverse operations simultaneously to both sides. The steps include subtracting 1 from all three parts and then dividing by 2. The distractors are designed to capture common errors: Option A reflects using addition/multiplication instead of subtraction/division, Option C suggests an error in the subtraction phase (-5 - 1 = -4), and Option D suggests a miscalculation of the bounds. Given the complexity of managing two inequality signs, this item is likely more difficult than a standard linear equation but remains a core part of the higher-tier GCSE curriculum.
