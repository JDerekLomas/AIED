The item assesses quadratic factorisation, a core GCSE topic involving the identification of two integers that sum to -1 and multiply to -6. The cognitive demand involves handling directed numbers and the distributive law in reverse. Distractors target common errors in sign manipulation, particularly the misconception that a negative product can result from two negative factors. Comparing this to the calibration examples, it sits at a similar difficulty level to the "Tom and Katie" factorisation item but is slightly more direct in its presentation.
