The item assesses the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically the priority of multiplication over addition and subtraction. While the calculation itself is simple, the question asks for the "first step," which directly targets the common left-to-right processing misconception. Compared to the calibration examples, this is more fundamental than solving inequalities or quadratic factoring, suggesting a higher facility rate but lower IRT difficulty. The distractors are highly plausible for students who rely on linear reading or "addition before subtraction" mnemonics.
