The item assesses the understanding of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically comparing left-to-right processing for addition/subtraction against the priority of multiplication over addition. The conceptual load is low, but the question targets a common persistent misconception where students apply left-to-right rules universally or misinterpret the "A" and "S" in BIDMAS as a rigid sequence. Based on the provided calibration items, this fundamental arithmetic concept often yields high discrimination but reveals significant gaps in student understanding, leading to a moderate difficulty profile.
