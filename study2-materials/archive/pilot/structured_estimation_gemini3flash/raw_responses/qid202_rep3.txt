The item assesses basic addition of mixed numbers with common denominators, a fundamental skill in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum. The reasoning involves evaluating the simplicity of the arithmetic against the commonality of the "add across" misconception (Option C) and the conversion to improper fractions (Option B). I have compared this to the calibration examples, noting that while the math is more straightforward than solving inequalities, the presence of highly plausible distractors for students with early-stage fraction understanding suggests moderate difficulty and high discrimination.
