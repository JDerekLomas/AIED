The item assesses quadratic factorization, a core topic for UK Key Stage 4 (ages 14-16). It requires students to identify two integers that sum to -1 and multiply to -6. The distractors are highly plausible because they represent common errors in integer arithmetic and sign placement, which are frequent hurdles in this specific curriculum area. The cognitive load is moderate, focusing on simultaneous constraints rather than multiple procedural steps. Given the calibration items, this topic typically shows moderate difficulty and high discrimination as it effectively separates students who have mastered negative number operations from those who haven't.
