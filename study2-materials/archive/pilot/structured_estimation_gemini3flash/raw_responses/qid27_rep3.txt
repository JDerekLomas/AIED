The item tests substitution into an algebraic expression involving negative numbers.
The expression is $10 - 2d$ with $d = -2$.
Steps to solve:
1. Substitute $d = -2$: $10 - 2(-2)$
2. Multiply $-2 \times -2 = +4$ (Crucial step: negative $\times$ negative)
3. Add: $10 + 4 = 14$

Distractor analysis:
- A ($10 - 2(2) = 6$, then making it negative? Or $10 - 22$ logic): $-12$ is a common result if students confuse signs or subtraction order.
- B ($10 - 2(2) = 6$): Student ignores the negative sign of $d$.
- C (Correct): $14$.
- D ($10 - 2$ followed by $d$? Or $10 - (-22)$?): $32$ is less common but often results from concatenation or specific order of operations errors.

The specific misconception "multiplying two negatives gives a negative" would lead to $10 - 4 = 6$ (Option B). However, the interaction between the subtraction sign and the negative coefficient is a notorious "trap" in UK secondary math (KS3/KS4). 

Comparing to calibration items:
- Item 1 ($-5=p+10$) had a very low classical difficulty (0.167). Negative number manipulation is consistently harder for this age group than teachers expect.
- Item 4 (Factorising) had a difficulty of 0.473.
- Substitution with two negatives is generally more difficult than standard substitution but easier than solving multi-step inequalities.

I expect the classical difficulty to be around 0.45. Many students will choose 6 (Option B) because they see $10 - 2 \times 2 = 6$ or $10 + (-4) = 6$. The IRT difficulty (b) will likely be slightly positive as it requires mastery of directed numbers.
