The item assesses the conversion of arithmetic expressions into formal algebraic notation, specifically focusing on the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and fraction notation. The complexity is moderate as it requires recognizing that multiplication (ab) precedes addition and that the division symbol translates to a vinculum covering the entire denominator. Distractors A and B effectively target common errors in order of operations and distributive property confusion, while D tests the understanding of "algebraic convention" regarding the removal of the multiplication sign.
