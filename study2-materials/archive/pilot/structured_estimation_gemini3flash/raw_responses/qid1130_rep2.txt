The item requires the student to synthesize geometric knowledge (angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees) with algebraic manipulation (combining like terms and solving a multi-step linear equation). The cognitive load is moderate as students must first set up the equation $4x + (2x - 12) + (4x + 42) = 180$, simplify it to $10x + 30 = 180$, and then solve for $x$. The distractors are likely derived from common errors such as setting the sum to 90 or 360, or making sign errors during the inverse operation phase, which aligns with the identified misconception of using the same operation rather than the inverse. Based on the calibration examples, multi-step algebraic problems with geometric contexts typically fall in the middle-to-high difficulty range for this age group.
