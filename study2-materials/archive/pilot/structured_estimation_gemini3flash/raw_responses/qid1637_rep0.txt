The item assesses the ability to solve a two-sided linear inequality, requiring two distinct inverse operations applied simultaneously to all three parts of the expression. I analyzed the procedural complexity, noting that it involves subtraction followed by division, and evaluated the commonality of the inverse operation misconception in this multi-step context. Finally, I compared the item's structure and likely student performance against the provided calibration examples to estimate difficulty and discrimination parameters.
