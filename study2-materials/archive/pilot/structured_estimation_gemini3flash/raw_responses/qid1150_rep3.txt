The item assesses the ability to rearrange a formula involving a square and a fraction, which is a standard UK secondary school curriculum requirement. The reasoning involves evaluating the two-step algebraic manipulation (multiplication by the denominator followed by square rooting) and identifying how common errors, such as squaring instead of rooting or failing to multiply correctly, manifest in the distractors. The difficulty is estimated by comparing it to similar algebraic manipulation tasks in the calibration set, noting that literal equations (rearranging) often present higher cognitive load than numerical equations for this age group.
