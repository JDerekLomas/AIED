The item involves a standard two-step linear equation requiring an additive inverse and a multiplicative inverse. The presence of a fraction as the solution increases the likelihood of errors involving reciprocal confusion or operation reversal. Based on the calibration items, this type of equation typically shows moderate discrimination and a difficulty level slightly below the mean for the target age group.
