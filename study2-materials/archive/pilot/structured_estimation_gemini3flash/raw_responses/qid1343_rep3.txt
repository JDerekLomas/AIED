The item assesses the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) using four basic integers and two operations of equal/varying priority. My reasoning involves identifying that the primary hurdle is resisting the left-to-right processing instinct (which leads to option C) or misidentifying operation priority (leading to options A or B). Based on the calibration examples, particularly the arithmetic item involving fractions and decimals, students often struggle with multi-step arithmetic when operation priority is not explicitly signaled by brackets. The item is procedurally simple but cognitively demanding for students with weak foundational rules, leading to a moderate difficulty profile and high discrimination.
