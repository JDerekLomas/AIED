The item involves solving a basic algebraic equation where the variable is in the denominator. This structure typically triggers a specific misconception where students apply the inverse operation to the wrong number (calculating $10 \times 5$ or $10 \div 5$) rather than correctly rearranging the equation. Based on the calibration items, such algebraic errors are common among secondary students, leading to a moderate difficulty level. The distractors are highly plausible, specifically $p=50$ (multiplication) and $p=2$ (division in the wrong order), which suggests a significant portion of students will select incorrect options.
