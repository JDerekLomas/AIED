The item evaluates a student's ability to solve a multi-step quadratic equation by isolating the variable. The process involves subtracting 9, dividing by 3, and taking the square root, while recognizing both positive and negative roots. The distractors are designed to catch common errors in arithmetic or order of operations, specifically the inverse operation misconception. Based on the calibration examples, items involving inverse operations and multiple steps typically show moderate difficulty and high discrimination among this age group.
