The item assesses the ability to substitute a value into a linear nth-term formula. The cognitive process involves replacing $n$ with 15, performing multiplication ($3 \times 15 = 45$), and then subtraction ($1 - 45 = -44$). The identified misconception involves order of operations (calculating $1 - 3$ first to get $-2$, then multiplying by 15 to get $-30$), which is a common error in algebraic substitution. The item is concise and uses standard notation, leading to high clarity but requiring specific procedural knowledge of negative numbers and term-to-term rules.
