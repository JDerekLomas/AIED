The item assesses multi-step equation solving involving squares and square roots. To solve $3p^2 + 9 = 39$, a student must subtract 9 ($3p^2 = 30$), divide by 3 ($p^2 = 10$), and then take the square root ($p = \pm\sqrt{10}$). The complexity is moderate as it combines linear operations with quadratic inverse operations. The distractors target common arithmetic errors (e.g., $39+9$ or $39/3$) and the failure to recognize non-integer roots. Based on the calibration items, multi-step algebraic manipulation for this age group typically results in a moderate difficulty parameter and a low-to-moderate guessing probability.
