The item evaluates the application of order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically involving negative integers. Reasoning focuses on the conflict between left-to-right processing and operator priority, noting that the presence of multiple negative signs increases the likelihood of arithmetic errors. Distractors are mapped to common errors: A and B represent left-to-right calculation, while C represents an error in the multiplication step or sign handling.
