The item asks for the expansion of $(m-3)(m-2)$. 
- **Correct Answer (A):** $m^2 - 5m + 6$. This requires FOIL/Grid method: $m^2 - 2m - 3m + 6$.
- **Distractor D ($m^2 - 5m - 6$):** This directly tests the misconception that $(-3) \times (-2) = -6$. This is a very common error among UK secondary students (Key Stage 3 and 4).
- **Distractor B ($m^2 - m - 6$):** This suggests an error in both the linear term (perhaps $-3 + 2$) and the constant term.
- **Distractor C ($m^2 + 5m + 6$):** This suggests a complete disregard for the negative signs in the brackets.

Comparing this to the calibration examples:
- The item "Tom and Katie" (factorising $x^2-5x-6$) had a classical difficulty of 0.473 and $b = 0.404$. Expanding brackets is generally considered slightly easier than factorising (the reverse process), but the negative signs here are particularly tricky.
- The "negative times negative" misconception is strong. 
- Procedurally, it's a standard 3-4 step process (expand, then simplify).
- Notation is standard for the UK curriculum (Year 9/10).

I expect a higher success rate than the "Tom and Katie" item because expansion is a more direct procedural task than identifying factorisation errors, but the negative constant will still trip up nearly half the cohort.
