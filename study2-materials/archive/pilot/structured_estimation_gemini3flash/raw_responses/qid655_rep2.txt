The item assesses the ability to solve a one-step linear equation involving negative integers and fractions. Reasoning involves recognizing that the unknown is the result of dividing -8 by -6, which requires understanding that a negative divided by a negative yields a positive result. The distractors are highly plausible as they cover sign errors (A and B) and reciprocal errors (C), targeting common misconceptions regarding integer multiplication and algebraic manipulation.
