The item assesses the expansion of a quadratic binomial with two negative constants. The primary cognitive challenge lies in the application of the distributive property and the correct multiplication of negative integers. I evaluated the item's complexity based on the standard UK curriculum for Key Stage 3 and 4, noting that while the procedure is routine, the sign-handling creates significant opportunities for common misconceptions to manifest. The distractors are highly plausible as they systematically target errors in addition and multiplication of directed numbers.
