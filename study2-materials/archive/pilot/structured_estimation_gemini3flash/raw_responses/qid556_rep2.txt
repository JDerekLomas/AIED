The item assesses the fundamental algebraic concept of inverse operations, specifically isolating a variable by dividing a coefficient. The visual representation using a "star" to denote the operation is a common pedagogical tool in UK secondary schools, making the question highly accessible. While the concept is foundational, the presence of distractors like "+9" and "-9" directly targets the common misconception of using the same operation rather than the inverse, which often persists in lower-attaining students. Given the simplicity of the single-step procedure and the clear visual mapping from 9y to y, the item is expected to have a high success rate among the 11-16 age group, placing its difficulty in the lower range compared to multi-step linear equations.
