The item assesses the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) by comparing a standard expression to one containing parentheses. Reasoning involves calculating the left side (8 + 3 = 11) using division priority and the right side (20 / 4 = 5) using bracket priority. The primary misconception involves left-to-right processing, which leads to an incorrect equality (8+12=20, 20/4=5 on both sides). This is a fundamental concept for the 11-16 age range, typically resulting in moderate discrimination and low guessing parameters due to the clear presence of a dominant distractor.
