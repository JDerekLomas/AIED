The item assesses the ability to solve linear inequalities with variables on both sides. I evaluated the complexity of the algebraic manipulation, specifically the potential for errors when handling negative signs and the direction of the inequality symbol. By comparing this item to the provided calibration examples—particularly the very similar inequality question—I estimated that the difficulty is slightly higher than basic linear equations but remains a standard curriculum expectation. The distractors effectively target common errors in inverse operations and sign management.
