The item assesses the ability to identify errors in a multi-step linear equation solution involving multiplication and subtraction. I evaluated the complexity of the fractional expression and the specific error in Step 2, where the student used the same operation (addition) instead of the inverse (subtraction). By comparing this structure to the calibration examples, particularly the first and third items which also involve inverse operation misconceptions, I estimated the difficulty and discrimination parameters based on the typical performance of the UK secondary student cohort.
