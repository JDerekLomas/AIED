The item assesses the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically focusing on the priority of indices over multiplication. The core challenge is resisting the left-to-right processing impulse (which leads to $6^2 = 36$). I evaluated the procedural simplicity against the high prevalence of the "left-to-right" misconception in this age group. By comparing this to the provided calibration items—particularly the arithmetic item with a similar misconception—I estimated the difficulty parameters. The distractor 36 is highly plausible for students with weak operational hierarchy, while 12 (interpreting $3^2$ as $3 \times 2$) targets a secondary misconception.
