The item assesses the ability to identify valid algebraic transformations when solving equations with variables on both sides. It specifically targets the inverse operation misconception, where students might add a constant to both sides when they should subtract, or vice versa, to eliminate a term. While the concepts of balancing equations are standard for the 11-16 age range, the meta-cognitive "Jo and Paul" format increases cognitive load and requires students to evaluate two different incorrect transformations. Given that both proposed steps involve the same sign error (using the same operation instead of the inverse), the item is likely to have a high difficulty and strong distractor attraction for those who struggle with negative number operations in algebra.
