The item requires students to substitute a decimal value ($x = 0.3$) into a linear equation ($2x + 3y = 12$) and solve for $y$. 
Steps:
1. Substitution: $2(0.3) + 3y = 12 \Rightarrow 0.6 + 3y = 12$.
2. Rearrange: $3y = 12 - 0.6 = 11.4$.
3. Solve: $y = 11.4 / 3 = 3.8$.

Analysis of Distractors:
- Option D (3.8) is correct.
- Option B (3.9): Potential error in subtraction ($12 - 0.6 = 11.7$ then $11.7/3 = 3.9$) or miscalculating $2 \times 0.3$.
- Option D (4.2): Misconception of using the same operation ($12 + 0.6 = 12.6$, then $12.6 / 3 = 4.2$). This matches the stated misconception "uses the same operation rather than the inverse".
- Option A (4.1): Likely a calculation error in the division or subtraction.

Psychometric considerations:
This item combines algebra with decimals, which significantly increases the difficulty for the 11-16 age group compared to integer equations. While the concept (substitution) is standard, the arithmetic ($12 - 0.6$ and $11.4 \div 3$) is a common failure point. The "same operation" misconception is a strong distractor here. Comparing to the calibration items, this feels more difficult than the simple equation $-5 = p + 10$ because of the decimal arithmetic and multi-step nature, but less complex than the inequality which involves variables on both sides.
