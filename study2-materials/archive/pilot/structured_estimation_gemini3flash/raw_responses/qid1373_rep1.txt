The item assesses the expansion of a single bracket involving a negative multiplier. The primary difficulty stems from the application of the distributive law combined with negative number arithmetic—specifically the rule that a negative times a negative equals a positive. Compared to the calibration items, this is a fundamental algebraic skill with common, high-frequency misconceptions (distractors B and C). The item is highly standard in presentation (low transfer distance) and clear in its requirement.
