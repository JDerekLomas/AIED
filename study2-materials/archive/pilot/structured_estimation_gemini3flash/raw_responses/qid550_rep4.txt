The item assesses understanding of the commutative property and the order of operations by presenting two statements for verification. I evaluated the complexity of verifying arithmetic identities compared to solving equations, noting that while the operations are simple, the conceptual hurdle involves recognizing that rearrangement is valid under specific rules (BIDMAS). I then compared this to the calibration items, specifically the "Tom and Katie" factorizing item, to estimate the likely difficulty and discrimination parameters based on common student misconceptions regarding operation priority.
