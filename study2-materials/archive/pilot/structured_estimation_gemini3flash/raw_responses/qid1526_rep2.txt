The item assesses the addition of fractions with unequal denominators ($3/5 + 2/7$). The correct procedure involves finding a common denominator (35) and adjusting the numerators ($21/35 + 10/35 = 31/35$). The primary misconception tested is the "add-across" error ($5/12$), which is one of the most persistent errors in middle-school mathematics. Distractor D ($5/35$) represents a partial process error, while A ($11/35$) likely targets a subtraction or numerator calculation error. The visual representation (arithmetic pyramid/circles) is a standard pedagogical tool in the UK curriculum. Given the strength of the add-across misconception and the procedural nature of the task, the item is expected to have a moderate difficulty level and a high discrimination power.
