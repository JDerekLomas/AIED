The item assesses a specific sub-step of binomial expansion: the multiplication of two negative constants. While the overall context is algebraic, the target operation is arithmetic. The visual presentation with arrows reduces cognitive load by isolating the terms, making the task more direct than a full expansion. The primary challenge lies in the negative sign multiplication, a common area for misconceptions, though the simplicity of the single-step calculation suggests a relatively high success rate compared to more complex algebraic manipulations.
