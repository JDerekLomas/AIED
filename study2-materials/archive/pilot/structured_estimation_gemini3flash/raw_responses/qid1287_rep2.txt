The item assesses the ability to translate visual representations (cups and counters) into algebraic equations and solve them. The visual model explicitly shows the subtraction of 'x' from both sides and then the subtraction of '2' from both sides, leading to the solution. The distractors target common errors in algebraic manipulation, specifically the misconception of adding terms instead of using inverse operations (e.g., adding 1x to 2x to get 3x, or adding 4 and 2 to get 6). Given the visual scaffolding, the initial setup is accessible, but the subsequent steps in the distractors are highly plausible for students struggling with variable manipulation.
