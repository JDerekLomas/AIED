The item assesses the ability to solve a multi-step quadratic equation involving subtraction, division, and finding square roots, including the recognition of both positive and negative solutions. The complexity is moderate for the target age group, as it requires isolating the squared term before applying the inverse operation of squaring. Distractors are well-designed to capture common errors, such as using the wrong variable name or performing incorrect arithmetic operations (e.g., adding instead of subtracting). Based on the calibration items, this question sits in the middle range of difficulty for secondary students.
