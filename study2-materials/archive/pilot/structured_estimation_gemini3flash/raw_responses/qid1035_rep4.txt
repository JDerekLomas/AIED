The item assesses the expansion of a single bracket involving a negative sign and subtraction, which is a core skill in the UK Key Stage 3 and 4 algebra curriculum. The reasoning considers the high frequency of sign errors when distributing a negative coefficient, the structural simplicity of the expression, and the specific attraction of distractors that fail to apply the double negative rule.
