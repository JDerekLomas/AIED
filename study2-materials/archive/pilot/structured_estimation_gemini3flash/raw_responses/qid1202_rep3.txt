The target item asks students to solve the linear equation \(3 - y = 5\). 
- **Mathematical Analysis:** This is a one-step or two-step equation depending on the student's method (e.g., adding $y$ to both sides then subtracting 5, or subtracting 3 then dividing by -1).
- **Misconception Analysis:** 
    - Choice A ($y=2$): Likely comes from $5 - 3$ or ignoring the negative sign in front of $y$.
    - Choice C ($y=8$): Comes from adding 3 to 5 (using the same operation instead of inverse, or misinterpreting the 3 as being subtracted).
    - Choice D ($y=-8$): Likely a sign error combined with the addition error.
- **Comparison to Calibration Items:** 
    - The first calibration item $-5 = p + 10$ has a classical difficulty of 0.167. That item is arguably harder because of the negative result and the structure. 
    - The target item $3 - y = 5$ involves a negative coefficient for the variable, which is a notorious "trip-wire" for UK students in Key Stage 3 and 4. Many students will incorrectly perform $5 - 3 = 2$.
    - The "misconception tested" note suggests students will use the same operation ($5+3=8$) or fail to handle the subtraction of $y$ correctly.
- **Psychometric Estimation:** 
    - Proportion correct: Solving equations with negative variables is generally poorly performed. I expect a low proportion correct, likely between 0.25 and 0.35, as "2" is a very strong distractor.
    - IRT Difficulty ($b$): Based on the calibration items, where a 0.16 proportion correct mapped to -0.702 and 0.29 mapped to 0.002, this item should sit around the -0.1 to 0.1 range.
    - Discrimination ($a$): Most of these diagnostic items show high discrimination (above 1.2).
    - Guessing ($c$): With 4 choices and a common misconception, guessing is usually low, but some students might guess if they get stuck on the negative $y$.
