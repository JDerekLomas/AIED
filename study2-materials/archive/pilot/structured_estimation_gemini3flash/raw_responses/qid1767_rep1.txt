The item assesses a fundamental algebraic skill: identifying the inverse operation needed to isolate a variable. The transition from $x - 7$ to $x$ requires the addition of 7, which is a core concept in early secondary algebra (Key Stage 3). The primary distractor is the use of the same operation (subtraction) rather than the inverse, a common misconception in equation solving. The visual presentation using "function machine" style arrows or "working bars" is standard in UK pedagogy, making the transfer distance low. Given the simplicity of the single-step operation and its foundational nature, the difficulty is expected to be relatively low compared to multi-step equations, though the specific misconception tested often persists into higher age groups.
