The item assesses substitution into a formula involving an exponent and a negative base. The primary cognitive challenge lies in the application of the rule that an even power of a negative number results in a positive value, a common area for misconceptions regarding sign rules and exponentiation. Comparing this to the calibration items, it requires fewer procedural steps than the inequality or function machine items but targets a highly persistent misconception similar to the factorisation item.
