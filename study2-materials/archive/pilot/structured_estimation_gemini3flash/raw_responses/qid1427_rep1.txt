The item assesses the fundamental algebraic concept of inverse operations within the context of solving linear equations. While the mathematical operation is simple (subtracting 7), the question uses a visual representation of "working out" which adds a layer of interpretation. The misconception tested—using the same operation rather than the inverse—is a classic error for students at the lower end of the 11-16 age range. Comparing this to the calibration items, it is more direct than the inequality or function machine items, suggesting a higher success rate and lower IRT difficulty.
