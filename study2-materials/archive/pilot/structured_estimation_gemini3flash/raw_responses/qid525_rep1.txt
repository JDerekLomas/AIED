The item involves adding mixed numbers with different denominators, requiring the conversion to a common denominator or improper fractions. The primary misconception (adding numerators and denominators) is highly common among UK secondary students, leading to distractor D. The procedural steps include finding a common denominator (20), converting fractional parts, and simplifying or regrouping, which increases the cognitive load and potential for error compared to simple integer addition.
