The item assesses order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and the use of brackets.
To solve it, a student must evaluate the four expressions:
A) $16 - (10) \div 2 = 16 - 5 = 11$
B) $10 + 4 \div 2 = 10 + 2 = 12$
C) $16 - 6 + 2 = 12$ (This is identical to the expression without brackets)
D) $(10 + 4) \div 2 = 14 \div 2 = 7$ (Correct)

The misconception "left to right regardless of priority" is strong here. If a student calculates $16-6+4 \div 2$ left to right without brackets, they get $(10+4) \div 2 = 7$. Therefore, the question asks which brackets *force* that specific (often incorrect) left-to-right result. 

Comparing this to the calibration items:
- It is more complex than the $0.4 - 1/5 \times 3$ item because it involves evaluating multiple options rather than a single calculation.
- The "left to right" misconception is very common in the UK 11-14 age range.
- The difficulty should be moderate. While the calculation is simple, the logic of "adding brackets to make it true" requires more working memory than a standard calculation.
- Option C is a "weak" distractor because it doesn't change the value of the original expression, but students often struggle with the fact that $16-6+2$ is $12$ (they might do $6+2$ first to get $16-8=8$).
- Classical difficulty is likely higher (easier) than the first two calibration examples because the answer can be found by trial and error with relatively small integers.

IRT b-parameter will likely be around the mean (0.0 to 0.5) as it requires multiple steps of verification. Discrimination should be high as BIDMAS is a key "gatekeeper" concept.
