The item assesses the addition of fractions with unequal denominators, a core skill in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum. The reasoning involves identifying the need for a common denominator, calculating the equivalent fractions ($12/20$ and $5/20$), and summing the numerators. The distractors are highly effective: Option A represents the common "add across" misconception ($3+1/5+4$), while Option C results from subtracting rather than adding, and Option B represents a combination of adding numerators and multiplying denominators. Given the prevalence of the "add across" error among students in this age group, the item is expected to have a moderate difficulty level and high discrimination.
