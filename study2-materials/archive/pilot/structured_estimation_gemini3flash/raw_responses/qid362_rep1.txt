The item assesses the ability to rearrange a linear equation from the form ax + by = c to y = mx + c to identify the gradient. This requires multiple algebraic steps, including subtracting terms and dividing by coefficients, which introduces several opportunities for sign errors and inverse operation mistakes. The distractors are highly plausible as they represent common errors: using only the coefficient of x, failing to account for the sign change when moving terms, or neglecting to divide by the coefficient of y. Given the complexity of rearranging compared to standard slope-intercept forms, the item is expected to have a higher difficulty level and strong discrimination.
