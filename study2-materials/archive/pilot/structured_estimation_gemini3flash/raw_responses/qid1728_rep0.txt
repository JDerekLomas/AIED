The item evaluates the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically within the context of fraction arithmetic. To solve correctly, students must prioritize the multiplication ($\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{20}$) before performing the subtraction ($\frac{15}{20} - \frac{1}{20} = \frac{14}{20} = \frac{7}{10}$). The distractors are highly plausible: Option C targets the left-to-right misconception ($\frac{2}{4} \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{2}{20} = \frac{1}{10}$), and others target common fraction errors like subtracting denominators. Given the calibration data for similar BIDMAS items, this is likely to have a low proportion correct and a difficulty parameter near the middle of the range for this cohort.
