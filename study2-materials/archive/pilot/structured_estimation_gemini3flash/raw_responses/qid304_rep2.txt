The item assesses basic order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) by asking for the first step rather than the final result. The concept is foundational for UK secondary students, typically introduced in Key Stage 2 and reinforced in Year 7. Distractors A and B target common left-to-right processing errors and multiplication precedence over subtraction, while D addresses a fundamental misunderstanding of mathematical structure. Given the simplicity of the question format and the direct nature of the probe, the item is likely to have high clarity and a relatively high success rate compared to more complex algebraic manipulations.
