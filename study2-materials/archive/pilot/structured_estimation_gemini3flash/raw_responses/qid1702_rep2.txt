The item requires substituting a decimal value into a linear equation and solving for the unknown variable. The reasoning process involves identifying the relationship between $x$ and $y$, performing the multiplication $6 \times 0.5$, and then correctly applying inverse operations to isolate $x$, specifically handling the transition from $10x - 3 = 30$ to $10x = 33$. The distractors are designed to capture common errors in arithmetic and the misuse of inverse operations, which typically increases the item's difficulty for secondary school students.
