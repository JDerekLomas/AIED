The item assesses the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically the priority of multiplication over addition. The primary distractor (27) targets the common "left-to-right" misconception, which is a fundamental error at this level. Compared to the calibration items, this is a very standard, low-abstraction task with minimal procedural steps and low visual complexity. Given the high prevalence of the order-of-operations misconception among younger or lower-attaining secondary students, the item is expected to have a relatively low proportion correct despite its simplicity, resulting in a moderate IRT difficulty.
