The item assesses the fundamental understanding of inverse operations within the context of linear equations. It requires identifying that adding 7 is the inverse of subtracting 7 to isolate the variable. While the concept is foundational, the visual presentation using a "star" and a flow-diagram style adds a slight layer of abstraction compared to standard symbolic manipulation. The primary distractor is the use of the same operation (subtraction), which is a common misconception in early algebra. Based on the calibration items, this item is likely to have a relatively high success rate as it focuses on a singular, clear step of algebraic manipulation.
