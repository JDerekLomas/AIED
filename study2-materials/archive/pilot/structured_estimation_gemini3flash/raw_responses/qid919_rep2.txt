The item assesses the application of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically regarding squaring before multiplying, combined with decimal arithmetic. The primary misconception involves multiplying the base by the coefficient before squaring ($3 \times 0.3 = 0.9 \rightarrow 0.9^2 = 0.81$), which makes Distractor A highly plausible. Distractor C represents a linear calculation error ($3 \times 2 \times 0.3$), and Distractor D represents a decimal point error. Given the calibration examples, items involving order of operations misconceptions often show low classical difficulty (proportion correct) because the distractor aligns perfectly with a common intuitive but incorrect path. The item is moderately abstract due to the functional notation and table format but remains well within the standard UK curriculum for Key Stage 3 and 4.
