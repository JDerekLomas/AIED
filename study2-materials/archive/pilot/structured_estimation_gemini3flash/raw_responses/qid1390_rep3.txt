The item evaluates the application of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) combined with fractional arithmetic. The primary challenge involves resisting the "left-to-right" impulse (Option B) and correctly performing multiplication before addition. Based on the calibration items, particularly the decimal/fraction order of operations question, students frequently struggle with multi-step fraction operations. The procedural steps include multiplying fractions and finding a common denominator for addition, which increases cognitive load relative to basic arithmetic.
