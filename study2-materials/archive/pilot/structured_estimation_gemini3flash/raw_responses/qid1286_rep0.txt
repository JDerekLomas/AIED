The item assesses the ability to rearrange a formula involving a cube root and fractions, specifically the volume of a sphere formula. This requires multiple algebraic steps: multiplying by the denominator, dividing by the coefficient and pi, and finally taking the cube root. The presence of variables and radicals increases the abstraction level and cognitive load compared to simple linear equations. Distractors are well-designed to capture common errors in reciprocal operations and notation placement. Based on the provided calibration items, this problem is significantly more complex than basic linear solving but follows a standard curriculum path for higher-tier GCSE students.
