The item assesses basic algebraic expansion involving a negative sign outside a bracket. I am evaluating the cognitive demand of distributing a negative factor across two terms, specifically focusing on the common sign error when multiplying two negatives. Based on the calibration items, this represents a fundamental algebraic skill with moderate discrimination and a high prevalence of specific misconceptions.
