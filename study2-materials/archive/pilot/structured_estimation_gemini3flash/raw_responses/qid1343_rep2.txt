The item assesses the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) using four integers and two operations of equal priority level (division and multiplication) separated by addition. The cognitive demand is centered on resisting the left-to-right execution (which leads to 14) and correctly identifying that division and multiplication must be performed before addition. The distractors are well-mapped to common errors: 14 (left-to-right), 8 (correct), 3 (incorrect grouping or addition first), and 9 (incorrect order or calculation error). Based on the calibration examples, items involving order of operations often show relatively low classical difficulty because the misconception is persistent even among older students.
