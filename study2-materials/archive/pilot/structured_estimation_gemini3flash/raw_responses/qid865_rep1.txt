The item assesses the ability to link a visual representation of a quadratic graph to its algebraic equation by identifying roots and the orientation of the curve. It requires synthesizing knowledge of x-intercepts (roots at $x = -5$ and $x = 1$) with the "n-shape" characteristic of a negative quadratic coefficient. The distractors are highly plausible because they target common errors in sign manipulation when moving from roots to factors and the failure to recognize the negative $x^2$ term. The cognitive load is moderate as students must check both the roots and the expansion (or leading coefficient) simultaneously.
