The item assesses the expansion of a single bracket involving a negative multiplier and a negative constant term. I evaluated the complexity of the sign rules, noting that the primary hurdle is the double negative (-5 multiplied by -7). Comparing this to the calibration examples, it is more straightforward than solving inequalities but more prone to specific sign errors than simple linear equations. I estimated the difficulty parameters based on the likelihood of students correctly applying the distributive property while managing negative integers.
