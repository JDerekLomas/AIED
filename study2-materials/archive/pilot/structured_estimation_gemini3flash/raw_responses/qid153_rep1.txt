The item involves a standard two-step linear equation requiring students to apply inverse operations. The reasoning process evaluates the common pitfalls of sign errors and the confusion between division and its reciprocal (division by 12 vs division by 3). Based on the calibration items, this problem is relatively straightforward but targets a high-frequency misconception regarding inverse operations and negative signs, leading to a prediction of moderate difficulty and high discrimination.
