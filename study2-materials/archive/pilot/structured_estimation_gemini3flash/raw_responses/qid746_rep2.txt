The item assesses the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). I analyzed the sequential steps: first evaluating the parentheses (2+2=4), then division (12/4=3), and finally addition (4+3=7). I then evaluated the distractors: A (10) results from left-to-right calculation ignoring brackets, C (12) results from calculating brackets then addition before division, and D (4) results from ignoring the division. Given the strong presence of the left-to-right misconception in this age group, I estimated a moderate difficulty level and a high discrimination factor.
