The item assesses the expansion of a single bracket involving negative coefficients and constants. The primary cognitive challenge lies in the application of the distributive law combined with integer arithmetic rules, specifically the multiplication of two negative numbers. The distractors are highly plausible as they represent common errors in sign management (forgetting the negative on the first term or failing to flip the sign on the second). Comparison with calibration items suggests this is a foundational algebraic skill for the target age group, typically resulting in moderate difficulty but high discrimination.
