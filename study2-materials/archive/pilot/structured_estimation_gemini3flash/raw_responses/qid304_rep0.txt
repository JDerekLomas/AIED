The item assesses basic Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically identifying the priority of brackets over addition and multiplication. Given the target age range (11-16), this is a foundational concept typically mastered early, though the "left-to-right" misconception remains a common hurdle. The question is highly focused on a single procedural rule rather than a complex calculation, making the cognitive load low but the specific misconception highly targeted.
