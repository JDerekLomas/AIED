The item assesses the application of the quadratic formula, specifically the calculation of the $b^2$ term within the discriminant. The difficulty arises from squaring a negative coefficient ($-3$), which frequently triggers the misconception that $(-3)^2 = -9$. This is a moderately high-level topic for the 11-16 age range, typically appearing in the Higher Tier GCSE curriculum. The cognitive load is focused on a specific algebraic trap rather than a long sequence of steps, making the item a strong diagnostic tool for identifying sign errors in exponentiation.
