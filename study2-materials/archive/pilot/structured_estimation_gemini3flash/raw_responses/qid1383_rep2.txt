The item assesses substitution into a formula involving an even exponent and a negative base. The primary cognitive challenge lies in the application of the rule that a negative number raised to an even power results in a positive value, a frequent source of error in secondary mathematics. The distractors effectively target common misconceptions, including linear multiplication (k times 4) and the sign error (negative 81). Based on the calibration items, this question is relatively straightforward in structure but contains a high-frequency misconception trap, leading to a moderate difficulty profile and strong discrimination between students who understand exponent rules and those who do not.
