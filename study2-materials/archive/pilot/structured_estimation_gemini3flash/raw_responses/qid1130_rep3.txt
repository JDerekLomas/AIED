The item requires the student to integrate geometric knowledge (sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees) with algebraic manipulation (combining like terms and solving a linear equation). The procedural complexity involves summing (4x + 2x - 12 + 4x + 42 = 180), simplifying to 10x + 30 = 180, and solving for x. Distractors likely target common errors such as setting the sum to 90 or 360, or making sign errors during the inverse operation phase (the specified misconception). Given the multi-step nature and the combination of geometry and algebra, this item is likely to have a higher difficulty and moderate discrimination compared to simpler one-step equations.
