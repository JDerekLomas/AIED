The item involves solving a linear inequality with variables on both sides, which is a standard topic for UK Key Stage 3 and GCSE students. The process requires isolating the variable through inverse operations, specifically involving addition/subtraction and potentially handling negative coefficients or inequality direction. I am comparing this to the provided calibration examples, particularly the similar inequality $2n+3 \leq 3n-7$, noting that the target item involves slightly simpler arithmetic but a similar logical structure.
