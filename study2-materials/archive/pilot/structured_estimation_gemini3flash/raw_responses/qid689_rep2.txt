The item assesses the ability to solve a one-step equation where the variable is in the denominator, a common stumbling block for students transitioning from basic arithmetic to algebra. The reasoning involves recognizing that the reciprocal relationship or the inverse operation of division by $p$ requires multiplication, though many students will intuitively perform $10 \times 5$ or $10 \div 5$. Given the calibration examples, this specific structure often results in high error rates due to the "inverse operation" misconception, leading to a low classical difficulty. The distractors are highly plausible, particularly B ($10 \times 5$) and C ($10 \div 5$), which align with common procedural errors.
