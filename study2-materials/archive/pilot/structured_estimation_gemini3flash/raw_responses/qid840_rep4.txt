The item assesses the ability to identify valid intermediate steps in solving a linear equation involving fractions and multiplication. It specifically targets the inverse operations misconception by evaluating if students recognize that division by 8 (Katie) or division by 5 (Tom) is applied correctly to both sides. The format requiring the evaluation of two distinct claims increases the cognitive load compared to a standard calculation task. Given the calibration items, this problem is of moderate difficulty as it requires algebraic fluency and the ability to detect common errors in logic.
