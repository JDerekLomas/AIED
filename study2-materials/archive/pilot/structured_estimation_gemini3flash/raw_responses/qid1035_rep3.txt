The item assesses the distribution of a negative sign over a binomial, specifically focusing on the interaction between the negative multiplier and a negative term within the brackets. Reasoning involves applying the distributive law and integer multiplication rules, where the primary hurdle is the "-1 times -3p" operation. Comparison with calibration data suggests that sign errors in algebra are common and highly diagnostic of student proficiency at the KS3/KS4 level.
