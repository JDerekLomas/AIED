The item assesses the expansion of a squared binomial, a core topic in the UK Key Stage 3 and 4 curriculum. The primary challenge involves correctly applying the distributive law and managing negative signs when multiplying $(-3) \times (-3)$. I evaluated the cognitive demand by considering the common pitfalls: failing to recognize the middle term (Option B and C) and the sign error in the constant term (Option A). Based on the calibration items, this problem is more accessible than multi-step inequalities but contains highly seductive distractors that tap into fundamental misconceptions regarding negative number multiplication and the "freshman's dream" error.
