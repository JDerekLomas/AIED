The item assesses the expansion of a squared binomial, a core algebraic skill in the UK secondary curriculum. The reasoning follows these steps:
1. Identify that the expansion requires applying the distributive law or FOIL, involving four multiplication steps and the combination of like terms.
2. Evaluate the specific difficulty of squaring a negative term, which often leads to the common misconception that $(-4)^2 = -16$.
3. Compare the item to the provided calibration examples, noting that while the concept is foundational, the specific error targeted by distractors B and C is extremely prevalent among students aged 11-14.
4. Estimate the psychometric parameters based on the high plausibility of distractors and the moderate level of algebraic abstraction required.
