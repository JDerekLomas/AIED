The item involves a one-step linear equation with negative integers. I evaluated the structural similarity to the first calibration example, noting that the combination of negative constants and the requirement for inverse operations creates a specific cognitive hurdle. I assessed the distractors based on common arithmetic errors (adding instead of subtracting) and sign errors, then mapped these features to the provided IRT benchmarks to estimate difficulty and discrimination.
