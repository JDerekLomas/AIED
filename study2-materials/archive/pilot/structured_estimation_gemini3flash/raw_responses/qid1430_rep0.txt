The item assesses basic addition of fractions with common denominators, a fundamental skill typically mastered early in the secondary curriculum. The primary cognitive challenge lies in resisting the intuitive but incorrect "add across" strategy (adding both numerators and denominators). Given the simplicity of the values and the commonality of the misconception, this item is likely to have a high success rate compared to the calibration examples, though the specific distractor (3/14) is highly attractive to lower-ability students.
