The item involves rearranging a formula with two operations: multiplication and squaring. Students must apply inverse operations in the correct sequence, first dividing by $r$ and then taking the square root. The use of Greek notation ($\omega$) adds a layer of abstraction that typically increases perceived difficulty for UK secondary students compared to standard $x, y, z$ variables. The distractors are designed to capture common errors in order of operations or incorrect application of inverse functions.
