<chain_of_thought>
The item evaluates the application of order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) combined with directed number arithmetic (negative numbers). The complexity is moderate because students must evaluate four separate multi-step expressions to identify the correct answer, increasing the cognitive load and the likelihood of procedural errors. Common pitfalls include mishandling the subtraction of a negative product and squaring negative numbers. Based on the calibration examples involving similar misconceptions and multi-step arithmetic, this item is expected to have a moderate difficulty level and a high discrimination factor, as it effectively separates students who understand the rules of signs from those who do not.
