The item assesses the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically the priority of multiplication over addition and subtraction. The problem requires three distinct steps: identifying the multiplication (10 x 3 = 30), then performing subtraction and addition from left to right (8 - 7 = 1, then 1 + 30 = 31). The primary distractor (33) targets the common misconception of linear left-to-right processing (8 - 7 = 1, 1 + 10 = 11, 11 x 3 = 33). Compared to the calibration examples, this item is relatively straightforward and targets a foundational skill frequently encountered by the younger end of the 11-16 age range, suggesting a moderate difficulty level and high clarity.
