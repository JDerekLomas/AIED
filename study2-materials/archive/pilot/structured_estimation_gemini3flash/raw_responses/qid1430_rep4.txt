The item assesses basic fraction addition with common denominators, a foundational skill in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum. The primary misconception (adding both numerators and denominators) is highly prevalent among lower-attaining students, making Distractor D particularly attractive. Given the simplicity of the procedure and the clear notation, the cognitive load is very low, and the item is expected to have a high facility rate (classical difficulty) and a low IRT difficulty parameter compared to more complex algebraic items.
