The item assesses the application of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically regarding indices and multiplication within a quadratic function context. Students must evaluate $y = 3(0.3)^2$, which requires squaring $0.3$ to get $0.09$ before multiplying by $3$ to reach $0.27$. The primary misconception involves multiplying the coefficient by the base before squaring ($(3 \times 0.3)^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81$), which leads to distractor A. Other distractors like $1.8$ or $2.7$ result from errors in decimal placement or doubling instead of squaring. This is a common hurdle for Key Stage 3 and 4 students, making the item moderately difficult despite its simple appearance.
