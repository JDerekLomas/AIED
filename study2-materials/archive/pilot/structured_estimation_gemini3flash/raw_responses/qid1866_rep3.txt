The item assesses the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically the priority of multiplication over addition and subtraction. The problem requires two distinct steps: performing the multiplication (10 x 3 = 30) and then the addition/subtraction from left to right (8 - 7 + 30). The distractors are highly plausible, specifically targeting students who perform operations strictly left to right (8-7=1, 1+10=11, 11x3=33) or those who misapply addition priority over subtraction (8 - (7+30) = -29). Given the calibration examples, items involving arithmetic order of operations often show low classical difficulty because many students default to left-to-right processing.
