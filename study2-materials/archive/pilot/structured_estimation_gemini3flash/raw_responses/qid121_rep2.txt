The item assesses the ability to determine the gradient of a linear equation presented in the implicit form $ax + by = c$. This requires students to rearrange the equation into the explicit form $y = mx + c$, involving two distinct algebraic steps: subtracting the $x$-term and dividing by the coefficient of $y$. The identified misconception—using the same operation rather than the inverse—is particularly potent here during the division phase or the initial transposition. Distractors are highly plausible as they represent common errors such as identifying the coefficient of $x$ directly (A and B) or failing to account for the negative sign (C). This task is a standard part of the UK KS4 curriculum, representing a moderate level of abstraction and procedural demand.
