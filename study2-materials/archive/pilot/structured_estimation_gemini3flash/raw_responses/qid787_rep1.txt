The item assesses the ability to identify valid algebraic transformations in linear equations with variables on both sides. It specifically targets the common misconception of using the same operation rather than the inverse (e.g., subtracting 3 from -5 to get -8, or adding 5 to -3 to get -8, while failing to apply it to both sides correctly or using the wrong sign). The cognitive load is moderate as students must evaluate two separate claims. Given the calibration items, this item is likely to have a lower proportion correct because "Neither is correct" (Option D) is often a difficult choice for students who feel compelled to pick a person's method.
