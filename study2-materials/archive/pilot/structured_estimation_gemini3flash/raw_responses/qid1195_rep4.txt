The item involves two distinct arithmetic operations: squaring a number and multiplication. The primary cognitive challenge lies in the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically prioritizing the exponent over multiplication. Distractors target common errors: B (12) targets multiplying 2 and 3 then multiplying by 2 (or treating exponents as multiplication), C (36) targets performing multiplication before squaring, and D (11) targets a miscalculation of the exponent or addition. Based on the calibration examples, items involving order of operations errors tend to have moderate to high discrimination and a negative IRT difficulty as they are fundamental skills.
