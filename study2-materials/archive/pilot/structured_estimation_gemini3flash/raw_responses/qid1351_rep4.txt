The item involves a one-step linear equation with negative integers. I will analyze the cognitive requirements by comparing it to the first calibration example, which shares an identical structure and misconception focus. I will evaluate the difficulty by considering the likelihood of students incorrectly applying additive operations or making sign errors when transitioning from positive to negative numbers.
