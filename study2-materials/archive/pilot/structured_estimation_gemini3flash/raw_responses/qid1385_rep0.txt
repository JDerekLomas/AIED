The item assesses fraction addition using common denominators and grouping strategies. While the core concept is fundamental, the presence of multiple terms allows for both efficient grouping (1/3 + 2/3 and 1/4 + 3/4) and common errors like adding numerators and denominators. The difficulty is likely moderate to low for the 11-16 age range, as the numbers are small and the result is an integer, though the misconception "add across" is highly prevalent in this cohort.
