The item assesses the fundamental understanding of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically identifying the innermost parentheses as the starting point. My reasoning involves evaluating the complexity of the nested structure against the relative simplicity of the question's requirement—identifying the first step rather than calculating the final result. I have considered the high plausibility of the "left-to-right" distractor and the moderate cognitive load required to parse the nested brackets.
