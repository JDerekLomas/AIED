The item assesses the ability to substitute a negative integer into a quadratic function, specifically targeting the common misconception where students incorrectly evaluate (-1)^2 as -1 instead of 1. By comparing the cognitive demands of this task—substitution, squaring negatives, and basic arithmetic—against the provided calibration items, I can estimate the difficulty and discrimination parameters based on the typical prevalence of this algebraic error in the UK Key Stage 3 and 4 cohorts.
