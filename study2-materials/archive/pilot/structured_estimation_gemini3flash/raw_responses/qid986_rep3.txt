The item assesses multi-step linear equation solving by presenting incorrect intermediate steps based on common operational errors. Tom's error involves adding 6 to the right side without clearing the denominator, while Katie's error involves dividing the right side by 2 instead of multiplying. This "Who is correct?" format increases cognitive load compared to standard solving tasks, as students must evaluate two distinct logical paths. The target misconception—applying the same operation rather than the inverse—is highly prevalent in this age group, and the "Neither" option often creates uncertainty for students who are used to one person being correct.
