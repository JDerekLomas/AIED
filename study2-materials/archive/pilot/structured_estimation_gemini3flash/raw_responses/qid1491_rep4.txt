The item tests the exponentiation of a negative integer: \((-2)^4\). 
- **Mathematical Concept**: Understanding that an even exponent applied to a negative base results in a positive product. It requires knowledge of both the definition of exponents and the rules for multiplying negative numbers.
- **Distractors**: 
    - A) -16: Common error where the student applies the exponent to the magnitude but keeps the negative sign (often confused with \(-2^4\)).
    - B) -8: Arithmetic error multiplying base by exponent (\(-2 \times 4\)).
    - D) 8: Arithmetic error multiplying base by exponent but ignoring the sign (\(2 \times 4\)).
- **Calibration Comparison**: 
    - Compared to \(-5=p+10\) (difficulty 0.167), this is a more fundamental concept but highly prone to a specific, persistent misconception. 
    - The misconception "multiplying two negatives gives a negative" is extremely common in the 11-14 age range.
    - Many calculators and students struggle with the distinction between \((-2)^4\) and \(-2^4\).
- **Difficulty**: While the procedure is short, the "trap" is very effective. In UK secondary schools, a significant portion of students (even high-achievers) frequently select -16.
- **Discrimination**: This item typically discriminates well between students who understand the structural rules of algebra/arithmetic and those who follow surface-level patterns.
