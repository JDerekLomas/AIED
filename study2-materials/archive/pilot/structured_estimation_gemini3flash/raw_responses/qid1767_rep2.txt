The item assesses the fundamental understanding of inverse operations within the context of linear equations. Reasoning involves identifying that moving from "x - 7" to "x" requires neutralizing the subtraction, which is a core early-secondary algebraic skill. The cognitive demand is low as it focuses on a single conceptual step, though the visual representation of "Isaac's book" adds a slight layer of interpretation. The primary distractor is the inverse operation error, which is highly prevalent in this age group, and the simplicity of the item suggests a high discrimination value but a relatively low difficulty threshold compared to multi-step equations.
