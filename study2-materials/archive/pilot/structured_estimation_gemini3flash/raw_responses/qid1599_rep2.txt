The item assesses the fundamental transition from arithmetic division notation to algebraic fraction notation, specifically focusing on the treatment of expressions within parentheses. The cognitive demand is relatively low as it is a recognition task rather than a multi-step calculation, but it addresses a common stumbling block in early algebra regarding the grouping of terms. The distractors are well-constructed to target specific errors: Option C targets a failure to maintain the denominator as a single unit (order of operations error), while Option D targets a misunderstanding of the dividend/divisor relationship. Given the foundational nature of this topic in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum, it likely has a moderate difficulty level and high discrimination for students early in their algebraic development.
