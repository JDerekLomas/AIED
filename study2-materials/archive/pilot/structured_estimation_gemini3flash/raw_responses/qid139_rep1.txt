The item assesses integer multiplication within the context of algebraic expansion. The reasoning focuses on the specific cognitive hurdle of multiplying two negative constants, which is a common source of error for secondary students. I evaluated the simplicity of the single-step procedure against the high plausibility of distractors representing common additive or sign errors.
