The item assesses the ability to substitute a value into a linear equation and solve for the remaining variable. The cognitive demand is moderate, requiring students to understand the relationship between tabular data and algebraic expressions. The primary hurdle is the multi-step nature of isolating the variable after substitution, where common errors involving inverse operations typically occur.
