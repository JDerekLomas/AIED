The item assesses the expansion of a quadratic binomial $(m-5)(m-7)$. This requires applying the distributive property (FOIL method) and correctly handling directed numbers, specifically the multiplication of two negative constants. The misconception targeted is the sign error $(-5) \times (-7) = -35$. Based on the calibration items, algebraic manipulation of this type usually shows moderate difficulty for the 11-16 age range, with high discrimination as it clearly separates students who understand sign rules from those who do not. The distractors are highly plausible as they cover common errors in term summation ($-5-7$ vs $-5+7$) and sign multiplication.
