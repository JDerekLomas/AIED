The item assesses the ability to substitute a value into a linear sequence formula involving negative terms. The primary cognitive demand involves evaluating $1 - (3 \times 15)$, which requires both substitution and the application of order of operations (BIDMAS). Distractors target common errors: Option B accounts for an off-by-one error or miscalculating $1-45$ as $-46$; Option C targets the BIDMAS misconception $(1-3) \times 15$; and Option D represents a failure to include the constant term. Given the simplicity of the expression but the presence of negative numbers, the item is expected to have moderate difficulty and high discrimination.
