The item assesses the fundamental order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically identifying the priority of multiplication over addition and subtraction. The cognitive demand is low as it only asks for the first step rather than the final numerical result, which simplifies the procedural requirement. However, the left-to-right misconception (Option B) and the common "addition before subtraction" misconception (Option A) are highly prevalent in the 11-16 age range, making the distractors very plausible. Based on the calibration items, this conceptual hurdle typically results in low classical difficulty despite the simple appearance of the numbers.
