The item assesses the addition of fractions with unequal denominators, a core skill in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum. The reasoning involves identifying the need for a common denominator (20) and converting the numerators before adding, while distractors target the common misconception of adding numerators and denominators independently (4/9) or errors in numerator calculation (4/20, 7/20). Based on the calibration examples, this specific misconception is highly prevalent, leading to a lower proportion of correct answers despite the conceptual clarity of the task.
