The item assesses the expansion of a single bracket involving a negative multiplier, which is a fundamental skill in the UK Key Stage 3 and 4 curricula. The primary cognitive challenge lies in the application of the distributive law combined with integer arithmetic rules, specifically the multiplication of two negative numbers. Based on the provided calibration examples, items involving negative sign errors typically show moderate discrimination and difficulty, as they effectively separate students who have mastered signed number operations from those who apply rules inconsistently. The distractors are highly plausible, targeting common errors in sign management and term multiplication.
