The item assesses the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) using four basic integers and two operations (division and multiplication) separated by addition. The primary misconception involves executing operations linearly from left to right, leading to distractor C (22). Distractor A (3) results from performing the addition before the multiplication and division, while distractor D (12) likely involves a calculation error or partial execution. Based on the calibration examples for similar arithmetic priority tasks, this item typically has a low classical difficulty as students often default to linear processing, though the concepts are fundamental to the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum.
