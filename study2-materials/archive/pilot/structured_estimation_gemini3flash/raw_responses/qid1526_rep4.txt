The item assesses fraction addition with unequal denominators, a core skill for students aged 11-14. The reasoning identifies that students must find a common denominator (35) and adjust numerators (21 and 10), leading to the correct answer 31/35. The distractors are highly effective: option C targets the most common misconception (adding numerators and denominators), while options A and D target common subtraction or arithmetic errors. Given the prevalence of the "add across" misconception, this item is expected to have a relatively low proportion correct, similar to the calibration examples involving common procedural errors.
