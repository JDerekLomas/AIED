The item assesses the ability to solve linear equations with variables on both sides, a standard topic in the UK Key Stage 3 and 4 curriculum. I evaluated the complexity of the algebraic manipulation, specifically the two-step process of collecting like terms and isolating the variable. The distractors are strategically designed to capture common errors, such as incorrect inverse operations or sign errors, which increases the discrimination potential while maintaining a moderate difficulty level relative to the calibration items.
