The target item tests the ability to translate a word problem into an algebraic equation, specifically focusing on the correct use of brackets (order of operations). 

1. **Concept Complexity**: The core concept is algebraic representation and BIDMAS/order of operations. This is a fundamental skill in Key Stage 3 (ages 11-14).
2. **Procedural Steps**: The student must: (a) identify the variable, (b) apply the first operation (add 5), (c) apply the second operation to the *result* (multiply by 4), and (d) equate to 17.
3. **Distractor Plausibility**: 
   - Option A ($n+5 \times 4=17$) is a high-frequency error for students who translate word-for-word without considering operator precedence.
   - Option B ($4n+5=17$) is a common error where students apply the multiplication only to the variable.
   - Option C ($n^4+5=17$) targets confusion between multiplication and powers.
4. **Psychometric Comparison**: 
   - Compared to the first calibration example ($-5 = p + 10$), this is slightly more complex due to the linguistic-to-algebraic translation.
   - The misconception "Carries out operations from left to right" is very strong in this item (Distractor A).
   - In the calibration set, items with strong misconceptions often have low classical difficulty (proportion correct). The order of operations item in the calibration had a difficulty of 0.134. However, this item is slightly more intuitive as a "story."
5. **IRT Parameters**: 
   - The discrimination is likely to be high because this is a "classic" diagnostic question that clearly separates those who understand brackets from those who don't.
   - The guessing parameter is likely low (near 0) because the distractors are very "attractive" based on specific misconceptions, rather than being random noise.
