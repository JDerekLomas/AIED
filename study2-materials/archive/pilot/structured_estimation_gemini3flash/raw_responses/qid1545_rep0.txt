The item assesses the understanding of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) by comparing a standard expression to one containing parentheses. To solve it, students must evaluate $8 + (12 \div 4) = 11$ and $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 5$, then identify that $11 > 5$. The primary misconception involves left-to-right processing, which leads to evaluating the first expression as $(8 + 12) \div 4 = 5$, resulting in an "equal" response. Based on the calibration examples where order of operations items show low classical difficulty (high failure rates) but moderate IRT parameters, this item is expected to be challenging for the lower end of the 11-16 age range.
