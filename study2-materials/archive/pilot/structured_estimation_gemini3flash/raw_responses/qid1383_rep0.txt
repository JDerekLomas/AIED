The item assesses the application of index notation with negative bases, specifically requiring the student to evaluate $(-3)^4$. This involves two primary components: numerical calculation ($3^4 = 81$) and the application of sign rules (an even exponent results in a positive product). The distractors are highly effective, targeting common errors such as multiplying the base by the exponent ($3 \times 4 = 12$) and the persistent misconception that a negative base always results in a negative outcome. Given the high prevalence of the sign-rule misconception among secondary students, I expect a moderate difficulty level and strong discrimination between those who understand the properties of powers and those who apply rules superficially.
