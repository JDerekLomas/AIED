The item assesses the addition of fractions with unequal denominators, a foundational skill in the UK secondary curriculum. The reasoning follows that students must identify the need for a common denominator (20), convert the numerators (12 and 5), and sum them, while avoiding the highly common misconception of adding numerators and denominators directly. The visual representation as a "number pyramid" adds a slight layer of interpretation but remains highly accessible to the target age group.
