The item assesses the ability to rearrange a three-variable formula involving multiplication/division and a square power. The process requires two distinct inverse operations: multiplying by 'r' and taking the square root. Compared to the calibration items, this involves a higher level of algebraic abstraction but a standard procedural flow. The distractors are well-constructed to capture common errors, such as squaring instead of square rooting or incorrect application of the inverse to the wrong variable.
