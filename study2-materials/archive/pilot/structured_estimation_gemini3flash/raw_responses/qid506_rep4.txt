The item assesses the ability to solve a one-step linear equation involving fractions, specifically requiring the division of a unit fraction by an integer. The reasoning considers that students often struggle with the inverse operation when fractions are involved, frequently choosing to multiply the denominator by the coefficient (correct) or mistakenly multiplying the numerator (incorrect) or performing the inverse of the fraction itself. Based on the calibration examples, items involving fractions and one-step algebraic manipulations typically show moderate difficulty and high discrimination.
