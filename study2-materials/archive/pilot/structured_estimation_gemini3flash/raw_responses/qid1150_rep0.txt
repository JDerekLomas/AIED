The item assesses the ability to rearrange a formula involving a square and a fraction, requiring two distinct inverse operations: multiplication and square rooting. The complexity is moderate for the target age group (11-16), as it involves literal symbols rather than numerical values, increasing the level of abstraction. The distractors are well-designed to capture common errors, such as squaring instead of rooting or applying operations to the wrong side of the equation. Based on the provided calibration items, this algebraic manipulation task typically shows a moderate difficulty level and high discrimination, as students who understand inverse operations perform significantly better than those who do not.
