The item assesses the expansion of a single bracket involving a negative sign and a binomial with a negative coefficient. I have analyzed the complexity of distributing the negative sign across both terms, noting that the primary cognitive hurdle is the "negative times a negative" rule. By comparing this to the provided calibration items, I have determined that it is a fundamental algebraic skill with highly plausible distractors for students who struggle with sign consistency.
