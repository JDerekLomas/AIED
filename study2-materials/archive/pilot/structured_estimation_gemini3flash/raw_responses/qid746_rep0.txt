The item assesses the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically the priority of brackets over division and addition. I evaluated the procedural steps (addition within brackets, division, final addition) and the strength of the identified misconception (left-to-right processing), which leads to distractor A. By comparing this to the provided calibration items, particularly the order of operations example, I determined its likely difficulty and discrimination parameters.
