The item evaluates algebraic manipulation and inverse operations. I analyzed the complexity of the fractional equation and the specific errors made by the characters: Tom applies the inverse operation to only one side of the equation incorrectly (+6 to 10 but not removing -6), while Katie uses the same operation (division by 2) rather than the inverse (multiplication). These are high-frequency misconceptions in the 11-16 UK curriculum. I compared this to the provided calibration items, noting that "Neither is correct" often increases difficulty as students are biased toward finding a "correct" person.
