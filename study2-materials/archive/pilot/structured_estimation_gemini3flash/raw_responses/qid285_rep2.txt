The item involves rearranging a formula with two operations: multiplication and squaring. The reasoning process evaluates the complexity of isolating a variable that is both a coefficient and a base of an exponent, which typically requires a division step followed by a square root. Based on the provided calibration examples, this type of algebraic manipulation for students aged 11-16 is moderately difficult, as it requires understanding inverse operations in the correct order. The distractors are designed to capture common errors, such as applying the square root to only one side or failing to invert the multiplication correctly.
