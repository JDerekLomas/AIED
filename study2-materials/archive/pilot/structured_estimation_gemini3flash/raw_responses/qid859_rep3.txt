The item involves solving a linear equation with variables on both sides, requiring multiple steps: collecting like terms and isolating the variable. The distractors are strategically designed to capture common errors, such as using the same operation instead of the inverse (e.g., adding 3 to both sides resulting in 0, or subtracting 6d from 12d and then mismanaging the constants). Compared to the calibration items, this represents a moderate difficulty level within the UK secondary curriculum, as it requires balancing two distinct algebraic operations.
