The item assesses the application of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) combined with fraction arithmetic. Students must recognize that multiplication takes precedence over subtraction, necessitating a common denominator calculation for the final step. The distractors are strategically designed to capture common errors: Option D represents a left-to-right calculation error (3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4; 2/4 * 1/5 = 2/20 = 1/10 - wait, actually 2/20 = 1/10 is B, while D is 5/10), Option B represents the primary misconception of left-to-right processing, and Option A represents a common error in fraction subtraction/multiplication logic. Based on the calibration examples, items involving order of operations misconceptions often show low classical difficulty (proportion correct) because the intuitive left-to-right approach is very tempting, leading to a higher IRT difficulty.
