The item assesses the probability of independent events, specifically the intersection of two outcomes. The calculation requires identifying individual probabilities (1/4 and 1/5) and applying the multiplication rule for independent events. The distractors target common misconceptions: adding the denominators (A), adding the numerators and denominators (C), and potentially doubling the result (D). Based on the calibration items, this type of probability question typically falls in the middle range of difficulty for the 11-16 age group, as students often confuse additive and multiplicative rules in probability contexts.
