The item requires substituting a non-integer value ($y=0.5$) into a linear equation ($10x - 6y = 30$) and solving for $x$. This involves multiple steps: multiplication of a decimal, transposition of terms (requiring inverse operations), and division by a coefficient. The "inverse operation" misconception is specifically targeted by distractors that likely arise from incorrect signs during the rearrangement of $10x - 3 = 30$. The tabular presentation adds a slight layer of abstraction, though the task remains a standard algebraic manipulation common in the UK Key Stage 3 and 4 curricula.
