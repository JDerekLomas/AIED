The item assesses the ability to identify a counter-example for a quadratic expression involving fractions and decimals. I evaluated the complexity of evaluating each option, noting that students must correctly square a value less than 1, multiply by 2, and compare the result to 1. The primary misconception involves the behavior of squares and negatives, particularly the belief that squaring a negative might result in a negative or that small positive fractions/decimals behave like integers. Based on the calibration items, this requires higher cognitive load and abstraction than simple linear equations, leading to a predicted difficulty that reflects the nuance of identifying a specific case where the expression becomes negative.
