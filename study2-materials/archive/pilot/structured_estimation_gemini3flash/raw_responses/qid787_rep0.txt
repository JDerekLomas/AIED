The item assesses the ability to identify valid algebraic transformations in linear equations with variables on both sides. It specifically targets the common misconception of using the same operation rather than the inverse (e.g., subtracting 3 from -5 to get -8, or adding 5 to -3 to get -8, but placing the result on the incorrect side). The structure of the question, involving two characters' arguments, increases cognitive load and abstraction compared to a standard "solve for x" prompt. Given the calibration examples, this conceptual check on inverse operations typically results in a moderate difficulty level and high discrimination, as students must understand the balance of an equation rather than just following a memorized procedure.
