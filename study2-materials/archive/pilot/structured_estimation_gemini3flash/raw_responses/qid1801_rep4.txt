The item involves solving a double inequality, which requires applying inverse operations simultaneously to both sides of the expression. The reasoning identifies that students must subtract 1 from all parts and then divide by 2, while the distractors capture common errors such as adding 1 instead of subtracting (Option B vs D) or applying operations incorrectly to the bounds. The complexity is moderate for the 11-16 age range, sitting above basic linear equations but below complex quadratics.
