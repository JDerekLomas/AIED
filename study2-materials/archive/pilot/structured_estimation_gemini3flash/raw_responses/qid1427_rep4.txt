The item assesses the fundamental algebraic concept of inverse operations within the context of solving linear equations. It requires recognizing that to isolate a variable, one must undo the addition of a constant by subtracting that same constant. The cognitive demand is relatively low as it focuses on a single-step conceptual identification rather than a multi-step calculation. The presence of the inverse operation's counterpart (addition) as a distractor directly targets the common misconception of repeating the operation instead of inverting it, which is a well-documented error in early algebra. Based on the calibration items, this item is likely to have a higher proportion of correct answers than the more complex equations, but will still show significant discrimination between students who grasp the balancing method and those who do not.
