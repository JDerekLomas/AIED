The item assesses the ability to solve a one-step linear equation involving fractions, specifically requiring division by an integer. The reasoning considers the cognitive demand of fractional arithmetic combined with algebraic manipulation, noting that the common misconception of multiplying rather than dividing (leading to A) or simple calculation errors (leading to D or C) provides high distractor plausibility. Based on the calibration examples, items involving fractions and inverse operations typically exhibit moderate difficulty and high discrimination among secondary students.
