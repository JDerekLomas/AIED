The item assesses basic addition of mixed numbers with common denominators, a fundamental skill in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum. The reasoning involves evaluating the simplicity of the arithmetic against the commonality of the misconception where students add denominators. The distractors are highly plausible, particularly the one targeting the addition of denominators and the one presenting the answer as an improper fraction despite the instruction for a mixed number.
