The item assesses the expansion of a quadratic expression with two negative constants. The reasoning evaluates the complexity of the FOIL method (First, Outside, Inside, Last) against common sign errors. Students must correctly combine $-7m$ and $-5m$ to get $-12m$ and multiply $-5$ by $-7$ to get $+35$. Distractors A and D target common errors in addition and sign rules for multiplication, while C targets the sign error in the linear term. Given the prevalence of the negative multiplication misconception, the item is likely to have a moderate difficulty level and high discrimination among students in the 11-16 age range.
