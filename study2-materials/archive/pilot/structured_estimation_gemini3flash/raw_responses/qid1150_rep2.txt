The item assesses the ability to rearrange a three-variable formula involving multiplication and a square root. The problem requires two distinct inverse operations: multiplying by 'r' and then taking the square root of the product. While the algebraic structure is fundamental to the UK secondary curriculum, the transition from numerical equations to literal equations (rearranging formulas) increases abstraction. Distractors target common errors such as squaring instead of square-rooting or failing to apply the inverse to both variables. Based on the provided calibration items, this task is moderately difficult but conceptually straightforward for the target age group.
