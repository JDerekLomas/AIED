The item tests substitution into an algebraic expression involving negative numbers.
The expression is $10 - 2d$ with $d = -2$.
Calculation: $10 - 2(-2) = 10 - (-4) = 10 + 4 = 14$.

Distractor Analysis:
- Option A (-12): Likely from $10 - 22$ (treating $2d$ as $2$ followed by $-2$ as digits) or some combination of $10 - 2 - 20$.
- Option B (6): $10 + 2(-2) \rightarrow 10 - 4 = 6$. This assumes the student treats the expression as $10 + 2d$ or makes a sign error where one negative survives.
- Option D (32): Likely $10 - 2 \times (-2)$ but misinterpreted as $10 - 2 = 8$, then $8 \times 4$? Or more likely, a concatenation error or calculation slip.

The core misconception identified is "multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer". If a student thinks $-2 \times -2 = -4$, they get $10 - 4 = 6$ (Option B). If they think $10 - 2(-2)$ involves a "triple negative" effect or simply subtracts the product of $2 \times 2$, they might arrive at different values.

Comparing to calibration items:
- The item is simpler than the quadratic factorization or the inequality.
- It is similar in complexity to $-5 = p + 10$ but involves two operations (multiplication then subtraction).
- Negative number arithmetic is a notorious "gatekeeper" concept for UK students (KS3/KS4).
- The classical difficulty for negative number substitution is usually around 0.4 - 0.5.

The distractors are quite plausible. Option B is a very common error (sign error in multiplication). Option A might attract those who struggle with the order of operations or basic directed number subtraction.
