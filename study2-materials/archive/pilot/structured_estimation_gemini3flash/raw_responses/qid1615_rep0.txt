The item assesses the ability to translate a multi-step verbal word problem into a formal algebraic equation, specifically testing the understanding of order of operations and grouping. The core challenge lies in recognizing that "the result" implies the subtraction must occur before the division, necessitating a fraction bar or parentheses. Distractors B and D are highly plausible as they mirror the sequential reading of the text without accounting for BODMAS/BIDMAS rules, while C represents a confusion of inverse operations. Based on the calibration items, this type of algebraic translation typically sits at a moderate difficulty level for the 11-16 age range, with a strong pull toward the linear-reading misconception.
