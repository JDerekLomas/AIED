The item tests the evaluation of a negative integer raised to an even power: \((-2)^4\). 
- **Mathematical concepts**: Negative numbers, exponents (indices), and the rule that a negative number raised to an even power results in a positive product.
- **Procedural steps**: Either calculating \((-2) \times (-2) \times (-2) \times (-2)\) or recognizing \(2^4 = 16\) and determining the sign.
- **Distractors**: 
    - A) \(-16\): The most common error, where students apply the exponent to the magnitude but retain the negative sign (often confused with \(-2^4\) without parentheses).
    - B) \(-8\): Misinterpreting exponentiation as multiplication (\(-2 \times 4\)).
    - D) \(8\): Misinterpreting exponentiation as multiplication but ignoring the sign (\(2 \times 4\)).
- **Psychometric Comparison**: Looking at the calibration items, items involving negative number rules (like the factorising question) often have moderate difficulty. The misconception "multiplying two negatives gives a negative" is extremely persistent. In UK schools, indices with negative bases are typically introduced in Key Stage 3 (ages 12-14). 
- **Difficulty Estimation**: The classical difficulty (proportion correct) is likely to be lower than one might expect because many students instinctively see a negative sign and an exponent and assume the result remains negative. The "calculator-style" notation \((-2)^4\) is very standard, but the confusion between \((-2)^4\) and \(-2^4\) is a high-level distractor.
- **Discrimination**: This item usually discriminates well between students who understand the structural rules of arithmetic and those who follow surface-level patterns.
