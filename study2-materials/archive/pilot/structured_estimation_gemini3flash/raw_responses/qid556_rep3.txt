The item assesses the fundamental algebraic concept of inverse operations, specifically isolating a variable by dividing a coefficient. The visual presentation using a "star" to represent an operation is a common pedagogical tool in UK secondary schools (Key Stage 3) to scaffold the concept of balancing equations. The primary misconception involves students confusing additive and multiplicative inverses (choosing -9 instead of /9). Based on the calibration items, this fundamental algebraic step typically shows high discrimination and a difficulty level slightly below the mean for the target age group, as it tests a core foundational skill rather than a multi-step procedure.
