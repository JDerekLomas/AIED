The item assesses the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically the priority of multiplication over addition and subtraction. The problem requires three distinct operations: multiplication, subtraction, and addition. The most common error path is a linear left-to-right calculation $(8-7=1; 1+10=11; 11 \times 3=33)$, which is represented by Distractor D. Another common error involves performing addition before subtraction $(7+30=37; 8-37=-29)$, represented by Distractor C. Based on the calibration examples, items involving order of operations often show low classical difficulty because the misconception is highly prevalent among lower-attaining students in this age range.
