The item assesses the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) using four integers and three operations (division, addition, multiplication). The primary cognitive demand lies in prioritizing division and multiplication over addition, while the distractors are specifically engineered to capture students who calculate strictly from left to right or group operations incorrectly. Based on the provided calibration examples, similar arithmetic hierarchy items show low classical difficulty due to the prevalence of the "left-to-right" misconception.
