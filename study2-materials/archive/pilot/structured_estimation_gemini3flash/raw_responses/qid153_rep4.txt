<chain_of_thought>
The item assesses the ability to solve a basic linear equation involving two steps: adding a constant to both sides and dividing by a coefficient. The complexity is low, involving standard algebraic manipulation. Distractors target common errors such as sign errors (A and C) and the inversion of the division operation (B). Based on the calibration items, solving simple equations often yields low classical difficulty scores because students frequently apply operations incorrectly or struggle with fractional results. This item is slightly simpler than the inequality example provided, suggesting a difficulty parameter closer to the middle of the provided range.
