The item assesses the ability to identify errors in a multi-step algebraic solution, specifically focusing on the application of inverse operations. Step 1 correctly applies multiplication to clear the denominator, while Step 2 incorrectly uses addition instead of subtraction to isolate the variable. Based on the provided calibration items, this specific misconception (using the same operation instead of the inverse) is highly prevalent and often leads to low success rates. The format of evaluating someone else's steps adds a layer of metacognitive demand, though the algebra itself is foundational for the target age group.
