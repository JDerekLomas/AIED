The item requires students to integrate geometric knowledge (angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees) with algebraic manipulation (combining like terms and solving a linear equation). The cognitive load is moderate as it involves setting up an equation from a visual representation. The distractors are likely derived from common errors such as setting the sum to 90 or 360 degrees, or failing to apply inverse operations correctly when isolating x. Based on the calibration items, multi-step algebraic problems for this age group typically show moderate difficulty and high discrimination.
