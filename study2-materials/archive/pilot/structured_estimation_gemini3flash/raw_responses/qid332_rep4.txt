The item assesses two-step linear equation solving, specifically the order of operations and the application of inverse operations to both sides. Tom correctly identifies that adding 5 to both sides is a valid first step, whereas Katie incorrectly multiplies only one term on the left by 3, a common error when students fail to apply the operation to the entire side of the equation. Based on the calibration items, this type of algebraic manipulation typically yields moderate difficulty and high discrimination among secondary students.
