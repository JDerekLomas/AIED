The item assesses two-step linear equation solving, specifically the order of operations and the distributive property when multiplying across terms. Tom correctly applies the inverse operation of addition to isolate the fractional term. Katie fails to multiply the constant term (-5) when attempting to clear the denominator, a very common error among students in this age group. The item's format, involving two characters' statements, increases cognitive load and requires students to evaluate two different logical paths, making it more difficult than a standard "solve for x" question.
