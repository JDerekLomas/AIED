The item assesses integer multiplication within the context of algebraic expansion, specifically focusing on the product of two negative constants. The reasoning involves identifying the sign rule (negative times negative equals positive) and the arithmetic operation (4 times 3), while recognizing that common errors involve either adding the terms or incorrectly assigning a negative sign to the product.
