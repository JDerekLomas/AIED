The item evaluates the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) using basic arithmetic. The reasoning focuses on the sequential nature of the calculation versus the hierarchical priority of division over addition. High distractor plausibility is expected because the left-to-right calculation (3+6=9, 9/2=4.5, 4.5+1=5.5) or other misorderings lead directly to the provided options. Given the low complexity but high misconception prevalence in this age group, the item is expected to have moderate difficulty and high discrimination.
