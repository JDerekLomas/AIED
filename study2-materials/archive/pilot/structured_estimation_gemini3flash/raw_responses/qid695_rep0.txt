The item assesses the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) using four integers and three operations (division, addition, multiplication). The primary misconception involves performing operations linearly from left to right, which leads directly to distractor C. The presence of two operations of higher priority than addition (division and multiplication) increases the procedural steps and cognitive load compared to simpler two-operator problems. Based on the calibration items, particularly the one involving decimals and fractions, this item is slightly more accessible due to the use of whole numbers, but the linear-processing trap remains a significant factor in student error rates for this age group.
