The item assesses basic order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) involving addition and multiplication. The primary hurdle is the common misconception of performing operations from left to right (5+4=9, 9x3=27), which is explicitly targeted by Distractor A. The mathematical concepts are foundational for the 11-16 age range, representing a low abstraction level and minimal procedural steps. Given its status as a fundamental "gatekeeper" concept, the item typically shows high discrimination between students who have mastered arithmetic hierarchy and those who have not.
