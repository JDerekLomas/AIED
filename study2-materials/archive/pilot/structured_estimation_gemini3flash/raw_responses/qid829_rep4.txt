The item asks for the expansion of $(m-3)(m-2)$. This is a standard quadratic expansion problem involving two negative constants. 

1. **Step-by-step solution**:
   - $m \times m = m^2$
   - $m \times (-2) = -2m$
   - $-3 \times m = -3m$
   - $-3 \times (-2) = +6$
   - Simplify: $m^2 - 5m + 6$

2. **Analysis of Distractors**:
   - Option B ($m^2-m-6$): Error in adding linear terms ($-3 + 2$ instead of $-3 - 2$) and sign error in the constant.
   - Option C ($m^2+5m+6$): Sign error in linear terms (treating both as positive).
   - Option D ($m^2-5m-6$): The specific misconception mentioned: multiplying two negatives to get a negative $(-3 \times -2 = -6)$.

3. **Comparison with Calibration Items**:
   - The "Tom and Katie" factorising item (Item 4) is very similar. It had a classical difficulty of 0.473 and $b = 0.404$. That item involved identifying the correct factorization, whereas this is the forward process (expanding). Expanding is generally slightly easier than factorising for students.
   - However, the negative signs in both terms of $(m-3)(m-2)$ are a notorious "trap" for students at the foundation level.
   - The IRT discrimination (a) for these algebraic expansion/factorisation items tends to be high (around 1.3 - 1.5) because they clearly separate those who know the rules of directed numbers from those who don't.

4. **Psychometric Estimates**:
   - Classical difficulty: Expanding brackets is a core skill. I expect about 45-50% of students to get this right, as the negative constant multiplication is a very common pitfall.
   - IRT difficulty: Based on calibration item 4 ($b=0.404$), and noting this is expansion rather than factorisation, the difficulty should be slightly lower or similar. I'll place it near 0.35.
   - Discrimination: Usually high for algebra, likely around 1.4.
   - Guessing: Standard 4-choice MCQ often sees $c$ around 0.15-0.20 for this age group.
