The item involves a standard two-step linear equation requiring an addition and a division. The primary difficulty lies in the division step resulting in a fraction less than one, which often triggers "division by smaller number" or inverse operation misconceptions. Distractors target sign errors and the common error of dividing the coefficient by the constant (12/3 instead of 3/12). Based on the calibration items, this is a fundamental algebraic skill with high clarity but moderate misconception strength.
