The item assesses the addition of mixed numbers with different denominators, a core skill in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum. The process requires several sequential steps: finding a common denominator (20), converting the fractional parts, adding the whole numbers and fractions separately (or converting to improper fractions), and ensuring the final result is in the requested mixed number format. Distractor D directly targets the common "add across" misconception (adding numerators and denominators), while A and C explore improper fraction conversions and denominator errors. The cognitive load is moderate due to the multiple steps involved, but the question is highly clear and standard in its presentation.
