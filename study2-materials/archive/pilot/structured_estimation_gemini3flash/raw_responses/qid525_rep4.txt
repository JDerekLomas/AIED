The item assesses addition of mixed numbers with unequal denominators, a core skill in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum. The process involves identifying a common denominator (20), converting the fractional parts, and handling the whole numbers. The distractors are well-designed: Option D targets the common "add across" misconception (adding numerators and denominators), while Options A and C provide the result as improper fractions or with incorrect denominators, testing the student's ability to follow the specific instruction to provide a mixed number. The cognitive load is moderate due to the multi-step nature of the conversion and addition.
