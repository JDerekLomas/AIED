The item assesses the probability of independent events, requiring the multiplication of two simple probabilities (1/4 and 1/5). The distractors are highly effective because they target common additive misconceptions (1/4 + 1/5 = 2/9 or 2/20) and simple counting errors (1/9). While the math is foundational for the UK secondary curriculum, the specific misconception of adding numerators and denominators is a persistent error that significantly lowers the proportion of correct responses.
