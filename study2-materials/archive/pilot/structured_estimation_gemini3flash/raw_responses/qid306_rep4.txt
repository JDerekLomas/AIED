The item assesses order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically comparing the left-to-right convention for addition/subtraction with the priority of multiplication over addition. The cognitive demand is low as it focuses on identifying the first step rather than the final result, though the common misconception of always working left-to-right (Problem Q) or incorrectly prioritizing addition over subtraction (Problem P) makes the distractors highly attractive. Based on the calibration items, this fundamental concept often has moderate difficulty but high discrimination among secondary students.
