The item involves rearranging a formula with two operations: multiplication and squaring. The reasoning identifies that students must correctly apply inverse operations in the reverse order of operations (division then square root). Comparing this to the calibration examples, the item is more abstract than basic linear equations but uses a standard formulaic structure familiar to students in the 14-16 age range. The distractors target common algebraic errors, such as incorrect inverse operations and poor spatial manipulation of variables.
