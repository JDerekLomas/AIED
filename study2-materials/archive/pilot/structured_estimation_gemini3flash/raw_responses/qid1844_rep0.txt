The item assesses the ability to find the y-intercept of a quadratic function in factored form, specifically testing the expansion of the constant term and integer multiplication. The primary hurdle involves recognizing that the y-intercept occurs when x=0 and correctly multiplying (-8) by (-6). Distractors target common errors such as adding the constants (A), confusing intercepts with roots (B), or failing to apply the rules for multiplying negative numbers (D). Based on the calibration items, this requires moderate conceptual understanding of coordinate geometry and algebraic expansion.
