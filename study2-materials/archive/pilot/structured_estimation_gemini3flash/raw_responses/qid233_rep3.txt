The item assesses the conversion of arithmetic operations into formal algebraic notation, specifically focusing on the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and the use of the vinculum for division. Reasoning involves identifying that multiplication ($ab$) and addition ($+3$) must occur within the denominator due to the original parentheses, while evaluating common errors such as partial division or incorrect grouping. The difficulty is likely moderate as it combines order of operations with algebraic conventions, which is a foundational but often misunderstood topic in early secondary school.
