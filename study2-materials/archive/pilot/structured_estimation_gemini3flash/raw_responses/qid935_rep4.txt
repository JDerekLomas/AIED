The item involves basic substitution and solving a linear equation, which is a fundamental skill for UK secondary students. The complexity is low as it isolates a single step of a larger process (simultaneous equations). The distractors are strategically chosen to capture common arithmetic errors and the specified misconception regarding inverse operations. Given the performance of similar items in the calibration set, this item is likely to have a moderate difficulty level and high discrimination due to the clear presence of a common misconception.
