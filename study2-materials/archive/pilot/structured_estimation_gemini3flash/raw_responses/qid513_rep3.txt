The item assesses the ability to identify errors in a multi-step linear equation solution. 
The equation is $15 = 2p - 4$.
Step 1: $11 = 2p$. Here, the student subtracted 4 from 15 instead of adding 4 (inverse operation error).
Step 2: $22 = p$. Here, the student multiplied 11 by 2 instead of dividing by 2 (inverse operation error).
Both steps are incorrect, making D the correct answer.

Comparing this to the calibration examples:
- The first example ($-5=p+10$) had a classical difficulty of 0.167. It was a one-step equation.
- The target item is more complex because it requires evaluating another person's work (meta-cognition) across two steps.
- The misconception "uses the same operation rather than the inverse" is explicitly tested twice here.
- Step 1 is a very common error (subtracting when you should add). 
- Step 2 is also common (multiplying when you should divide).
- Many students will see $15-4=11$ and think Step 1 is correct. Others might see $11 \times 2 = 22$ and think Step 2 is correct. 
- Option A (Only step 1) will be a very strong distractor for those who think $15-4=11$ is the correct first move.
- Option C (Both correct) will attract students who consistently use the same operation instead of the inverse.
- Because both steps are wrong, the "Double Negative" logic of the question (identifying that both are incorrect) usually makes the item harder than a standard "solve this" question.

The calibration data shows that items involving inverse operation misconceptions are often quite difficult (low proportion correct). Given the two-step nature and the "which steps are correct" format, I expect a low classical difficulty.
