The item assesses the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically regarding the priority of division over subtraction and the non-commutative nature of subtraction. I have evaluated the complexity of decimal notation combined with algebraic-style identity notation and compared it to the calibration examples involving similar arithmetic operations and misconceptions. My reasoning focuses on the high prevalence of the "left-to-right" misconception and the common error where students assume subtraction can be swapped like addition, which informs the difficulty and discrimination estimates.
