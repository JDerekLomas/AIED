The item assesses the understanding of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically focusing on nested parentheses. I am evaluating the cognitive demand of identifying the starting operation versus performing the full calculation, noting that the presence of multiple decimals and brackets increases visual complexity. I am comparing this to the provided calibration items where order of operations misconceptions often lead to low classical difficulty scores.
