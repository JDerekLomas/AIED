The item assesses basic fraction addition with unequal denominators, a foundational skill in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum. The primary cognitive demand involves finding a common denominator, which is relatively straightforward here as one denominator is a multiple of the other. The distractors are highly effective, particularly Option B (adding across), which targets a pervasive and persistent misconception. Given the prevalence of this specific error among students aged 11-14, the item is expected to have a moderate difficulty level despite its procedural simplicity.
