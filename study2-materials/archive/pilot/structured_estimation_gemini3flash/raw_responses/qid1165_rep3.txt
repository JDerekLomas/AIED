The item assesses a fundamental rule of arithmetic within an algebraic context: the multiplication of two negative integers. The visual presentation uses arrows to isolate a specific step of the FOIL/expansion process, which reduces the procedural cognitive load compared to a full expansion but isolates the specific misconception regarding negative signs. While the concept is foundational for the 11-16 curriculum, the common error of "negative times negative equals negative" remains a persistent distractor for students at this level, making the incorrect options highly plausible.
