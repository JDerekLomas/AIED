The item assesses order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically involving fractions. To solve it correctly, students must prioritize multiplication over addition, requiring them to calculate 1/2 * 1/3 = 1/6 and then find a common denominator to compute 1/3 + 1/6 = 2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2. The primary misconception (left-to-right processing) leads to 1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6, followed by 5/6 * 1/3 = 5/18, which is provided as option B. Other distractors likely target errors in fraction addition (adding numerators and denominators) or multiplication. Given the calibration examples, items involving order of operations and fractions typically show low classical difficulty (proportion correct) because multiple failure points exist: the conceptual hierarchy of operations and the procedural execution of fraction arithmetic.
