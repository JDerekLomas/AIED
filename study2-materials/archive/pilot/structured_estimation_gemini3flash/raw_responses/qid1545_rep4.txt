The item assesses the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) by comparing two expressions that use the same numbers but different grouping structures. The calculation is relatively straightforward, but the misconception of left-to-right processing is a common pitfall at this level, making the distractor representing equality particularly attractive. Based on the provided calibration items, this type of conceptual comparison typically shows moderate difficulty and high discrimination among lower secondary students.
