The item assesses the probability of independent events (combined events). The mathematical steps involve identifying the individual probabilities (1/4 and 1/5) and applying the multiplication rule for independent events. The distractors are strategically designed to capture common errors: adding the denominators (1/9), adding the probabilities incorrectly (2/9), or incorrectly combining numerators while multiplying denominators (2/20). Based on the calibration items, the misconception of adding fractions by adding numerators and denominators is a strong distractor for this age group, leading to a moderate difficulty level.
