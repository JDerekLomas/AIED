The item tests the ability to translate a word problem into a formal algebraic equation, specifically focusing on the use of brackets to maintain the order of operations. 

- **Concept Complexity**: The core concept is "order of operations" (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and algebraic representation. This is a foundational skill for 11-13 year olds (Key Stage 3).
- **Procedural Steps**: The student must identify the variable, add 5, then multiply the *result* (requiring brackets), and set it equal to 17.
- **Distractor Analysis**: 
    - Option A ($n+5 \times 4=17$) is a very strong distractor for students who process left-to-right without understanding that multiplication takes precedence over addition in formal notation.
    - Option B ($4n+5=17$) is a common error where students multiply the variable first before adding.
    - Option C ($n^4+5=17$) is a weaker distractor, likely catching those confused by "multiply by four" vs "power of four."
- **Psychometric Comparison**: Looking at the calibration items, items involving order of operations (like the second example) often have low classical difficulty (low proportion correct) because the left-to-right misconception is very persistent. However, translating words to algebra is often slightly more intuitive than calculating with fractions and decimals. I expect a classical difficulty around 0.40 - 0.50, as it is a standard "forming equations" task.
- **Discrimination**: This item clearly separates those who understand the structural necessity of brackets from those who apply operations linearly. It should have a healthy discrimination parameter (around 1.3-1.5).
