The item assesses the ability to substitute a value into a linear equation with two variables and solve for the remaining variable. The cognitive demand involves substituting $x=0$ into $4x + 2y = 10$, which simplifies the equation to $2y = 10$, and then performing a single-step division. While the substitution of zero is a foundational skill, the presentation within a table of values adds a layer of representational interpretation. The distractors target common errors: $A (20)$ likely stems from $4 \times 5$ or $10 \times 2$, $B (3)$ from $10 - 4 - 3$, and $D (2.5)$ from $10/4$. Given the simplicity of substituting zero, this item is expected to have a relatively high success rate compared to more complex algebraic manipulations, though the inverse operation misconception (dividing vs. subtracting) remains a factor.
