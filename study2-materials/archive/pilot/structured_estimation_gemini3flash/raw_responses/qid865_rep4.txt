The item assesses the ability to link a visual representation of a quadratic graph to its algebraic equation by identifying roots and the orientation of the curve. Students must recognize that roots at $x = -5$ and $x = 1$ correspond to factors $(x+5)$ and $(1-x)$ or $(x-1)$, while the downward concavity indicates a negative $x^2$ coefficient. The misconception involving negative multiplication often leads students to select options where the signs of the constants within the brackets do not account for the negative leading coefficient required for the "n-shape" graph.
