The item tests the fundamental rules of multiplying and dividing negative numbers, specifically the rule that a negative times a negative equals a positive. 

- **Mathematical Analysis**: 
  - Tom's calculation: $-3 \times (-8) = 24$. Tom claims it is $-24$. Tom is incorrect.
  - Katie's calculation: $\frac{-24}{-3} = 8$. Katie claims it is $-8$. Katie is incorrect.
  - Therefore, Option D (Neither) is the correct answer.

- **Psychometric Considerations**:
  - The misconception "multiplying two negatives gives a negative" is extremely strong and pervasive in the UK KS3 and KS4 curriculum.
  - The diagram provided is slightly abstract (arrows representing vectors or directed numbers). While it supports the idea of -24 and its components, students often ignore the diagram if they feel confident (but are wrong) about the sign rules.
  - Option C (Both) is a very strong distractor for students who consistently apply the "negative and negative stays negative" rule.
  - Option A and B are attractive to students who might be confused about one operation but not the other.
  - Compared to the calibration items: This item is conceptually simpler than solving linear inequalities (Item 5) but targets a more "sticky" misconception than the factorising item (Item 4). The "Neither" answer (Option D) typically lowers the proportion correct because students are often socially conditioned to think at least one person in a word problem is usually right.

- **Difficulty Prediction**: 
  - Given that Item 1 (simple equation) had a difficulty of 0.167 and Item 2 (order of operations with fractions) had 0.134, this item is likely to be difficult. Negative number arithmetic is a high-error zone. However, the "Neither" option often acts as a "difficulty inducer."
  - I expect a classical difficulty around 0.25 - 0.35.
  - Discrimination is likely to be high as it clearly separates those who know the sign rules from those who don't.
