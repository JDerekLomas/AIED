<chain_of_thought>
The item assesses multi-step equation solving involving squares and roots. I evaluated the cognitive load of isolating the variable, the commonality of inverse operation errors, and the potential for confusion between variables (n vs p) in the distractors. My predictions are based on the alignment of this item's complexity with the provided calibration examples.
