The item assesses substitution into a linear algebraic expression involving negative numbers and the order of operations. I am evaluating the cognitive steps required: substituting $d = -2$ into $10 - 2d$, performing the multiplication $(-2) \times (-2)$, and then adding that result to 10. The distractors effectively target common errors: $10 - 4 = 6$ (sign error in multiplication), $10 - (-2) = 12$ or similar arithmetic slips leading to $-12$, and concatenation or incorrect order of operations leading to $32$. Based on the calibration items, substitution with negatives is a moderately difficult task for this age group, typically showing high discrimination as it separates students with a firm grasp of directed numbers from those who rely on rote procedures.
