The item requires students to substitute a decimal value ($x=0.3$) into a linear equation ($2x + 3y = 12$) and solve for $y$. 
Steps: 
1. Multiply $2 \times 0.3 = 0.6$.
2. Subtract $0.6$ from $12$ to get $11.4$.
3. Divide $11.4$ by $3$ to get $3.8$.

Misconception analysis:
The stated misconception is "using the same operation rather than the inverse." 
- If a student adds $0.6$ instead of subtracting: $12 + 0.6 = 12.6$; $12.6 / 3 = 4.2$ (Option C).
- If a student treats $2x$ as $2.3$ (concatenation): $2.3 + 3y = 12 \rightarrow 3y = 9.7 \rightarrow y \approx 3.23$ (not an option).
- Arithmetic errors with decimals are highly likely here. $12 - 0.3 = 11.7$; $11.7 / 3 = 3.9$ (Option B).
- $12.3 / 3 = 4.1$ (Option A).

Psychometric context:
Compared to the calibration items, this involves multi-step manipulation (substitution + two-step equation solving) with decimals. Decimals significantly increase the difficulty for UK secondary students compared to integers. While the underlying algebra is mid-level (KS3/Year 8-9), the decimal arithmetic makes it prone to errors. The discrimination is likely to be moderate-to-high as it separates those who can handle multi-step procedural logic from those who cannot. The guessing parameter is likely low because the distractors are mathematically "close" and derived from common errors.
