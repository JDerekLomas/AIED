The item evaluates order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) specifically within the context of fraction arithmetic. To solve it correctly, students must prioritize the multiplication ($\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{20}$) before performing the subtraction ($\frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{20} = \frac{15}{20} - \frac{1}{20} = \frac{14}{20} = \frac{7}{10}$). The distractors are highly effective: Option B ($\frac{1}{10}$) results from a left-to-right calculation ($\frac{2}{4} \times \frac{1}{5}$), which is the primary misconception being tested. Option A ($\frac{2}{16}$) represents a combination of left-to-right calculation and incorrect denominator handling. Based on the calibration examples involving similar order-of-operation errors, this item is likely to have a low proportion correct (high difficulty) because the "intuitive" left-to-right path is very attractive to lower-attaining students.
