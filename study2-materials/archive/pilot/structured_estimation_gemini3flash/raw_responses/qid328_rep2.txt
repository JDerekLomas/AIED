The item assesses the addition of fractions with unequal denominators, a fundamental skill in the UK secondary curriculum. The reasoning follows these steps:
1. Identifying that the denominators are multiples (3 and 9), which simplifies the procedural demand compared to coprime denominators.
2. Evaluating the strength of the "add across" misconception (Option B), which is highly prevalent among lower-attaining students.
3. Comparing the item's complexity to the calibration examples; it is more straightforward than solving inequalities but involves a higher cognitive load than basic integer operations due to the need for equivalent fractions.
4. Estimating difficulty based on the commonality of the error and the clear presence of a strong distractor.
