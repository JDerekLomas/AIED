The item tests the evaluation of a negative integer raised to an even power: \((-2)^4\). 
- Mathematical steps: \((-2) \times (-2) \times (-2) \times (-2)\). This involves understanding the definition of an exponent and the rules for multiplying negative numbers.
- Distractor analysis:
  - A) \(-16\): The most common error. Students correctly calculate \(2^4 = 16\) but believe the negative sign remains, often confusing \((-2)^4\) with \(-2^4\), or simply applying the "negative plus negative is negative" logic to multiplication.
  - B) \(-8\): Confuses exponentiation with multiplication (\(-2 \times 4\)).
  - D) \(8\): Confuses exponentiation with multiplication and ignores the sign or makes a sign error.
- Psychometric context: This is a classic "trap" question in the UK curriculum (KS3/KS4). While the arithmetic is simple, the sign rule for even powers is a high-frequency site for misconceptions.
- Comparing to calibration items: 
  - It is more "simple" looking than the equation solving items, but the misconception (\(-16\)) is extremely "sticky."
  - The proportion correct is likely to be lower than one might expect for such a short question, similar to the "negative vs inverse" errors seen in the calibration sets.
  - Discrimination should be high because it cleanly separates those who know the power rule from those who don't.
  - Guessing: Since there are four options and two common calculation errors (\(2 \times 4\) vs \(2^4\)), guessing is present but distractor A is a very strong "attractor."
