The item assesses the ability to solve a two-sided linear inequality, which requires applying inverse operations (subtraction followed by division) to all three parts of the expression. The complexity is moderate as it involves negative numbers and maintaining the inequality structure. The identified misconception (using the same operation rather than the inverse) is directly addressed by distractors like D, while B and C likely target calculation errors or incorrect application of steps to only one side of the inequality. Based on the calibration examples, multi-step algebraic manipulation for this age group typically results in a moderate difficulty level and a discrimination value above 1.0.
