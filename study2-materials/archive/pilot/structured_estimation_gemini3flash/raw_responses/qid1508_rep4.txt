The item assesses the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) using four integers and two operations. I evaluated the complexity of the arithmetic, the attractiveness of the left-to-right processing distractor (Option D), and the typical performance of UK secondary students on non-calculator order-of-operations tasks. Based on the calibration examples, this item is slightly more accessible than the multi-format example provided earlier, but still triggers significant procedural errors.
