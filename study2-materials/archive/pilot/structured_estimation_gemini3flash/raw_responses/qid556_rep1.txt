The item assesses a fundamental algebraic concept: identifying the inverse operation required to isolate a variable in a linear equation. The cognitive demand is relatively low as it focuses on a single step of a procedure (division to undo multiplication) rather than a full multi-step solution. The visual representation using a "star" and the context of "Isaac's book" adds a slight layer of abstraction but remains highly accessible to the target age group. The primary distractor is likely to be subtraction, based on the common misconception of using the same operation or confusing coefficient relationships with additive ones. Given the simplicity of the transformation from 9y to y, the item is expected to have a high success rate among UK secondary students.
