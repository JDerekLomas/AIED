The item assesses the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). I analyzed the cognitive steps: identifying the parentheses (2+2=4), then performing division (12/4=3), and finally addition (4+3=7). I evaluated the distractors: A (10) results from left-to-right calculation (4+12=16, 16/2=8, 8+2=10); C (12) results from ignoring parentheses but following some order (12/2=6, 4+6+2=12); and D (4) results from an alternate error in operation sequencing. Given the commonality of the left-to-right misconception and the simplicity of the arithmetic, I estimated the parameters relative to the provided calibration examples.
