The item assesses the ability to solve a two-step linear equation involving fractions. To solve it correctly, students must multiply by 2 (or cross-multiply) and then add 3. The distractors target common errors: Option A (multiplying by 8 and subtracting 3), Option B (incorrectly combining terms or signs), and Option C (applying operations to the denominator or failing to isolate the variable correctly). Based on the calibration items, multi-step equations involving fractions typically present a moderate difficulty level for the 11-16 age range, with specific misconceptions regarding inverse operations and fraction manipulation being highly prevalent. The 3PL model is appropriate here as guessing remains a factor in 4-choice items, though the strong distractors likely keep the guessing parameter relatively low.
