The item assesses the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS). To solve correctly, students must perform division and multiplication before addition (6 + 2 = 8). The primary distractor (14) stems from a left-to-right processing error ((12 / 2 + 1) * 2 = 14), which is a high-frequency misconception in this age group. Other distractors like 9 (12 / (2+1) * 2) or 3 are less likely but capture common grouping or calculation errors. Compared to the calibration examples, this is a fundamental arithmetic task with low abstraction but high susceptibility to procedural errors, suggesting a moderate difficulty level and strong discrimination.
