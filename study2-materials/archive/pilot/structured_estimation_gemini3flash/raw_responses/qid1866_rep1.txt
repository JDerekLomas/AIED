The item assesses the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically the priority of multiplication over addition and subtraction. The problem requires three operations: multiplication, subtraction, and addition. The core challenge lies in resisting the left-to-right impulse (which leads to A: 33) and correctly identifying that $10 \times 3$ must be performed first. The distractors are highly plausible, targeting common errors such as left-to-right processing and sign errors. Based on the calibration examples, items involving order of operations often have moderate discrimination and relatively low classical difficulty due to the persistence of the left-to-right misconception among secondary students.
