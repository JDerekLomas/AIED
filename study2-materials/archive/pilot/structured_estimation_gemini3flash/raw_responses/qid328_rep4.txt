The item assesses basic fraction addition with unequal denominators, a fundamental skill in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum. The reasoning follows that while the mathematical operation is straightforward, the specific misconception of adding numerators and denominators (leading to 3/12) is extremely prevalent among lower-attaining students. Since the denominators are related (3 is a factor of 9), the procedural complexity is lower than if the denominators were coprime, making the correct answer relatively accessible to students with basic fluency.
