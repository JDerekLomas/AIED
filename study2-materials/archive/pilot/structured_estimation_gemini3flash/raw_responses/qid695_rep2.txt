The item assesses the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) using four integers and three operations (division, addition, multiplication). The primary challenge is the "left-to-right" misconception, which leads to option C (18 / 2 = 9; 9 + 2 = 11; 11 * 2 = 22). Another common error is performing multiplication before division or incorrect grouping, leading to options A or D. Given the calibration examples, items involving order of operations typically show high discrimination as they clearly separate students who understand the hierarchy of operations from those who apply them linearly. The cognitive load is moderate due to the multiple steps, but the numbers themselves are small and familiar.
