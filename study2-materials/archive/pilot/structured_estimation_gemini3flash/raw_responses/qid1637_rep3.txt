The item assesses the ability to solve a two-sided linear inequality, requiring the application of inverse operations (subtraction and division) to all three parts of the expression. I have evaluated the complexity of managing multiple boundary conditions and the likelihood of students applying operations incorrectly or inconsistently across the inequality. By comparing this to the provided calibration items—specifically the multi-step linear inequality and the function machine items—I have estimated the difficulty and discrimination parameters based on typical UK secondary school performance trends for this specific algebraic topic.
