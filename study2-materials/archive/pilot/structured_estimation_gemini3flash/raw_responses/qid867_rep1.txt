The item assesses the expansion of a squared binomial, a core algebraic skill in the UK secondary curriculum. The reasoning evaluates the prevalence of common errors, such as squaring the individual terms (Option B) or misapplying the sign of the constant term (Option D). Given the clear phrasing and standard presentation, the cognitive load is moderate, but the strength of the misconception regarding negative signs significantly influences the difficulty parameters.
