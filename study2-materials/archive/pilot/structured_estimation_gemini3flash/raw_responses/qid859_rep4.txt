The item involves solving a linear equation with unknowns on both sides, which is a standard mid-level secondary school algebra task. The reasoning process involves evaluating the steps required (collecting like terms and isolating the variable) against the identified misconception of using the same operation instead of the inverse. I compared this item to the provided calibration examples, noting that it is more complex than a one-step equation but more straightforward than inequalities or quadratic factorisation.
