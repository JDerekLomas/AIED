The item assesses the ability to substitute a value into a linear sequence formula involving negative coefficients. Reasoning involves identifying the substitution step ($1 - 3 \times 15$), performing the multiplication before the subtraction (Order of Operations), and correctly handling the resulting negative integer arithmetic. The misconception (left-to-right processing: $1-3 = -2$, then $-2 \times 15 = -30$) is a common error in algebraic manipulation. Distractors are well-mapped to common arithmetic slips, such as off-by-one errors or sign errors.
