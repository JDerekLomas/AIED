The item assesses the foundational algebraic concept of inverse operations within the context of solving linear equations. While the mathematical operation is simple (subtracting 7), the question uses a specific visual representation of "working out" which increases the transfer distance from standard calculation. The primary misconception involves students selecting the operation currently visible in the equation (+7) rather than the inverse needed to isolate the variable. Based on the calibration items, this type of conceptual hurdle typically results in a moderate difficulty level and high discrimination, as it clearly separates students with procedural understanding from those who rely on surface-level cues.
