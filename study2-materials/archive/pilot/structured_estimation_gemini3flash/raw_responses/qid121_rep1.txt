The item requires students to rearrange a linear equation from implicit form (ax + by = c) to explicit form (y = mx + c) to identify the gradient. This involves multiple algebraic steps: subtracting 5x and then dividing by 3. Common errors involve identifying the coefficient of x before rearranging (Distractor A), or failing to handle the sign change during subtraction (Distractor C). The misconception "uses the same operation rather than the inverse" is particularly relevant here during the subtraction and division phases. Compared to the calibration items, this requires a higher level of algebraic manipulation and conceptual understanding of linear graphs, placing its difficulty in the mid-to-high range for the target age group.
