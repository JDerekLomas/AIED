The item involves solving a linear inequality with variables on both sides, which is a standard topic for UK secondary students (Key Stage 3/4). The item requires algebraic manipulation, including collecting like terms and applying inverse operations. The logic is very similar to the fifth calibration example ($2n+3 \le 3n-7$), suggesting the difficulty and discrimination parameters will be closely aligned. The presence of common distractors based on incorrect inverse operations or sign errors suggests a moderate level of difficulty and a non-zero guessing parameter typical of 4-choice algebra questions.
