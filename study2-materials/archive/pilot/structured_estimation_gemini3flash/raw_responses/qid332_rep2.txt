The item assesses the understanding of inverse operations and the correct order of steps when solving two-step linear equations. Tom correctly applies the inverse of subtraction first, while Katie incorrectly multiplies only one term by 3, a common error in algebraic manipulation. Based on the provided calibration items, this type of algebraic reasoning typically shows moderate difficulty and solid discrimination for the age group.
