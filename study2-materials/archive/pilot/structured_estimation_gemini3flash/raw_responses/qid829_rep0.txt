The item involves expanding a quadratic expression $(m-3)(m-2)$ using the distributive law. This requires four multiplications (FOIL method) and the combination of like terms. The primary difficulty lies in the manipulation of negative signs, specifically $(-3) \times (-2) = +6$ and $(-3m) + (-2m) = -5m$. The distractors target common errors in integer arithmetic and term combination, which are standard misconceptions in the UK Key Stage 3 and 4 curriculum. Based on the provided calibration examples, this item is slightly more complex than basic linear equations but follows a highly standard procedural format.
