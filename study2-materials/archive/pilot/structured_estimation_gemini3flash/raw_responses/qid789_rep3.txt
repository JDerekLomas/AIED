The item assesses fundamental fraction addition and simplification, which are core lower secondary skills. The reasoning involves identifying that while the addition step is straightforward due to common denominators, the requirement to simplify the result (8/10 to 4/5) adds a secondary procedural step where many students may stop prematurely or fail. Distractor analysis suggests that Option A targets the "add across" misconception, while Option B targets students who fail to simplify, making the item moderately difficult despite its simple appearance.
