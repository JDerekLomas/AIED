The item involves a basic one-step linear equation with negative integers, which is a foundational skill in the UK Key Stage 3 curriculum. My reasoning focuses on the similarity between this item and the first calibration example, as both test the application of inverse operations in the presence of negative numbers. I evaluated the cognitive load as low, but noted that the specific misconception (adding instead of subtracting) is highly prevalent among students at this level, leading to a relatively low expected proportion correct despite the procedural simplicity.
