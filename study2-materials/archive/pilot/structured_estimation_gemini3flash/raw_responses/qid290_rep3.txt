The item assesses the ability to identify a counter-example for a quadratic expression involving fractions and decimals. I evaluated the cognitive load required to process multiple substitution steps and the specific misconception regarding the squaring of numbers between -1 and 1. I compared the complexity of squaring fractions and negative integers against the target expression to estimate difficulty and discrimination parameters based on the provided calibration items.
