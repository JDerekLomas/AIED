The item assesses the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) using basic arithmetic. The primary misconception is the left-to-right processing error, which leads to option B. I have evaluated the complexity of the arithmetic operations, the commonality of this specific error in the UK 11-16 age range, and the clarity of the question's presentation. Based on the calibration items, this problem is relatively straightforward but contains highly attractive distractors for students who lack procedural fluency in operator precedence.
