The item evaluates the application of the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), specifically prioritizing exponents over multiplication. The question is structurally simple but targets a highly prevalent misconception where students process operations linearly from left to right. Distractor B targets the multiplication of the base by the exponent (2 * 3 * 2), Distractor C targets the linear left-to-right error ((2 * 3)^2), and Distractor D represents a calculation or addition error. Based on calibration items with similar misconception strengths, this item is expected to have a low proportion correct but a relatively low IRT difficulty due to the elementary nature of the numbers involved.
