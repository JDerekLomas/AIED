The item assesses basic integer multiplication and the sign rules associated with negative numbers. I evaluated the simplicity of the single-step calculation against the common misconception that two negatives result in a negative product (Option A) and the potential for additive confusion (Option C). Given the clear phrasing and standard curriculum alignment for UK Key Stage 3, the cognitive load is low, but the presence of high-frequency distractors suggests a moderate difficulty level.
