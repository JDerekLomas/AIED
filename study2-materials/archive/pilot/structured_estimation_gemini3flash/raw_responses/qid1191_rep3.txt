The item involves solving a linear equation with the unknown on both sides ($20t - 5 = 5t + 10$). 

**Step-by-step solution:**
1. Subtract $5t$ from both sides: $15t - 5 = 10$.
2. Add $5$ to both sides: $15t = 15$.
3. Divide by $15$: $t = 1$. Correct Answer: B.

**Distractor Analysis:**
- Option A ($t=0$): Could arise from a complete failure to handle the constants or a misinterpretation of $15t = 15$ as $15t - 15 = 0 \rightarrow t=0$? Less likely.
- Option C ($t=-1$): Mismanagement of signs. If a student gets $15t = -15$ or subtracts $10$ from both sides incorrectly.
- Option D ($t=1/5$): Likely from $25t = 5$ (adding $5t$ instead of subtracting, and subtracting $10$ instead of adding $5$). This aligns with the misconception "uses the same operation rather than the inverse".

**Psychometric Comparison:**
- The first calibration example ($-5 = p + 10$) had a classical difficulty of 0.167. That was a one-step equation but with negative numbers, which often trips students up more than multi-step equations with positive integers.
- The last calibration example ($2n + 3 \leq 3n - 7$) had a classical difficulty of 0.569 and an IRT difficulty of 0.808. Our target item is slightly simpler because it is an equation rather than an inequality, but involves larger coefficients.
- Linear equations with variables on both sides are standard for UK Year 8/9 (ages 12-14). 
- The misconception "using same operation" is very common here (e.g., adding $5t$ to $20t$ to get $25t$, or subtracting $5$ from $10$ to get $5$).
- I expect the difficulty to be moderate, likely around 0.45-0.55 classical difficulty.
