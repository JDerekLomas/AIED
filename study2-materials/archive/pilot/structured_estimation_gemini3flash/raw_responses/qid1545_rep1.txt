The item evaluates order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) by comparing two expressions with identical numbers but different grouping. The left side ($8 + 12 \div 4 = 11$) requires prioritizing division, while the right side ($(8 + 12) \div 4 = 5$) requires prioritizing the brackets. The common misconception of left-to-right calculation results in $20 \div 4 = 5$ for the left side, leading students to choose the '=' symbol (Option C). Given the calibration examples, this type of arithmetic misconception is highly prevalent in the target age group, typically resulting in low classical difficulty and moderate discrimination.
