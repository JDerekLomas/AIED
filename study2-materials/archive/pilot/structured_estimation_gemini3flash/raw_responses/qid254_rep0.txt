The item assesses the foundational concept of calculating the mean, specifically focusing on the inclusion of zero in the count of values and the correct application of the order of operations (BIDMAS). Students must recognize that while zero does not change the sum, it must be included in the divisor (n=5). Distractor B targets a common calculator-entry error regarding the order of operations, while C targets the misconception that zero is not a "value" to be counted. The cognitive load is low, but the distractors are highly plausible for this age group.
