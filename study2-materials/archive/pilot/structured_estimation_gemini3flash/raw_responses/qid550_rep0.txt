The item assesses the commutative and associative properties of addition and multiplication within the context of the order of operations. Students must evaluate two statements involving basic arithmetic operations and determine if the equivalence holds when terms are rearranged. The primary challenge lies in the "left-to-right" misconception, where students might incorrectly assume that changing the order of addition and subtraction (Tom) or addition and multiplication (Katie) always changes the result, or conversely, that the operations are always commutative regardless of the operator. Given the simplicity of the numbers involved, the cognitive load is low, but the conceptual trap regarding the priority of operations makes the item moderately difficult for younger or lower-attaining students in the 11-16 age range.
