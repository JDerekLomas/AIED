The item assesses the conversion of arithmetic operations into formal algebraic notation, specifically focusing on the hierarchy of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and the use of the vinculum for division. Reasoning involves identifying that multiplication ($a \times b$) takes precedence and is written as $ab$, and that the division of the entire bracketed expression requires placing the $2$ over the sum $3+ab$. Distractor A targets a left-to-right processing error, while B and D target notation and grouping misconceptions. Given the commonality of BIDMAS errors in early secondary school, the difficulty is expected to be moderate.
