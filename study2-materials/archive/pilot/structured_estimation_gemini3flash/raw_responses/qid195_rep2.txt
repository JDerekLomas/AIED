The item involves solving a linear equation with fractional terms, requiring the application of inverse operations (multiplication and addition) to isolate the variable. The distractors are strategically designed to capture common errors, such as multiplying by the denominator without clearing the fraction correctly or misapplying operations to the constant. Based on the provided calibration items, this problem falls into a moderate difficulty range for the UK secondary curriculum, as it combines algebraic manipulation with fraction arithmetic, leading to a slightly higher cognitive load than basic one-step equations.
