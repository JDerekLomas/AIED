The item assesses the understanding of the mean (arithmetic average) specifically when a zero is present in the data set and the correct order of operations. The inclusion of zero is a classic trap; students often ignore it in the divisor (Option C) or the sum. Option B tests the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS), as a linear calculation without brackets would only divide the final term by 5. The conceptual load is low, but the procedural distractors are highly plausible for this age group. Based on the calibration items, foundational statistics questions with common pitfalls typically show moderate difficulty but high discrimination among lower-ability students.
