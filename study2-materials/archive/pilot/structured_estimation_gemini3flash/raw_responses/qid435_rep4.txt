The item evaluates the application of order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) combined with negative number arithmetic across four distinct expressions. The reasoning process involves calculating each option while identifying where students likely fail: Option A involves a mix of operations yielding 12; Option B (the correct answer) requires multiplying -4 by 2 first to get -8, then subtracting -8 from -28 to reach -20; Option C and D test squaring negatives and division sign rules. The cognitive load is relatively high as students must evaluate multiple independent expressions to find the match, rather than solving a single equation.
