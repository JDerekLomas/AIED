The item assesses the Order of Operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) using a multi-step arithmetic expression. The primary challenge involves prioritizing multiplication over addition and subtraction, while also managing negative numbers. The identified misconception (left-to-right processing) leads directly to distractor B, while other distractors target common errors in integer arithmetic or grouping. Based on the calibration items involving similar order-of-operation errors, this item is likely to have a moderate difficulty level and high discrimination, as the distinction between procedural fluency and surface-level execution is clear.
