The item assesses the ability to solve a linear equation involving a fraction and a numerator expression. I have evaluated the steps required: multiplying by the denominator (2) and adding the constant (3). I considered the common misconceptions, such as applying the same operation instead of the inverse or performing operations in the wrong order, which make the distractors particularly plausible. The difficulty is likely higher than simple one-step equations but lower than multi-step inequalities with variables on both sides.
