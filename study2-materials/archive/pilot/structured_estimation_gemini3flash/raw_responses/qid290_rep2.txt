The item assesses the ability to identify a counter-example for a quadratic expression involving fractions, decimals, and negative numbers. To solve it, a student must understand that a counter-example must result in a non-positive value (≤ 0). Evaluation of the options requires squaring values and performing arithmetic: A results in 0.125, B results in -0.5 (the correct counter-example), C results in 7, and D results in 1. The misconception noted (multiplying two negatives gives a negative) specifically targets distractors C and D, where students might incorrectly calculate (-2)² as -4 or (-1)² as -1. The inclusion of decimals and fractions increases cognitive load, while the concept of a "counter-example" adds a layer of logical abstraction. Compared to the calibration items, this requires more evaluative reasoning than simple equation solving.
