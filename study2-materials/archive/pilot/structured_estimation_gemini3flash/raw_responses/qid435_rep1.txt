The item evaluates the ability to apply the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) alongside negative number arithmetic across four distinct expressions. The target expression (B) requires evaluating $-28 - (-8)$, which tests the specific misconception of handling double negatives and the subtraction of a negative product. The distractors are well-constructed to capture common errors in squaring negatives and sign management in multiplication. Given the multi-step nature of verifying four different calculations, the cognitive load is moderate for the target age group, leading to a predicted difficulty slightly above the mean.
