The item assesses order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) combined with negative number arithmetic. Based on the provided calibration examples, questions involving both signed numbers and operation priority tend to have low classical difficulty scores because the "left-to-right" misconception is highly prevalent and attractive. The distractors are well-constructed to capture common errors: A and B represent left-to-right processing with sign errors, while C represents a failure to correctly apply the negative sign during the multiplication phase. Given the similarity to the second calibration example, I expect a relatively low proportion correct and a difficulty parameter near the middle of the range.
