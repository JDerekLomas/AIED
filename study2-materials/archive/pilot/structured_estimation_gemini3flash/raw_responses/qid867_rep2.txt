The item assesses the expansion of a squared binomial, a core algebraic skill in the UK secondary curriculum. I am evaluating the cognitive demand based on the multi-step nature of the expansion (FOIL method or grid method) and the high frequency of the "freshman's dream" error (squaring individual terms) represented in the distractors. I am also considering the specific misconception of sign errors when multiplying negative constants.
