The item assesses fraction addition with common denominators and the grouping of terms to simplify calculations. I evaluated the cognitive demand by considering the likelihood of the "add across" misconception (Option B) and the use of common denominators (Option A/D). Given the clear grouping of thirds and quarters, higher-ability students will quickly reach the integer sum, while lower-ability students are highly prone to the identified misconception.
