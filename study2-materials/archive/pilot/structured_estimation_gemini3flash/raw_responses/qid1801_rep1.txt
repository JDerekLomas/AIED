The item involves solving a double inequality, which requires applying inverse operations (subtraction and division) to all three parts of the expression simultaneously. Reasoning through the distractors, Option A represents a common error where the student adds 1 and multiplies by 2 (using same operations instead of inverses), Option C likely stems from a calculation error or partial processing of the range, and Option D represents a misapplication of the constants. Given the multi-step nature and the specific misconception of inverse operations in a less common double-inequality format, this item is expected to have a higher difficulty level than basic linear equations but maintain strong discrimination.
