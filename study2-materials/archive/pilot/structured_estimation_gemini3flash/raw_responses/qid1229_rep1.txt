The item tests a very specific and notorious nuance in mathematical notation and calculator logic: the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) regarding unary negatives versus powers. 

1. **Mathematical analysis**: $-6^2$ is interpreted by calculators (and standard convention) as $-(6^2)$, resulting in $-36$. Many students intuitively believe it means $(-6)^2 = 36$.
2. **Distractors**: 
   - **C (36)** is the primary distractor and is extremely powerful. Most students who haven't encountered this specific calculator quirk or the formal priority of indices over negation will choose this.
   - **A (12) and B (-12)** target students who confuse squaring with multiplying by 2.
3. **Difficulty assessment**: Looking at the calibration examples, items involving order of operations (like the $0.4 - 1/5 \times 3$ item) often have very low classical difficulty (proportion correct). This item is famously counter-intuitive. In the UK context, even high-attaining students at GCSE (age 16) frequently miss this.
4. **IRT parameters**: 
   - The difficulty will be high (low classical proportion correct). 
   - The discrimination is likely to be moderate to high because it separates those who truly understand notation from those who apply a "common sense" rule.
   - Guessing (c) is likely low because the misconception (C) is so attractive that students don't guess; they confidently choose the wrong answer.
5. **Comparison with Calibrations**: The "Solve $-5=p+10$" item had a 0.167 success rate. I expect this item to be similarly difficult or even harder, as the "36" distractor is more seductive than the distractors in the algebra items.
