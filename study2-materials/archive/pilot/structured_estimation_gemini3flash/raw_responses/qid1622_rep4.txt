The item assesses the ability to substitute a value into a linear equation and solve for the remaining variable. The cognitive demand is moderate, requiring the understanding of zero-product properties and basic algebraic manipulation. Distractors are well-aligned with common procedural errors, such as misidentifying operations or incorrect division.
