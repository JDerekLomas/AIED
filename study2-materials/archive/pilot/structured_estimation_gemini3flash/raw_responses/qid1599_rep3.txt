The item assesses the fundamental algebraic convention of representing division as a fraction, specifically involving a binomial divisor. The cognitive demand is relatively low as it is a recognition task rather than a multi-step calculation. The distractors target common errors in fraction notation, such as reversing the dividend and divisor or failing to group terms correctly. Based on the simplicity of the concept for the 11-16 age range, the item is likely to have a high success rate and moderate discrimination.
