The item assesses the ability to translate a concrete visual representation (cups and counters) into algebraic notation and then solve the resulting linear equation. The visual prompt provides a step-by-step reduction of the equation $x + 4 = 2x + 2$, leading to $x = 2$. Distractors B, C, and D capitalize on the common misconception of adding coefficients and constants (e.g., $1x + 2x = 3x$ and $4 + 2 = 6$) rather than performing inverse operations to isolate the variable. While the visual aid simplifies the conceptual leap, the multi-step nature of the distractors (showing both the equation and a first step) increases cognitive load. Comparing this to the calibration items, it is more complex than the simple one-step equation but more concrete than the inequality, suggesting a moderate difficulty level and a high discrimination as it clearly separates those who understand the additive inverse from those who combine terms.
