The item involves a standard two-step linear equation requiring an inverse operation (addition) followed by division. The presence of a fraction as a solution increases the likelihood of errors related to the order of division (dividing the smaller number by the larger) and sign errors. Based on the calibration items, similar algebraic tasks show moderate discrimination and difficulty parameters that reflect common procedural misconceptions in the UK secondary curriculum.
