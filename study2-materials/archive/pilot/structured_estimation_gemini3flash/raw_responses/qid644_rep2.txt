The item assesses a specific sub-step of binomial expansion: the multiplication of two negative constants. The reasoning involves identifying the sign rule (negative times negative) and basic multiplication. The visual prompt (arrows) reduces cognitive load by isolating the terms, though it requires decoding the diagram. Distractors target common sign errors and additive misconceptions.
