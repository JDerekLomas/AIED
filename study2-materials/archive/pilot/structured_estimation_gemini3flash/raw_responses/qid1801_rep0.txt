The item assesses the ability to solve a double inequality, which requires applying inverse operations to all three parts of the expression simultaneously. Reasoning through the distractors reveals common errors: Distractor A assumes addition instead of subtraction for the constant, Distractor C suggests a failure to subtract from the lower bound, and Distractor D indicates a potential miscalculation or partial operation. Based on the provided calibration items, multi-step algebraic manipulation typically results in moderate difficulty for the 11-16 age range, with discrimination being relatively high as it separates students who understand the structure of inequalities from those who apply rote, single-step rules.
