The item assesses the ability to identify valid algebraic transformations in linear equations with variables on both sides. It specifically targets the inverse operation misconception, where students might add instead of subtract (or vice versa) when moving terms across the equals sign. Jo's error involves subtracting 3 from -5 to get -8 (instead of adding 3), and Paul's error involves subtracting 5 from -3 to get -8 (instead of adding 5). The cognitive load is moderate as students must evaluate two separate claims, and the "Neither" option is often challenging for students who expect one person to be correct. Based on the calibration items, this conceptual check on inverse operations typically yields lower success rates than procedural execution.
