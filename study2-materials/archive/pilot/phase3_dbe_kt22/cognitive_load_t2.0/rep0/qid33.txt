ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of Cartesian product (A x A): Recognizing it as a set of ordered pairs.
2. Computational mapping of (A x A): { (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2) }.
3. Computational mapping of (C x C): { (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) }.
4. Definition of subset relation (⊆): Understanding that every element in the first set must exist in the second.
5. Logic evaluation: Comparing the generated elements of the first set against the bounds of the second set.
6. Distinguishing noise: Ignoring irrelevant sets B and D which are included to test focus/filtering.
