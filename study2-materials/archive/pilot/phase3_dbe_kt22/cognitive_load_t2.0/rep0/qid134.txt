ELEMENTS:
1. Identifying all candidate keys (determining that A is the sole candidate key because it functionally determines B and C).
2. Definition recall: 3NF (every non-prime attribute is non-transitively dependent on every candidate key).
3. Definition recall: BCNF (for every non-trivial dependency X→Y, X must be a superkey).
4. Logical evaluation of A→BC against 3NF criteria (checking prime vs non-prime attributes).
5. Logical evaluation of A→BC against BCNF criteria (checking if A is a superkey).
6. Simultaneous comparison of both results to match the specific pairings in the multiple-choice options.
