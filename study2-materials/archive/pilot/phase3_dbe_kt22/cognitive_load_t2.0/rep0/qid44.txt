ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of a 'superkey' (distinguishing it from other key types).
2. Definition of an 'attribute' vs. a 'tuple' (to identify category errors in the distractors).
3. The uniqueness constraint (functional dependency from key to tuple).
4. The direction of the relationship (keys identify tuples, not vice versa).
5. The hierarchical relationship between superkeys and candidate keys (specifically the "minimality" requirement).
6. Evaluating "relation" as an entity within a schema vs. data within a relation (to address distractor D).
