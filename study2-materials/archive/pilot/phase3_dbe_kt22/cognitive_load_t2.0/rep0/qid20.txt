ELEMENTS: 
1. Set difference definition (calculating T - S)
2. Cartesian product definition (S x result)
3. Set notation and member identification (recognizing elements vs. ordered pairs)
4. Distinguishing between set union and Cartesian product (avoiding the "addition" of elements)
5. Executing the procedural steps in the correct order (PEMDAS for sets)
6. Maintaining the distinct sets S and the intermediate set {3} in memory to form the pairs.

ELEMENT COUNT: 6
