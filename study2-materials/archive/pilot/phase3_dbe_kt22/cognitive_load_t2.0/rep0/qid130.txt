ELEMENTS: 
1. **Relation and Dependency Notation**: Decoding the schema R and the set of Functional Dependencies (FDs) $\Sigma$.
2. **Decomposition Mapping**: Mentally mapping which FDs from $\Sigma$ apply to R1 and which apply to R2.
3. **Lossless Join Theorem (Intersection Rule)**: Recalling that for two relations, the intersection must be a superkey for at least one of them.
4. **Candidate Key Identification**: Determining that $A$ is the key for R1 ($A \to B$) and $B$ is the key for R2 ($B \to C$).
5. **Lossless Join Evaluation**: Checking if $R1 \cap R2$ (which is $\{B\}$) is a key for R1 or R2.
6. **Dependency Preservation Definition**: Recalling that $(\Sigma_1 \cup \Sigma_2)^+ = \Sigma^+$.
7. **Dependency Preservation Evaluation**: Checking if all original FDs ($A \to B, B \to C$) are contained within the union of the decomposed FDs (here, $A \to B$ is in R1 and $B \to C$ is in R2).
8. **Logical Synthesis**: Comparing the results of both tests to the four multiple-choice combinations provided.
