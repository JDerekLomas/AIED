ELEMENTS: 
1. **SQL Syntax Recall**: Understanding that `SELECT *` retrieves all columns but the row count depends on the join logic.
2. **Join Logic (INNER JOIN)**: Understanding that an inner join only includes rows where the join condition matches in both tables.
3. **Primary/Foreign Key Relationship**: Recognizing `CourseNo` as the linking attribute between the `Course` and `Enrol` tables.
4. **Information Retrieval (Table Data)**: Mentally accessing or visually scanning the (implied) provided table instances for `Course` and `Enrol`.
5. **Set Cardinality Evaluation**: Identifying which records in the `Enrol` table have valid matches in the `Course` table (typically the number of rows in the junction/transaction table, provided referential integrity is maintained).
6. **Constraint Satisfaction**: Filtering out any rows in either table that do not have a corresponding match.

ELEMENT COUNT: 6
