As a university instructor, I have evaluated this question based on its cognitive load and the specific context of South African undergraduate diversity.

The question is a classic "distractor-heavy" scenario. While the text is long and introduces numerous entities (trainers, members, equipment, maintenance schedules) and constraints, the actual task—identifying the key attribute of the "Administrator"—is relatively simple if the student can filter out the noise. However, for a novice, the "element interactivity" is high because they must process the entire schema to ensure no specific rules override the general "ID" assumption.

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **Reading Comprehension/Filtering:** Isolating the "Administrator" entity within a dense 250-word narrative.
2.  **Entity-Attribute Mapping:** Identifying which specific attributes belong to the "Administrator" versus "Employee" or "Member" (Address vs. Phone).
3.  **Concept Recall (Key Attribute):** Understanding the definition of a primary key (uniqueness and invariance).
4.  **Schema Hierarchies (ISA/Generalization):** Recognizing that "Administrator" is a category of "Employee" and therefore inherits the "unique ID" mentioned at the start of the text.
5.  **Distractor Evaluation:** Evaluating "Landline number" (mentioned specifically for administrators) vs. "ID" (mentioned for employees generally).
6.  **Constraint Identification:** Checking if the landline is explicitly stated as unique (it is not) versus the ID (which is).

**ELEMENT COUNT:** 6

**Proportion Estimating Logic:** 
While the answer is "ID", many students in this demographic—particularly those for whom English may be a second or third language or those with lower reading stamina—tend to fall for "Option A: Landline number" because it is the attribute mentioned in the same sentence as "Administrator." However, since it is a multiple-choice question and "ID" is a very standard convention in introductory database courses, the success rate remains relatively high.

Your estimate:
0.72
