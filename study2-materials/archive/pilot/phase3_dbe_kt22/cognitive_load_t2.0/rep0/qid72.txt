ELEMENTS: 
1. SQL Syntax Knowledge: Recognition of the `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` clauses.
2. Operator Logic: Understanding the Boolean `OR` (disjunction) and how it evaluates row inclusion.
3. Row-by-Row Evaluation: The procedure of checking each record in the dataset against the criteria.
4. Schema Mapping: Identifying that `StudentID` is the filtering column and `CourseNo` is the output.
5. Set Aggregation: Summing the instances where the conditions `102` or `103` are met without accidentally counting only unique values (given the lack of `DISTINCT`).
6. Visual Search: Scanning the table specifically for the provided IDs while ignoring irrelevant IDs (like 101 or 104).
