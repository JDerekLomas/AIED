ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall (the Set Difference operation '-' specifically requires remembering to subtract B from A, not A from B).
2. Evaluation of logical membership (checking which elements of A exist in B).
3. Management of irrelevant information (identifying that sets C and D are "noise" and should be ignored).
4. Procedural step (identifying common elements {4, 5}).
5. Procedural step (final subtraction to result in {2, 3}).

ELEMENT_COUNT: 5

For undergraduate CS students in South Africa, this represents very low element interactivity as it is a foundational discrete math concept usually mastered in first year. The presence of distractors (Sets C and D) is the only minor cognitive load factor.
