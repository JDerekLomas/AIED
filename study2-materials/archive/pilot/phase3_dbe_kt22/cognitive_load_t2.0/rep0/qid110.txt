ELEMENTS: 
1. Recalling the definition and algorithm for attribute closure ($X^+$).
2. Identifying the starting set (A) from the problem statement.
3. Evaluating the first FD (A → B): checking if 'A' is in the current set and appending 'B'.
4. Evaluating the second FD (B → C): checking if 'B' is in the current set and appending 'C'.
5. Evaluating the third FD (D → ABC): checking if 'D' is in the current set (logical evaluation/constraint).
6. Maintaining the growing set {A, B, C} in working memory while iterating through the functional dependencies.
7. Final comparison of the calculated set {A, B, C} against the provided multiple-choice options.
