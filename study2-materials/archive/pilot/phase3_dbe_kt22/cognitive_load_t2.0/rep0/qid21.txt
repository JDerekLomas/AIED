1. Set definition recall (recognizing sets S and T)
2. Cartesian Product operation rules (generating pairs for S x T)
3. Cartesian Product operation rules (generating pairs for S x S)
4. Set Difference operation rules (understanding the subtraction logic)
5. Mental maintenance of the product (S x T) = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)}
6. Mental maintenance of the product (S x S) = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}
7. Comparison logic (identifying which elements of the first set are absent in the second)
