ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of 3NF (recall of constraints and requirements).
2. Definition of BCNF (recall of constraints and requirements).
3. Comparative hierarchy of Normal Forms (3NF vs BCNF hierarchy).
4. Distinction between "minimising" and "eliminating" redundancy.
5. Evaluating logical truth of Option A (identifying 3NF is less/weaker, not more/stronger, restrictive).
6. Evaluating logical truth of Option B (knowing 3NF permits transitive-like anomalies if the determinant is a candidate key in specific edge cases, or simply that it is weaker than 4NF/5NF).
7. Evaluating logical truth of Option C (distinguishing absolute elimination from the practical reductions of 3NF).
