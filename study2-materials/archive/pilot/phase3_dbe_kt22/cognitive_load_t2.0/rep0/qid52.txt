ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall of specific SQL keyword syntax (`CREATE TABLE`).
2. Synonym recognition (Understanding that a "relation" in relational theory maps to a "table" in SQL implementation).
3. Case/Syntax discrimination (Distinguishing between SQL standard commands and descriptive English-like distractors like "New").
4. Platform-specific verification (Confirming if PostgreSQL uses standard SQL or custom "relation" keywords).
