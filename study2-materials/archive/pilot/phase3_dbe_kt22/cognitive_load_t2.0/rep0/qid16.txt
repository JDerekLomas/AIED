ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Set notation (curly braces) and element recognition.
2. Definition recall: The Union operator ($\cup$) and its logic of combining sets.
3. Definition recall: The Proper Subset operator ($\subset$) and its specific requirement ($B \subseteq X$ and $B \neq X$).
4. Logical condition: Computing the union of set $A$ and $B$ (recognizing that $B$ is already a subset of $A$).
5. Comparison: Comparing the resulting union set $\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ against set $B$ to determine the subset relationship.
6. Evaluation of the "Proper" constraint: Checking if set $B$ is smaller than/not equal to the resulting union.
