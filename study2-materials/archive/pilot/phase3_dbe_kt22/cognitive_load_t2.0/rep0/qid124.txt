ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall the definition of a Candidate Key (CK): must be a superkey and must be minimal.
2. Definition of functional dependency (FD) and the closure algorithm.
3. Computation of the attribute closure $\{A, B\}^+$: Start with $\{A, B\}$.
4. Application of FD $A \to B$ (though redundant here, student must check it).
5. Application of FD $AB \to C$ to include $C$ in the set.
6. Verification of the "Superkey" property: Check if $\{A, B, C\} \subseteq \{A, B\}^+$.
7. Recall the "Minimality" requirement: Check subsets of $\{A, B\}$ for the superkey property.
8. Evaluation of $A^+$: $\{A\}^+ = \{A, B\}$. Since $A \to B$, and $AB \to C$, $A$ alone can derive all attributes ($A \to ABC$).
9. Comparative logic: If $A$ is a superkey, then $AB$ cannot be a Candidate Key because it is not minimal.
10. Logical conclusion: Map result to "False".
