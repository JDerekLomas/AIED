ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall the definition of a Super Key (SK) (attribute(s) whose closure includes all attributes in R).
2. SQL/Relational schema notation (understanding $R$ as the set of attributes).
3. Functional Dependency (FD) notation ($X \to Y$).
4. The algorithm for attribute closure (the step-by-step procedure).
5. Initializing the closure set with $A$.
6. Scanning $\Sigma$ to evaluate the condition for $A \to B$ (Logic check: is $A \subseteq \{A\}$?).
7. Updating the working set to $\{A, B\}$.
8. Scanning $\Sigma$ to evaluate the condition for $B \to C$ (Logic check: is $B \subseteq \{A, B\}$?).
9. Updating the working set to $\{A, B, C\}$.
10. Evaluating the condition for $D \to ABC$ (Logic check: is $D \subseteq \{A, B, C\}$?).
11. Comparison/Constraint check: Does final set $\{A, B, C\}$ equal/contain $\{A, B, C, D\}$?
12. Logical conclusion (Missing $D$ means False).
