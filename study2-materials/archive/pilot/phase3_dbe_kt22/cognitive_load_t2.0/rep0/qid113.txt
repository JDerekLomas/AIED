ELEMENTS: 
1. Recalling the formal definition of "attribute closure" ($X^+$).
2. Recognizing the functional dependency notation ($X \to Y$).
3. Evaluating the first step of the closure procedure (Initial set $\{D\}$).
4. Searching the set $\Sigma$ for dependencies where the left-hand side is a subset of the current closure.
5. Applying the augmentation rule/transitivity for $D \to ABC$.
6. Updating the working set to $\{A, B, C, D\}$.
7. Performing a final check against the relation schema $R$ to ensure all attributes are accounted for.
8. Distinguishing between the given options to find the matching set.
