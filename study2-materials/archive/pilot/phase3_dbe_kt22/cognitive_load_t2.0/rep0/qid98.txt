ELEMENTS: 
1. **Definition recall**: Understanding the definition of a "key attribute" (uniqueness and non-nullity).
2. **Entity Identification**: Identifying the entities described in the narrative (Employee, Member, Fitness Class, Equipment).
3. **Hierarchy Logic**: Processing the "Subtype/Supertype" relationship for employees (Technicians/Administrators as categories of Employees).
4. **Relationship Cardinality**: Distinguishing between One-to-Many and Many-to-Many relationships (e.g., Classes to Time Slots, Technicians to Maintenance).
5. **Evaluating Constraint A**: Assessing the mobile phone number of a technician (considering nullability or lack of explicit uniqueness).
6. **Evaluating Constraint B**: Assessing the date of maintenance (evaluating whether a date alone can uniquely identify a record).
7. **Evaluating Constraint C**: Assessing employee names (distinguishing between unique IDs provided in the text and non-unique names).
8. **Evaluating Constraint D**: Mapping the specific business rule "No two fitness classes have the same daily time slot" to the requirement for a key.
