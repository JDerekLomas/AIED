ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The structural criteria for a "weak entity" (requirement of an identifying relationship and a partial key).
2. Concept distinction: Distinguishing between an entity, a multi-valued attribute, and a simple attribute (Status vs. Speciality vs. Associate Member).
3. Entity identification: Recognizing "Associate member" as a distinct object with its own attributes (name, associate number).
4. Relationship analysis: Identifying the relationship between 'Member' and 'Associate member'.
5. Key constraint evaluation: Identifying that "associate number (1, 2...)" is a partial key and requires the Member's ID/Email to be unique.
6. Filtering distractors: Evaluating "Fitness class" which, despite constraints, has a unique time slot and thus a candidate key.
7. Logical evaluation: Recognizing that "Equipments' status" and "Trainers' speciality" are attributes/look-up values, not entities in this context.
8. Constraint satisfaction: Applying the "multi-valued attribute vs. weak entity" rule to "speciality".
