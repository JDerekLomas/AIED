ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall: The fundamental principle of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (linking permissions to roles, and users to roles).
2. Domain distinction: Differentiating between "Resources" (objects/permissions) and "Subjects/Groups" (the roles representing the functions).
3. Logical mapping: Identifying that departments represent functional responsibilities (roles) while files/printers/mailboxes represent the resources those roles need access to.
4. Evaluation of distractors: Filtering out irrelevant entities like "workstations" which are hardware constraints, not organizational roles.
5. Scenario analysis: Correlating the phrase "distinct functions" with the SQL/Security definition of a "Role".
