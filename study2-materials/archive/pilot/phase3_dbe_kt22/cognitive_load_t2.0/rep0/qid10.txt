ELEMENTS: 
1. Recalling the definition of the intersection operator (∩).
2. Processing the set membership for sets A and B to find the intersection.
3. Holding the result of the intersection {4, 5} in working memory.
4. Recalling the definition of the set difference operator (-).
5. Applying the set difference between the original set A and the intermediate result.
6. Filtering elements to ensure only elements present in A but not in the intersection remain.
