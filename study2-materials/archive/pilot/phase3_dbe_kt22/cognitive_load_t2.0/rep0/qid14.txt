ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of a Cartesian Product ($A \times B$): Understanding that the first element of each pair belongs to set $A$ and the second belongs to set $B$.
2. Set Extraction (Set $A$): Identifying that $A = \{2, 3, 4\}$ from the provided samples.
3. Set Extraction (Set $B$): Identifying that $B = \{5, 7\}$ from the provided samples.
4. Size Constraint: Confirming that $|A| \times |B| = 3 \times 2 = 6$, satisfying the condition provided in the stem.
5. Systematic Generation: Mental construction of all six pairs $((2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7))$ to compare against distractors.
6. Pattern Matching: Evaluating multiple logical conditions across four options to identify the one that contains exactly the generated set while excluding invalid coordinates (like $(3,4)$ in Option B or $(5,5)$ in Option D).
