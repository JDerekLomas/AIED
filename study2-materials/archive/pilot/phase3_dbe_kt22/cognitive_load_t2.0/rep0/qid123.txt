ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall of a Candidate Key (CK): Must be both a superkey (uniqueness) and minimal (no smaller subset is a superkey).
2. Functional Dependency (FD) rules: Understanding the $X \rightarrow Y$ notation.
3. Attribute Closure procedure: Calculating $\{A\}^+$ using the provided set $\Sigma$.
4. Logic application (Step 1): Does $\{A\}$ derive all attributes $\{A, B, C\}$? (In this case, $A \rightarrow B$ is given, then $A,B \rightarrow C$ applies, so $A$ is a superkey).
5. Logic application (Step 2/Minimality): Determining if any subset of $\{A\}$ is a superkey (trivial here as $A$ is a singleton set).
6. Distinguishing between a Primary Key, Superkey, and Candidate Key to ensure the specific definition of CK is met.
