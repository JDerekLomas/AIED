ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) requirements regarding functional dependencies.
2. Definition of Third Normal Form (3NF) requirements regarding functional dependencies.
3. The existence property of 3NF: there is an algorithm that guarantees both lossless join and dependency preservation.
4. The existence property of BCNF: while lossless join is guaranteed, dependency preservation is not always possible.
5. Evaluation of logical quantifiers ("always" vs. "cannot"): distinguishing between "possible but not guaranteed" and "impossible."
6. Recall of specific counter-examples (e.g., the relationship between {A, B} -> C and C -> B) to invalidate Option A or C.
