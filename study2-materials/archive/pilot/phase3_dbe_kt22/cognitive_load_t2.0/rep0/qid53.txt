In the context of a South African undergraduate CS cohort, this question primarily tests **recall of specific syntax** and the **conceptual distinction** between Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML).

While the logic is simple, the "distractor" options leverage common natural language synonyms ("Delete"), which frequently trip up students who have a general understanding of the concept but haven't solidified their syntactic precision.

**ELEMENTS:**
1. **SQL Command Recall:** Identifying "DROP" as the keyword for schema destruction.
2. **Object Keyword Recall:** Identifying "TABLE" as the required entity type descriptor in the syntax.
3. **Conceptual Distinction:** Distinguishing between removing a *structure* (DDL) and removing *tuples* (DML/DELETE).
4. **Syntax Rules:** Recognizing that "DROP RELATION" is not valid standard SQL syntax.
5. **Identifier Mapping:** Linking the variable "R" in the question to the placeholder in the options.

**ELEMENT COUNT: 5**

**PROPORTION CORRECT ESTIMATE:**
At the start of a semester, many students conflate "Delete" and "Drop" due to their synonymous meaning in English. In a diverse South African cohort, those with less prior exposure to command-line or formal logic systems often rely on "best-fit" terminology. However, as a multiple-choice question, the "A" option is a classic landmark.
