ELEMENTS: 
1. **SQL Keyword Recall**: Distinguishing between `DROP` (schema modification) and `DELETE` (data manipulation).
2. **Command Syntax Structure**: Recalling the specific multi-part structure of the `ALTER TABLE` statement.
3. **Table vs. Column Distinction**: Recognizing that `COLUMN` is the required keyword in standard SQL syntax for this operation.
4. **Relational Terminology Mapping**: Translating the formal term "attribute A from relation R" into the SQL equivalent "column A from table R."
5. **Syntax Evaluation (Option Analysis)**: Mental parsing of the four specific permutations to identify which conforms to standard SQL grammar versus plausible-sounding decoys.
