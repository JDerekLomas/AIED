ELEMENTS: 
1. **Schema structure awareness**: Identifying attributes in R, R1, and R2.
2. **Functional Dependency (FD) identification**: Processing the set Σ and identifying the given dependencies.
3. **Lossless Join Rule (Chase/Intersection property)**: Identifying $R1 \cap R2 = \{B\}$ and recalling the theorem that the intersection must be a superkey for at least one of the schemas.
4. **Candidate Key derivation**: Calculating the closure of $\{B\}$ (i.e., $B^+ = \{B, C\}$) within the context of R to check if it determines $A$ or $C$ (finding it is a key for $R2$).
5. **Dependency Preservation logic**: Evaluating if all FDs in Σ are either directly contained in a sub-schema or can be inferred from the union of projections ($\pi_{R1}(\Sigma) \cup \pi_{R2}(\Sigma)$).
6. **Transitive Mapping**: Verifying specifically if $A \to C$ (which is "lost" in physical separation) is preserved through the join of $A \to B$ (in $R1$) and $B \to C$ (in $R2$).
7. **Four-way Logical Choice**: Managing the four permutations of the two properties to match the derivation to the correct option (A, B, C, or D).
