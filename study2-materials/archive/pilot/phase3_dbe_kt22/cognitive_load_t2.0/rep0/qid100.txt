To evaluate this question from the perspective of Cognitive Load Theory, we must distinguish between the "noise" (the full scenario) and the "essential elements" required to find the specific answer regarding the relationship between a **member** and a **fitness class**.

While the prompt contains extensive information about technicians, equipment, and administrators, the student must hold the following elements in working memory to arrive at the correct answer:

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **Entity Identification:** Identifying "Member" and "Fitness Class" as the relevant objects amidst a large text block.
2.  **Constraint Extraction (Member -> Class):** Processing the rule "A member may choose to participate in one or more fitness classes."
3.  **Constraint Extraction (Class -> Member):** Processing the rule "Each fitness class is attended by one or more members."
4.  **Concept Mapping:** Mapping the "Many-to-Many" (N:M) logical concept to the "N:N" notation provided in the options.
5.  **Distinction/Filtering:** Simultaneously ignoring distracting information (Personal Trainer relationship, Associate Member relationship, etc.) while holding the primary entities in mind.

**ELEMENT COUNT: 5**

**PROPORTION ESTIMATE:**
At a South African university with diverse backgrounds, this is a relatively accessible question. While the text is long (increasing "extraneous" load), the specific sentences describing the member-to-class relationship are explicit and use standard phrasing. Stronger students will quickly scan for keywords, while weaker students may get bogged down in the equipment or technician details. However, since the cardinality is explicitly stated for both directions, most should succeed.
