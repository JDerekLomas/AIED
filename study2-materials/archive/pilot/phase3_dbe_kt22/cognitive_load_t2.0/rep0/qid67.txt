ELEMENTS: 
1. SQL Syntax recognition: Identifying `FOREIGN KEY` and `REFERENCES` as the primary mechanisms for referential integrity.
2. Table Relationship Mapping: Determining which table is the 'Parent' (Student) and which is the 'Child' (Enrol) based on the syntax.
3. Concept Definition Recall: Defining "Referential Integrity" as ensuring every foreign key value has a matching primary key value in the referenced table.
4. Logical Directionality: Distinguishing between Option A (Child-to-Parent) and Option B (Parent-to-Child), as students often flip the direction of dependency.
5. Distinction between Constraints: Differentiating Referential Integrity from Entity Integrity (Primary Keys) or NOT NULL constraints (Options C and D).
