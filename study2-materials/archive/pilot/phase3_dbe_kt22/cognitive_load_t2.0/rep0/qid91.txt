ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall of ER diagram notation (identifying keys/attributes).
2. Definition recall of "Primary key constraint" (uniqueness and minimality).
3. Definition recall of "Foreign key constraint" (referential integrity between entities/relationships).
4. Definition recall of "Domain constraint" (data types and value ranges).
5. Evaluation of mapping capabilities: assessing whether ER notation (e.g., underlining) explicitly represents PKs vs. FKs (which are often implicit via relationships) vs. specific domain constraints (which are usually in the schema level, not diagrammatic).
6. Distinction between the logical/physical schema and the conceptual model (ER level).
