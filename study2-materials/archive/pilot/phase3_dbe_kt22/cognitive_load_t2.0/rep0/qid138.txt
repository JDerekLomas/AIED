ELEMENTS: 
1. **Attribute Identification**: Recognizing the set of attributes in the relation $R=\{A,B,C,D\}$.
2. **Closure Calculation for Key Discovery**: Determining the candidate keys by computing attribute closures based on $\Sigma$ (Identifying that $AB$ is a key and $BC$ is a key).
3. **Prime vs. Non-prime Distinction**: Identifying $\{A, B, C\}$ as prime attributes and $\{D\}$ as a non-prime attribute.
4. **3NF Definition Recall**: Recalling the criteria (For $X \to Y$, $X$ is a superkey, or $Y$ is a subset of a candidate key).
5. **BCNF Definition Recall**: Recalling the stricter criteria (For $X \to Y$, $X$ must be a superkey).
6. **Constraint Evaluation ($AB \to CD$)**: Evaluating this FD against both normalization definitions.
7. **Constraint Evaluation ($C \to A$)**: Evaluating this FD against both definitions (Crucially noting $A$ is prime, satisfying 3NF but failing BCNF because $C$ is not a superkey).
8. **Comparative Logic**: Synthesizing the evaluations to select the specific combination (3NF and not BCNF).
