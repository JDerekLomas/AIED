ELEMENTS: 
1. Recalling the definition of logical entailment ($\Sigma \models X \to Y$) in functional dependencies.
2. Understanding the syntax and properties of Armstrong’s Axioms (specifically Transitivity).
3. Applying the attribute closure algorithm ($A^+$) as a procedural step.
4. Holding the given set of dependencies $\Sigma$ in working memory.
5. Evaluating the logical path $A \to B$ and $B \to C$ to derive $A \to C$.
6. Comparing the derived dependency against the target statement to determine truth value.

ELEMENT COUNT: 6

ESTIMATE: 
While some students struggle with formal notation, this specific problem is a "textbook" application of the Transitivity Rule ($A \to B$ and $B \to C \implies A \to C$), which is the most intuitive of Armstrong's Axioms. Even students who haven't mastered closures can often identify the chain logically.
