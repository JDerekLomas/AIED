ELEMENTS: 
1. **Definition recall**: Criteria for what constitutes an "Entity Type" vs. an "Attribute" or "Relationship".
2. **Text Analysis**: Processing the domain description of 'Fitness class' (attributes: name, start date, end date, time slot).
3. **Text Analysis**: Processing the description of 'Fitness centre' (identified as the context/database container, not a repeating record).
4. **Text Analysis**: Processing 'Trainers’ speciality' (described as a multi-valued property of trainers).
5. **Text Analysis**: Processing 'Equipment ID' (described as a unique identifier for equipment).
6. **Logical evaluation of cardinality**: Mapping 'member-participates-in-class' to determine if 'class' is a discrete object.
7. **Constraint evaluation**: Comparing 'Fitness class' against 'Equipment ID' to distinguish between an object and an attribute.
