ELEMENTS: 
1. **Definition recall**: Understanding what the logical implication symbol ($\vDash$) means in the context of Functional Dependencies (FDs).
2. **Armstrong's Axioms/Closure procedure**: Knowledge of the algorithm to compute the attribute closure ($D^+$).
3. **Step-by-Step execution**:
    - Start with $\{D\}$.
    - Apply $D \to ABC$ to get $\{A, B, C, D\}$.
4. **Subset verification**: Checking if the target attributes $\{A, C\}$ are a subset of the calculated closure $\{A, B, C, D\}$.
5. **Transitivity logic**: Mentally chaining $A \to B$ and $B \to C$ (though redundant here, students often process these to ensure the set is minimal).
6. **Distinction between Given and Derived**: Keeping track of what is in the original set $\Sigma$ versus what is being tested ($D \to AC$).
