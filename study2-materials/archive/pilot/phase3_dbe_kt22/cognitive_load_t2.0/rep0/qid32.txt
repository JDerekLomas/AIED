ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of the subset relation ($\subseteq$).
2. Definition of the Cartesian product ($\times$).
3. Calculating the set $B \times B$ from given set $B$ (yielding $\{ (a,a), (a,b), (b,a), (b,b) \}$).
4. Evaluating the types of elements (distinguishing between a primitive element 'a' and a tuple '(a,a)').
5. Recognition/filtering of distractor information (ignoring sets A, C, and D).
6. Logical evaluation of the membership vs. inclusion property (a set $B$ can only be a subset of another set if its elements are of the same type).

ELEMENT COUNT: 6
