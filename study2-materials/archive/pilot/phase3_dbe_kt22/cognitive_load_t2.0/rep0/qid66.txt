ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The specific definition of the "Entity Integrity Constraint" in relational database theory.
2. Concept distinction: Distinguishing between Entity Integrity (no nulls in PK) and Referential Integrity (foreign keys).
3. Primary Key structure: Understanding that a PK can be "composite" (comprising multiple attributes).
4. Logical evaluation of quantifiers: Mapping "None" versus "At least one" to the rule that applies to every individual attribute within a composite key.
5. SQL/Relational constraints: Recognizing how the `NOT NULL` property implicitly applies to all components of a primary key.
