ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall the definition of a "prime attribute" (an attribute that is part of at least one candidate key).
2. Recall the definition of a "candidate key" (a minimal superkey).
3. Evaluate Functional Dependency 1 ($A \to B$) to determine $A$'s role in potential keys.
4. Evaluate Functional Dependency 2 ($B \to C$) and Functional Dependency 3 ($C \to A$) to identify the transitive cycle.
5. Compute the closure of $\{A\}$ to check if it is a key: $A^+ = \{A, B, C\}$.
6. Compute the closure of $\{B\}$ to check if it is a key: $B^+ = \{B, C, A\}$.
7. Compute the closure of $\{C\}$ to check if it is a key: $C^+ = \{C, A, B\}$.
8. Verify minimality for each (none have smaller subsets).
9. Compare the set of all attributes in candidate keys $\{A, B, C\}$ against the set of attributes in the relation $R=\{A, B, C\}$.

ELEMENT COUNT: 9

While the concept of candidate keys is fundamental, the requirement to verify *all* possible candidate keys in a cycle and map them to the definition of "prime" requires high element coordination. Given the variety in student backgrounds, many might correctly identify one key (e.g., $A$) but fail to verify that $B$ and $C$ are also keys, though the cyclic nature of this specific problem assists those with better intuition.
