ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of Candidate Key (CK) and Superkey.
2. Definition recall of 3NF (Prime vs. Non-prime attributes, transitive dependencies).
3. Definition recall of BCNF (Determinant must be a superkey).
4. Procedural step: Determining the closures of attribute sets (e.g., $(AB)^+$, $(BC)^+$).
5. Procedural step: Identifying all Candidate Keys ($AB$ and $BC$).
6. Distinction: Identifying Prime attributes ($A, B, C$) vs. Non-prime attributes ($D$).
7. Evaluation of FD1 ($AB \to CD$): Checking if $AB$ is a superkey (Satisfies BCNF/3NF).
8. Evaluation of FD2 ($BC \to A$): Checking if $BC$ is a superkey (Satisfies BCNF/3NF).
9. Logical synthesis: Recognizing that $BC \to A$ involves a prime attribute on the RHS, which satisfies 3NF even if $BC$ were not a superkey, whereas BCNF is more restrictive.
10. Final comparison: Matching findings to the provided multiple-choice combinations.
