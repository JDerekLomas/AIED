ELEMENTS: 
1. SQL Syntax Recall: Identifying `SELECT COUNT(*)` as an aggregate function.
2. Conceptual Definition: Distinguishing that `COUNT(*)` counts tuples/rows rather than attributes/columns.
3. Logical Mapping: Linking the keyword `FROM person` to the specific table object mentioned in the options.
4. Evaluation of Distractors: Differentiating between the action of a basic `SELECT *` (Option A) and the specific aggregate result (Option B vs C).
