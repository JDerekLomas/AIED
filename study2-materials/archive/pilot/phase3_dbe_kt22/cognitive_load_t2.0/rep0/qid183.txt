ELEMENTS: 
1. Concept recall: Definition and mechanism of SQL Injection (SQLi).
2. Concept recall: Purpose and implementation of "input sanitization/constraint."
3. Distinction: Distinguishing between the *scope* of an attack (privilege levels) and the *prevention* of an attack.
4. Logical evaluation: Identifying the falsity of removing user privileges as a preventative measure for SQLi (as a functional database requires some level of privilege to operate).
5. Negation handling: Evaluating the "Which... are NOT correct" framing (negative phrasing).
6. Multiple-choice logic: Evaluating the "None of the above" catch-all relative to statements A, B, and C.
