ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall: The formal definition of equivalence between sets of Functional Dependencies (FDs).
2. SQL/Logical Syntax: Interpretation of the FD arrow notation ($\rightarrow$).
3. Property Recall: Knowledge of Armstrong's Axioms (specifically Transitivity).
4. Procedural Step (Σ1): Determining the closure of $A$ under $\Sigma_1$ to see if it derives $C$ ($A \rightarrow B$ and $B \rightarrow C$ implies $A \rightarrow C$).
5. Procedural Step (Σ2): Determining the closure of $A$ and $B$ under $\Sigma_2$ to check for the presence of $A \rightarrow B$.
6. Evaluation: Identifying the missing dependency ($A \rightarrow B$) in the closure of $\Sigma_2$ and its impact on the equivalence.
7. Constraint: Maintaining the distinction between "one-way implication" (is $\Sigma_1 \subseteq \Sigma_2^+$?) versus "equivalence" ($\Sigma_1 \equiv \Sigma_2$).
