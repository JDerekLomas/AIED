ELEMENTS:
1. SQL Privilege Syntax: Understanding the structure and meaning of GRANT/REVOKE statements.
2. Owner Privileges: Recognising that Linda, as the owner, holds all original permissions.
3. WITH GRANT OPTION: Tracking that this modifier allows Amy to delegate privileges further.
4. Redundancy (Dual-source privileges): Managing the fact that Peter receives the same privilege from two different actors (Linda and Amy).
5. The CASCADE Semantic: Understanding that revoking from a grantor automatically triggers the revocation of privileges they delegated.
6. Privilege Independent Chains: Evaluating whether Peter's privilege from Linda remains intact regardless of the revocation from Amy.
7. Step-by-step state tracking: Maintaining the mental state of the "privilege graph" through three sequential transformations.
