ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of logical implication ($\Sigma1 \models \Sigma2$) in functional dependencies (FDs).
2. Knowledge of the transitivity rule in Armstrong's Axioms ($A \to B$ and $B \to C \implies A \to C$).
3. Definition of a closure ($X^+$) or the specific closure of individual attributes under $\Sigma1$.
4. Comparison step: Checking if all dependencies in $\Sigma2$ are members of $\Sigma1^+$.
5. Syntax of FD notation ($X \to Y$).
6. Distinguishing between $\Sigma1 \models \Sigma2$ and the reverse, $\Sigma2 \models \Sigma1$.
