ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Recalling what a SQL injection attack is and how it occurs (concatenation of untrusted input).
2. Code analysis: Distinguishing between static strings (B), hard-coded variables (C), and user-provided input/external requests (A).
3. Syntax interpretation: Understanding how single quotes and the plus operator function to build a query string in the provided pseudocode/JavaScript-style syntax.
4. Logical evaluation: Identifying which snippet allows an end-user to manipulate the logic of the SQL statement.
5. Comparative mapping: Matching the conceptual vulnerability (dynamic string building) to the specific lines of code in the options.
