ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall definition of a Candidate Key (CK): must be a superkey and minimal.
2. Recall definition of an attribute closure ($X^+$).
3. Compute the closure of $\{A\}$ using functional dependencies (FDs) $\Sigma$: $\{A\} \to \{A, B, C, D\}$.
4. Identify $\{A\}$ as a valid Candidate Key.
5. Identify potential alternative keys by looking at the RHS of FDs (specifically the role of $CD$ and $B$).
6. Evaluate the second FD: $\{CD\} \to \{A, B\}$.
7. Compute the closure of $\{CD\}$: $\{CD\} \to \{C, D, A, B\}$.
8. Compare $\{CD\}$ and $\{A\}$ to the definition of "only" in the prompt.
9. Distinguish between a Primary Key (often singular) and Candidate Keys (multiple possible).
