ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of set difference (A - B vs. B - A).
2. Logical condition evaluation for equality (Set A must equal Set B for A - B = B - A to be true, unless both are empty).
3. Comparing elements across sets for option A (calculating {1} vs {4}).
4. Comparing elements across sets for option B (calculating {} vs {4}).
5. Comparing elements across sets for option C (recognizing identity despite order).
6. Comparing elements across sets for option D (calculating {6} vs {}).
7. Identifying that set order does not matter in set theory.
