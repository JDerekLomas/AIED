ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall definition of a Candidate Key (CK): must be a superkey and minimal.
2. Recall the property of an attribute closure ($X^+$).
3. Recognize the "cyclic" nature of the Functional Dependencies (FDs) ($A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow A$).
4. Procedure: Compute the closure of $A$ ($A^+ = \{A, B, C\}$) to verify it is a superkey.
5. Procedure: Compute the closure of $B$ ($B^+ = \{B, C, A\}$) to check for alternative keys.
6. Procedure: Compute the closure of $C$ ($C^+ = \{C, A, B\}$) to check for alternative keys.
7. Logic: Compare the results of the closures to evaluate the truth of the word "only."
8. Distinguish between a Primary Key (often unique) and Candidate Keys (multiple can exist).
