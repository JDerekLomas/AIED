As a university instructor, I would evaluate this specific problem as follows:

This question involves **Functional Dependency (FD) theory** and the concept of **Equivalent Sets of Dependencies**. While it looks simple, it requires a high degree of "intrinsic cognitive load" because students cannot evaluate the elements in isolation; they must interact them to verify mutual entailment ($\Sigma_1 \models \Sigma_2$ and $\Sigma_2 \models \Sigma_1$).

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **Recall of Equivalence Definition:** Knowledge that $\Sigma_1 \equiv \Sigma_2$ if and only if $\Sigma_1^+ = \Sigma_2^+$ (or each FD in one can be derived from the other).
2.  **Constraint Analysis ($\Sigma_1$):** Holding $\{A \to B, AB \to C\}$ in memory.
3.  **Constraint Analysis ($\Sigma_2$):** Holding $\{A \to B, B \to C\}$ in memory.
4.  **Logical Deduction (Augmentation/Transitivity):** Recognizing that in $\Sigma_1$, since $A \to B$, then $A \to AB$ (augmentation), and combined with $AB \to C$, implies $A \to C$.
5.  **Logical Deduction (Transitivity):** Recognizing that in $\Sigma_2$, $A \to B$ and $B \to C$ implies $A \to C$.
6.  **Comparative Verification (Direction A):** Checking if $B \to C$ (from $\Sigma_2$) can be derived from $\Sigma_1$ (it cannot; $B^+$ in $\Sigma_1$ is just $\{B\}$).
7.  **Distinction between $A$ and $B$ as determinants:** Keeping track of which attributes are on the left-hand side of each dependency across both sets simultaneously.

**ELEMENT COUNT: 7**

**Pedagogical Note:** Undergraduate students often make the "transitivity trap" error. They see that both sets imply $A \to C$ and $A \to B$, and hastily conclude they are equivalent, forgetting to check if $B \to C$ can be derived from the first set. Given the diversity of a South African CS cohort—where some excel at formal logic and others struggle with abstract notation—this "trick" usually catches about half the class.
