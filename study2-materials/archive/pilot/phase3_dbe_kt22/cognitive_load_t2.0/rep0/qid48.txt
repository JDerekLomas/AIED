ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall of a **candidate key** (minimality and uniqueness).
2. Definition recall of a **superkey** (uniqueness only).
3. Logic of **subset/superset relationships**: recognizing that any superset of a key satisfies the uniqueness constraint.
4. Distinguishing between **"must be"** and **"could be"** (logical necessity vs. possibility).
5. Evaluation of Option A: Checking if a proper superset retains "minimality" (it does not).
6. Evaluation of Option B: Checking if adding an attribute to a candidate key satisfies the superkey definition (it does).
7. Evaluation of Option C: Checking if a proper subset of a candidate key can be assumed to be a superkey (it cannot, by definition of minimality).
