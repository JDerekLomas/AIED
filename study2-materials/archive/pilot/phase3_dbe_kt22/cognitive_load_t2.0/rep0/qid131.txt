ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of the Lossless Join property (intersection must be a key for at least one resulting relation).
2. Definition recall of the Dependency Preservation property (union of local dependencies' closures must cover the original set).
3. Logical evaluation of the Intersection: $R_1 \cap R_2 = \{A\}$.
4. Constraint check: Is $\{A\}$ a key for $R_1$? (Applying $A \to B$ shows it is).
5. Constraint check: Is $\{A\}$ a key for $R_2$? (Applying $A \to C$ shows it is).
6. Dependency analysis for $R_1$: Functional dependency $A \to B$ is preserved.
7. Dependency analysis for $R_2$: Functional dependency $A \to C$ is preserved.
8. Distinguishing/Transitive mapping: Evaluation of the missing dependency $B \to C$ and whether it is implied by the projections $(B \to C$ cannot be checked in $R_1$ or $R_2$ directly, nor is it implied by the local $F^+$; however, $B \to C$ is lost because neither relation contains both B and C).
9. Comparative mapping: Matching the outcome of these logical tests against the four multiple-choice combinations.
