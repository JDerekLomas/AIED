ELEMENTS: 
1. Recalling the definition of logical entailment ($\Sigma \models X \to Y$) in the context of Functional Dependencies.
2. Understanding the Syntax of Armstrong's Axioms (specifically the Transitive Rule).
3. Applying the attribute closure algorithm ($A^+$) to the given set $\Sigma$.
4. Evaluating the first dependency ($A \to B$).
5. Evaluating the second dependency ($B \to C$).
6. Maintaining the logical chain ($A \to B$ and $B \to C$ implies $A \to C$) in working memory while ignoring the distractor ($D \to ABC$).

At a South African university, this is a foundational "easy" question in normalization theory. Students with weak backgrounds may struggle with the notation ($\Sigma \models$), but most will recognize the Transitive Rule intuitively. The correct answer rate is typically high because even without formal closure steps, the logic is linear.
