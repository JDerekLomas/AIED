ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall of ER diagram components (rectangles, ellipses, underlining).
2. Definition of a Primary Key (uniqueness and identification).
3. Mapping the Primary Key concept to its visual representation in an ER diagram (underlined attribute).
4. Definition of a Foreign Key (relationship between tables).
5. Evaluation of whether Foreign Keys are explicitly represented as attributes/constraints in standard Chen or Crow's Foot ER diagrams (usually they are implied by relationships, not marked as "FK").
6. Definition of a Domain constraint (data types, ranges).
7. Evaluation of whether Domain constraints (e.g., "Age > 18") are typically captured in a standard ER visual syntax.
