ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of the subset symbol (⊆).
2. Definition recall of the Cartesian product symbol (x).
3. Computing the elements of the Cartesian product $B \times B$ (ordered pairs $(a,a), (a,b)$, etc.).
4. Recognizing the ontological difference between a primitive element (e.g., $a$) and an ordered pair (e.g., $(a, a)$).
5. Distinguishing between set membership ($\in$) and subset ($\subseteq$) relationships.
6. Processing distractor information (Sets A, C, and D are irrelevant to the core logic).
