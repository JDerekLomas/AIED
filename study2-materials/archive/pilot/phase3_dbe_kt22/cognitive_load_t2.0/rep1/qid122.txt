ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Functional Dependency (FD) logical equivalence ($\Sigma1 \equiv \Sigma2$).
2. Definition recall: Criteria for a "Minimal Cover" (Canonical Cover), specifically the "Minimal Set" property.
3. Logical evaluation: Determining if $\Sigma1 \implies \Sigma2$ (Testing if $A \to C$ is derived from $\{A \to B, AB \to C\}$).
4. Logical evaluation: Determining if $\Sigma2 \implies \Sigma1$ (Testing if $AB \to C$ is derived from $\{A \to B, A \to C\}$).
5. Procedural knowledge: Attribute Closure algorithm (specifically $A^+$ under $\Sigma1$).
6. Constraint satisfaction: Identifying redundant dependencies or extraneous attributes (specifically checking if $AB \to C$ can be reduced to $A \to C$).
7. Distinction: Recognizing that even if the sets are equivalent, $\Sigma1$ is not minimal while $\Sigma2$ is.
