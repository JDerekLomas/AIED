ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of a candidate key (uniqueness and minimality).
2. Definition of a superkey (uniqueness property).
3. Logical relationship between candidate keys and superkeys (subset/superset relationship).
4. Evaluating Option A: Applying the minimality constraint (falsifying the claim).
5. Evaluating Option B: Applying the uniqueness property of {a, b} to its superset {a, b, c}.
6. Evaluating Option C: Testing the minimality/reducibility of {a, b}.
