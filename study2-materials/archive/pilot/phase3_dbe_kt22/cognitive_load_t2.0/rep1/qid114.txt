ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall the definition of a Super Key (SK) (a set of attributes whose closure contains all attributes of the relation).
2. Identification of the target attribute set (D) and the full relation schema (R={A,B,C,D}).
3. Understanding and applying the attribute closure algorithm (starting with D+ = {D}).
4. Evaluation of Functional Dependency (FD) 1: D→ABC (Check if D is a subset of the current closure; update closure to {D,A,B,C}).
5. Evaluation of FD 2: A→B (redundant in this specific path but requires check).
6. Evaluation of FD 3: B→C (redundant in this specific path but requires check).
7. Comparison of the final closure {A,B,C,D} against the schema R to verify if they are equal.
8. Distinguishing between a Super Key (SK) and a Candidate Key (CK) to ensure no additional minimality constraints are incorrectly applied.
