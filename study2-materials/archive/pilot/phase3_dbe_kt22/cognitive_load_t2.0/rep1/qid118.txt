ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The semantic entailment symbol ($\models$) and what it means for one set of functional dependencies to logically imply another.
2. Conceptual distinction: Understanding the direction of the implication (does $\Sigma_2$ cover all dependencies in $\Sigma_1$).
3. Closure computation (Procedure): Applying Armstrong's Axioms or the attribute closure algorithm ($A^+$ under $\Sigma_2$).
4. Logical evaluation: Checking if $A \rightarrow B$ can be derived from $\{A \rightarrow C, B \rightarrow C\}$.
5. Relational schema constraints: Keeping the attributes of $R=\{A, B, C\}$ in mind while evaluating the mapping.
6. SQL/Relational Logic mapping: Translating formal notation into functional dependency rules.
