ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of a Trivial Functional Dependency (Recall that $\alpha \to \beta$ is trivial if $\beta \subseteq \alpha$).
2. Concept of set inclusion (Subset vs. Superset relationships).
3. Symbolic notation parsing (Understanding that concatenation represents a set of attributes).
4. Logic evaluation of Option A (Is $\{X, Y, Z\}$ a subset of $\{X, Y\}$? No).
5. Logic evaluation of Option B (Is $\{Y, Z\}$ a subset of $\{X\}$? No).
6. Logic evaluation of Option C (Is $\{Z\}$ a subset of $\{X, Y, Z\}$? Yes).
7. Logic evaluation of Option D (Is $\{X\}$ a subset of $\{Y, Z\}$? No).
8. Comparative elimination (Determining which single option satisfies the rule).
