ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall of BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) properties.
2. Definition recall of 3NF (Third Normal Form) properties.
3. Concept of "Dependency Preservation" and its technical definition.
4. Evaluation of the logical quantifier "always" vs "cannot" for BCNF (knowing BCNF is lossy with respect to dependencies in specific cases).
5. Evaluation of the logical quantifier "always" for 3NF (recalling the existence of an algorithm that guarantees preservation).
6. Distinguishing between "lossless join" (which both have) and "dependency preservation" (which only 3NF guarantees).
