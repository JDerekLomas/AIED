ELEMENTS:
1. Recall of the definition of a Cartesian Product ($A \times B$).
2. Parsing the rule that the first element of each tuple belongs to Set $A$.
3. Parsing the rule that the second element of each tuple belongs to Set $B$.
4. Extracting elements of Set $A$ from given samples $\{2, 3, 4\}$.
5. Extracting elements of Set $B$ from given samples $\{5, 7\}$.
6. Verifying the size constraint ($|A| \times |B| = 3 \times 2 = 6$) matches the problem statement.
7. Systematic generation (or matching) of all 6 combinations to evaluate the options.
