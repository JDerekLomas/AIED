As an instructor, I evaluate this question as having relatively low element interactivity because it primarily tests **definitional recognition** rather than the application of rules to a complex scenario (like writing a join query or normalization).

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **Definition Recall (DAC):** Remembering that Discretionary Access Control is centered on "ownership" rather than centralized policy (MAC) or roles (RBAC).
2.  **Concept Distinction:** Distinguishing between the role of a Database Administrator (DBA) versus a private Object Owner in the context of DAC.
3.  **Logical Evaluation (Statement A):** Assessing the validity of the "no owner" constraint (which contradicts the DAC principle that everything is created/owned by someone).
4.  **Logical Evaluation (Statement B/C):** Evaluating the power of the DBA versus the discretionary power of the individual owner.
5.  **Logical Evaluation (Statement D):** Identifying the core mechanism of DAC—that ownership grants the right to manage privileges.

**ELEMENT COUNT:** 5

**Estimated proportion answering correctly:**
The difficulty here for South African undergraduates often lies in the nuanced difference between Option C and D. Students often assume the DBA has "god-mode" over all privileges (a common misconception in practical settings like MySQL), whereas formal DAC theory emphasizes the owner's discretion. Stronger students will identify the keyword "owner" in Option D.

Your estimate:
0.72
