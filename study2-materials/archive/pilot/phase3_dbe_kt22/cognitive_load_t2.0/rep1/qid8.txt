ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall of the Cartesian Product (A × B) as a set of ordered pairs $(a, b)$.
2. The structural rule that the first element of each pair belongs to set A.
3. The structural rule that the second element of each pair belongs to set B.
4. Logical mapping: extracting the unique values from the first positions $\{p, q\}$.
5. Logical mapping: extracting the unique values from the second positions $\{x, y\}$.
6. Order sensitivity (distinguishing between A × B and B × A) to evaluate option D.
