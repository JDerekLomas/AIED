ELEMENTS: 
1. Recalling the formal definition of "attribute closure" ($X^+$).
2. Recalling the specific syntax of functional dependencies ($\alpha \to \beta$).
3. Holding the starting set $\{A\}$ in working memory.
4. Scanning the set $\Sigma$ to identify applicable FDs (matching the LHS to the current closure set).
5. Executing the transitive property step 1: $A \to B$ (Result: $\{A, B\}$).
6. Executing the transitive property step 2: $B \to C$ (Result: $\{A, B, C\}$).
7. Evaluating and rejecting $D \to ABC$ because the LHS ($D$) is not in the current set $\{A, B, C\}$.
8. Checking for the convergence criterion (no more FDs can be applied).
9. Comparing the final derived set against the multiple-choice distractors.
