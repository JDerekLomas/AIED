ELEMENTS:
1. SQL Syntax Knowledge: Understanding that `FROM TableA, TableB` without an explicit JOIN keyword results in a Cartesian product (Cross Join) before filtering.
2. Table Relationship Mapping: Identifying the join condition `Course.CourseNo = Enrol.CourseNo` and how it links specific rows.
3. Logical Filtering (Year): Applying the constraint `Year = 2018` across the dataset.
4. Logical Filtering (Join Condition): Evaluating the equality condition for every combination generated by the cross join.
5. Mental Execution/Row Counting: Maintaining a running total of matches while iterating through rows of the (implicit) Enrol and Course tables.
6. Schematic Retrieval: Recalling the provided data entries from the specific tables (which are referenced but not visible in the prompt, implying the student must reference an external diagram/table).
