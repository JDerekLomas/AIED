ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of the `GRANT` command functionality and scope.
2. Understanding of the SQL access control hierarchy (system vs. schema vs. object vs. column level).
3. Distinguishing between "A specified attribute" (Column-level privileges, which are supported).
4. Distinguishing between "An entire relation" (Table-level privileges, which are supported).
5. Evaluation of "A specified tuple" against SQL standard constraints (SQL does not support row-level/tuple-level security via the `GRANT` command; this requires VPC/RLS or Views).
6. Logical negation: Identifying which element is *not* compatible with the command.
