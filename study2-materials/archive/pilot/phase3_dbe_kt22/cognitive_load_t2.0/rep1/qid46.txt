ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall of a **superkey** (a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple).
2. Definition recall of a **candidate key** (a minimal superkey).
3. Logic of **set supersets**: understanding that if $\{a, b\}$ satisfies the uniqueness property, any superset (like $\{a, b, c\}$) must also satisfy it.
4. Logical evaluation of Option A: recognizing it contradicts the property of supersets.
5. Distinction between **minimal** and **non-minimal**: recognizing that a superset of a superkey cannot be a candidate key because it is not minimal (Option B).
6. Definition recall of a **primary key** and its specific selection criteria (Option C).
