ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall of the definition of the Two-Phase Locking (2PL) protocol (Growing vs. Shrinking phase).
2. Rule application for the Shrinking phase: the specific constraint that once a lock is released, no new locks can be acquired (Option A).
3. Rule application for transaction completion: the permissibility of releasing all locks at commit time, as seen in Strict or Rigorous 2PL variants (Option B).
4. Distinguishing 2PL from "Conservative 2PL" or Pre-declaration: evaluating if acquiring all locks at the start is a requirement or a possibility within the protocol (Option C).
5. Logic integration: evaluating the validity of individual statements to determine if "All of the above" applies.
