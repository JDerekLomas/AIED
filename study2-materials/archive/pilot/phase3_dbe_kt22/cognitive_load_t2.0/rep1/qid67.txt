ELEMENTS: 
1. SQL Syntax recognition: Identifying the PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY keywords.
2. Definition recall: Recalling the concept of "referential integrity" (as opposed to entity integrity or domain constraints).
3. Table Relationship Mapping: Recognizing that 'Enrol' is the child/referencing table and 'Student' is the parent/referenced table.
4. Logical evaluation of Constraint direction: Determining whether the dependency flows from Enrol to Student or Student to Enrol.
5. Distinction between Integrity Types: Distinguishing between a Foreign Key requirement (Choice A) and a Primary Key/NOT NULL requirement (Choices C and D).
6. Disconfirmation of set relationships: Evaluating if every record in a parent table must exist in a child table (Choice B).
