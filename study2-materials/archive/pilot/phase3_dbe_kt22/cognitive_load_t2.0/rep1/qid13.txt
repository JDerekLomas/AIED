ELEMENTS: 
1. Recalling the definition of set difference (A - D): understanding it includes elements in A not in D.
2. Executing the operation A - D: comparing {2,3,4,5} with {8,9,10,11} and maintaining the intermediate result {2,3,4,5}.
3. Recalling the definition of set difference (B - C): understanding it includes elements in B not in C.
4. Executing the operation B - C: comparing {4,5,6,7} with {6,7,8,9} and maintaining the intermediate result {4,5}.
5. Recalling the definition of intersection (∩): understanding it seeks common elements.
6. Executing the final operation: comparing intermediate results {2,3,4,5} and {4,5} to find commonality.
