ELEMENTS:
1. Ownership rules (Implicitly, the owner has the `GRANT` privilege and is the root of the privilege tree).
2. `GRANT ... WITH GRANT OPTION` syntax and semantics (enabling the receiver to pass on the privilege).
3. The chain of authorization/lineage (Linda → Amy → Peter).
4. Dual-grant logic (Recognizing that Peter received the privilege from two distinct sources: Linda and Amy).
5. `REVOKE ... CASCADE` mechanics (Understanding that revoking from a parent removes permissions from those granted by that parent).
6. State-tracking (Monitoring the status of permissions for two distinct subjects across three sequential steps).
7. Identifying the "independent path" (Recognizing that Linda's direct grant to Peter remains unaffected by the revocation of Amy).
