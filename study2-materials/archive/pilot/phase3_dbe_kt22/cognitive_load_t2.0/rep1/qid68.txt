In evaluating this question for an undergraduate South African CS cohort, we must consider that while the query is simple, it is technically an "underspecified" or "abstract" problem unless a specific instance of the `Study` table is provided. Assuming the students are provided with a visual schema or sample data (common in CS101-style database modules), the cognitive load is very low.

**ELEMENTS:** 
1. **SQL Keyword Recognition**: Recognizing that `SELECT` and `FROM` define the scope of the operation.
2. **Column Projection**: Understanding that `StudentID` and `Name` determine width, but the question asks for rows (height).
3. **Cardinality Concepts**: Mapping the rows of a source table (`Study`) directly to the result set in the absence of a `WHERE` or `LIMIT` clause.
4. **Distinction between Schema and Instance**: Realizing the number of rows is independent of the columns selected.

**ELEMENT COUNT: 4**

Regarding the success rate: This is a fundamental "Stage 1" knowledge check. In a typical South African cohort, even those struggling with complex joins usually grasp the direct relationship between table records and unfiltered `SELECT` results early on. However, if the sample table is not visually adjacent to the question, "search and find" errors occur.
