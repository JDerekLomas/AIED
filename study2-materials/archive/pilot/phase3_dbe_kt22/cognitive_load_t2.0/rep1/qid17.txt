ELEMENTS: 
1. Recalling the definition of the intersection operator (∩).
2. Processing the intersection of A and C ({2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} ∩ {3,5,7,9} = {3,5,7,9}).
3. Recalling the definition of the subset/proper subset operator (⊂).
4. Evaluating the membership of elements in set B ({3,5,7}) against the resulting set from step 2.
5. Identifying that B is indeed a subset of the result ({3,5,7} ⊂ {3,5,7,9}).
6. Interpreting the "not a subset" (⊄) negation symbol.
7. Comparing the logical outcome (it is a subset) with the statement (it is NOT a subset) to determine the truth value.
