ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall of the "Cartesian product" concept (all possible ordered pairs).

3. Mapping of the specific set members {1, 2} and {a, b} to the definition.
4. Evaluation of option A (detecting the outlier 'b,b').
5. Evaluation of option B (detecting internal pairing).
6. Evaluation of option C (confirming all valid combinations exist).
7. Evaluation of option D (detecting reversed order/A×B vs B×A).
