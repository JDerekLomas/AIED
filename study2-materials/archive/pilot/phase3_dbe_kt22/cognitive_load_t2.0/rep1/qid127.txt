ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall the definition of a "prime attribute" (an attribute that is part of at least one candidate key).
2. Understand the notation of functional dependencies (FDs) in the set Σ.
3. Compute the closure of attribute {A} to determine if it is a candidate key.
4. Compute the closure of attribute {B} to determine if it is a candidate key.
5. Compute the closure of attribute {C} to determine if it is a candidate key.
6. Identify if any other combinations (composite keys) are necessary to check.
7. Synthesize the findings to check if all three attributes belong to the set of discovered keys.
8. Evaluate the logical truth value of the statement "A, B, and C are all prime" based on those findings.

ELEMENT COUNT: 8

The correct answer is True (A is a key, B is a key, C is a key, thus all are prime). While the FD set is a simple cycle, students often struggle with the definition of "prime" versus "primary" or stop after finding only one key. In a South African undergraduate context with mixed backgrounds, many will intuitively grasp the cycle, but a significant portion will guess or confuse the definitions.
