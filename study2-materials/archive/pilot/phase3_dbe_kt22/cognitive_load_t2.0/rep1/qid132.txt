ELEMENTS: 
1. **Schema structure awareness**: Recognizing the attributes in R and their distribution into R1 and R2.
2. **Functional Dependency (FD) recall**: Understanding the definitions and implications of A→B, B→C, and A→C.
3. **Lossless Join Property definition**: Recalling the condition that $R1 \cap R2$ must functionally determine either $R1$ or $R2$ (i.e., $B \to \{A, B\}$ or $B \to \{B, C\}$).
4. **Inter-dependency evaluation**: Testing the intersection $\{B\}$ against the provided set $\Sigma$ (determining that $B \to C$ exists).
5. **Dependency Preservation definition**: Recalling that $(\Sigma_1 \cup \Sigma_2)^+ = \Sigma^+$ (the projection of FDs onto schemas).
6. **FD Projection**: Determining $\Sigma_1$ ($A \to B$) and $\Sigma_2$ ($B \to C$) and checking if $A \to C$ is still implied via transitivity.
7. **Synthesis**: Simultaneously holding the results of both tests (Lossless = True, Preserving = True) to select Option A from the distractor list.
