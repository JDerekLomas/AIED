ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall: The concept of "concurrent transactions" (multiple database operations occurring simultaneously).
2. Logical evaluation of Option A: Understanding "throughput" (number of tasks per time unit) and how overlapping execution increases it.
3. Logical evaluation of Option B: Understanding "response time" (latency) and how shorter tasks aren't stuck behind long-running tasks (head-of-line blocking).
4. Logical evaluation of Option C: Understanding "utilization" (CPU and I/O resource usage) and how idle cycles are minimized when one transaction waits for I/O.
5. Integration/Synthesis: Recognizing that all three benefits are the standard theoretical justifications for concurrency.
