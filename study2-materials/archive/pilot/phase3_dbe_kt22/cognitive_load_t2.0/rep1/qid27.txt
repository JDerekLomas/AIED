1. Spatial mapping of shaded regions to set components (visual decoding).
2. Set operator definitions (Union vs. Intersection vs. Difference).

4. Identification of the Intersection (A ∩ C) and its relationship to the shaded region.
5. Evaluating logical negation (subtracting set B from the resulting set).
6. Comparison of distractors (distinguishing why option A represents the visual whole while D introduces unnecessary exclusions).
