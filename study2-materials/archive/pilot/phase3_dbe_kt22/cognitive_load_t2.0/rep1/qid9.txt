ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of Set Difference (Recall: A - B means elements in A that are not in B).
2. Evaluation of Set A members ({2, 3, 4, 5}).
3. Evaluation of Set B members ({4, 5, 6, 7}).
4. Comparison of elements (Checking 2, 3, 4, and 5 against the contents of B to identify overlaps).
5. Application of the exclusion rule (Removing {4, 5} from the initial set A).
6. Pattern recognition/Distinction (Ensuring elements unique to B, like {6, 7}, are not included in the result).
