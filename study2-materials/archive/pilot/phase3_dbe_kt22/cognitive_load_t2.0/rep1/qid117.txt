ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of the entailment operator (Σ1 ⊨ Σ2 means Σ2 is a subset of Σ1+).
2. SQL syntax/logic vs. Relational Theory notation (distinguishing Σ and → symbols).
3. The Transitivity rule of Functional Dependencies (FDs).
4. Procedural step: Testing if A → C is in Σ1+ (Applying A → B and B → C).
5. Procedural step: Testing if B → C is in Σ1+ (Direct look-up).
6. Evaluating logical equivalence (since all FDs in Σ2 are derivable from Σ1, the entailment holds).
