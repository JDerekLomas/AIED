ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall of Candidate Key (CK) definition (uniqueness and minimality).
2. Recall of the Closure algorithm procedure (attribute closure).
3. Logic of functional dependencies (interpreting A→B and AB→C).
4. Computing A+ (Closure of A): Must hold A, then add B, then evaluate if {A,B} allows C.
5. Evaluating if A+ contains all attributes in R {A,B,C}.
6. Determining if other potential CKs exist (e.g., checking if {A} is minimal or if subsets of A work, though A is a singleton).
7. Distinction between Superkeys and Candidate Keys to confirm if A is the "only" one.
