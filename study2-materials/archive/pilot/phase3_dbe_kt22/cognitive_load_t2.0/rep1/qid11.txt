ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The concept of the Union ($\cup$) operator in set theory (combining sets while removing duplicates).
2. Logical procedure: The step-by-step process of evaluating nested parentheses $(A \cup B)$ before combining with $C$.
3. Data tracking (Set A & B): Holding the elements {2, 3, 4, 5} and {4, 5, 6, 7} in memory to perform the first union.
4. Redundancy filtering: Identifying and removing overlapping elements {4, 5} to form the intermediate set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.
5. Data tracking (Intermediate Set & Set C): Holding the intermediate result and the elements of Set C {6, 7, 8, 9}.
6. Pattern matching: Comparing the final calculated set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} against the multiple-choice distractors to identify Option B.
