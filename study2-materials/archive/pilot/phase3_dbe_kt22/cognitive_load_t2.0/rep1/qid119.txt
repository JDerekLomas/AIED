To evaluate whether two sets of functional dependencies ($\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$) are equivalent, a student must determine if $\Sigma_1^+ = \Sigma_2^+$. This requires checking if $\Sigma_1 \models \Sigma_2$ and if $\Sigma_2 \models \Sigma_1$ using closure algorithms.

ELEMENTS: 
1. **Definition recall**: Understanding that equivalence means each set of dependencies must logically imply the other.
2. **Attribute Closure Algorithm**: Knowing the steps to compute $X^+$ for a given set of dependencies.
3. **Logic evaluation (Σ1 ⊧ Σ2)**: Testing if $A \to B$ and $B \to C$ can be derived from $\Sigma_1$. 
4. **Logic evaluation (Σ2 ⊧ Σ1)**: Testing if $A \to B$ and $AB \to C$ can be derived from $\Sigma_2$.
5. **Transitivity rule**: Recognizing that in $\Sigma_2$, $\{A \to B, B \to C\} \implies A \to C$.
6. **Augmentation/Simplification**: Recognizing that $A \to C$ implies $AB \to C$ in $\Sigma_1$ analysis.
7. **Set comparison**: Maintaining the status of both implication checks simultaneously to arrive at the final True/False conclusion.
