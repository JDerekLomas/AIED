ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of DCL (Data Control Language) verbs: Distinguishing between GRANT and REVOKE for removing privileges.
2. Conceptual distinction: Understanding the "Cascade" vs. "Restrict" behavior in the context of transitive privileges.
3. Syntax recognition: Identifying whether the modifier (RESTRICT/CASCADE) belongs to the GRANT or REVOKE statement.
4. Logical mapping: Matching the specific goal ("avoid cascading") to the corresponding SQL keyword.
5. Evaluating distractors: Discarding non-standard SQL syntax like "no cascade" or "no restrict" which may appear plausible to a novice.
