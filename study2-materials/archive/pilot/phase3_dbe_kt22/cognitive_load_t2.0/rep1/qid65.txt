ELEMENTS:
1. SQL command syntax (`CREATE TABLE` keyword structure).
2. Data type mapping (translating "STRING" to specific SQL types like `VARCHAR`).
3. Attribute-delimiter rules (recognizing the difference between a comma and a semicolon in a list).
4. Statement termination rules (recognizing the required trailing semicolon vs. a trailing comma).
5. Pattern matching (holding the target schema in mind to ensure all three columns are present in each option).
6. Syntax distinctions (differentiating between very similar visual strings where the only difference is one or two punctuation marks).

ELEMENT_COUNT: 6
