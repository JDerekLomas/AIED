ELEMENTS: 
1. Recalling the formal definition of "attribute closure" ($X^+$).
2. Processing the functional dependencies (FDs) in $\Sigma$.
3. Starting the iterative algorithm: Initializing the set $\{D\}$.
4. Evaluating the FD $D \rightarrow ABC$: Checking if the LHS ($D$) is a subset of the current result set.
5. Performing the union operation: $\{D\} \cup \{A, B, C\}$ to get $\{A, B, C, D\}$.
6. Checking remaining FDs ($A \rightarrow B$ and $B \rightarrow C$) for further expansion.
7. Termination logic: Recognizing the closure includes all attributes in $R$.
