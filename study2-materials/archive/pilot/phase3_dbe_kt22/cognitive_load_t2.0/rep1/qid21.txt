ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of Cartesian Product ($S \times T$): Recalling that it involves creating all possible ordered pairs $(s, t)$.
2. Definition of Set Difference ($-$): Recalling that it involves removing elements of the second set from the first.
3. Execution of $(S \times T)$: Calculating/holding the 6 pairs in $\{(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\}$.
4. Execution of $(S \times S)$: Calculating/holding the 4 pairs in $\{(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\}$.
5. Pattern Matching/Logical Evaluation: Simultaneously comparing the elements of the second set against the first to identify which elements remain.
6. Distinguishing notation: Ensuring $(S \times S)$ is not confused with $(S \times T)$ or $(T \times S)$ during the subtraction process.
