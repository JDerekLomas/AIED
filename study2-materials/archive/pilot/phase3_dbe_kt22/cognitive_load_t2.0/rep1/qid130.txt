ELEMENTS: 
1. **Schema and Dependency Interpretation:** Identifying attributes and the Functional Dependency (FD) set.
2. **Lossless Join Condition:** Recalling the rule that the intersection $R1 \cap R2$ must functionally determine $(R1 - R2)$ or $(R2 - R1)$.
3. **Lossless Join Evaluation:** Performing the intersection $\{B\}$ and checking if $B \to \{A\}$ or $B \to \{C\}$ in the closure $\Sigma^+$.
4. **Dependency Preservation Condition:** Recalling that all original FDs must be inferable from the union of projected dependencies.
5. **Dependency Preservation Evaluation:** Verifying $A \to B$ is in $R1$ and $B \to C$ is in $R2$.
6. **Multi-condition Mapping:** Synthesizing the results of both tests to select the correct boolean combination (A, B, C, or D).
