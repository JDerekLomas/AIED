ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form).
2. Definition of 3NF (Third Normal Form).
3. The hierarchy of normal forms (BCNF is stronger/stricter than 3NF).
4. The concept of functional dependency vs. redundancy.
5. Evaluating "less restrictive" vs "more restrictive" (logical distinction).
6. Evaluating "eliminate" vs "minimize" regarding the specific capabilities/guarantees of BCNF (knowing that while it handles functional dependency redundancy, it may not eliminate all redundancy, e.g., multi-valued dependencies).
