ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of the Cartesian Product (A x A): Understanding that it results in a set of ordered pairs.
2. Construction of ordered pairs for (A x A): Forming {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}.
3. Construction of ordered pairs for (C x C): Forming a larger set of 9 pairs.
4. Definition of the Subset relationship (⊆): Understanding that every element in the first set must exist in the second.
5. Membership verification: Mentally checking if each pair from A x A is present in C x C (logical comparison).
6. Distinguishing relevant from irrelevant data: Recognizing that sets B and D are distractors not needed for the calculation.
