ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall of the definition of a "dirty read" (reading uncommitted data).
2. Recall of the definition of an "unrepeatable read" (row values changing during a transaction).
3. Recall of the definition of a "phantom read" (new rows appearing during a transaction).
4. Knowledge of the SQL standard isolation level hierarchy.
5. Evaluation of "Read committed" against the constraint: inhibits dirty reads.
6. Evaluation of "Read committed" against the constraint: permits unrepeatable reads.
7. Evaluation of "Read committed" against the constraint: permits phantom reads.
8. Distinguishing "Read committed" from "Read uncommitted" (which allows dirty reads) and "Repeatable read" (which prevents unrepeatable reads).
