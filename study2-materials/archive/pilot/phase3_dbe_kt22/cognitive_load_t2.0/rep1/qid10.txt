ELEMENTS: 
1. Recalling the definition of the set intersection operator (∩) as the set of common elements.
2. Mentally comparing sets A and B to identify overlapping elements ({4, 5}).
3. Recalling the definition of the set difference operator (-) as elements in the first set not present in the second.
4. Holding the temporary result of (A ∩ B) in working memory.
5. Performing the subtraction A - {4, 5} by filtering out those elements from the original set A.
6. Identifying the final resulting set {2, 3}.
7. Mapping the calculated result to the correct multiple-choice option (A).
8. Distinguishing between noise data (Sets C and D) and the relevant information (Sets A and B).
