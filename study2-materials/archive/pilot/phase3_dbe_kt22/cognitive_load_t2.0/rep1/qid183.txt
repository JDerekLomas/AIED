ELEMENTS: 
1. Concept recall: Definition and mechanism of SQL injection (concatenation of unsanitized input).
2. Distinction: The difference between "limiting" privileges (Least Privilege principle) and "removing" privileges (which renders the application non-functional).
3. Logic evaluation: Identifying "not correct" (negation) in a multiple-choice format.
4. Concept recall: Understanding the relationship between the application's service account and the database permissions.
5. Distinction: The difference between mitigating an attack's impact (Least Privilege) vs. preventing the vulnerability entirely (parameterized queries).
6. Evaluating "None of the above" as a logical exhaustive check of all preceding statements.
