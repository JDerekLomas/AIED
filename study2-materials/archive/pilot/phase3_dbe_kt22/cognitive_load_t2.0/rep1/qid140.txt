ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The criteria for Third Normal Form (3NF).
2. Definition recall: The criteria for Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF).
3. Relational comparison: Evaluating the hierarchical relationship between 3NF and BCNF (is one a subset of the other?).
4. Definition of redundancy: Understanding what constitutes redundancy in a relational context.
5. Conceptual distinction: Differentiating between "minimising" versus "eliminating" anomalies/redundancy within the specific theoretical constraints of 3NF (especially regarding transitive dependencies vs. functional dependencies where the determinant is not a superkey).
6. Logical evaluation: Mapping the three provided statements against the retrieved definitions to identify the single correct proposition.
