In evaluating this question for undergraduate students, we must consider the mental load required to bridge set theory notation with the relational foundations of database systems.

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **Notation Decoding:** Recalling that $A \times B$ represents a Cartesian product (the set of all ordered pairs).
2.  **Cartesian Expansion (Set 1):** Mentally constructing or computing the elements of $A \times A$ $\{(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\}$.
3.  **Cartesian Expansion (Set 2):** Mentally constructing or computing the elements of $A \times C$ $\{(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\}$.
4.  **Subset Definition:** Recalling the rule for $X \subseteq Y$ (every element in $X$ must be present in $Y$).
5.  **Comparative Evaluation:** Simultaneously holding both sets in memory to verify if all pairs in the first set exist in the second set.
6.  **Logical Evaluation:** Determining the final boolean value based on the inclusion test.

**ELEMENT COUNT: 6**

**Pedagogical Note:** While the mathematics is relatively foundational, South African undergraduate cohorts often feature a "bimodal" distribution. Students with strong backgrounds in Discrete Mathematics will find this trivial (automaticity), while those struggling with the transition to formal logic and set theory (often found in students with weaker foundational schooling) will find the element interactivity high as they must manually compute each pair rather than recognizing the property that if $A \subseteq C$, then $A \times A \subseteq A \times C$.
