ELEMENTS: 
1. Recalling the definition and operation of the Set Union (∪) operator.
2. Recalling the definition and operation of the Set Intersection (∩) operator.
3. Managing operator precedence (performing the operation inside the parentheses first).
4. Mentally constructing the intermediate set (A ∪ B = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}).
5. Comparing each element of the intermediate set against Set C to identify commonalities.
6. Filtering out elements from Sets A, B, and C that are not part of the final intersection.
7. Distinguishing between the final result and plausible distractors (like B ∩ C or (A ∩ B) ∪ C).
