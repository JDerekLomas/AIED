ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall of the set difference operation (relative complement).
2. The logic of the commutative property requirement ($A - B = B - A$).
3. Computation of $A - B$ for the given sets (identifying elements in A not in B).
4. Computation of $B - A$ for the given sets (identifying elements in B not in A).
5. Comparing the two resulting sets for equality.
6. Identifying that $A - B = B - A$ only occurs if $A = B$ (or both are empty).
7. Evaluation of four distinct multiple-choice options.
