ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of a Superkey: Recalling that a superkey is any set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple.
2. Inclusion Property (Monotonicity): Understanding that if a set $S$ is a superkey, any superset of $S$ is also a superkey.
3. Logical Implication: Evaluating the relationship between $\{a, b\}$ and its superset $\{a, b, c\}$.
4. Distinguishing Concepts: Differentiating between a "superkey" (minimal or not) and a "candidate key" (which must be minimal).
5. Schema Context: Recognizing the notation $R(a,b,c)$ defines the universe of available attributes.
