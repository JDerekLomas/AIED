ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of set membership (recognizing elements in A, B, and C).
2. Definition of the Union (∪) operator (combining A and C while handling duplicates).
3. Result of the union operation (Set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}).
4. Definition of the Proper Subset (⊂) operator (all elements must be in the target set, and sets cannot be equal).
5. Definition of Set B ({3, 5, 7}).
6. Logical comparison between the resultant set and Set B (checking if {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} is a proper subset of {3, 5, 7}).
7. Boolean evaluation (determining if the relationship is True or False).
