ELEMENTS: 
1. **Identification of Candidate Keys**: Analyzing the closure of attributes based on $\Sigma$ to determine all possible keys ($\{A\}$ and $\{BC\}$).
2. **Definition of Prime Attributes**: Identifying $\{A, B, C\}$ as prime attributes (attributes belonging to at least one candidate key).
3. **Evaluation of 3NF Criteria**: Checking if for every $X \to Y$, $X$ is a superkey OR $Y$ is a prime attribute. 
4. **Evaluation of BCNF Criteria**: Checking if for every $X \to Y$, $X$ is a superkey.
5. **Logic Application (BC→ A)**: Specifically evaluating the functional dependency $BC \to A$ where the determinant $\{B, C\}$ is a candidate key (making it BCNF-compliant).
6. **Logic Application (A→ BC)**: Specifically evaluating the functional dependency $A \to BC$ where the determinant $\{A\}$ is a candidate key (making it BCNF-compliant).
7. **Constraint Integration**: Comparing the status of the relation against the four logical combinations (A, B, C, D) provided in the options.
