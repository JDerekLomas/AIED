ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Lossless Join property (R1 ∩ R2 → R1 or R1 ∩ R2 → R2).
2. Definition recall: Dependency Preservation property (Σ = (F1 ∪ F2)+).
3. Set intersection identification: Determining R1 ∩ R2 = {A}.
4. Functional Dependency (FD) evaluation: Checking if A → B or A → C exists in Σ.
5. FD mapping: Identifying which original dependencies map to R1 (A→B) and R2 (A→C).
6. Missing FD detection: Recognizing that B→C is not contained within either individual schema but must be checked for inferability from the union of projected dependencies.
7. Boolean logic application: Synthesizing the results of both tests to select the correct multiple-choice option.
