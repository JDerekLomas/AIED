ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The conceptual definition of an "Exclusive (X) Lock."
2. Conceptual distinction: Differentiating between Shared (S) locks and Exclusive (X) locks.
3. Mapping operations to permissions: Understanding that "Write" operations inherently require/imply the ability to read the data being modified.
4. Distinguishing operation types: Evaluating whether "Update" (Option D) is a sub-type of "Write" or a separate category in the context of the given options.
5. Evaluation of logic: Synthesizing that "Exclusive" means total control (both Read and Write access) over the data item.
