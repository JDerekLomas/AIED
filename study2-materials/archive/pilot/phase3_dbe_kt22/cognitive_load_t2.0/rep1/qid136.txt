ELEMENTS: 
1. **Definition recall: Functional Dependency (FD)** - Recognizing the meaning of $A \rightarrow B$ and $B \rightarrow C$.
2. **Procedural step: Determining the Candidate Key** - Computing the closure $\{A\}^+$ to identify that $A$ is the unique candidate key.
3. **Definition recall: Prime vs. Non-prime attributes** - Identifying $A$ as prime and $\{B, C\}$ as non-prime.
4. **Definition recall: 3NF criteria** - Checking if for every $X \rightarrow Y$, $X$ is a superkey OR $Y$ is a prime attribute (evaluation of the transitive dependency $A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C$).
5. **Definition recall: BCNF criteria** - Checking if for every $X \rightarrow Y$, $X$ is a superkey (strict requirement).
6. **Logical evaluation: Transitive Dependency** - Recognizing that $B \rightarrow C$ violates both 3NF (since $B$ is not a superkey and $C$ is not prime) and BCNF.
7. **Distinction between concepts** - Simultaneous comparison of the relation against both 3NF and BCNF requirements to select the correct paired option.
