ELEMENTS: 
1. **Definition recall**: Recall of the concept of logical implication ($\Sigma \models X \to Y$) in the context of functional dependencies.
2. **Procedure knowledge**: Knowing the Armstrong's Axioms or the Attribute Closure algorithm.
3. **Set of FDs ($\Sigma$)**: Holding the specific dependencies ($A\to B, B\to C, D\to ABC$) in memory.
4. **Logical Transitivity**: Evaluating the chain $A \to B \to C$ to infer $A \to C$.
5. **Decomposition Rule**: Recognizing that if $D \to ABC$, then $D$ must also functionally determine any subset ($D \to A$ and $D \to C$).
6. **Comparison/Synthesis**: Comparing the target dependency $D \to AC$ against the inferred set of dependencies or the result of $D^+$ to reach a verdict.
