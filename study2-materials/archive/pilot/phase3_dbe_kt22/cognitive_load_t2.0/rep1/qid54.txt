ELEMENTS: 
1. **SQL Keyword Recall**: Distinguishing between `DROP` (schema modification) and `DELETE` (tuple removal).
2. **Command Syntax Structure**: Recalling the specific mandatory keywords and order for `ALTER TABLE` statements.
3. **Keyword-Object Association**: Identifying that `COLUMN` is the specific keyword associated with attribute removal in the standard `ALTER` clause.
4. **Relational Algebra to SQL Mapping**: Understanding that "Attribute A from Relation R" translates to "Column A from Table R".
5. **Syntax Discrimination**: Evaluating four similar-looking permutations to identify the one that conforms to standard SQL grammar (specifically the requirement for the `DROP COLUMN` phrase in most dialects like PostgreSQL or MySQL).
