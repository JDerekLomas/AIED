ELEMENTS: 
1. **Candidate Key Identification**: Applying the closure algorithm to determine that AB is a candidate key.
2. **Superkey Recognition**: Identifying if the LHS of each FD is a superkey (Required for BCNF).
3. **Prime Attribute Identification**: Identifying all attributes that are part of any candidate key (Finding {A, B} vs. {C, D}).
4. **Alternative Key Discovery**: Testing if other combinations (like BC) form keys due to the FD C→A.
5. **BCNF Definition Application**: Checking if "A" in C→A is a superkey (it is not).
6. **3NF Definition Application**: Checking the two-part condition for C→A: Is C a superkey? (No) Is A a prime attribute? (Yes).
7. **Logical Integration**: Comparing the status of the two specific FDs against two distinct normalization thresholds simultaneously to select the correct pair of boolean values.
