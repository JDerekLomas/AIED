ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of a Cartesian product (set of ordered pairs).
2. Rule for Subset relation (all elements of set 1 must exist in set 2).
3. Mapping values of A x B: {(1,a), (1,b), (2,a), (2,b)}.
4. Mapping values of C x D: {(1,a), (1,b), (1,c), (2,a), (2,b), (2,c), (3,a), (3,b), (3,c)}.
5. Evaluation of logical containment: verifying if each pair in the first mental list exists in the second mental list.
