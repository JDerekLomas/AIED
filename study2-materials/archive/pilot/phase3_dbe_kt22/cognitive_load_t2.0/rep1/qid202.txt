ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall of the definition for "correctness criterion" specifically within the context of transaction management.
2. Recognition and recall of the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to distinguish their individual roles.
3. Distinction between a "property" of a single transaction vs. a "criterion" for the schedule of interleaved (concurrent) transactions.
4. Identification of "Serializability" as the formal benchmark for correctness in concurrency control.
5. Evaluation of "All of the above" as a distractor by testing the necessity of each property specifically for the *concurrency* aspect of correctness.
