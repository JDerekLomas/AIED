ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall of definition: Minimal Cover (equivalence of closure and no redundant dependencies).
2. SQL-adjacent Logic: Logical equivalence/entailment of functional dependency sets.
3. Transitive property application (A -> B, B -> C implies A -> C).
4. Reflexive property application (logic of A -> B and B -> C vs AB -> C).
5. Evaluation of Σ1 |= Σ2: Checking if A->B and B->C can be derived from {A->B, AB->C}.
6. Evaluation of Σ2 |= Σ1: Checking if A->B and AB->C can be derived from {A->B, B->C}.
7. Syntactic constraint: Identification of the extraneous attribute 'B' in the LHS of AB -> C given A -> B.
