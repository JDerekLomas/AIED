ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The formal definition of Boye-Codd Normal Form (BCNF).
2. Definition recall: The formal definition of Third Normal Form (3NF).
3. Distinctions between similar concepts: Differentiating between the "X is a superkey" condition and the "A is a prime attribute" condition.
4. Logical conditions to evaluate: Identifying which condition applies to which normal form across multiple permutations (matching X to 3NF/BCNF vs A to 3NF/BCNF).
5. Definition recall: Meaning of "non-trivial FD" and "prime attribute" (needed to parse the choices correctly).
6. Comparison/Elimination: Holding the truth values of A, B, and D in memory to verify C as the only correct statement.
