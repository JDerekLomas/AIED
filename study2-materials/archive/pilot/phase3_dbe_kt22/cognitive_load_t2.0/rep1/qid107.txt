As a university instructor, I have evaluated this question based on its cognitive load and element interactivity. Despite the lengthy "word problem" narrative, the question focuses on a very narrow task: identifying the key attribute of a specific entity within a complex scenario.

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **Recall of Definition (Entity vs. Attribute):** Understanding that an entity represents a category (Administrator) and attributes are its properties.
2.  **Recall of Definition (Key Attribute):** Identifying that a key attribute must be unique and non-null for every instance of the entity.
3.  **Parsing/Filtering Scoped Information:** Filtering the large paragraph to find the specific sentence related to "employees" (the parent class of Administrators).
4.  **Logical Mapping (Inheritance/Generalization):** Recognizing that "Administrator" is a sub-category of "Employee" and therefore inherits the "unique ID" attribute defined at the beginning of the text.
5.  **Distinction/Exclusion:** Evaluating if the specific administrator attribute (Landline) is unique (it is not explicitly stated as such, whereas the ID is explicitly called "unique").

**ELEMENT COUNT:** 5

**TEACHING CONTEXT REFLECTION:**
South African undergraduate cohorts often struggle with "extraneous load"—the ability to filter a long English narrative to find a single logical constraint. Stronger students will immediately scan for the word "unique" or "ID." Weaker students often get "lost in the story" and may mistakenly select "Landline" simply because it is mentioned specifically in the same sentence as "Administrator." However, since the answer "ID" is a classic convention in database pedagogy, many will guess it correctly even if they don't fully parse the inheritance logic.

**ESTIMATED SUCCESS RATE:**
Given the presence of the word "unique" next to "ID" in the first sentence, I expect a high success rate, though the length of the text will intimidate a small portion of the class.
