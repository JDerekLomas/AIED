ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall of set union (A ∪ B) 
2. Execution of the union operation (combining elements of A and B while removing duplicates)
3. Definition recall of the "proper subset" symbol (⊂)
4. Recognition of the relationship between a set and its union with another set
5. Logical evaluation of the membership of B's elements {3,5,7} within the resulting set A {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
6. Evaluation of the "proper" constraint (is B smaller than/not equal to the union?)

ELEMENT COUNT: 6
