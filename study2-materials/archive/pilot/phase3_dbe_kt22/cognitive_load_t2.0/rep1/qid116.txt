ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of equivalence for functional dependency sets (mutual entailment).
2. Logical inference via transitivity (A → B and B → C implies A → C).
3. Concept of "covering" (Does Σ1 cover Σ2 and vice versa?).
4. Application of Armstrong’s Axioms to Σ1 to test if Σ2 is satisfied.
5. Application of Armstrong’s Axioms to Σ2 to test if Σ1 is satisfied (specifically testing if B can derive A or A can derive B in Σ2).
6. Distinguishing between subset relationships and total equivalence.
