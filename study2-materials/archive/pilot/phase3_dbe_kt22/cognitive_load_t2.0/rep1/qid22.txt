ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of set intersection ($\cap$): Understanding that elements in $A \cap B$ must exist in both sets.
2. Property of inclusion: Recognizing that if $\{2, 3\} \subseteq B$, then set $B$ must contain at least those specific elements.
3. Set cardinality (counting): Calculating that the number of elements (size) of $B$ must be $\geq$ the count of elements in the intersection.
4. Logical evaluation: Testing the provided options (1, 2, 3, 4) against the derived constraint $|B| \geq 2$.
5. Syntax/Notation: Correct interpretation of set braces and intersection symbol.
