ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall the definition of a Super Key (SK) (attribute(s) whose closure includes all attributes in R).
2. Knowledge of attribute closure algorithm (functional dependency expansion).
3. Identify starting set: {A}.
4. Evaluate FD $A \to B$: include $B$ in closure ($A, B$).
5. Evaluate FD $B \to C$: include $C$ in closure ($A, B, C$).
6. Evaluate FD $D \to ABC$: check if LHS $D$ is in the current set $\{A, B, C\}$ (logical evaluation: it is not).
7. Final set comparison: compare $\{A, B, C\}$ against $\{A, B, C, D\}$ to determine if $D$ is missing.
8. Boolean mapping: since $D$ is missing, $\{A, B, C, D\} \neq \{A, B, C\}$, therefore False.
