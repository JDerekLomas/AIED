ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall of definition: What constitutes a Candidate Key (CK) (uniqueness and minimality).
2. Synthesis rule (Attribute Closure): Knowing the procedural steps to find the closure of a set of attributes.
3. Logical Evaluation (Set 1): Computing $A^+$ using $\Sigma$ to verify if it covers $\{A,B,C,D\}$.
4. Distinction/Scanning: Identifying other possible determinants in $\Sigma$ (checking $CD$).
5. Logical Evaluation (Set 2): Computing $CD^+$ using $\Sigma$ to determine if it is also a CK.
6. Minimality check: Verifying if any subset of $\{C,D\}$ (i.e., $C$ or $D$) is a key.
7. Comparison: Evaluating the truth value of the word "only" in the statement against the findings.
