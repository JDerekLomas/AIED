In evaluating this question, we must consider that it is a "category mistake" problem disguised as a set theory problem. It tests the foundational logic required for Relational Algebra.

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **Set Member Definition:** Distinguishing between an individual element (e.g., $1$) and an ordered pair (e.g., $(1, a)$).
2.  **Cartesian Product ($\times$) Procedure:** Recalling that $A \times B$ results in a set of ordered pairs.
3.  **Subset ($\subseteq$) Definition:** Recalling that every element of the first set must be present in the second set.
4.  **Data Type Mapping:** Comparing the "type" of elements in $A$ (integers) vs. the "type" in $A \times B$ (tuples).
5.  **Distractor Management:** Ignoring the irrelevant sets $C$ and $D$.
6.  **Logical Evaluation:** Synthesizing the above to realize a set of integers cannot be a subset of a set of pairs.

**ELEMENT COUNT:** 6

**Pedagogical Note:** Students often struggle with this early in the semester because they focus on the "values" (seeing $1$ and $2$ in both sets) rather than the "structure" (scalar vs. tuple). In a South African context where discrete math foundations vary, many students rely on visual intuition rather than formal definitions, leading them to see the "1" and "2" in both places and select "True."
