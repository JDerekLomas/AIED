ELEMENTS: 
1. **Schema identification**: Mapping sets $R1$ and $R2$ to the universal set $R$.
2. **Lossless Join property definition**: Recalling the requirement that $R1 \cap R2$ must functionally determine either $R1$ or $R2$ (the common attribute must be a superkey of at least one relation).
3. **Intersection calculation**: Identifying that $R1 \cap R2 = \{B\}$.
4. **Dependency recall/lookup**: Identifying the set of given dependencies $\Sigma = \{A \to B, B \to C\}$.
5. **Key evaluation (Lossless)**: Checking if $B \to \{A, B\}$ or $B \to \{B, C\}$ holds in $\Sigma$ (confirming $B \to C$ makes it lossless).
6. **Dependency Preservation property definition**: Recalling the requirement that the union of dependencies enforced on individual projections $(F1 \cup F2)^+ = F^+$.
7. **Projection of dependencies**: Determining that $A \to B$ is in $R1$ and $B \to C$ is in $R2$.
8. **Logical synthesis**: Combining the evaluation of both properties to choose between the four multiple-choice options.
