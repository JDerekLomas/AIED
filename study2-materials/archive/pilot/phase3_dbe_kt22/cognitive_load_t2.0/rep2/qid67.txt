ELEMENTS: 
1. SQL Syntax recognition: Identifying the FOREIGN KEY and REFERENCES keywords.
2. Conceptual definition: Recalling the definition of Referential Integrity (specifically foreign keys).
3. Table Relationship Mapping: Identifying "Student" as the parent table and "Enrol" as the child table.
4. Logical Directionality: Evaluating the "One-to-Many" or "Child-to-Parent" constraint direction (Condition A vs Condition B).
5. Constraint Distinction: Distinguishing between a Foreign Key (Referential Integrity) and a Primary Key/NOT NULL (Entity Integrity) (Options C and D).
6. Variable Matching: Tracking that the column StudentID exists in both schemas but plays different roles.
