ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall the definition of the Subset relationship (⊆), which requires every element of the first set to be present in the second set.
2. Recall the definition of a Cartesian Product (x), specifically that elements of the resulting set are ordered pairs, not individual atoms.
3. Identify the nature of elements in set B (individual characters/atoms: {a, b}).
4. Compute or visualize elements of B x B (ordered pairs: {(a,a), (a,b), (b,a), (b,b)}).
5. Compare the types: Distinguish between an element (e.g., 'a') and an ordered pair (e.g., '(a,a)') to evaluate the subset condition.
6. Evaluate logical truth: Recognize that set B contains atoms while B x B contains pairs, making the subset relationship false.
7. Manage Distractors: Disregard sets A, C, and D, which are irrelevant to the specific boolean evaluation.
