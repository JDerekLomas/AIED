ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall and apply the Set Union operator ($\cup$) logic.
2. Maintain Set A and Set C in working memory to compute their union.
3. Form the intermediate set result: $\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
4. Recall and apply the Proper Subset operator ($\subset$) logic.
5. Retrieve Set B from the prompt for comparison.
6. Evaluate the logical relationship: whether the large intermediate set is a proper subset of the smaller Set B.
7. Understand the Boolean mapping (True/False) to the final result of the logical evaluation.
