ELEMENTS: 
1. **Definition recall of Logical Entailment ($\Sigma \vDash X \to Y$):** Understanding that the dependency must hold in every relation instance that satisfies $\Sigma$.
2. **Procedure (Armstrong’s Axioms/Closure Algorithm):** Knowing the steps to compute the attribute closure ($D^+$).
3. **Set-theoretic check (Initial step):** Starting the closure with the determinant, $D^{(0)} = \{D\}$.
4. **Logical Evaluation (FD 1):** Checking if $A \to B$ can be applied to $\{D\}$ (result: No).
5. **Logical Evaluation (FD 2):** Checking if $B \to C$ can be applied to $\{D\}$ (result: No).
6. **Logical Evaluation (FD 3):** Checking if $D \to ABC$ can be applied to $\{D\}$ (result: Yes, updates closure to $\{D, A, B, C\}$).
7. **Subset verification (Final step):** Comparing the target dependent $\{A, C\}$ against the calculated closure $\{A, B, C, D\}$.
8. **Syntax/Notation mapping:** Recognizing the notation $\Sigma \vDash$ and its relationship to the FD set and the candidate FD.
