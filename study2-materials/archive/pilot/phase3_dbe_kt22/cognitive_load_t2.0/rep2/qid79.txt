ELEMENTS:
1. SQL Syntax Knowledge: Understanding that `SELECT *` retrieves all columns.
2. Join Mechanism: Identifying the `INNER JOIN` logic (matching rows based on a common key).
3. Primary Key/Foreign Key relationship: Identifying `CourseNo` as the linking attribute.
4. Data Source Integration: Locating the specific tables (Course and Enrol) and their record counts (assuming students are provided with the table data/schemas which are missing from this prompt).
5. Mathematical Evaluation: Counting the total number of valid intersections/matches between the sets.
6. Filtering Logic: Recognizing that unmatched rows in either table are excluded from an inner join.
