ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall: Set Intersection (elements common to both sets).
2. Set element mapping: Identifying that {2, 3} must reside in B.
3. Logical constraint evaluation: If {2, 3} is in B, B must have at least 2 elements.
4. Set element mapping: Identifying that {1} must not be in B (otherwise 1 would be in the intersection).
5. Multiple-choice evaluation: Testing if set size "1" is mathematically possible given the intersection results.

ELEMENT COUNT: 5
