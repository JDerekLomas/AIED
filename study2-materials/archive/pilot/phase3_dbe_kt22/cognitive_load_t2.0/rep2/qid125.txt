ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall definition of a Candidate Key (uniqueness and minimality).
2. Recall definition of a Superkey.
3. Logical process of the Closure Algorithm ($A^+$).
4. Evaluate Functional Dependency 1: $A \to B$.
5. Evaluate Functional Dependency 2: $AB \to C$.
6. Mental computation of $A^+ = \{A, B, C\}$ (satisfying the superkey condition).
7. Evaluation of minimality (checking if any subset of $\{A\}$ is a key, which is trivial but a logical step).
8. Distinction between "a" Candidate Key and the "only" Candidate Key.
9. Verification of other potential attributes (e.g., checking if $B$ or $C$ are keys).
