ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of logical implication ($\models$) in functional dependencies (Σ1 implies Σ2 if Σ2's dependencies follow from Σ1's).
2. Transitivity rule of Armstrong’s Axioms ($A \to B$ and $B \to C \implies A \to C$).
3. Recall/Execution of the attribute closure algorithm ($A^+$ under Σ1).
4. Recall/Execution of the attribute closure algorithm ($B^+$ under Σ1).
5. Evaluation of $A \to C$ against Σ1 (determining if $C \in A^+$).
6. Evaluation of $B \to C$ against Σ1 (determining if $C \in B^+$).
7. Distinction between $\models$ (logical implication) and $\equiv$ (equivalence).
8. Syntax and structural comparison between set Σ1 and set Σ2.
