As an instructor, I would classify this as a "low interactivity" recall task. It assesses foundational vocabulary rather than procedural execution or logical synthesis.

ELEMENTS: 
1. **Definition Recall**: Remembering the specific function of the `SELECT` clause as defined in the SQL standard.
2. **SQL Keyword Distinction**: Distinguishing between Data Manipulation Language (DML) for retrieval (Select) vs. modification (Update, Delete) or Data Definition Language (Create).
3. **Syntax Mapping**: Associating the term "attributes" with column names returned in a query result set.

ELEMENT COUNT: 3

ESTIMATE:
At a South African university, even with varying backgrounds, this is introduced in the first lecture on SQL. Most students—including those with minimal prior exposure—tend to grasp the "Big Four" DML commands early on through labs and lecture slides.
