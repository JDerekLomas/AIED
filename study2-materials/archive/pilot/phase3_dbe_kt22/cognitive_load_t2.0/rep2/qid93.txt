ELEMENTS: 
1. **Definition recall**: Criteria for what constitutes an "Entity Type" vs. an "Attribute" or "Relationship" in ER modeling.
2. **Identification of candidates**: Evaluating "Fitness centre" (Singular organizational context/scope, not a set of instances).
3. **Identification of candidates**: Evaluating "Fitness class" (Multivalued object with attributes: name, start date, end date, time slot).
4. **Identification of candidates**: Evaluating "Trainers’ speciality" (Multivalued attribute or separate entity dependent on design pattern).
5. **Identification of candidates**: Evaluating "Equipment ID" (Unique identifier/attribute).
6. **Constraint processing**: Parsing the relationship rules (one-to-many/many-to-many) to see which noun functions as a primary object.
7. **Mapping entities to instances**: Filtering out the single instance (Fitness centre) from the collection of instances.

ELEMENT COUNT: 7
