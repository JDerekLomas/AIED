ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall of a "candidate key" (uniqueness and minimality).
2. Definition recall of a "superkey" (uniqueness, but not necessarily minimal).
3. Set theory logic: Understanding that any superset of a key maintains the uniqueness property.
4. Distinguishing between a candidate key and a superkey (eliminating option A based on the minimality requirement).
5. Evaluation of functional dependencies: Recognizing that {a,b} determines {c}, therefore {a,b,c} is a superset of the key.
6. Logical negation: Understanding that if {a,b} is minimal, then a proper subset like {a} cannot be assumed to be a superkey without more information (eliminating option C).
