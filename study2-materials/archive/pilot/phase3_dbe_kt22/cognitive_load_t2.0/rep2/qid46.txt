ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of a superkey (a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple).
2. Definition of a candidate key (a minimal superkey).
3. The "Superkey Closure" property (if K is a superkey, any superset of K is also a superkey).
4. Logical negation/Evaluation of Option A: Testing if adding an attribute 'c' violates superkey status.
5. Distinction between candidate and superkey for Option B: Identifying that a proper superset cannot be "minimal."
6. Primary key constraints for Option C: Recalling that "primary" is a designator for a candidate key, not an automatic status for any superkey.
