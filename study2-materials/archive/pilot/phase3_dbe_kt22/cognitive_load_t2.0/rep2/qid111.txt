ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall the definition of a Superkey (SK) (an attribute set whose closure contains all attributes in R).
2. SQL/Normalization notation rules (understanding the notation for the set of attributes R and Functional Dependencies Σ).
3. Procedural knowledge of the Attribute Closure Algorithm.
4. Identification of the target attribute (A) and its starting set {A}.
5. Application of FD 1: A → B (adds B to the set, resulting in {A, B}).
6. Application of FD 2: B → C (adds C to the set, resulting in {A, B, C}).
7. Evaluation of FD 3: D → ABC (recognizing it cannot be applied because D is not in the current set {A, B, C}).
8. Logical comparison: Check if the final closure {A, B, C} contains the full set R {A, B, C, D}.
9. Identification of the "missing" attribute (D) and the absence of any dependency pointing to D.
