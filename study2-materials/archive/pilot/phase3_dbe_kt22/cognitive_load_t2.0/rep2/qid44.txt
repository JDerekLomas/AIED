ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of a 'superkey' (distinguishing it from other key types).
2. Definition of 'attribute' vs 'tuple' (terminology recall).
3. The functional dependency relationship (attributes identify tuples, not vice versa).
4. The subset/superset relationship between superkeys and candidate keys (logical hierarchy).
5. The scope of uniqueness (within a relation vs. between relations).
6. Evaluating Option A (Checking constraints for validity).
7. Evaluating Option B (Identifying the category error of tuples identifying attributes).
8. Evaluating Option C (Recalling the minimality requirement for candidate keys).
9. Evaluating Option D (Clarifying the scope of identification).
