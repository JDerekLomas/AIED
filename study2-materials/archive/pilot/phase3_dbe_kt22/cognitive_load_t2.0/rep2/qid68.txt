In evaluating this question for an undergraduate cohort, we must consider that while the SQL syntax is basic, the student cannot answer without a visual or descriptive schema (which is implied to be present). If the table `Study` is provided in the prompt, the task is a simple cardinality count. If it is not, it becomes a test of "schema-agnostic" reasoning or a trick question.

Based on standard introductory database assessments:

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **SQL Keyword Recognition:** Recognizing `SELECT` and `FROM` define the scope.
2.  **Column Filtering (Projection):** Understanding that specific columns (`StudentID`, `Name`) do not change the number of rows.
3.  **Table Mapping:** Locating the `Study` table within the provided schema.
4.  **Row Counting:** Identifying that no `WHERE` clause exists, meaning all tuples are returned.
5.  **Cardinality Observation:** Physically counting the entries in the table data.

**ELEMENT COUNT:** 5

**ESTIMATE:** This is a low-interactivity "knowledge" or "comprehension" level question (Bloom’s Taxonomy). The primary risk for South African students with varied backgrounds is overthinking the "Projection" (columns) and confusing it with "Selection" (rows). However, the absence of a `WHERE` clause makes it a fundamental test of the SQL mental model.
