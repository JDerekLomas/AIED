ELEMENTS: 
1. Recalling the formal definition of "Attribute Closure".
2. Syntactical parsing of the schema R and the functional dependency set Σ.
3. Logical evaluation of the first dependency (A → B): checking if 'A' is in the current set and appending 'B'.
4. Logical evaluation of the second dependency (B → C): checking if 'B' is now in the set and appending 'C'.
5. Logical evaluation of the third dependency (D → ABC): checking if 'D' is in the set (and determining it is not).
6. Procedural iteration: maintaining the state of the accumulating set {A, B, C} in working memory until no more dependencies apply.
7. Constraint matching: Comparing the final calculated set {A, B, C} against the provided multiple-choice distractors.
