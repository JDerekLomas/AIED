ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Boycee-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) requirements and properties.
2. Definition recall: Third Normal Form (3NF) requirements and properties.
3. Distinction: Dependency preservation vs. Lossless join properties.
4. Logical evaluation: The existence of "uniqueness" in schema decomposition (knowing that multiple valid decompositions usually exist).
5. Fact retrieval: The trade-off theorem (the 3NF synthesis algorithm vs. the BCNF decomposition algorithm).
6. Fact retrieval: Identifying that BCNF does not guarantee dependency preservation.
