ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of Cartesian Product ($S \times T$): Recalling that it involves creating all possible ordered pairs $(s, t)$.
2. Definition of Cartesian Product ($S \times S$): Recognizing the same operation applied to the set $S$ with itself.
3. Calculating $S \times T$: Generating the specific set $\{(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\}$.
4. Calculating $S \times S$: Generating the specific set $\{(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\}$.
5. Definition of Set Difference ($-$): Recalling that it removes elements present in the second set from the first.
6. Execution of Set Difference: Comparing the generated sets and identifying which tuples remain after subtraction.
7. Result Verification: Comparing the calculated result $\{(1,3), (2,3)\}$ against the provided options.
