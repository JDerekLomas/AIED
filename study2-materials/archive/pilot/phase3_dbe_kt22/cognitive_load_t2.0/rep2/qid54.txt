ELEMENTS: 
1. **SQL Keyword Knowledge**: Recalling the specific DDL command `ALTER TABLE`.
2. **Schema vs. Data Distinction**: Differentiating between `DELETE` (DML for rows) and `DROP` (DDL for columns).
3. **Table Reference Rules**: Knowing that the table identifier `R` must immediately follow the `ALTER TABLE` clause.
4. **Column Specification Syntax**: Recalling that the `DROP` keyword is often followed by the optional/required keyword `COLUMN` depending on the dialect, but specifically must precede the attribute name `A`.
5. **Logic Elimination**: Evaluating the distractors that swap the positions of `R` and `A` or use incorrect prepositional phrases (e.g., `FROM`).
