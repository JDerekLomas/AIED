In this context, the question tests theoretical understanding of the normalization hierarchy. Because the options are mutually exclusive and rely on a singular subset/superset relationship, the element interactivity is relatively low compared to a question requiring the execution of a multi-step normalization procedure.

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **Definition Recall:** Memory of the formal requirements for Third Normal Form (3NF).
2.  **Definition Recall:** Memory of the formal requirements for Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF).
3.  **Logical Hierarchy Relationship:** Recalling that BCNF is a stricter version of 3NF (every relation in BCNF is, by definition, also in 3NF).
4.  **Directional Logic:** Evaluating "If P, then Q" versus "If Q, then P" to determine which condition implies the other.
5.  **Distinction Mapping:** Distinguishing between the subset/superset relationship to eliminate "cannot be" distractors (C and D).

**ELEMENT COUNT: 5**

While the hierarchy is a fundamental concept, students with minimal prior exposure often confuse the direction of the implication (thinking 3NF, being the "lower" number, is the subset) or fail to distinguish between the two when dependencies are not present to illustrate the difference. At a South African university with varying backgrounds, the "A" students will find this trivial, while the bottom quartile will struggle with the logical directionality.

**Your estimate:**
