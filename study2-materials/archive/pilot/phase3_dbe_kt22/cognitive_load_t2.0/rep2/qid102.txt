As an instructor, I would classify this as a **high interactivity** problem hidden within a specific question. While the final answer depends on a single relationship, the student must perform a "filtering" task to isolate relevant variables from a dense narrative.

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **Entity Identification:** Distinguishing between the 'Member' entity and the 'Fitness Class' entity.
2.  **Relationship Mapping:** Locating the specific "participate" relationship amidst several others (maintain, instruct, register, add).
3.  **Semantic Rule Extraction:** Finding the specific rule: "*Each fitness class is attended by one or more members*."
4.  **Concept Definition Recall:** Recalling the definition of "Total" participation (every instance of the entity must exist in the relationship) vs. "Partial".
5.  **Logic Mapping:** Translating "one or more members" (minimum cardinality ≥ 1) into the structural constraint of "Total participation."
6.  **Distractor Filtering:** Deliberately ignoring irrelevant constraints like date ranges, equipment status, or employee subtypes while holding the primary question in mind.

**ELEMENT COUNT:** 6

**Proportion Estimations:** 
South African undergraduate cohorts often struggle with "word problems" where they must extract formal logic from English prose. While the definition of Total participation is entry-level, many students will focus on the 'Member' side of the relationship (where participation is partial) or get lost in the extraneous details about trainers and administrators.
