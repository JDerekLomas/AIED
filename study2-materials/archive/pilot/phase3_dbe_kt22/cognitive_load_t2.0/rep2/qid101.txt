ELEMENTS: 
1. **Definition Recall**: Recalling the definition of "participation constraint" (Total vs. Partial).
2. **Entity Identification**: Locating the specific entity "Member" within the text.
3. **Relationship Mapping**: Locating the specific relationship "participate" and its link to the entity "Fitness Class".
4. **Keyword Extraction/Logical Parsing**: Identifying the modal verb phrase "may choose to" in the sentence "A member may choose to participate in one or more fitness classes."
5. **Logic Mapping**: Determining that "may choose to" implies the existence of a member who participates in zero classes.
6. **Constraint Application**: Linking the possibility of zero participation (optionality) to the concept of "Partial" participation.
7. **Noise Filtering**: Identifying and ignoring a large volume of irrelevant distractors (Employee subtypes, Equipment status, Maintenance schedules, Associate members, Administrators).
