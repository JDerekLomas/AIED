ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall: Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) requirements and properties.
2. Definition recall: Third Normal Form (3NF) requirements and properties.
3. Conceptual knowledge: Dependency Preservation (the ability to enforce functional dependencies within individual tables of a decomposition).
4. Relational mapping: Associating the property of "always dependency-preserving" with 3NF synthesis algorithms.
5. Relational mapping: Associating the property that BCNF decomposition is "lossless-join but not necessarily dependency-preserving" with its algorithm.
6. Logical negation: Evaluating the distinction between "always" and "cannot be" for each form (identifying that BCNF can be preserving in some cases, but isn't guaranteed).
