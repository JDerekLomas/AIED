ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall the definition of a "prime attribute" (an attribute that is part of at least one candidate key).
2. Recall the definition of a "candidate key" (a minimal superkey).
3. Evaluate the closure of {A} using the given FDs (A+ = {A, B, C}) to identify it as a key.
4. Evaluate the closure of {B} using the given FDs (B+ = {B, C, A}) to identify it as a key.
5. Evaluate the closure of {C} using the given FDs (C+ = {C, A, B}) to identify it as a key.
6. Compare the set of attributes in all identified candidate keys ({A}, {B}, {C}) against the set {A, B, C}.
7. Map the resulting logical conclusion to the True/False selection.
