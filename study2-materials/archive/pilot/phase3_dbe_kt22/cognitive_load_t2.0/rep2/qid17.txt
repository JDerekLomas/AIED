ELEMENTS: 
1. Recalling the definition of the intersection operator (∩).
2. Processing the elements of Set A.
3. Processing the elements of Set C.
4. Performing the set operation (A ∩ C) to derive a new mental set {3, 5, 7, 9}.
5. Recalling the definition of the subset operator (⊆) and the "not a subset" operator (⊄).
6. Recalling the elements of Set B {3, 5, 7}.
7. Evaluating the logical relationship: checking if every element in B is in the derived set (A ∩ C).
8. Negating the result (since the statement asks if B is *not* a subset).

ELEMENT COUNT: 8
