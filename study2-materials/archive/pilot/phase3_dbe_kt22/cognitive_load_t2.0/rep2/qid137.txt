ELEMENTS: 
1. Determining Candidate Keys (finding the closure of AB and BC).
2. Recalling the definition of Prime Attributes ({A, B, C}).
3. Recalling the 3NF definition (for each $X \rightarrow Y$, $X$ is a superkey OR $Y$ is prime).
4. Recalling the BCNF definition (for each $X \rightarrow Y$, $X$ must be a superkey).
5. Evaluating AB → CD against the 3NF condition.
6. Evaluating BC → A against the 3NF condition.
7. Evaluating AB → CD against the BCNF condition.
8. Evaluating BC → A against the BCNF condition (noting BC is not a superkey because it doesn't derive D).
9. Comparing combined 3NF/BCNF status to the multiple-choice options.
