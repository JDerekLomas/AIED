ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of a Super Key (SK): Understanding that a set of attributes must functionally determine all other attributes in the relation.
2. Recall/application of Armstrong's Axioms (specifically transitivity): Processing the logic that if $D \rightarrow B$ and $B \rightarrow C$, then $D$ can reach $C$.
3. Closure calculation (Step-by-step procedure): Executing the algorithm for $D^+$ ($D^+ = \{D\} \rightarrow \{D, A, B, C\}$) using the provided set $\Sigma$.
4. Logic/Comparison: Checking the result of the closure ($\{A, B, C, D\}$) against the full set of attributes in $R$ to verify equivalence.
5. SQL/Schema context: Recognizing the notation for Functional Dependencies and relation schemas.
