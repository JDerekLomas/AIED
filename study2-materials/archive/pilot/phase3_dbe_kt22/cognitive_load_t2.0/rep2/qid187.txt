ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of Discretionary Access Control (DAC) (specifically that it is based on user identity/discretion).
2. Knowledge of Mandatory Access Control (MAC) or Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to differentiate the "non-identity" and "role" claims in the distractors.
3. Recall of the "Trojan Horse" security vulnerability in the context of access control (unauthorized data flow via authorized users).
4. Evaluating logical consistency between the mechanism (identity) and the vulnerability (indirect information leakage).
5. Technical terminology distinction (e.g., certificates vs. identity).
