ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of equivalence for functional dependency sets (mutual entailment).
2. Rule for decomposing/combining the RHS of a dependency (Σ2: A→B, A→C can be viewed as A→BC).
3. The reflexive property and augmentation rule of Armstrong’s Axioms to evaluate Σ1.
4. Identification that Σ1 contains a redundant attribute in AB→C because A→B exists (transitivity/augmentation logic).
5. Comparing Σ1 and Σ2 directly to see if A can derive BC in both sets.
6. Evaluation of the truth value of the logical equivalence statement.
