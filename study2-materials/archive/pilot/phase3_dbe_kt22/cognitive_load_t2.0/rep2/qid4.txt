ELEMENTS:

2. Distinction between ordered pairs (A, B) vs (B, A) to maintain the sequence of sets.
3. Verification of set completeness (ensuring all $2 \times 2 = 4$ combinations are present).
4. Logical evaluation of distractors (eliminating options with self-referential pairs or incorrect ordering).
