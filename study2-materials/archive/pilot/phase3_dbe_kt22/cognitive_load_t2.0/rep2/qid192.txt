ELEMENTS:
1. SQL Syntax Recall: Understanding `GRANT`, `REVOKE`, and `WITH GRANT OPTION` syntax.
2. Grant Dependency Chain: Tracking the hierarchical flow of privileges (Linda → Amy → Peter).
3. Privilege vs. Option Distinction: Distinguishing between the right to query (SELECT) and the right to pass that privilege on (GRANT OPTION).
4. CASCADE Mechanism: Evaluating how revoking an option at the root affects privileges further down the dependency tree.
5. Entity/Subject Mapping: Maintaining the current state of three distinct users (Linda, Amy, Peter) simultaneously.
6. Execution Order: Sequential processing of discrete steps to update the privilege state in working memory.
