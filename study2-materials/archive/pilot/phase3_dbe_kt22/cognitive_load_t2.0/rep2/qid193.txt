ELEMENTS:
1.  **Ownership Hierarchy:** Recognizing Linda as the root authority/owner of the object.
2.  **`WITH GRANT OPTION` Mechanics:** Understanding that this specific clause allows Amy to pass on privileges.
3.  **Path Tracking (Grant Dependency):** Identifying the specific chain of authorization: Linda → Amy → Peter.
4.  **Redundant Privilege Paths:** Recognizing the parallel grant from Linda directly to Peter (Step 1).
5.  **`CASCADE` Semantic Logic:** Recalling that `CASCADE` invalidates any privileges that rely solely on the revoked user’s grant.
6.  **Dependency Resolution:** Evaluating Peter’s status by comparing his "lost" privilege path (from Amy) against his "retained" privilege path (directly from Linda).
7.  **Syntax Processing:** Parsing three distinct temporal steps in a sequential logical order.
