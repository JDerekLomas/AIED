ELEMENTS: 
1. **Identification of Candidate Keys**: Determining all possible keys by evaluating attribute closures (A⁺ and (BC)⁺).
2. **Definition of Prime Attributes**: Distinguishing which attributes belong to a candidate key (A, B, and C are all prime).
3. **Evaluation of 3NF Definition**: Checking if every functional dependency (X → Y) satisfies the condition: X is a superkey OR Y is a prime attribute.
4. **Evaluation of BCNF Definition**: Checking if every functional dependency (X → Y) satisfies the condition: X is a superkey.
5. **Logic Mapping (BC → A)**: Identifying that in BC → A, the determinant {B, C} is a candidate key (satisfying BCNF/3NF).
6. **Logic Mapping (A → BC)**: Identifying that in A → BC, the determinant {A} is a candidate key (satisfying BCNF/3NF).
7. **Synthesis**: Integrating the findings of both dependencies across both normalization standards to select the correct pair.
