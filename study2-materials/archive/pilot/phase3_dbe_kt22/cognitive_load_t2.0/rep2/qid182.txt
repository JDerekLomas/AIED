As a university instructor, I would classify this question as a relatively low interactivity task, primarily focusing on **recall** and **differentiation** rather than procedural application.

In the South African undergraduate context, where many students rely on rote learning from textbooks (like Silberschatz or Elmasri & Navathi), this question tests their ability to distinguish MAC from Discretionary Access Control (DAC) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **Recall of Definition (MAC):** Remembering that MAC is based on system-wide policies and sensitivity labels.
2.  **Recall of Definition (DAC):** Identifying that owner-determined access (Option B) and GRANT/REVOKE (Option C) define DAC, allowing for the elimination of those choices.
3.  **Recall of Definition (RBAC):** Identifying that "assigning roles" (Option D) relates specifically to RBAC.
4.  **Categorization:** Linking "levels of security" (Classification) to the "Mandatory" nature of the model.
5.  **Technical Distinction:** Distinguishing between an "Object Owner" (decentralized) and a "System Administrator/Policy" (centralized/MAC).

**ELEMENT COUNT: 5**

**RATIONALE:** 
While the interactivity is low (students don't need to perform a procedure), the common hurdle for South African CS undergraduates in this specific module is often English proficiency versus technical jargon. Stronger students will immediately identify "classify" as a MAC keyword. Weaker students often confuse MAC and DAC because they perceive "GRANT" commands (Option C) as "mandatory" steps for security. However, since this is a standard multiple-choice definition question, the success rate is usually high after a lecture on security.

**Your estimate:**
0.72
