ELEMENTS: 
1. SQL Syntax Knowledge: Understanding `UPDATE` statements and `SET` clauses.
2. Definition Recall (Transaction Boundaries): Recognizing that a `COMMIT` statement successfully terminates a transaction.
3. Procedural Sequence: Evaluating the linear execution of statements (`BEGIN` -> `UPDATE` -> `UPDATE` -> `COMMIT` -> `ROLLBACK`).
4. Distinction between Active and Closed Transactions: Distinguishing that `ROLLBACK` only affects the current active transaction.
5. Logic/Constraint Satisfaction: Recognizing that once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent and beyond the scope of a subsequent `ROLLBACK` command in the same script.
