ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Understanding the core principle of RBAC (grouping permissions by job function/organizational role rather than by resource type).
2. Distinction: Distinguishing between the "Subject" (Department/Job Function) and the "Object" (Resource).
3. Logical mapping: Identifying that the "four departments" in the prompt align with the definition of "Roles" in an organizational context.
4. Evaluation: Recognizing that workstation access (C) is a device-level constraint, not a central RBAC role type in this scenario.
5. Constraint satisfaction: Applying the requirement that "each department needs access to different resources," implying roles should be defined by those departments.
