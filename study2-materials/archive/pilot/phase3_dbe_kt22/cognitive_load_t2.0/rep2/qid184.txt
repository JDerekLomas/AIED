ELEMENTS:
1. SQL Syntax Recall: Recalling the correct structure and keyword placement for a `REVOKE` command versus a `GRANT` command.
2. Concept Differentiation (Command Intent): Distinguishing between granting a permission and removing a permission.
3. Terminology Mapping: Identifying the specific SQL keyword (`RESTRICT`) that acts as the logical opposite/counter-measure to `CASCADE`.
4. Logic Evaluation: Determining which command type (GRANT or REVOKE) would logically necessitate a clause to stop a chain reaction of privilege loss.
5. Identifying "Distractor" Keywords: Recognizing that phrases like "no cascade" and "no restrict" are syntactically invalid in standard SQL.
