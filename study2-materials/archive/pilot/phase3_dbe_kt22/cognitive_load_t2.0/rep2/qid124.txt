ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall the definition of a Candidate Key (CK): must be a superkey and must be minimal.
2. Recall the definition of Functional Dependencies (FDs) and how to calculate a closure.
3. Determine the closure of the attribute set {A, B} based on Σ: $A \to B$ is redundant here, but $(AB)^+ = \{A, B, C\}$.
4. Verify if {A, B} is a superkey: Yes, because it contains all attributes of R.
5. Apply the minimality constraint: Check if any proper subset of {A, B} (i.e., {A} or {B}) is also a superkey.
6. Calculate the closure of {A}: $A \to B$ implies $A^+ = \{A, B, C\}$ because $A \to B$ and $\{A, B\} \to C$.
7. Compare findings to the definition: Since {A} is a superkey, {A, B} is not minimal.
8. Distinguish between a Superkey and a Candidate Key to arrive at the final Boolean value.
