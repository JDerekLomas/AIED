ELEMENTS:
1. SQL syntax recall (Recognition of the comma-separated JOIN syntax as a Cross Join/Cartesian Product).
2. Data cardinality of Table 1 (Mental scan of rows in "Course" table).
3. Data cardinality of Table 2 (Mental scan of rows in "Enrol" table).
4. Relational Algebra logic (Understanding that the size of a Cartesian product is $N \times M$).
5. Mathematical operation (Multiplication of the two identified constants).
6. Distinguishing from Inner Join logic (Avoiding the instinct to filter by common keys like CourseID).
