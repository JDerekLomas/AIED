ELEMENTS: 
1. **Definition of a Superkey**: Recalling that a superkey is any set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple.
2. **Definition of a Candidate Key**: Recalling that a candidate key is a *minimal* superkey.
3. **Subset/Superset Logic**: Evaluating the relationship between $\{a\}$ and its supersets (e.g., $\{a, b\}$) in the context of the uniqueness property.
4. **Logical Evaluation of Option A**: Processing the property that any superset of a superkey is also a superkey (rendering the "must not" statement false).
5. **Logical Evaluation of Option B**: Determining that while $\{a, c\}$ is a superkey, it is not minimal (as $\{a\}$ exists), thus failing the candidate key requirement.
6. **Logical Evaluation of Option C**: Recognizing that while $\{a\}$ *could* be a candidate key, it is only one if no subset of $\{a\}$ is a superkey (in this case, only the empty set, which is not applicable), but also recognizing if this "must" be true based on the provided definition of the relation $R$.
