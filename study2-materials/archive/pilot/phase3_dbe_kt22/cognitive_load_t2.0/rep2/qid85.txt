ELEMENTS:
1. SQL syntax knowledge (specifically the `IN` predicate and subquery structure).
2. Schema comprehension (identifying the Foreign Key relationship between `Enrol.CourseNo` and `Course.CourseNo`).
3. Set-based logic (evaluating the inner query result first, then mapping it to the outer query).
4. Data lookup/Cardinality assessment (finding the specific Course ID for ‘Relational Databases’ in a mental or provided dataset).
5. Join/Filtering logic (mapping how many rows in the `Enrol` table correspond to that specific `CourseNo`).
6. Definition recall (distinguishing between the number of rows returned versus the number of columns or specific values).

ELEMENT COUNT: 6
