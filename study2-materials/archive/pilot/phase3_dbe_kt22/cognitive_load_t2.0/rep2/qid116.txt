ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall: The formal definition of equivalence (Σ1 ≡ Σ2 if Σ1+ = Σ2+ or if each set implies the other's dependencies).
2. Transitivity rule: Applying inference rules to determine if A→C is implied by Σ1 (A→B, B→C implies A→C).
3. Subset/Membership checking: Evaluating if Σ2's functional dependencies are contained within the closure of Σ1.
4. Logical negation/counter-example checking: Evaluating if Σ1's functional dependencies are contained within the closure of Σ2 (Checking if A→B is implied by {A→C, B→C}).
5. Functional Dependency syntax: Interpreting the meaning of the attribute mappings.
