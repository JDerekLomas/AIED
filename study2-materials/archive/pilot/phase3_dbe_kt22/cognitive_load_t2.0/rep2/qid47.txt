ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of a **superkey** (a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple).
2. The property of **monotonicity/superset relation** in keys (if a set is a superkey, any superset of it is also a superkey).
3. **Set notation/containment** (recognizing that {a,b,c} contains {a,b}).
4. Logical **implication/necessity** (evaluating "must be" vs "must not be").
5. Distinguishing between a **superkey** and a **candidate key** (crucial for students who might confuse "minimal" with the definition of superkey).
