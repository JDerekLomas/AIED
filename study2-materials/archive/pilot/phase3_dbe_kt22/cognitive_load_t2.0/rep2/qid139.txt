ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall of Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) criteria.
2. Definition recall of Third Normal Form (3NF) criteria.
3. Logical comparison of "strictness/restrictiveness" between BCNF and 3NF (understanding the subset relationship).
4. Distinction between the concepts of "minimizing" vs "eliminating" redundancy (and the theoretical reality that FD-based normalization cannot eliminate all types of redundancy, such as multi-valued dependencies).
5. Evaluation of logical conditions for each multiple-choice option against the recalled definitions.
