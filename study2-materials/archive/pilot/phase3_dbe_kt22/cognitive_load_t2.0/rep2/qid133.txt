ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) requirements (specifically the "X is a superkey" condition).
2. Definition recall of Third Normal Form (3NF) requirements (the disjunctive "X is a superkey OR A is a prime attribute" condition).
3. Distinguishing between the restrictive nature of BCNF versus the more permissive nature of 3NF.
4. Definition recall of "non-trivial functional dependency" to establish the scope of the rule.
5. Definition recall of "prime attribute" (membership in a candidate key).
6. Logical evaluation of Statement A: Recognizing it as a "half-definition" of 3NF incorrectly applied to BCNF.
7. Logical evaluation of Statement B: Recognizing it as the definition of BCNF incorrectly applied to 3NF.
8. Logical evaluation of Statement C: Verifying the single-condition requirement for BCNF.
9. Logical evaluation of Statement D: Recognizing it as only one half of the permitted conditions for 3NF, making the "if" statement incomplete/incorrect in this phrasing.
