ELEMENTS: 
1. Recalling the definition of the intersection operator (∩)
2. Evaluating the contents of the intersection between sets A and B (identifying common elements {4, 5})
3. Recalling the definition of the set difference operator (-)
4. Maintaining the result of the first operation ({4, 5}) in memory while retrieving the original set A
5. Applying the difference operation (removing the intersection results from the original set A)
6. Disregarding the distracting, irrelevant sets C and D (cognitive filtering)
7. Comparing the final result ({2, 3}) against the provided multiple-choice options
