To evaluate this question, we must look at the cognitive load required to determine the equivalence of two sets of functional dependencies (FDs), $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$.

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **Recall of Definition:** The student must recall that $\Sigma_1 \equiv \Sigma_2$ if and only if $\Sigma_1^+ = \Sigma_2^+$ (or $\Sigma_1$ covers $\Sigma_2$ and vice versa).
2.  **Logic of Closure ($A \to C$ in $\Sigma_1$):** Evaluation of whether $A \to C$ holds in $\Sigma_1$. The student must hold $A \to B$ and $AB \to C$ simultaneously to deduce that since $A \to A$, then $A \to AB$, and by transitivity/augmentation, $A \to C$.
3.  **Logic of Closure ($A \to C$ in $\Sigma_2$):** Evaluation of whether $A \to C$ holds in $\Sigma_2$ via transitivity ($A \to B$ and $B \to C$).
4.  **Checking Coverage (Forward):** Testing if every FD in $\Sigma_2$ can be derived from $\Sigma_1$.
5.  **Checking Coverage (Backward):** Testing if every FD in $\Sigma_1$ can be derived from $\Sigma_2$ (specifically checking if $AB \to C$ is implied by $\{A \to B, B \to C\}$).
6.  **Comparative Analysis:** Keeping the results of both coverage tests in memory to reach the final Boolean conclusion.

**Instructional Context:**
At a South African university, this is a standard "mid-to-high" difficulty task for Second Year students. While the theoretical concepts are straightforward, students with weaker discrete math backgrounds often struggle with the multi-step verification process (Attribute Closure algorithm). They frequently guess "True" because both sets intuitively seem to "link" A, B, and C in a chain, overlooking the formal proof process.
