ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall of the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle formula ($|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$).
2. Recognition of mathematical notation for cardinality ($|X|$).
3. Recognition of the set theory symbol for intersection ($\cap$).
4. Recognition of the set theory symbol for union ($\cup$).
5. Arithmetic operation: Addition ($10 + 5$).
6. Arithmetic operation: Subtraction ($15 - 2$).

ELEMENT COUNT: 6

At a South African university, second or third-year CS students would have encountered this in a Discrete Mathematics prerequisite. However, students with weaker backgrounds often struggle with notation transfer (translating symbols to the logical operation).
