ELEMENTS: 
1. Recalling the Lossless Join Theorem for two-set decompositions (intersection of schemas must be a key for at least one of the schemas).
2. Identifying the intersection of $R1 \cap R2$ (attribute A).
3. Testing if A is a superkey for $R1$ (evaluating $A^+$ with respect to $\Sigma$).
4. Testing if A is a superkey for $R2$.
5. Recalling the Dependency Preservation definition (sum of projections of functional dependencies must cover the original closure).
6. Evaluating the projection of $\Sigma$ onto $R1$ (A $\to$ B is preserved).
7. Evaluating the projection of $\Sigma$ onto $R2$ (A $\to$ C is preserved).
8. Determining if the "lost" dependency (B $\to$ C) can be derived from the preserved dependencies using transitive rules.
9. Synthesizing these two separate conclusions to choose between four combinatorial distractors.
