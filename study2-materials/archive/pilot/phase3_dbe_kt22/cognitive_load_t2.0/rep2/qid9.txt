1. Definition recall of the set difference operation ($A - B$).
2. Identifying the contents of set $A$.
3. Identifying the contents of set $B$.
4. Logic/Comparison: Identifying which elements in $A$ are also present in $B$ (finding the intersection $\{4, 5\}$).
5. Logic/Constraint: Subtracting those shared elements from the starting set $A$.
6. Distinguishing between $A - B$ and $B - A$ (avoiding the distractors).
7. Filtering irrelevant information (ignoring sets $C$ and $D$).
