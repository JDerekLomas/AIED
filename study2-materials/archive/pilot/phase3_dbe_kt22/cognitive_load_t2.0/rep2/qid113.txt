ELEMENTS: 
1. Recalling the formal definition and procedure of a "closure" in the context of relational algebra.
2. Initializing the set (starting with D).
3. Scanning and evaluating Functional Dependency (FD) 1: D → ABC (satisfying the LHS condition to add ABC).
4. Scanning and evaluating FD 2: A → B (checking if A is in the current set and understanding B is already present).
5. Scanning and evaluating FD 3: B → C (checking if B is in the current set and understanding C is already present).
6. Verifying if any additional attributes (like R itself) need to be considered or if the set is complete.
7. Identifying that the union of {D} and {A, B, C} contains all four attributes of relation R.
