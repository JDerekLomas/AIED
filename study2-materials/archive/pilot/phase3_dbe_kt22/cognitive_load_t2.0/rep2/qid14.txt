ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of Cartesian Product (A × B): understanding that the first coordinate belongs to set A and the second to set B.
2. Extraction of unique elements for Set A: identifying {2, 3, 4} from the first coordinates of the given pairs.
3. Extraction of unique elements for Set B: identifying {5, 7} from the second coordinates of the given pairs.
4. Calculation of total cardinality: verifying that |A| × |B| (3 × 2) equals the 6 elements mentioned in the prompt.
5. Systematic construction/validation of the full set: pairing each element of {2, 3, 4} with {5, 7} to produce {(2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7)}.
6. Comparative evaluation: Distinguishing the correct set from distractors that contain transposed values, incorrect elements, or incorrect cardinalities.
