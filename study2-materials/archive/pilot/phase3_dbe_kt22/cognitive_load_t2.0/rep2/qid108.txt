ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of ER diagram limitations (distinguishing between structural constraints and semantic/business logic constraints).
2. Evaluation of attribute-level check constraints (start date vs. end date comparison).
3. Evaluation of temporal business rules/periodic constraints (maintenance frequency of twice a year).
4. Evaluation of domain constraints/value enumerations (new, working, or broken).
5. Understanding relationship cardinality (one-to-many relationship between trainer and class).
6. Understanding participation constraints (optionality: not all trainers deliver classes).
7. Distinction between what can be represented graphically in an ERD vs. what requires external triggers, assertions, or documentation.
