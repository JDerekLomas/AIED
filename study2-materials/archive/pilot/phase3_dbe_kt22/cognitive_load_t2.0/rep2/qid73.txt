To answer this question, a student must process the following:

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **Syntax Identification**: Recognizing `SELECT`, `COUNT()`, and `MIN()` as aggregate functions.
2.  **Concept of Aggregation**: Understanding that these functions compress multiple rows into a single result row.
3.  **Column Identification**: Locating the specific column `units` within the provided table.
4.  **COUNT logic (Null Handling)**: Knowing whether `COUNT(column)` includes or excludes NULL values (crucial distinction from `COUNT(*)`).
5.  **Procedural Execution (Counting)**: Incrementing a mental counter while scanning the rows.
6.  **MIN logic**: Identifying the smallest numerical value in the set.
7.  **Output Mapping**: Matching the computed results (the "what") to the correct ordinal position in the SELECT list (the "where") to select the right pair from the options.

**ELEMENT COUNT: 7**

**ESTIMATION:**
South African undergraduate cohorts often show a "bimodal" distribution. Stronger students will find this trivial, but weaker students often confuse `COUNT` with the number of rows in the table or the sum of values, and frequently swap the order of results (choosing C instead of B). Given that "Study" is likely a small table in this context, the primary hurdle is basic aggregate theory.

Your estimate:
0.65
