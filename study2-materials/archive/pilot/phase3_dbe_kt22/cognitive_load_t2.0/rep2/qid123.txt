ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The formal definition of a Candidate Key (CK) as a minimal superkey that functionally determines all attributes in the schema.
2. Rule of attribute closure: The procedural steps to calculate $\{A\}^+$.
3. Evaluation of FD1: Applying $A \to B$ to include $B$ in the closure of $\{A\}$.
4. Evaluation of FD2: Applying $AB \to C$ to the updated set $\{A, B\}$ to include $C$ in the closure.
5. Set comparison: Verifying if the resulting closure $\{A, B, C\}$ matches the full set of attributes $R$.
6. Logical distinction (Minimality): Determining if $A$ is the smallest possible set (trivially satisfied here as a singleton, but still a step in the definition check).
7. Synthesis: Compiling the results of the logic to select the correct boolean value (True).
