ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall: Characteristics and visual notation of an ER diagram (rectangles, diamonds, lines).
2. Definition recall: Definition and representation of a Primary Key (underlining attributes).
3. Definition recall: Definition of a Foreign Key (relationship between entities/tables).
4. Definition recall: Definition of a Domain constraint (data types, range restrictions).
5. Distinguishing concepts: Determining which constraints are intrinsic to the conceptual model vs. those that are strictly logical/physical schema implementation details (ER diagrams typically explicitly show PKs via notation and FKs via relationship lines, whereas domains are often omitted or secondary).
