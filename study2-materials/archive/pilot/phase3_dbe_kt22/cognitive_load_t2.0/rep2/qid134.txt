ELEMENTS: 
1. **Identification of Candidate Keys**: Analyzing the FD {A→BC} to determine that A is the sole candidate key (A determines all attributes).
2. **Identification of Attributes**: Distinguishing between prime attributes {A} and non-prime attributes {B, C}.
3. **Definition Recall (BCNF)**: Recalling that BCNF requires the determinant of every functional dependency to be a superkey.
4. **Logical Evaluation (BCNF)**: Checking if 'A' in A→BC is a superkey (Yes).
5. **Definition Recall (3NF)**: Recalling that 3NF requires every FD X→Y to satisfy one of three conditions: X is a superkey, Y is a prime attribute, or the FD is trivial.
6. **Logical Evaluation (3NF)**: Applying the 3NF test to A→BC.
7. **Hierarchical Logic**: Recognizing that if a relation is in BCNF, it is automatically in 3NF (often used as a shortcut/cross-check).
8. **Option Matching**: Coordinating the results of the 3NF and BCNF checks to select the correct combined choice (A).
