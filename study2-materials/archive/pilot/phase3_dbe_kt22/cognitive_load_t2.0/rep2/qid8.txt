ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of the Cartesian Product ($A \times B$) as a set of ordered pairs.
2. The ordering rule (first element of the pair belongs to the first set $A$, second belongs to the second set $B$).
3. Pattern recognition/Set abstraction (identifying the unique elements across multiple tuples).
4. Distinguishing between the specific sets $A$ and $B$ to avoid transposition errors (relevant for Option D).
5. Eliminating distractors based on the total number of elements required for the product ($2 \times 2 = 4$).

ELEMENT COUNT: 5
