ELEMENTS: 
1. Recalling the definition of the set difference operator (-) 
2. Recalling the definition of the set intersection operator (∩)
3. Maintaining the contents of Set A in working memory
4. Maintaining the contents of Set D in working memory
5. Executing the subtraction A - D while identifying shared elements (8, 9 are absent, results in {2, 3, 4, 5})
6. Maintaining the contents of Set B in working memory
7. Maintaining the contents of Set C in working memory
8. Executing the subtraction B - C while identifying shared elements (6, 7 are removed, results in {4, 5})
9. Storing the result of (A - D) temporarily
10. Storing the result of (B - C) temporarily
11. Evaluating the intersection (finding commonalities) between the two temporary result sets ({2, 3, 4, 5} ∩ {4, 5})
