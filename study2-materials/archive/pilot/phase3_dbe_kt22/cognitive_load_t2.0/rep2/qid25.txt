ELEMENTS: 
1. Interpretation of the visual Venn diagram (identifying the shaded set-theoretic region).
2. Recall of the 'U' (Union) operator symbol and logic.
3. Recall of the '∩' (Intersection) operator symbol and logic.
4. Recall of the '-' (Difference) operator symbol and logic.
5. Evaluation of logical priority/parentheses within the expressions.
6. Mapping abstract set notation to relational algebraic concepts (specifically Difference vs. Intersection).
7. Identifying the equivalence between A and (A U B) - B (noticing that both describe the same region if A and B are generic sets).
