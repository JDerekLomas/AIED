ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall definition of a Candidate Key (uniqueness and minimality).
2. Recall definition of a Superkey.
3. Logical evaluation of the closure $A^+$ using the FD set (calculating $\{A, B, C, D\}$).
4. Logical evaluation of the closure $CD^+$ using the FD set (calculating $\{C, D, A, B\}$).
5. Identification of $CD$ as a potential candidate key.
6. Verification of minimality for $CD$ (checking subsets $C$ and $D$).
7. Comparison of identified keys $\{A\}$ and $\{CD\}$ against the prompt’s claim ("only CK").
8. Syntax and attribute mapping of the relation schema $R$.
