PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of Set Theory notation: Understanding the symbol $\cup$ as the "Union" operation.
2. Knowledge of Set Theory notation: Understanding the symbol $\subset$ as the "Proper Subset" operation.
3. Execution of the Union operation: Correctly combining sets A and B to form a resultant set $\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$.
4. Evaluation of the Subset relationship: Verifying if every element in B is in the resultant set and ensuring the resultant set contains at least one element not in B.
5. Reading comprehension: Correctly mapping the provided definitions of A and B to the expression without being distracted by the irrelevant set C.
6. Logical consistency: Recognizing that any set $X$ is always a subset of $X \cup Y$, and since $A$ contains elements not in $B$, the "proper" subset condition holds.
