PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the standard notation of the Entity-Relationship (ER) model (specifically the Chen notation commonly taught in South African curricula).
2. Distinguishing between an "entity" and a "relationship" (rectangle vs. diamond).
3. Distinguishing between "strong/regular" and "weak" variations in visual notation (single line vs. double line).
4. Mapping the specific term "weak entity" to its corresponding geometric symbol.
5. Avoiding the common confusion between a "weak entity" (Double Rectangle) and its "identifying relationship" (Double Diamond).
