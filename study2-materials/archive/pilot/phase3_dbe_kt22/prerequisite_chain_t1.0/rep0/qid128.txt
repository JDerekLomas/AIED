PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a Candidate Key (CK) as a minimal superkey.
2. Ability to compute the closure of an attribute set ($X^+$) using Armstrong's Axioms or the closure algorithm.
3. Identifying "essential" attributes: recognizing that if an attribute (C) does not appear on the right-hand side of any functional dependency in $\Sigma$, it *must* be part of every candidate key.
4. Distinguishing between a Primary Key and a Candidate Key.
5. Multi-step logical reasoning: testing if $C$ alone is a key, or if $C$ combined with other attributes forms the key.
6. Reading and interpreting formal functional dependency notation ($\Sigma=\{...\}$).
7. Identifying "extraneous" attributes within a closure (e.g., realizing $B \to D$ is redundant because $B \to AD$ implies $B \to D$, though not strictly necessary for this specific question, it's a potential point of confusion).
