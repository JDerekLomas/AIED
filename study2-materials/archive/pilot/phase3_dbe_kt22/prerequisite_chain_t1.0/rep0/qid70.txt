To provide an accurate estimate, I have assessed this question against the context of a diverse South African undergraduate cohort, where many students may be transitioning from a conceptual understanding of data to the technical rigors of SQL syntax and case sensitivity.

**PREREQUISITES:**
1.  **Literal String Matching:** Understanding that the string `'tom'` is lowercase and must match the data exactly after the function is applied.
2.  **Function Application:** Knowing that `lower(Name)` transforms the data in the `Name` column to lowercase before the comparison occurs.
3.  **Schema Interpretation:** Being able to identify the `Study` table and correctly locate the `Name` column within it (assuming a schema or data sample was provided, which is implicit in this type of question).
4.  **Case Sensitivity Awareness:** Recognizing that SQL string comparisons are generally case-sensitive (depending on collation) and that `lower()` is used specifically to normalize this.
5.  **Counting Logic:** Correcting counting the occurrences that meet the criteria (filtering) rather than returning all rows in the table.
6.  **Syntactic Literacy:** Recognizing that `SELECT *` returns rows, but the `WHERE` clause dictates the quantity.

**COUNT: 6**
