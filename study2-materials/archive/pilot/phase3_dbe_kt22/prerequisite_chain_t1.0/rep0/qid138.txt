PREREQUISITES:
1. **Candidate Key Identification**: Ability to compute attribute closures (e.g., finding $(AB)^+ = \{A, B, C, D\}$ and $(BC)^+ = \{B, C, A, D\}$) to identify all candidate keys (AB and BC).
2. **Identifying Prime Attributes**: Understanding that A, B, and C are prime attributes because they are members of candidate keys.
3. **Applying the 3NF Definition**: Knowing that for each functional dependency $X \to Y$, either $X$ is a superkey or $Y$ is a prime attribute.
4. **Evaluating 3NF for $C \to A$**: Recognizing that while $C$ is not a superkey, $A$ is prime, thus satisfying 3NF.
5. **Applying the BCNF Definition**: Knowing that for each $X \to Y$, $X$ must be a superkey.
6. **Evaluating BCNF for $C \to A$**: Identifying that $C$ is not a superkey, which violates BCNF.
7. **Schema Literacy**: Correct interpretation of the relational schema notation $R=\{A,B,C,D\}$ and the dependency set $\Sigma$.
8. **Logical Synthesis**: Combining the findings (3NF satisfied, BCNF violated) to select the correct multiple-choice option.
