PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of SQL injection (manipulating a query via untrusted user input).
2. Distinguishing between dynamic SQL built from user-controlled variables (Request.form) versus hard-coded local variables.
3. Reading and tracing basic JavaScript/pseudo-code logic (variable assignment).
4. Recognizing the role of string concatenation (`+`) in constructing SQL statements.
5. Identifying that Choice B is a static string with no variables.
6. Identifying that Choice C, while using concatenation, uses a hard-coded literal rather than external input.
7. Understanding that the `Request.form` object in Choice A represents external, unvalidated user input.
8. Evaluating "None of the above" as a potential distractor and rejecting it.
