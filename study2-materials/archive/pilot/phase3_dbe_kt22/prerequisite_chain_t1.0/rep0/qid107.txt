PREREQUISITES:
1. **Filtering relevant information:** Ability to isolate the specific "administrator" entity requirements from a dense narrative containing multiple other entities (trainers, technicians, members, equipment).
2. **Understanding Entity-Relationship (ER) inheritance:** Recognizing that "administrator" is a sub-category (subtype) of "employee."
3. **Knowledge of attribute inheritance:** Understanding that a subtype inherits all attributes of its supertype, including the primary key.
4. **Identifying Key Attributes:** Identifying that the "unique ID" mentioned for employees applies to administrators, whereas landline numbers, names, and addresses are not guaranteed to be unique or stable enough to be keys.
5. **Distinguishing "unique" from "attribute":** Recognizing that while administrators have landlines, the text specifically labels the employee ID as "unique."
6. **Reading comprehension:** Correctly associating the "unique ID" mentioned in the first sentence with the "administrator" mentioned in the second sentence.
