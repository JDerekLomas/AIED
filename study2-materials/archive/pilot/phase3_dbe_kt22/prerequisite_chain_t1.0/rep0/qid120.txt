PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of Functional Dependency (FD) equivalence (Σ1 ≡ Σ2 if and only if Σ1+ = Σ2+).
2. Knowledge of Armstrong’s Axioms (specifically the Transitivity rule) or the attribute closure algorithm.
3. Ability to compute the closure of attribute {A} under Σ1 ($A^+ = \{A, B, C\}$).
4. Ability to identify that "AB → C" in Σ1 can be simplified to "A → C" because A determines B (Augmentation/Transitivity).
5. Comparing two sets of FDs to check if each dependency in one can be derived from the other.
6. Recognizing that Σ1 and Σ2 both imply the same set of dependencies (A → B and A → C).
7. Distinguishing between a "minimal cover" and equivalent sets of dependencies.
