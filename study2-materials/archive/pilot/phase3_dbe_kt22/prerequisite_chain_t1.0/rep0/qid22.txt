PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of set notation (specifically the use of curly braces for sets).
2. Understanding the definition of the intersection operator ($\cap$).
3. Understanding that if $A \cap B = \{2, 3\}$, then $\{2, 3\}$ must be a subset of $B$.
4. Logical reasoning regarding the cardinality (size) of a set: if $B$ contains at least the elements 2 and 3, its size $|B|$ must be $\ge 2$.
5. Ability to interpret the negative constraint in the question ("cannot be").
6. Evaluating each multiple-choice option against the derived constraint $|B| \ge 2$.
7. Distinguishing between the set $A$ (the context) and the set $B$ (the subject of the question).
