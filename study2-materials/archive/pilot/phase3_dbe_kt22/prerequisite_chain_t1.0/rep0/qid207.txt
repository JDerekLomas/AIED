PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the ACID properties acronym and what each letter represents (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
2. Distinguishing between the roles of different DBMS components (e.g., the Transaction Manager vs. the Lock Manager vs. the Recovery Manager).
3. Understanding the functional purpose of a "log" (Write-Ahead Logging) as a persistent record of changes.
4. Reasoning that because logs are stored on stable storage, they are primarily used to recover data after a crash (ensuring Durability).
5. Reasoning that logs allow for "undoing" partial transactions during recovery (ensuring Atomicity).
6. Distinguishing "Integrity/Consistency" as a property often enforced by constraints or application logic rather than the logging mechanism itself.
7. Distinguishing "Isolation" as a property primarily managed by the Concurrency Control/Lock Manager rather than the log.
