PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the formal definition of a **superkey** (a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple).
2. Understanding the formal definition of a **candidate key** (a minimal superkey).
3. Recognizing the subset/superset relationship between keys (the "closure property" of superkeys).
4. Logic: Identifying that adding attributes to a superkey always results in another superkey (invalidating A).
5. Logic: Distinguishing between "must be" and "could be" (invalidating B and C, as {a} is only a candidate key if no subset of {a}, i.e., the empty set, is a superkey, or more simply, if we don't know if a smaller subset exists—though in this specific schema, {a} is the smallest non-empty set).
6. Critical Thinking: Recognizing that the question is a "trick" or "none of the above" type scenario, as none of the provided options are logically necessary truths.
7. Reasoning under pressure: Not assuming that because {a} is a superkey, it is automatically "minimal" (the definition of a candidate key).
