PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (identifying elements within curly braces).
2. Knowledge of the Cartesian Product (S x T), specifically that it results in a set of ordered pairs.
3. Calculating the cardinality and members of (S x T) (2x3=6 pairs).
4. Calculating the cardinality and members of (S x S) (2x2=4 pairs).
5. Understanding the Set Difference operator (-), specifically that it removes elements of the second set from the first.
6. Identifying common elements between the two product sets (the intersection).
7. Execution of multi-step symbolic logic without making a manual mapping error.
8. Distinguishing between the sets S and T to ensure the correct elements are subtracted (e.g., not confusing S x T with T x S).
