PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of "Attribute": Understanding that this refers to a column or field in a database table.
2. Definition of "Tuple": Recognizing this as the formal relational model term for a row or record.
3. Definition of "Uniquely Identify": Understanding the constraint that no two rows can have the same value for these attributes.
4. Definition of "Superkey": Specifically knowing that it is the set of one or more attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple (the formal definition).
5. Distinguishing "Superkey" from "Foreign key": Not confusing a unique identifier with a referential constraint used to link tables.
6. Identifying "Domain" as a distractor: Knowing that a domain refers to the set of allowable values for an attribute, not an identifier.
7. Identifying "Subkey" as a distractor: Recognizing that "Subkey" is not a standard term in the relational model (unlike Candidate Key or Primary Key).
8. Ability to parse formal academic phrasing: Connecting "taken collectively" to the concept of a composite set of attributes.
