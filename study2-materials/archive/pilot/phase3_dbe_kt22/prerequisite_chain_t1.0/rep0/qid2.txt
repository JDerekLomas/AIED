PREREQUISITES:
1. Recalling the mathematical definition of a "Set" (specifically the properties of being unordered and containing distinct elements).
2. Distinguishing a "Set" from a "Relation" (which is a set of tuples, but the term "collection of distinct elements" is the foundational definition of the set itself).
3. Distinguishing a "Set" from a "Tuple" (where order matters and elements need not be distinct).
4. Understanding basic mathematical terminology used in the context of the Relational Model.
5. Reading comprehension of a formal definition-style sentence.
