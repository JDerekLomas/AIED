PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (braces and elements).
2. Knowledge of the Cartesian Product operator (x) and how it generates ordered pairs.
3. Ability to compute the specific members of a Cartesian Product (A x A and C x C).
4. Understanding the subset symbol (⊆) and the condition required for one set to be a subset of another.
5. Multi-step logical reasoning: comparing every element of the first resulting set against the second.
6. Recognizing the property of monotonicity in Cartesian products (if A ⊆ C, then A x A ⊆ C x C), which allows a shortcut if the student is advanced.
7. Avoiding the "distraction" of sets B and D which are irrelevant to the specific expression.
