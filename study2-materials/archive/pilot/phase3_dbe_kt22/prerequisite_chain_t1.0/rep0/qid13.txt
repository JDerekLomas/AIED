PREREQUISITES:
1. Understanding set notation (identifying elements within braces).
2. Knowledge of the Set Difference operator (A - D): removing elements of the second set from the first.
3. Knowledge of the Set Intersection operator (∩): identifying elements common to both resultant sets.
4. Ability to perform multi-step logical processing (evaluating parentheses before the intersection).
5. Precision in element matching (avoiding "visual sliding" between four similar sets).
6. Distinguishing between Difference and Intersection (not confusing the symbols or operations).
