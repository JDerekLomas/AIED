PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the formal definition of 3NF (specifically the allowance for prime attributes on the right-hand side of a functional dependency).
2. Understanding the formal definition of BCNF (every determinant must be a candidate key).
3. Ability to compare "restrictiveness" (subset/superset relationship) between normal forms (knowing that all BCNF relations are in 3NF, but not vice versa).
4. Distinguishing between "minimizing" and "eliminating" redundancy (recognizing that 3NF allows certain types of transitive dependencies involving prime attributes that can still harbor redundancy).
5. Knowing the trade-off involved in 3NF (guaranteeing dependency preservation at the cost of potential redundancy).
6. Evaluating multiple-choice options to identify the "most correct" or "only correct" statement (eliminating the false claim that 3NF is more restrictive than BCNF).
