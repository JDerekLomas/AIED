PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a "Transaction" in a database context.
2. Knowledge of the Lock Compatibility Matrix (specifically for Exclusive (X) locks).
3. Distinguishing between Shared (S) locks (read-only) and Exclusive (X) locks (read/write).
4. Logical inference that "writing" an object inherently requires "reading" it (or the authority to modify implies the authority to view).
5. Mapping the SQL operation "Update" to the fundamental operations of "Read and write".
6. Eliminating distractor B (Write) which is a subset of the permissions, and distractor D (Update) which is a specific command rather than the full scope of operations allowed.
