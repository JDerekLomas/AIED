PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of the keyword 'INSERT' as the standard DML command for data entry (distinguishing it from synonyms like 'ENTER').
2. Knowledge of the mandatory 'INTO' clause following the 'INSERT' command.
3. Knowledge of the 'VALUES' keyword required to specify the data payload.
4. Correct identification of the syntactical sequence: command, target relation, values keyword, then data.
5. Distinguishing between the tuple list (parentheses) and the SQL keywords in the correct order (Option B vs Option C).
6. Basic familiarity with relational terminology (mapping "tuple" to row and "relation" to table).
