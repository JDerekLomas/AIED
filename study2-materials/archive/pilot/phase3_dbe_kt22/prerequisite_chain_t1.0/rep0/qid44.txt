PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Terminology - Attribute vs Tuple**: Distinguishing that attributes are columns (the identifiers) and tuples are rows (the data being identified).
2. **Definition of Superkey**: Knowing that a superkey is defined by its ability to uniquely identify a row within a single relation.
3. **Directionality of Identification**: Understanding that keys identify tuples, not the other way around (eliminating the inversion in option B).
4. **Superkey vs Candidate Key Relationship**: Knowing that all candidate keys are superkeys, but not all superkeys are candidate keys (understanding the "minimality" requirement for candidate keys to eliminate option C).
5. **Scope of Identification**: Realizing that keys identify records *within* a table, not the table itself compared to other tables (eliminating option D).
6. **English Language Proficiency**: Interpreting technical phrasing like "uniquely identify," which can be challenging for second- or third-language speakers in a South African context.
