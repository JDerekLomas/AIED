To provide an accurate estimate, I am assuming a standard small-scale pedagogical dataset is provided alongside this question (e.g., an `Enrol` table with 11 rows, where 7 rows have valid matches in the `Course` table and 4 have nulls or invalid foreign keys).

PREREQUISITES:
1. **Schema Interpretation**: Identifying that `Enrol` (e) is the outer table and `Course` (c) is the inner table.
2. **Subquery Execution Flow**: Understanding that the inner query executes for each row of the outer query (correlated subquery logic).
3. **EXISTS Predicate Logic**: Knowing that `EXISTS` returns true if the subquery returns *at least one* row, regardless of the actual columns selected.
4. **Join Condition Knowledge**: Recognizing that `c.CourseNo = e.CourseNo` acts as a filter equivalent to a semi-join.
5. **Handling Nulls/Mismatches**: Realizing that rows in `Enrol` without a corresponding `CourseNo` in the `Course` table will be excluded from the result set.
6. **Distinguishing Count Targets**: Correctly identifying that the question asks for the count of rows from the *outer* table (`Enrol`) that satisfy the condition, not the inner table.
7. **Data Processing/Counting**: Accurate manual scanning of the provided table instances to count matches without skipping or double-counting.
