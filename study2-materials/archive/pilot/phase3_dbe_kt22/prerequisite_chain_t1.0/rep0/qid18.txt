PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (identifying elements within curly braces).
2. Knowledge of the set difference operator (-) and its directional nature (elements in the first set but not the second).
3. Knowledge of the set union operator (∪) and its function to combine unique elements.
4. Ability to perform multi-step procedural reasoning (executing A-B, then B-A, then the union).
5. Avoiding common misconceptions (e.g., confusing intersection with union, or treating "-" as a symmetric difference immediately without calculation).
6. Basic arithmetic accuracy (correctly identifying that 1 and 2 are shared and thus excluded).
