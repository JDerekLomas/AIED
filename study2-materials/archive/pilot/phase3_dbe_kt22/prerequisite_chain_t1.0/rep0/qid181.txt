PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of SQL Data Control Language (DCL) syntax specifically related to the GRANT statement.
2. Recall of the specific keyword phrase "WITH" vs "ALLOW" (distinguishing between standard SQL syntax and intuitive but incorrect natural language synonyms).
3. Recall of the specific keyword phrase "GRANT OPTION" vs "GRANT PRIVILEGE" (distinguishing between the name of the clause and the general concept of permissions).
4. Understanding the functional difference between merely holding a privilege and holding the authority to delegate it.
5. Reading comprehension of the multiple-choice options to avoid "distractor" terms that sound technically plausible (e.g., Option A).
