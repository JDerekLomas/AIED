PREREQUISITES: 
1. Definition of a Superkey: Understanding that a superkey is any set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple.
2. Property of Superkeys: Knowing that any superset of a superkey is also a superkey.
3. Definition of a Candidate Key: Understanding that a candidate key is a *minimal* superkey (no proper subset is a superkey).
4. Definition of a Primary Key: Knowing that a primary key is a specific candidate key chosen by the designer.
5. Logical negation/Exclusion: Ability to evaluate whether "must not be" is a true statement based on the definitions provided.
6. Schema reading: Understanding the notation R(a,b,c) represents the set of all available attributes in the relation.
7. Distinguishing "Possible" vs "Necessary": Recognizing that while {a,b,c} *can* be a superkey, the question asks what *must* be true.
