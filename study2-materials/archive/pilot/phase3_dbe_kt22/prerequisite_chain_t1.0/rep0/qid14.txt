PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Understanding Cartesian Product notation**: Knowing that $A \times B$ represents the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.
2. **Element decomposition**: Identifying that in an ordered pair $(x, y) \in A \times B$, the first element belongs to set $A$ and the second belongs to set $B$.
3. **Set construction from samples**: Extracting the unique elements for $A$ from the given pairs $\{2, 3, 4\}$ and for $B$ from the given pairs $\{5, 7\}$.
4. **Cardinality constraint reasoning**: Recognizing that since $n(A \times B) = 6$ and $n(A \times B) = n(A) \times n(B)$, the sets $A$ and $B$ must have sizes that multiply to 6 (confirming $|A|=3$ and $|B|=2$).
5. **Systematic expansion**: Correcting generating the full Cartesian product based on the derived sets $A=\{2, 3, 4\}$ and $B=\{5, 7\}$.
6. **Distinguishing between sets and pairs**: Not confusing elements of $A$ with elements of $B$ (avoiding distractors that mix coordinates, like Option B).
7. **Pattern matching/Verification**: Comparing the generated set against the multiple-choice options to find the exact match (Option C).
