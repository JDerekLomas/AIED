PREREQUISITES: 
1. Definition of the Cartesian Product: Understanding that $X \times Y$ results in a set of ordered pairs $(x, y)$.
2. Element-wise generation: Correcty identifying that $A \times B = \{(1,a), (1,b), (2,a), (2,b)\}$.
3. Definition of a Subset ($\subseteq$): Understanding that $S \subseteq T$ is true only if every element in $S$ is also an element in $T$.
4. Membership testing in a Cartesian Product: Realizing that $(x, y) \in C \times D$ if and only if $x \in C$ AND $y \in D$.
5. Applying the subset rule to product sets: Checking if all first elements of $A \times B$ are in $C$ (i.e., $\{1, 2\} \subseteq \{1, 2, 3\}$) AND all second elements are in $D$ (i.e., $\{a, b\} \subseteq \{a, b, c\}$).
6. Distinguishing notation: Not confusing the Cartesian Product ($\times$) with union, intersection, or arithmetic multiplication.
7. Logic processing: Confirming that because $A \subseteq C$ and $B \subseteq D$, the statement must be True.
