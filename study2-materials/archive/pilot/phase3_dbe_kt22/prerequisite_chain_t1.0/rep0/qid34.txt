PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a Cartesian product (A x B) as a set of ordered pairs.
2. Recognizing the notation for a subset ($\subseteq$) and its logical requirement (every element in the first set must exist in the second).
3. Ability to mentally or physically construct the set A x A: {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}.
4. Ability to mentally or physically construct the set A x C: {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)}.
5. Applying the subset rule to compare the two resulting sets of ordered pairs.
6. Identifying that B and D are "distractor" sets and must be ignored to solve the problem.
7. Distinguishing between a subset ($\subseteq$) and a proper subset ($\subset$) or simple membership ($\in$), ensuring no confusion with the "equal" component of the symbol.
