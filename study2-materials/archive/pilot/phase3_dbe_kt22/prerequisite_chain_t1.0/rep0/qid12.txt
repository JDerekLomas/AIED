PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the definition of the Union ($\cup$) operator (combining elements from both sets).
2. Recalling the definition of the Intersection ($\cap$) operator (identifying common elements only).
3. Understanding operator precedence/order of operations (evaluating the parentheses $(A \cup B)$ first).
4. Accurate execution of the first step: identifying that $A \cup B = \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$.
5. Accurate execution of the second step: comparing the intermediate set $\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$ with set $C = \{6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
6. Identifying the common elements $\{6, 7\}$ without missing any or including extras (like 4 or 5).
7. Sustained attention to detail (avoiding "skimming" errors where $B \cap C$ is calculated instead).
