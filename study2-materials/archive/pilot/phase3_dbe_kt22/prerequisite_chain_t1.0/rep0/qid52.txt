PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of SQL standard syntax for Data Definition Language (DDL).
2. Knowledge of PostgreSQL-specific terminology (recognizing that "relation" is a formal database term, but "table" is the keyword used in the command).
3. Distinguishing between the formal relational model terminology (relation) and the practical SQL implementation (table).
4. Eliminating non-SQL syntax (identifying that "New" is not a standard DDL keyword compared to "CREATE").
5. Precise syntax recognition (knowing that the command is "CREATE TABLE" and not "CREATE RELATION", despite the course often using the terms interchangeably in theory).
