PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of the Union ($\cup$) operator: Understanding that it combines all unique elements from the involved sets.
2. Associative property of Union: Recognizing that $((A \cup B) \cup C)$ is equivalent to $A \cup B \cup C$ (processing multiple sets).
3. Set notation literacy: Ability to read elements within curly braces and map labels ($A, B, C$) to their respective sets.
4. Handling redundant elements: Knowing that duplicates (e.g., 4, 5, 6, 7 appearing in multiple sets) are only listed once in the resulting set.
5. Systematic scanning/verification: Comparing the derived result against the multiple-choice options to ensure no elements (like 3) are missing and no extraneous elements are added.
6. Identifying irrelevant data: Recognizing that Set $D$ is a "distractor" and not required for the calculation.
