PREREQUISITES: 
1. Definition of Cartesian Product: Understanding that $X \times Y$ produces a set of all possible ordered pairs $(x,y)$.
2. Ordered Pair Notation: Recognizing that $(1,a)$ is an element of a set and distinct from individual values.
3. Definition of Set Difference: Understanding that $S - T$ removes elements found in $T$ from $S$, rather than performing arithmetic on the values within the pairs.
4. Set Construction (C x D): Correctly identifying all 9 pairs in the first set.
5. Set Construction (A x B): Correctly identifying all 4 pairs in the second set.
6. Membership Testing: Determining which elements from (A x B) exist within (C x D) to be removed.
7. Handling Remaining Elements: Identifying that the "leftover" elements in (C x D) form the final result.
8. Distinguishing Subsets: Noticing that A is a subset of C and B is a subset of D, which simplifies the logic (but failing to see this leads to manual error).
9. Visual Scanning/Attention to Detail: Matching the calculated result against the provided options without missing a single coordinate (e.g., ensuring (3,a), (3,b), and (3,c) are all present).
