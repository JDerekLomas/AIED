PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) as the foundational framework for information security.
2. Distinguishing between "Confidentiality" (preventing unauthorized access/viewing) and "Integrity" (preventing unauthorized modification).
3. Interpreting the phrase "shouldn't change data" as a reference to data modification/accuracy rather than data access.
4. Parsing the nuance of the second clause ("shouldn't change data in ways different from how they are supposed to") as a reference to maintaining the correctness and consistency of data (logical integrity).
5. Eliminating "Availability" (ensuring access) and "Accountability" (tracing actions to individuals) as secondary to the primary act of modification described.
6. Mapping the natural language definition provided in the stem to the formal technical term "Integrity."
