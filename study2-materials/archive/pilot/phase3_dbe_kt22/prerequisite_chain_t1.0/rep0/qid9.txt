PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (identifying elements within curly braces).
2. Knowledge of the set difference operator (the minus sign '-' in the context of sets).
3. Ability to distinguish set difference from arithmetic subtraction.
4. Correct identification of the intersection between set A and set B (finding the elements {4, 5}).
5. Correct application of the "remove" rule (subtracting elements of the second set from the first set, rather than vice versa).
6. Ignoring irrelevant data (recognizing that sets C and D are "distractors" not needed for the calculation).
