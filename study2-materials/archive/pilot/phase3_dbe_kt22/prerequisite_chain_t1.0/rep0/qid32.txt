PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of Set Theory notation: Understanding the symbol $\subseteq$ (subset).
2. Knowledge of Set Theory notation: Understanding the symbol $\times$ (Cartesian product).
3. Ability to calculate a Cartesian product: Recognizing that $B \times B$ results in a set of ordered pairs (e.g., $(a, a)$), not individual elements.
4. Distinguishing element types: Recognizing that the elements of set $B$ are characters/atoms ($a, b$), whereas the elements of $B \times B$ are tuples.
5. Understanding the subset definition: Knowing that for $X \subseteq Y$ to be true, every element in $X$ must be present in $Y$.
6. Logical reasoning: Concluding that an atom (like $a$) is not the same as a tuple (like $(a, a)$), and therefore the set of atoms cannot be a subset of the set of tuples.
7. Filtering irrelevant information: Ignoring sets $A, C,$ and $D$ which are distractors.
