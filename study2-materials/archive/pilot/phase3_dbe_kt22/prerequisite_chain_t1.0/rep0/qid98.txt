PREREQUISITES:
1. **Reading Comprehension (Filtering Noise):** Ability to parse a dense narrative and distinguish between descriptive text (business rules) and structural metadata.
2. **Entity-Attribute Mapping:** Identifying which nouns in the text represent entities (Technician, Equipment, Class) versus their properties (Phone Number, Date, Time Slot).
3. **Understanding Key Uniqueness:** Knowing that a key attribute must uniquely identify every instance of an entity across the entire database, not just within a subset.
4. **Distinguishing Candidate Keys from Unique Constraints:** Recognizing that while a "Time Slot" is unique for fitness classes (as stated in the text), other options like "Phone Number" or "Name" are not guaranteed to be unique across all records or time.
5. **Handling Attribute Domains (Technician vs. Employee):** Understanding that a property of a subclass (Technician's phone) may not suffice as a key for the superclass or even uniquely identify the technician if shared.
6. **Multi-valued Attribute Identification:** Recognizing that "Specialities" or "Associate Members" imply one-to-many relationships, making associated attributes poor candidates for keys.
7. **Temporal Logic:** Realizing that a "Date of maintenance" cannot be a key because multiple pieces of equipment could be maintained on the same day, or one piece multiple times.
8. **Schema Inference:** Inferring the underlying ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) structure from the text to determine which attribute serves as the primary identifier.
