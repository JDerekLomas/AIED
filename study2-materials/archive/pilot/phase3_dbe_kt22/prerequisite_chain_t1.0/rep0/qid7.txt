PREREQUISITES: 
1. Definition of set equality (two sets are equal if and only if they contain exactly the same elements).
2. Understanding the property of order in sets (recognizing that {1, 2, 3} and {2, 1, 3} are identical because order does not matter).
3. Visual pattern matching/comparison (verifying each element in set A exists in set B and vice versa).
4. Distinguishing between a subset and an equal set (avoiding the error of selecting options where one set is contained within another but not identical).
