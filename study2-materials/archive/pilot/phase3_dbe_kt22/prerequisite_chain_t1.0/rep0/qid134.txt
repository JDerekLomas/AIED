PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding Functional Dependency (FD) notation (A→BC).
2. Ability to determine the Candidate Key(s) of a relation from a set of FDs (recognizing A is the key).
3. Defining "Prime Attribute" (A) vs. "Non-prime Attribute" (B, C).
4. Recalling the 3NF definition (for every X→Y, X is a superkey OR Y is prime).
5. Recalling the BCNF definition (for every X→Y, X is a superkey).
6. Distinguishing the hierarchical relationship between 3NF and BCNF (BCNF is stricter).
7. Identifying that A is a superkey, which satisfies both BCNF and 3NF conditions simultaneously.
8. Eliminating distractors that suggest a relation could be BCNF but not 3NF (which is logically impossible).
