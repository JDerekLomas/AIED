PREREQUISITES: 
1. Ability to identify the `FOREIGN KEY` syntax and its placement in the `Enrol` table.
2. Understanding the definition of Referential Integrity (as opposed to Entity Integrity or general constraints).
3. Distinguishing between the "Parent" table (`Student`) and the "Child" table (`Enrol`).
4. Knowing the directional rule of a Foreign Key: that the child must reference an existing value in the parent, not vice versa.
5. Distinguishing between a Referential Integrity constraint (Option A) and a Primary Key/Not Null constraint (Options C and D).
6. Interpreting the logical quantifier "Every" correctly in the context of relational sets.
