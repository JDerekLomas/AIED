2. Understanding the concept of "classification" (labels/clearances) as the central mechanism of MAC.
3. Identifying the "owner-based" permission model (Option B) as the defining characteristic of DAC, not MAC.
4. Recognizing that GRANT/REVOKE (Option C) are SQL implementations of DAC.
5. Identifying Role-Based Access Control (Option D) as a distinct model from MAC.
6. Applying the "mandatory" rule (policy is set by a central authority/system, not the user).
