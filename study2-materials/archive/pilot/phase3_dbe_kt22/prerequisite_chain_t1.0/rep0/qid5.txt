PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of a Cartesian product: Understanding that the result is a set of ordered pairs $(a, b)$.
2. Definition of Set Equality: Knowing that for two sets to be equal, they must contain the same elements.
3. Concept of Ordered Pairs: Recognizing that $(a, b)$ is not equivalent to $(b, a)$ unless $a = b$.
4. Logic of Universal Quantifiers: Understanding that "always equal" requires the statement to hold for all possible sets $A$ and $B$, including cases where they are distinct.
5. Handling Edge Cases: Recognizing that while the statement might be true if $A=B$ or if one set is empty, it is false in the general case.
6. Mathematical Notation: Correctly interpreting the "$\times$" symbol in a set theory/database context.
