PREREQUISITES:
1. **Visual Pattern Recognition**: Correctly identifying that the shaded area in the Venn diagram represents the intersection (overlap) of two circles.
2. **Set Theory Notation**: Understanding the symbol $\cup$ represents "Union" (everything in both sets).
3. **Set Theory Notation**: Understanding the symbol $\cap$ represents "Intersection" (only what is common to both).
4. **Set Theory Notation**: Understanding the symbol $-$ represents "Difference" (elements in one set but not the other).
5. **Mapping Logic to SQL Concepts**: Translating the visual "overlap" to the concept of a JOIN or intersection, though the question remains in pure set notation.
6. **Elimination Strategy**: Evaluating and rejecting distractors (e.g., recognizing that A U B would shade the entirety of both circles).
