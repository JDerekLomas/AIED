PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and how it differs from discretionary access control.
2. Identifying that in RBAC, "roles" typically correspond to job functions or organizational departments rather than the resources being accessed.
3. Distinguishing between "subjects" (users/departments), "objects" (files/printers), and "roles" (the intermediary abstraction).
4. Reading the scenario to filter out "noise" (distinguishing between the resources mentioned and the actual roles required to manage them).
5. Recognizing that "workstations" are physical assets/locations and not appropriate entities for roles in a standard RBAC model.
6. Multi-step reasoning: Mapping the four departments (Sales, Marketing, Management, Production) to the concept of "job functions" which define roles in a business context.
7. Eliminating Option D by realizing "Resource" and "Department" are categories/meta-names, not the specific roles themselves.
