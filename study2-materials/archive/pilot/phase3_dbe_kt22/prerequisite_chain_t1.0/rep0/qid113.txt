PREREQUISITES:
1. **Understanding Functional Dependency (FD) notation**: Recognizing that $X \to Y$ means $X$ determines $Y$.
2. **Knowledge of the Closure Definition**: Knowing that the closure of an attribute set $D$ (denoted $D^+$) is the set of all attributes functionally determined by $D$.
3. **Initialization Rule**: Knowing that any set of attributes determines itself (Reflexivity), so $D$ must be in $D^+$.
4. **Iterative Application of Transitivity**: Identifying that $D \to ABC$ means $A, B,$ and $C$ are added to the set.
5. **Chain Reasoning**: Recognizing that while $A \to B$ and $B \to C$ are given, they are redundant if $D$ already determines $A, B,$ and $C$ directly, or alternatively, being able to follow the path $D \to A \to B \to C$.
6. **Set Union Logic**: Correcting combining the results $\{D\} \cup \{A, B, C\}$ to form the final set $\{A, B, C, D\}$.
7. **Mapping Result to Distractors**: Correcting identifying that "ABCD" matches the computed set $\{A, B, C, D\}$.
