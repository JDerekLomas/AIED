PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of a Relation: Understanding that a relation is mathematically defined as a *set* of tuples.
2. Property of Sets: Knowing that sets are inherently unordered collections.
3. Attribute Independence: Understanding that attributes are identified by name, not by their ordinal position (positional independence).
4. Logical vs. Physical distinction: Distinguishing between how data is displayed/stored (which has an order) and the formal logical definition in the Relational Model.
5. Terminology translation: Correctly mapping the formal terms "tuple" and "attribute" to "row" and "column."
6. Reading comprehension: Correcting matching the two parts of the answer to the two blanks in the specific order requested (Tuples first, Attributes second).
