PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the mechanism of SQL injection (string concatenation vs. parameterized queries).
2. Knowing the definition of "sanitization" and "constraints" in the context of web security.
3. Distinguishing between the application’s database user (the service account) and the end-user of the software.
4. Understanding the Principle of Least Privilege (it mitigates damage but does not "prevent" the injection vulnerability itself).
5. Recognizing that removing all privileges from a database user would render the application non-functional, making it an invalid "prevention" strategy.
6. Identifying the negative phrasing in the prompt ("not correct").
7. Evaluating multiple-choice logic, specifically the role of "None of the above" when searching for an incorrect statement.
8. Distinguishing between "mitigation" (reducing impact) and "prevention" (stopping the occurrence).
