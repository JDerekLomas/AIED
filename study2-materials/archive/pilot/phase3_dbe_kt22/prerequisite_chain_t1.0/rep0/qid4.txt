PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of Set Notation: Recognizing that {1, 2} represents a set of distinct elements.
2. Definition of Cartesian Product: Understanding that $A \times B$ results in a set of ordered pairs $(x, y)$.
3. Membership Rule: Knowing that the first element of each pair must come from set $A$ and the second from set $B$.
4. Exhaustive Mapping: Understanding that every element in $A$ must be paired with every element in $B$.
5. Distinguishing Order: Recognizing that $(1, a)$ is not the same as $(a, 1)$, allowing for the rejection of Option D.
6. Identifying Pattern Errors: Spotting the "distractor" element in Option A (the inclusion of $(b, b)$) despite the other pairs appearing correct.
