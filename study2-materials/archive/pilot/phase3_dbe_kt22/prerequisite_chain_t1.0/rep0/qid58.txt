PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the definition of DML (Data Manipulation Language) versus DDL (Data Definition Language).
2. Distinguishing between operations that modify the *structure/schema* of a database and those that modify the *data* stored within it.
3. Correctly identifying "DROP" as a structural command (DDL).
4. Correctly identifying "ALTER" as a structural command (DDL).
5. Correctly identifying "CREATE" as a structural command (DDL).
6. Recognizing that "UPDATE" acts upon the rows/tuples within a table (DML).
7. Navigating the common linguistic confusion where students assume "Data" in DML refers to the entire database object (tables) rather than the records.
