PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Understanding Functional Dependency (FD) notation**: Correctly interpreting $X \to Y$ as "X determines Y".
2. **Definition of Equivalence**: Knowing that for $\Sigma_2$ to be a cover of $\Sigma_1$, they must be equivalent ($\Sigma_1^+ = \Sigma_2^+$).
3. **Logic of Implication (Redundancy check)**: Recognizing that in $\Sigma_1$, since $A \to B$, the dependency $AB \to C$ can be simplified (reduced) to $A \to C$ using the augmentation/decomposition rules or attribute closure.
4. **Definition of Minimal Cover (Standard Basis)**: Knowing the three specific criteria for minimality:
    - Every FD has a single attribute on the right-hand side.
    - No redundant functional dependencies (cannot derive an FD from the others in the set).
    - No redundant attributes on the left-hand side (extraneous attributes).
5. **Evaluating Minimality for $\Sigma_2$**: Checking if $\Sigma_2$ itself is minimal (it is, as it meets the three criteria above).
6. **Comparison and Verification**: Confirming that $\Sigma_2$ is equivalent to $\Sigma_1$ AND meets the minimality criteria.
7. **Distinguishing "A Cover" from "The Minimal Cover"**: Understanding that while multiple minimal covers can exist, the question asks if *this specific set* qualifies as *a* minimal cover.
