PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Knowledge of Relational Model Terminology**: Distinguishing between the formal mathematical terms (relation, attribute, tuple) and their informal counterparts (table, column, row).
2. **Schema Reading Literacy**: Recognizing the standard notation `Table(Column1, Column2)` and understanding that the items inside the parentheses represent the components of the header.
3. **Distinguishing Structure from Data**: Understanding that `courseID`, `courseName`, and `semester` define the structure (labels/fields) of the data, not the data entries (instances) themselves.
4. **Vocabulary Exclusion**: Knowing that a "Relation" refers to the whole table (the `Course` itself) and a "Tuple" refers to a specific row of data.
5. **English Proficiency**: In a South African context, ensuring the student understands that "attributes" in this context means "characteristics" or "properties" of the entity.
