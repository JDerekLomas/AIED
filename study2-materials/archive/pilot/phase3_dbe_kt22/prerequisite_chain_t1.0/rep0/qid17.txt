PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (braces and commas) to identify elements.
2. Understanding the intersection operator (∩) as the set of elements common to both A and C.
3. Performing the intersection calculation correctly: {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} ∩ {3,5,7,9} = {3,5,7,9}.
4. Understanding the subset operator (⊆) or proper subset operator (⊂) (Note: in many contexts these are used interchangeably, but both require checking if all elements of B are in the result of A ∩ C).
5. Understanding the "not a subset" negation symbol (⊄).
6. Comparing Set B {3,5,7} against the result {3,5,7,9} to determine if B is a subset.
7. Applying the logical negation: Recognizing that since B *is* a subset of {3,5,7,9}, the statement "B is *not* a subset" must be False.
8. Avoiding the "trap" of confusing ∩ (intersection) with ∪ (union).
9. Distinguishing between the concept of "subset" and "proper subset" (though not strictly necessary here, it can cause hesitation).
