PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the syntax and purpose of the SQL `GRANT` command.
2. Understanding the syntax and purpose of the SQL `REVOKE` command.
3. Distinguishing between the action of giving a privilege and removing a privilege (recognizing that "avoiding cascading" is a sub-clause of an removal operation).
4. Knowing the definition of "cascading revokes" (how privileges propagate via the `WITH GRANT OPTION`).
5. Identifying the specific keyword `RESTRICT` as the modifier that prevents a command from executing if it would result in dependent deletions.
6. Eliminating distractor syntax (like "no cascade" or "no restrict") which are not standard SQL keywords for this operation.
7. Reasoning that "avoiding cascading" is the logical opposite of the `CASCADE` keyword, which is used to force the removal of dependent privileges.
