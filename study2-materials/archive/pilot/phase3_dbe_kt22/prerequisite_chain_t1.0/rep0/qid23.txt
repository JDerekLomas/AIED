PREREQUISITES:
1. Understanding set notation (identifying elements within curly braces).
2. Knowing the definition of the set difference operator ($A - B$ means elements in $A$ that are not in $B$).
3. Recognizing that order of elements in a set does not matter (essential for evaluating Option C and D).
4. Understanding the equality of sets (two sets are equal if they contain exactly the same elements).
5. Performing multi-step calculation (computing $A - B$, then $B - A$, then comparing them for each option).
6. Identifying the specific case where $A - B = B - A$ (recognizing that this occurs when $A = B$, resulting in the empty set for both).
7. Distinguishing between a subset (Option B) and an identical set (Option C).
