PREREQUISITES: 
1. Ability to read and interpret a relational schema (identifying primary and foreign keys between Enrol and Course).
2. Understanding the concept of a subquery (nested SELECT).
3. Understanding the evaluation order of a subquery (inner query executes first).
4. Correct interpretation of the SQL IN operator (set membership).
5. Understanding the SELECT * wildcard (though not critical for the count, it must not confuse the student into counting columns instead of rows).
6. Ability to perform a manual join/lookup by matching values across two different tables.
7. Identifying the specific filtering criteria (CourseName = ‘Relational Databases’) and correctly mapping it to a CourseNo.
8. Accurately counting the occurrences of that specific CourseNo in the Enrol table without skipping rows.
9. Distinguishing between the number of courses (which might be 1) and the number of enrollments (the actual answer).
