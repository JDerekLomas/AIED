PREREQUISITES:
1. Understanding functional dependency (FD) notation (X → Y).
2. Knowing the definition of logical entailment (Σ ⊨ f) in the context of relational databases.
3. Ability to compute the attribute closure ($D^+$) using a given set of FDs.
4. Multi-step reasoning: Applying the transitive property (D → B and B → C implies D → C).
5. Understanding the decomposition rule: knowing that if D → ABC, then D → A and D → C are individually implied.
6. Applying the union rule: confirming that D → A and D → C can be combined into D → AC.
7. Distinguishing between a direct derivation and a logical consequence.
8. Accurate symbolic processing: correctly mapping the letters in the FDs to the conclusion without clerical error.
