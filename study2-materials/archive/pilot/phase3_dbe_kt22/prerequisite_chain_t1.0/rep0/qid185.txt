PREREQUISITES:
1.  **Understanding the Definition of a View**: Recognizing that a view is a virtual table derived from base tables or other views.
2.  **Distinguishing Ownership from Privileges**: Understanding that in SQL, creating an object does not automatically grant "All Privileges" if the underlying dependencies have restricted permissions.
3.  **Knowledge of View Updatability**: Knowing that many views (e.g., those with joins, aggregations, or distinct clauses) are inherently non-updatable, regardless of user permissions.
4.  **Understanding Privilege Inheritance/Delegation**: Realizing that a user's privileges on a view are constrained by the privileges they hold on the underlying schema objects.
5.  **Handling "Always" vs. "Necessarily" Logic**: Identifying that "always" (in Options A and B) is a high bar that is easily invalidated by specific edge cases (like non-updatable views or lack of GRANT OPTION).
6.  **Distinguishing between Options C and D**: Overcoming the common student misconception that "the creator of an object owns it and thus has all rights to it" (which is true for base tables but not views).
