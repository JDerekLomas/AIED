PREREQUISITES:
1. Understanding set notation (identifying elements within curly braces).
2. Knowledge of the Union (∪) operator (combining elements of A and C without duplicates).
3. Knowledge of the Subset (⊂) operator symbol and its meaning.
4. Correct execution of the Union operation: (A ∪ C) = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
5. Ability to perform a logical comparison between the resulting set and Set B.
6. Identifying that the resulting set contains elements (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8) not present in B.
7. Distinguishing between "subset" and "superset" (realizing that B is actually a subset of A and C, not the other way around).
8. Distinguishing between the symbols for Union (∪) and Intersection (∩), as a student confusing them might arrive at a different conclusion.
