PREREQUISITES: 
1. Set notation: Understanding that curly braces { } denote a set and recognizing elements within them.
2. Intersection operator (∩): Knowing that this symbol requires identifying elements common to both set A and set B.
3. Subtraction/Difference operator (-): Knowing that A - B means removing elements of the second set from the first set.
4. Order of operations: Correctly identifying that the expression inside the parentheses (A ∩ B) must be evaluated before the subtraction.
5. Identifying the dummy sets: Recognizing that sets C and D are irrelevant "distractors" to the specific calculation requested.
6. Execution/Mapping: Correctly calculating {4, 5} for the intersection and then performing {2, 3, 4, 5} - {4, 5} without making a clerical error.
