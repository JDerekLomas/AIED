PREREQUISITES: 
1. Vocabulary knowledge: Understanding the definition of "authentication" in a security context.
2. Conceptual classification: Distinguishing between the three classic factors of authentication (Knowledge, Possession, Inherence).
3. Scenario analysis: Identifying that a "password" belongs to the "what you know" category.
4. Scenario analysis: Identifying that an "SMS to a registered phone" implies the "what you have" category (possession of the SIM/device).
5. Pattern recognition: Recognizing that the combination of two different categories (Knowledge + Possession) constitutes "Two-factor authentication" (2FA).
6. Distractor discrimination: Avoiding the trap of selecting B just because a password is mentioned first, or A just because a phone is mentioned second.
7. Real-world context: Mapping the theoretical concept of "factors" to a common banking procedure (OTP).
