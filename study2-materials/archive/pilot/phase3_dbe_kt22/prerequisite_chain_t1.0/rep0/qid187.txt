PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of the definition of Discretionary Access Control (DAC) (i.e., that it is based on the identity of the user/subject).
2. Distinguishing DAC from Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to eliminate options referring to "roles."
3. Distinguishing DAC from Mandatory Access Control (MAC) or Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to eliminate options referring to "certificates."
4. Understanding the mechanism of a Trojan Horse attack in the context of access control (unauthorized data flow via authorized programs).
5. Multi-step reasoning: connecting the "discretionary" nature (the ability for a user to pass permissions) to the vulnerability of malicious software acting on behalf of that user.
6. Reading comprehension: identifying the nuance between "relies only on identity" (A) vs "does not rely on identity" (C).
