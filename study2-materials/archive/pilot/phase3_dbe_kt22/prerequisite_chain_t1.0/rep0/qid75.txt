To provide an accurate assessment, I have assumed a standard sample "Study" table typically found in textbooks (e.g., 5–8 rows with some duplicate `CourseNo` values and some unique ones).

**PREREQUISITES:**
1.  **Reading Schema/Data:** Correctly identifying the `CourseNo` column and its values from the provided table.
2.  **Understanding GROUP BY:** Knowing that the rows are partitioned into buckets based on identical values in the `CourseNo` column.
3.  **Understanding COUNT(*):** Knowing that this counts the number of rows within each specific group/bucket.
4.  **HAVING Clause Logic:** Understanding that `HAVING` acts as a filter *after* the grouping occurs, specifically excluding groups that do not meet the criteria.
5.  **Relational Logic (Inequality):** Correctly applying the strict inequality `> 1` (excluding groups with only one occurrence).
6.  **Final Output Definition:** Realizing the question asks for the number of *rows in the result set* (the number of groups that passed the filter) rather than the sum of the counts or a specific value within the table.
7.  **Mental Tracking/Counting:** Accurately performing the tallying for each unique `CourseNo` without skipping rows or miscounting.

**COUNT: 7**

**Your estimate:**
0.65
