PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the specific technical definition of "covert channel" as distinct from general secure communication.
2. Distinguishing between "secrecy of data" (Option B) and the "nature of the communication path" (Option A).
3. Recognizing that a covert channel specifically exploits mechanisms not intended for data transfer (e.g., timing, resource exhaustion).
4. Eliminating Option C by understanding that "trusted" implies an overt, legitimate communication path.
5. Eliminating Option D by knowing that security perimeters often contain overt (authorized) channels.
6. Overcoming the linguistic distractor where "covert" and "secret" are synonyms in common English but represent different concepts in database security.
