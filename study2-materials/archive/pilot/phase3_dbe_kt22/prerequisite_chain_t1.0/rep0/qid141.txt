PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the formal definition of 3rd Normal Form (3NF).
2. Understanding the formal definition of Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF).
3. Recognizing the nested (hierarchical) nature of Normal Forms (1NF $\subset$ 2NF $\subset$ 3NF $\subset$ BCNF).
4. Understanding the logical implication of "A implies B" in the context of subset/superset relationships (set theory).
5. Distinguishing between "must be" (necessity) and "can be" (possibility).
6. Recalling that BCNF is a stricter version of 3NF, meaning it eliminates anomalies that 3NF might still allow.
7. Correctly interpreting the propositional logic in the four options to identify the direction of the subset relationship.
