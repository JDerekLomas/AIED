PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of the specific terminology for "Concurrency Phenomenon" (Dirty Read, Unrepeatable Read, Phantom Read).
2. Understanding the technical definition of a "Dirty Read" (reading uncommitted data).
3. Understanding the technical definition of an "Unrepeatable Read" (data changing between two reads in the same transaction).
4. Understanding the technical definition of a "Phantom Read" (new rows appearing between two reads).
5. Familiarity with the four standard ANSI SQL Isolation Levels (Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable).
6. Ability to map the hierarchy of isolation levels (which level permits which phenomena).
7. Ability to perform a process of elimination (e.g., knowing Serializable allows nothing, and Read Uncommitted allows everything).
8. Distinguishing between "Read Committed" and "Repeatable Read" (the most common point of confusion for students).
