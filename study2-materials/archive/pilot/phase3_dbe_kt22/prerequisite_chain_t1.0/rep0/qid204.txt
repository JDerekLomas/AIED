PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of the "Two-Phase" rule (Expanding vs. Shrinking phase).
2. Knowledge that the shrinking phase is triggered by the first `UNLOCK` operation.
3. Distinguishing between Basic 2PL (which allows releasing locks before commit) and Strict 2PL.
4. Distinguishing between 2PL and Conservative (Static) 2PL (which requires acquiring all locks at the start).
5. Understanding that "All of the above" is a distractor that requires verifying every individual statement's compatibility with the general protocol definition.
6. Reading comprehension: Identifying that the question asks for the statement that is *always* true for the general protocol.
