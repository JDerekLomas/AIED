PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of basic SQL syntax and the structure of a DML (Data Manipulation Language) statement.
2. Understanding the specific functional definition of the `SELECT` clause as a projection operator (identifying attributes/columns).
3. Distinguishing between DML (Data Manipulation Language) and DDL (Data Definition Language) commands (e.g., separating `SELECT` from `CREATE`).
4. Distinguishing between data retrieval and data modification commands (e.g., separating `SELECT` from `UPDATE` or `DELETE`).
5. Terminology mapping: connecting the term "attributes" to "columns" or "fields" within the context of a SQL result set.
6. Reading comprehension of the English sentence structure to identify the missing keyword.
