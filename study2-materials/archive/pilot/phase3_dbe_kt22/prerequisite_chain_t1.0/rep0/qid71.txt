To provide an accurate estimate, I am assuming a standard undergraduate context where this question follows an introductory lecture on SQL. I am also assuming the students are provided with a sample instance of the `Study` table (e.g., a table with 4 rows where some `CourseNo` values repeat). Without a visual table instance, the question is unsolvable; therefore, I assume a table exists where there are 4 total entries but only 3 unique values.

**PREREQUISITES:**
1. **Schema Interpretation:** Ability to identify that `CourseNo` refers to a specific column and `Study` refers to the table.
2. **SQL Keyword Knowledge (`SELECT`):** Understanding that the command retrieves data from the specified column.
3. **SQL Keyword Knowledge (`DISTINCT`):** Understanding that this keyword filters out duplicate values, leaving only unique entries.
4. **Counting Logic:** Correctly identifying the number of unique items in the provided dataset (distinguishing between the total count of rows and the count of unique values).
5. **Eliminating Distractors:** Distinguishing between the count of the entire table (likely 4) and the result of the `DISTINCT` operation.
6. **Task Mapping:** Recognizing that the question asks for the *number of rows* in the result set, rather than the values themselves.

**COUNT: 6**
