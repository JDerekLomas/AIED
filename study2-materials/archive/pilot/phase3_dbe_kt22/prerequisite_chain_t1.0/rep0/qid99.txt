PREREQUISITES:
1. **Reading Comprehension (Information Filtering):** The ability to identify that 90% of the provided text (maintenance dates, equipment status, time slots) is "noise" irrelevant to the specific question asked at the end.
2. **Knowledge of EER Modeling Concepts:** Understanding the definition of a "Superclass" (a generalized entity type) and a "Subclass" (a specialized grouping of that entity).
3. **Keyword Identification:** Recognizing the phrase "classified into three categories" as a linguistic indicator of specialization/generalization.
4. **Distinguishing Entities from Attributes:** Recognizing that "Trainer," "Administrator," and "Technician" are being described with their own specific attributes (specialties, phone numbers), which qualifies them as entities rather than simple attribute values or domains.
5. **Logic of Inheritance:** Understanding that because all three categories share common attributes (Name, Address, ID) defined under "Employee," they inherit from a parent type.
6. **Vocabulary Matching:** Correctly mapping the conceptual relationship (Specialization) to the specific terminology used in the multiple-choice options (Superclass/Subclass).
