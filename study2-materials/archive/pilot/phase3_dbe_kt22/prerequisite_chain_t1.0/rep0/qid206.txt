PREREQUISITES:
1. Understanding the definition of "concurrency" in a database context (multiple transactions executing at once).
2. Knowledge of "throughput" as a performance metric (number of tasks completed per unit of time).
3. Knowledge of "response time" and the mathematical effect of interleaving on the "average" wait time (preventing short transactions from being stuck behind long ones).
4. Understanding "resource utilisation" (keeping CPU and I/O busy while one transaction waits for disk access).
5. Recognizing that these three benefits are complementary rather than mutually exclusive.
6. Test-taking strategy: Identifying that if two options are clearly correct (e.g., A and B), "All of the above" is the logically necessary choice.
