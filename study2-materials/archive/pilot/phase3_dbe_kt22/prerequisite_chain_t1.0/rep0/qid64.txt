1. Knowledge of the SQL `SELECT` statement purpose (retrieval vs. action).
2. Understanding the specific functionality of the `COUNT()` aggregate function.

5. Distinguishing between metadata (columns) and data (rows).
6. Literacy in English technical terminology (for students who may speak English as a second or third language).
