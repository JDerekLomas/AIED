PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Knowledge of Set Notation**: Recognizing that $\{1, 2\}$ denotes a set containing specific elements.
2. **Definition of Cartesian Product ($\times$)**: Understanding that $A \times B$ results in a set of **ordered pairs** (e.g., $(1, a)$), not a set of atoms.
3. **Definition of Subset ($\subseteq$)**: Understanding that for $X \subseteq Y$, every individual element of $X$ must be an element of $Y$.
4. **Type Compatibility (Structural Awareness)**: Recognizing the "category error"—that an element of $A$ (an integer) cannot be equal to an element of $A \times B$ (a tuple).
5. **Handling Distractors**: Ignoring sets $C$ and $D$, which are irrelevant to the specific proposition but may cause students to look for patterns in cardinality or inclusion.
6. **Logical Evaluation**: Correcting the common misconception that "A is part of the expression $A \times B$" implies "A is a subset of $A \times B$."
