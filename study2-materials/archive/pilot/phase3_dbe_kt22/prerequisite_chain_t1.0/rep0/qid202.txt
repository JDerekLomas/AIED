PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the technical definition of "correctness" in the context of database concurrency (as opposed to general system reliability).
2. Distinguishing between the ACID properties (A, C, I, D) and the specific execution schedules that maintain them.
3. Recognizing that "Consistency" (A) is a goal/property of a single transaction, whereas "Serializability" is the formal criterion for concurrent execution.
4. Knowing the definition of Serializability (a schedule is correct if it is equivalent to some serial execution).
5. Overcoming the "All of the above" distractor, which is common in students who associate all three terms with general database "correctness" or the ACID acronym.
6. Identifying that Atomicity (C) refers to the all-or-nothing nature of a transaction, not the interleaving of multiple transactions.
