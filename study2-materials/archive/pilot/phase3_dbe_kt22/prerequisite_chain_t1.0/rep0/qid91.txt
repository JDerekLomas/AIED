PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a Primary Key (PK) and how it is visually represented in an ER diagram (e.g., underlining an attribute).
2. Understanding the definition of a Foreign Key (FK) and recognizing that standard ER notation (Chen or Crow's Foot) typically represents relationships as lines/diamonds rather than explicit FK attributes within an entity.
3. Understanding the definition of a Domain Constraint (data types, ranges, or specific sets of values) and knowing that these are generally handled at the logical/physical schema level rather than the visual ER diagram level.
4. Distinguishing between "conceptual design" (ER) and "relational design" (Tables), specifically knowing which constraints are inherent to which model.
5. Interpreting the phrasing of the question to identify if "the" ER diagram refers to a specific provided image or the general capabilities of ER modeling notation.
