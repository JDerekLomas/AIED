PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of Set Theory notation (recognizing that curly braces {} denote a set).
2. Understanding the Cartesian Product operator (the symbol 'x') specifically in a mathematical/database context.
3. Distinguishing between a Set Union (which would result in A) and a Cartesian Product.
4. Knowing the definition of an ordered pair (a, b) as the element type of a product set.
5. Identifying the correct operands (recognizing the question asks for S x S, not S x T).
6. Executing the combinatorial expansion (2 elements x 2 elements = 4 pairs) without missing or duplicating permutations.
