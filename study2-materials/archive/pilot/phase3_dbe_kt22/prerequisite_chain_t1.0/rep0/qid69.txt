To provide an accurate assessment, I am assuming the students are provided with a visual representation of a `Study` table containing sample data, as the question is unanswerable without a specific instance of the database.

**PREREQUISITES:**
1. **Schema Literacy:** Correctly identifying the `Study` table among potentially multiple tables in a diagram.
2. **Column Identification:** Locating the specific column labeled `Name` within that table.
3. **SQL Operator Logic:** Understanding that the `=` operator in SQL performs a literal case-sensitive or case-insensitive string match (depending on collation) rather than a pattern match (like `LIKE`).
4. **Data Filtering/Scanning:** Correctly scanning the rows and identifying every instance where the value is exactly 'Tom'.
5. **Set Cardinality:** Understanding that the question asks for the *count* of rows (the result set size) rather than the content of the rows.
6. **Distinguishing Nulls/Similar Values:** Not being tripped up by similar names (e.g., 'Tommy') or null values if they exist in the sample data.
7. **Syntax Interpretation:** Recognizing that `SELECT *` retrieves the full row but does not change the count of rows that satisfy the `WHERE` clause.

**COUNT: 7**
