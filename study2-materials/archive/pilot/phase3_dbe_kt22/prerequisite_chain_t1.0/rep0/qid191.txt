PREREQUISITES: 
1. Distinguishing between Authentication (verifying identity) and Authorization/Access Control (restricting actions).
2. Understanding that "restricting access" and "restricting operations" are definitions of Authorization, not Authentication.
3. Recognizing that Authentication is the prerequisite step (Who are you?) before any of the listed "restricting" methods (What can you do?) are applied.
4. Resisting the "All of the above" trap, which is a common distractor for students who perceive all listed options as general "security things."
5. Reading comprehension of technical definitions: identifying that "restricting" implies a policy/rule (Authorization) rather than a verification process (Authentication).
