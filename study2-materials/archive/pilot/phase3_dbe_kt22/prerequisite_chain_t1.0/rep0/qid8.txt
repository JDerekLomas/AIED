PREREQUISITES: 
1. Definition of the Cartesian Product (A × B): Understanding that it results in a set of ordered pairs.
2. Order Sensitivity: Recognizing that the first element of each pair must belong to the set A and the second element must belong to the set B.
3. Set Notation: Interpreting the curly brace and comma notation for sets and parentheses for coordinates.
4. Element Extraction: Correctly identifying the unique elements from the first positions {p, q} and second positions {x, y} without being distracted by the repetition in the list.
5. Distinguishing A from B: Avoiding the "reverse" error (Option D) by maintaining the mapping of first-to-A and second-to-B.
6. Eliminating Distractors: Recognizing that all elements in the result must be accounted for and no extra elements can exist in the source sets.
