PREREQUISITES: 
- Distinguishing between Data Definition Language (DDL) for schema changes and Data Manipulation Language (DML) for tuple operations.
- Recalling the specific multi-word syntax for the `ALTER TABLE` statement.
- Recognizing `DROP` as the correct keyword for removing schema elements versus `DELETE` for removing rows.
- Knowing that `COLUMN` is a required (or standard) keyword in the `DROP` clause in many SQL dialects (PostgreSQL/MySQL/Oracle).
- Identifying that `DELETE FROM` is used for row-level operations, not attribute removal.
- Mapping the term "attribute" to "column" and "relation" to "table."
