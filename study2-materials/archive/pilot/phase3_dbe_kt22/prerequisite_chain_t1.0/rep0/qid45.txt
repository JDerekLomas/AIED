PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of the specific terminology used in the relational model (Referencing vs. Referenced).
2. Understanding the directional nature of a foreign key constraint (the child table points to the parent table).
3. Ability to map the term "foreign key" to the entity that *contains* the key rather than the one it *points* to.
4. Distinguishing between similar-sounding labels (Referencing vs. Referenced) in a multiple-choice context.
5. Reading comprehension to identify that the question asks for the role of the relation containing the key, not the target relation.
