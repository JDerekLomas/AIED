PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Visual Set Recognition**: Correct identification of the shaded region in a Venn diagram (recognizing that the shading covers the entire circle of B except for the overlapping portion shared with A).
2. **Set Notation Literacy**: Understanding the symbols for Union (U), Intersection (∩), and Set Difference (-).
3. **Operator Precedence/Evaluation**: Ability to process parentheses first in expression D.
4. **Logical Elimination**: Determining that option A (only A) and C (the intersection) are visually incorrect.
5. **Relational Subtraction Logic**: Specifically understanding that subtracting an intersection from a set (B - (A ∩ B)) leaves the "crescent" or "relative complement" of A in B.
6. **Distinguishing B from A**: Carefully verifying which circle is being modified (Option B describes the A-crescent, while Option D describes the B-crescent).
