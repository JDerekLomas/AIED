PREREQUISITES: 
1. Accessing the provided schema/data: The student must identify the specific table named "Study" from the database diagram or instance provided.
2. Understanding SELECT * vs. SELECT columns: Recognizing that the number of columns selected (StudentID, Name) does not affect the number of rows returned.
3. Distinguishing rows from columns: Correctly identifying that the question asks for the vertical count (records) rather than the horizontal count (attributes).
4. Data counting: Accurately counting the entries in the "Study" table, ensuring they do not count the header row or duplicate entries if the table allows them.
5. Understanding the absence of a WHERE clause: Realizing that without a filter, the query returns every record in the table.
6. Distinguishing tables: Not confusing the "Study" table with similar tables like "Student" or "Course" if they exist in the schema.
