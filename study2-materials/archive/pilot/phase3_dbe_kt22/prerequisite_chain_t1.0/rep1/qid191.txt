PREREQUISITES: 
1. Distinguishing between Authentication (verifying identity) and Authorization (restricting access/permissions).
2. Recognizing that "restricting access" and "restricting operations" are definitions of Authorization (Access Control).
3. Understanding that while Authentication is a prerequisite for Authorization, they are functionally distinct concepts in database security.
4. Overcoming the "All of the above" attractor, which often lures students who recognize that all options relate generally to "security."
5. Technical vocabulary: specifically the nuance of the word "method" in a security context.
