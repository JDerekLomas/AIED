PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the formal definition of a "superkey" (a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple).
2. Understanding the property of "monotonicity" or "superset property" in keys: if a set of attributes is a superkey, any superset of those attributes is also a superkey.
3. Reading and interpreting relational schema notation R(a,b,c).
4. Distinguishing between a "superkey" (which allows redundancy) and a "candidate key" (which must be minimal).
5. Applying the logic of "must" versus "could" in a formal set-theory context.
6. Avoiding the common misconception that adding attributes "breaks" a key's uniqueness property.
