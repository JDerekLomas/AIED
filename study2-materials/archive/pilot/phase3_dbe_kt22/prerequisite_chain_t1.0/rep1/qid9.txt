PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (identifying elements within braces).
2. Recognizing the minus sign (-) as the Set Difference operator rather than arithmetic subtraction.
3. Knowing the formal definition of Set Difference (elements in the first set that are NOT in the second set).
4. Correctly identifying the intersection of sets A and B ({4, 5}) to be removed.
5. Maintaining focus on the "left" set (A) as the source of the result, rather than the "right" set (B) or the union.
6. Filtering out irrelevant information (Sets C and D are "distractors" that are not part of the calculation).
