PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of a Cartesian product: Understanding that $A \times B$ results in a set of ordered pairs $(a, b)$.
2. Definition of an ordered pair: Knowing that the sequence of elements matters, such that $(a, b) \neq (b, a)$ unless $a = b$.
3. Definition of Set Equality: Knowing that for two sets to be equal, they must contain exactly the same elements.
4. Logical Quantifiers: Understanding the term "always" implies the statement must hold for all possible sets $A$ and $B$, including cases where $A \neq B$ and sets are non-empty.
5. Counter-example reasoning: Ability to mentally construct a simple case (e.g., $A=\{1\}, B=\{2\}$) to test the commutative property.
6. Distinguishing from Arithmetic: Overcoming the intuitive "interference" from scalar multiplication where $a \times b = b \times a$.
