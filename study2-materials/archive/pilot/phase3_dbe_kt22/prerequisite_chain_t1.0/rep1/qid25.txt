To answer this question correctly, a student must navigate several conceptual and symbolic hurdles. Even though the question is multiple-choice, the "failure points" are numerous because the distractors target specific common misconceptions in set theory and SQL logic.

**PREREQUISITES:**
1.  **Visual Set Identification**: Correct interpreting of the shaded area in a Venn diagram (identifying it as the "Left Only" or "A excluding B" region).
2.  **Set Notation Literacy (Union)**: Recognizing the symbol $\cup$ as a Union (combining all elements) rather than an Intersection.
3.  **Set Notation Literacy (Intersection)**: Recognizing the symbol $\cap$ as an Intersection (only common elements).
4.  **The Set Difference Operator**: Understanding that the minus sign ($-$) in set theory denotes the removal of elements found in the second set from the first.
5.  **Order of Operations (Parentheses)**: Correctly processing $(A \cup B)$ first before applying the subtraction of $B$.
6.  **Logical Equivalence Reasoning**: Recognizing that $(A \cup B) - B$ is mathematically equivalent to $A - B$ (or $A$ excluding the intersection), which matches the visual representation.
7.  **Distinguishing Similar Visuals**: Differentiating between "A" (the entire circle) and "A excluding B" (the crescent moon shape).

**COUNT: 7**
