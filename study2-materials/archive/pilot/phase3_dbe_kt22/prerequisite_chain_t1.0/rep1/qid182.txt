PREREQUISITES: 
1. Defining the acronym MAC (Mandatory Access Control) and distinguishing it from DAC (Discretionary Access Control) and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
2. Understanding the concept of a "security lattice" or hierarchical classification (e.g., Top Secret, Secret, Public).
3. Recognizing that in MAC, access is determined by the system/policy based on security clearances, not by the individual "owner" of the data.
4. Identifying that "GRANT/REVOKE" and "object owners" are specific characteristics of Discretionary Access Control (DAC), acting as distractors B and C.
5. Identifying that "assigning roles" is a characteristic of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), acting as distractor D.
6. Mapping the terminology "levels of security" and "classify" specifically to the MAC model.
