PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (braces and commas) to identify individual elements.
2. Knowing the definition of the Union operator ($\cup$) to combine sets A and B.
3. Correctly performing the union operation (realizing $A \cup B$ in this case is just set A, since B is a subset of A).
4. Knowing the definition of the "Proper Subset" symbol ($\subset$).
5. Distinguishing between a subset ($\subseteq$) and a proper subset ($\subset$) (crucial if the sets were identical).
6. Evaluating the logical relationship between the resulting set and set B.
7. Recognizing that if every element in B is in $(A \cup B)$ and $(A \cup B)$ contains at least one element not in B, the statement is true.
