PREREQUISITES:
1. Understanding the definition of a Set (unordered collection of elements).
2. Understanding the Cartesian Product operator (A x B) as the set of all possible ordered pairs (a, b).
3. Distinguishing between an element (e.g., 1) and an ordered pair (e.g., (1, a)).
4. Understanding the Subset symbol (⊆) and its formal definition (every element of the first set must be an element of the second set).
5. Recognizing that the elements of Set A are integers, whereas the elements of the Cartesian Product (A x B) are tuples.
6. Identifying that an integer is not equivalent to an ordered pair containing that integer (type mismatch).
7. Avoiding the "visual similarity" trap (seeing that the letters/numbers in the first set appear inside the pairs of the second set and assuming containment).
8. Ignoring the "distractor" sets C and D, which are irrelevant to the logic of the specific statement.
