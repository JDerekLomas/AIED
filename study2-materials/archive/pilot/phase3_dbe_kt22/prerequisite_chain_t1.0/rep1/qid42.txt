- Knowing the formal definition of a "Superkey" as a set of one or more attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple.
- Understanding the term "tuple" as a synonym for a row or record in a relational database.

- Identifying that "Subkey" is not a standard relational term in this context.
- Understanding that "Domain" refers to the set of allowable values for an attribute, not the attribute itself.
