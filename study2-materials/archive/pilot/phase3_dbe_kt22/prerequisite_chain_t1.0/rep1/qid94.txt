PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Definition of an Entity Type**: Understanding that an entity type represents a "thing" or "object" in the real world with independent existence, rather than just an attribute or a value.
2. **Reading and Parsing Narrative Requirements**: Extracting structural meaning from a dense paragraph of text and identifying nouns and their relationships.
3. **Distinguishing Attribute vs. Entity**: Recognizing that "Status type" (Option B) is a property of an equipment instance (an attribute with a domain of three values) rather than a standalone entity in this context.
4. **Distinguishing Constraint/Attribute vs. Entity**: Identifying that "Time slot" (Option D) is described as a property of a class used for a uniqueness constraint, not as a core object.
5. **Handling Subtyping/Specialization**: Recognizing that while "Trainer", "Administrator", and "Technician" are mentioned, they are categories of the "Employee" (Option C), which acts as a supertype entity.
6. **Identifying Relationship Attributes**: Recognizing that the "Report of each maintenance event" (Option A) is actually a record of a relationship between a Technician and Equipment, often modeled as a weak entity or associative entity given the date tracking.
7. **Negative Filtering**: Systematically eliminating options that serve better as attributes (Status, Time slot) to arrive at the most robust candidate for an entity.
