PREREQUISITES:
1. Distinguishing between Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) (e.g., understanding that "DELETE" is for rows, not schema).
2. Knowledge of the specific SQL keyword "ALTER TABLE" used for schema modification.
3. Knowledge of the specific clause "DROP COLUMN" required within an ALTER statement.
4. Correct interpretation of relational terminology ("Attribute" mapping to "Column" and "Relation" mapping to "Table").
5. Ability to recognize syntactically incorrect distractors that use valid keywords in an invalid order (e.g., Option C).
6. Multi-step reasoning to eliminate Option D, which is a common "false friend" for novice students who associate "Delete" with any form of removal.
