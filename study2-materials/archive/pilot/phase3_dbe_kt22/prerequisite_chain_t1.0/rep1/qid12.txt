PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the definition of the Union ($\cup$) operator (combining elements from both sets).
2. Recalling the definition of the Intersection ($\cap$) operator (identifying common elements only).
3. Understanding Order of Operations (Parentheses): Recognizing that the operation inside the brackets $(A \cup B)$ must be performed before the intersection with $C$.
4. Accurate execution of the first step: Correcting identifying $(A \cup B)$ as $\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$.
5. Accurate execution of the second step: Correcting identifying elements present in both $\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$ and $\{6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
6. Resilience to "Distractor D": Not confusing $\cap$ for $\cup$ or getting "lost" in the sequence of sets A, B, C, and D (recognizing that set D is irrelevant data).
