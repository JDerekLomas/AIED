PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Understanding the mathematical definition of a Relation:** Knowing that a relation is a set (of tuples) rather than a list or a sequence.
2. **Knowledge of Set Theory properties:** Understanding that sets are inherently unordered, meaning $\{a, b\} = \{b, a\}$.
3. **Distinguishing between a "Table" and a "Relation":** Recognizing that while a visual representation (table) has a specific visual order, the underlying logical model (relation) does not.
4. **Attribute Indifference:** Understanding that attributes are identified by name (labels), not by position, and thus their sequence in the schema is logically irrelevant.
5. **Vocabulary Comprehension:** Correct interpretation of the terms "tuple" (row) and "attribute" (column/field).
6. **Eliminating "Physical" Bias:** Overcoming the intuitive assumption that because data is stored in a file or displayed in a grid, that order is a defining characteristic of the data model.
