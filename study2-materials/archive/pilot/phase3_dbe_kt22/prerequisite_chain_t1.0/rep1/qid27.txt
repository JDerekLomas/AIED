PREREQUISITES: 
1. Interpreting a three-set Venn diagram layout (understanding spatial overlaps).
2. Knowledge of set notation symbols: Union (∪), Intersection (∩), and Difference (–).
3. Order of operations in set algebra (handling parentheses and left-to-right evaluation).
4. Distinguishing between "Set Difference" (removing an entire set) vs. "Relative Complement" in specific regions.
5. Visual scanning/elimination: Identifying that the shaded area represents elements in A or C that specifically exclude any membership in B.
6. Cognitive mapping of Option A: Realizing $(A \cup C)$ covers both circles entirely, and subtracting $B$ removes the middle "bridge" and the center, leaving exactly the two outer crescents.
7. Distinguishing Option A from Option D: Recognizing that Option D's subtraction of intersections $(B \cap A)$ and $(B \cap C)$ is redundant or incomplete compared to the simplicity of subtracting $B$ entirely.
