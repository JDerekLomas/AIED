PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of functional dependency (FD) equivalence (knowing that Σ1 ≡ Σ2 if and only if Σ1⁺ = Σ2⁺).
2. Knowledge of the reflexivity and transitivity rules (Armstrong's Axioms) to compute the closure of a set of dependencies.
3. Ability to perform attribute closure: specifically, calculating A⁺ under Σ1 to see if it yields {A, B, C}.
4. Ability to perform attribute closure: specifically, calculating A⁺ under Σ2 to see if it yields {A, B, C}.
5. Recognizing that Σ1 logically implies A → C (via transitivity: A→B, B→C), but Σ2 does not imply A → B.
6. Identifying a counter-example (e.g., A → B is in Σ1 but cannot be derived from Σ2).
7. Avoiding the "subset trap" (realizing that just because Σ2's dependencies are a subset of Σ1's logical implications, it doesn't mean they are equivalent in both directions).
