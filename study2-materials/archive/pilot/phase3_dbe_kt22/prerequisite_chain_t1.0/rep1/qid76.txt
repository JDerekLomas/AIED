To provide an accurate estimate, I have evaluated this question based on the specific context of the provided schema (assumed to contain data with overlaps) and the technical mechanics of the SQL `UNION` operator.

**PREREQUISITES:**
1.  **Reading Schema/Data:** Ability to correctly identify which rows in the `Study` table match the `CourseNo` criteria for 'COMP2400'.
2.  **Reading Schema/Data:** Ability to correctly identify which rows in the `Study` table match the `CourseNo` criteria for 'STAT2001'.
3.  **Understanding Projections:** Recognizing that only the `StudentID` column is being selected (and thus being compared for set operations).
4.  **SQL Keyword Knowledge (`UNION`):** Knowing that `UNION` by default performs a set operation and removes duplicate rows from the final result set.
5.  **Distinguishing Similar Concepts:** Differentiating `UNION` (distinct) from `UNION ALL` (duplicates allowed).
6.  **Identifying Overlap:** Checking if any students are enrolled in *both* COMP2400 and STAT2001 and accounting for that overlap in the final count.
7.  **Arithmetic/Counting:** Accurately tallying the final set of unique values.

**COUNT: 7**
