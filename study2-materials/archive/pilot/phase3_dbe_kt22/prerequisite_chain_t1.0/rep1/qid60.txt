PREREQUISITES: 
- Identifying the SQL command associated with the "add a new tuple" operation (INSERT).
- Recalling the specific mandatory keyword used to denote the values being added (VALUES).
- Recognizing the standard positional syntax for a table name in a DML statement (INSERT INTO [Table]).
- Distinguishing between valid SQL syntax and "pseudo-SQL" or natural language-sounding distractors (e.g., "enter").
- Understanding that the values must follow the table name/VALUES keyword, not precede them.
- Differentiating between the column-specification syntax and the value-insertion syntax.
