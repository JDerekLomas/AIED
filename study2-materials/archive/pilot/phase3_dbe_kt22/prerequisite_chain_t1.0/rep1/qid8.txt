PREREQUISITES: 
1. Definition of the Cartesian Product (A × B): Understanding that it represents the set of all ordered pairs where the first element is from A and the second is from B.
2. Ordered Pair Notation: Recognizing that in the tuple $(s, t)$, the position of the element determines its set membership.
3. Set Element Extraction: Ability to isolate the first elements $\{p, p, q, q\}$ and the second elements $\{x, y, x, y\}$ from the given set.
4. Set Uniqueness Property: Knowing that sets contain unique elements, thus $\{p, p, q, q\}$ simplifies to $\{p, q\}$.
5. Distinguishing Order of Sets: Recognizing that because A comes first in $A \times B$, A must contain the first elements of the pairs, eliminating the inverse (Option D).
