PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Definition of Cartesian Product ($A \times B$):** Understanding that elements are ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.
2. **Deconstruction of Ordered Pairs:** Ability to extract the set of first elements $\{2, 3, 4\}$ and map them to set $A$.
3. **Deconstruction of Ordered Pairs:** Ability to extract the set of second elements $\{5, 7\}$ and map them to set $B$.
4. **Cardinality Multiplication Rule:** Understanding that $|A \times B| = |A| \times |B|$.
5. **Deductive Reasoning (Solving for Set Sizes):** Given $|A \times B| = 6$ and at least 3 distinct first elements and 2 distinct second elements exist, the student must deduce that $|A|=3$ and $|B|=2$ (since $3 \times 2 = 6$).
6. **Set Reconstruction:** Correctly identifying $A = \{2, 3, 4\}$ and $B = \{5, 7\}$.
7. **Re-expansion:** Systematically generating all 6 pairs from $\{2, 3, 4\} \times \{5, 7\}$.
8. **Distinguishing Similar Concepts:** Avoiding the "reflexive" trap (Option A) or the "symmetry" trap (Option B).
