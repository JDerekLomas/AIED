To provide an accurate estimate, I am assuming the students are provided with a sample dataset (schema and populated tables) accompanying this question, as the numerical answers (11, 7, 4, 3) imply specific data is being queried.

**PREREQUISITES:**
1. **Schema Interpretation:** Ability to identify the relationship between the `Course` and `Enrol` tables via the `CourseNo` foreign key.
2. **Understanding SELECT \*:** Knowing that the star represents columns, but the question asks for the count of *rows*.
3. **Correlated Subquery Logic:** Understanding that the inner query executes in the context of each row of the outer query (`c.CourseNo=e.CourseNo`).
4. **EXISTS Operator Semantics:** Knowing that `EXISTS` returns a Boolean (True/False) based on whether the subquery returns *at least one* row, not the count of rows in the subquery.
5. **Deduplication Logic:** Realizing that even if a course has 100 enrollments, it only appears *once* in the result set because the `SELECT` is from the `Course` table.
6. **Set Matching:** Correctingly identifying the intersection of the two sets (Courses that appear in the Enrollment table) and counting them without error.
7. **Distinguishing EXISTS from JOIN:** Avoiding the common mistake of thinking this behaves like an `INNER JOIN`, which would return a row for every enrollment (potentially resulting in a higher number like 11 or 7).

**COUNT: 7**
