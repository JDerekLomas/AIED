PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Set Notation: Understanding that curly braces { } denote a set and commas separate distinct elements.
2. Understanding the Intersection Operator (∩): Knowing that A ∩ B requires identifying elements common to both sets A and B.
3. Accurate Set Intersection Execution: Correcting identifying that {4, 5} are the shared elements between {2, 3, 4, 5} and {4, 5, 6, 7}.
4. Understanding the Difference Operator (-): Knowing that A - B means "start with set A and remove any elements found in set B."
5. Order of Operations: Correcting processing the parentheses first (inner operation) before the outer subtraction.
6. Accurate Set Difference Execution: Removing {4, 5} from {2, 3, 4, 5} to arrive at {2, 3}.
7. Distinguishing Sets: Ignoring the irrelevant "distractor" sets C and D.
8. Multiple Choice Matching: Correcting mapping the calculated result {2, 3} to option A.
