PREREQUISITES:
1. Understanding the notation for the cardinality of a set ($|X|$).
2. Understanding the notation for the intersection of sets ($A \cap B$).
3. Understanding the notation for the union of sets ($A \cup B$).
4. Knowledge of the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle formula for two sets: $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$.
5. Ability to perform basic arithmetic (addition and subtraction) within the formula.
6. Recognizing that the intersection must be subtracted to avoid double-counting the overlapping elements.
