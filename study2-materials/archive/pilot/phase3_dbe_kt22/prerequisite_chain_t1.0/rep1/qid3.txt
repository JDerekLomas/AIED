3. Knowledge of the definition of "positive" (excluding zero and negative numbers).
4. Knowledge of the definition of "odd" (numbers not divisible by 2).
5. Understanding the inequality constraint "less than 10" (strict exclusion of 10 and numbers above it).
6. Ability to synthesize these constraints to generate or verify the sequence (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
7. Error checking/distinguishing between options (e.g., rejecting 'D' because it includes 11, or 'A' because it includes the even number 2).
