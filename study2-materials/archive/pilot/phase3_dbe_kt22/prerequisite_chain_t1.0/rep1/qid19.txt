PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Mathematical notation literacy**: Recognizing that curly braces `{}` denote a set.
2. **Knowledge of the Cartesian Product operator**: Recognizing that the symbol `x` (cross) represents the Cartesian product rather than scalar multiplication or set union.
3. **Understanding ordered pairs**: Knowing that the result of a Cartesian product is a set of tuples (coordinates) rather than individual elements.
4. **Distinguishing between S and T**: Correcting identifying that the operation is $S \times S$ and not $S \times T$ (which would include 3s).
5. **Systematic expansion**: Correcting applying the rule that every element in the first set must be paired with every element in the second set, resulting in $n^2$ elements.
