PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of the Union ($\cup$) operator: Understanding that it combines all unique elements from the involved sets.
2. Handling duplicates: Knowing that even if a number (like 4, 5, 6, or 7) appears in multiple sets, it is only listed once in the resulting set.
3. Associative property/Order of operations: Recognizing that $(A \cup B) \cup C$ requires finding the union of the first two sets and then uniting that result with the third.
4. Set notation literacy: Ability to read and interpret the curly brace $\{\}$ notation and commas as element separators.
5. Accurate data scanning (Manual "Join"): Correctly identifying every element from $A$, $B$, and $C$ without skipping values (specifically the number 3 in $A$).
6. Distinguishing distractors: Identifying that set $D$ is irrelevant information provided in the prompt.
7. Verification against options: Comparing the derived set $\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$ against the four choices and identifying B as the match.
