PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Knowledge of Set Notation:** Recognizing that {1,2} defines a set of discrete elements.
2. **Understanding the Cartesian Product (x):** Knowing that S x T results in a set of ordered pairs representing all possible combinations of elements from both sets.
3. **Execution of Cartesian Product (S x T):** Correctly identifying the 6 pairs in the first set: {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)}.
4. **Execution of Cartesian Product (S x S):** Correctly identifying the 4 pairs in the second set: {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}.
5. **Understanding Set Difference (-):** Knowing that the operation removes elements present in the second set from the first set.
6. **Relational Comparison/Matching:** Systematically comparing the two sets of pairs and correctly identifying which pairs remain.
7. **Eliminating Distractors:** Avoiding the common mistake of treating the sets as numbers or performing a simple subtraction of the cardinality (3-2=1).
