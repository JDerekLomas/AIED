PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the specific definition of a "Trojan horse" in a cybersecurity context (misleading appearance vs. malicious function).
2. Distinguishing between different types of malware (Trojan vs. Virus vs. Worm).
3. Knowing the specific technical definition of "self-replication" and which malware classes possess this trait.
4. Correctly processing a "NOT true" (negative phrasing) question, which requires identifying the three true statements and selecting the false one.
5. Recognizing that while Trojans may deliver a payload that replicates, the Trojan itself relies on social engineering/user action rather than autonomous replication.
