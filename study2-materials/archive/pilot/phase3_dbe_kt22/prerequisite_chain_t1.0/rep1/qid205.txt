PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of Concurrency Control terminology (specifically the "Standard Phenomena" defined in SQL-92).
2. Distinguishing between a "row-level" change (Unrepeatable Read) and a "set-level" change (Phantom Read).
3. Understanding the specific mechanism of the "Phantom Read" (newly inserted rows appearing in a subsequent range scan).
4. Eliminating "Dirty Read," which refers to reading uncommitted data rather than new insertions.
5. Eliminating "Lost Update," which refers to data loss during concurrent writes rather than a read anomaly.
6. Reading comprehension: identifying that "new rows" and "inserted" are the operational keywords in the prompt.
