PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of the Cartesian Product (B x B) as a set of ordered pairs.
2. Knowing the elements of set B (single characters/atoms).
3. Ability to compute B x B ({ (a,a), (a,b), (b,a), (b,b) }).
4. Understanding the subset symbol (⊆) and the requirement that every element of the left set must exist in the right set.
5. Distinguishing between an element (e.g., 'a') and an ordered pair (e.g., '(a,a)').
6. Recognizing that B contains atoms while B x B contains tuples, making the subset relation impossible.
7. Filtering out the distractor sets (A, C, D) which are irrelevant to the specific expression.
