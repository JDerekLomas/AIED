PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the formal definition of 3NF (every non-prime attribute is non-transitively dependent on the primary key).
2. Understanding the formal definition of BCNF (for every functional dependency X -> Y, X must be a superkey).
3. Distinguishing between "less restrictive" and "more restrictive" (recognizing that BCNF has a stricter requirement for determinants than 3NF).
4. Identifying the subset relationship between normal forms (knowing that all BCNF relations are in 3NF, but not all 3NF relations are in BCNF).
5. Understanding the specific limitation of BCNF regarding redundancy (recognizing that while it eliminates redundancy caused by functional dependencies, it does not account for multi-valued dependencies/4NF).
6. Multi-step reasoning to evaluate "eliminate" vs "minimize" in the context of data anomalies.
7. Technical vocabulary comprehension (specifically the nuance of "restrictive" in a formal logic context).
