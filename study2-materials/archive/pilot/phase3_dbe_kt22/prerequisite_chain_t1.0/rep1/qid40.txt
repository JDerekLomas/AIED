PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of relational model terminology (specifically the definition of "Attributes").
2. Ability to map formal terminology to a SQL-like schema declaration syntax.
3. Distinguishing between a schema (the structure) and an instance (the data).
4. Distinguishing between the name of the set (Relation) and the components of the set (Attributes).
5. Eliminating "Tuples" as a possibility by recognizing these are column headers, not rows of data.
6. Reading comprehension of the sentence structure to identify what the list of three items represents within the parenthetical notation.
