PREREQUISITES: 
1. Interpreting a Venn diagram (identifying that the shaded area represents the intersection of two sets).
2. Understanding set notation symbols ($\cup$ for Union, $\cap$ for Intersection, and $-$ for Difference).
3. Distinguishing between the logical "OR" (Union) and the logical "AND" (Intersection) in a visual context.
4. Recognizing that A - B represents elements in A only, and (A U B) - (A ∩ B) represents the symmetric difference (outer parts).
5. Mapping the visual "overlap" directly to the mathematical term "Intersection".
