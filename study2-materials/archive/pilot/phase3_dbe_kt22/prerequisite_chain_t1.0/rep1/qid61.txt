PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the specific SQL keyword `DELETE` for row-level operations versus `DROP` for schema-level operations.
2. Distinguishing between removing data (tuples) and removing the structure (table definition).
3. Recalling the mandatory syntax of the `DELETE` statement (requiring the `FROM` keyword).
4. Recognizing that `DROP` does not use a `FROM` clause.
5. Identifying the term "tuple" as a synonym for "row" or "record" in a relational context.
6. Eliminating distractor A, which incorrectly combines `DELETE` with the `TABLE` keyword (a common confusion with `DROP TABLE` or `TRUNCATE TABLE`).
