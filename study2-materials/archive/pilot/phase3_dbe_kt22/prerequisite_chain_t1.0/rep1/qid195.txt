PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the specific name of the Bell-LaPadula (BLP) property related to reading (No Read Up).
2. Distinguishing between the "Simple Security Property" and the "Star (*) Property."
3. Understanding the directionality of information flow in a multi-level security (MLS) model (subject vs. object clearance).
4. Correctly interpreting the phrase "retrieving information" as a "Read" operation.
5. Identifying that "higher security level" refers to the "Up" direction in the hierarchy.
6. Avoiding confusion with the Biba Integrity Model, which uses the inverse rules (Read Up/Write Down).
7. Recognizing that while "Read up" describes the action being prevented, the question asks which rule *prevents* it (the "No Read Up" or Simple Security rule).
