PREREQUISITES: 
1.  **Information Filtering**: Identifying that the question asks specifically about the relationship between "member" and "fitness class" while ignoring a large amount of distractors (equipment, technicians, administrators, associate members).
2.  **Schema Mapping**: Identifying the entity "member" and the entity "fitness class" from the text description.
3.  **Entity-Relationship Interpretation (Member to Class)**: Understanding the sentence "A member may choose to participate in one or more fitness classes" and translating "one or more" to a maximum cardinality of N.
4.  **Entity-Relationship Interpretation (Class to Member)**: Understanding the sentence "Each fitness class is attended by one or more members" and translating "one or more" to a maximum cardinality of N.
5.  **Cardinality Ratio Synthesis**: Combining the two directions (N from Member side, N from Class side) to conclude that the relationship is N:N.
6.  **Definition Recall**: Knowing that "cardinality ratio" refers to the maximum number of entity instances that can participate in a relationship instance.
7.  **Textual Analysis**: Distinguishing between the "personal trainer" relationship (which is 1:N or M:N depending on reading) and the "fitness class" relationship.
