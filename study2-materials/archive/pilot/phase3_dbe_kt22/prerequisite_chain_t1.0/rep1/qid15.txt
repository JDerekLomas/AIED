PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of Set Theory notation for Union ($\cup$): Understanding that $A \cup C$ combines all elements from both sets without duplicates.
2. Skill in Set Union execution: Correctly calculating $A \cup C = \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
3. Knowledge of Set Theory notation for Proper Subset ($\subset$): Understanding that $X \subset Y$ means every element of $X$ is in $Y$, and $X$ is not equal to $Y$.
4. Ability to evaluate the subset relationship: Comparing the union $\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$ against set $B = \{3, 5, 7\}$.
5. Understanding cardinality constraints: Realizing a larger set (8 elements) cannot be a subset of a smaller set (3 elements).
6. Distinguishing between subset ($\subseteq$) and proper subset ($\subset$) definitions (though not strictly necessary for this specific False result, it is a potential point of confusion).
7. Order of operations: Correctly processing the union inside the parentheses before evaluating the subset operator.
