PREREQUISITES:
1. Understanding set notation (the curly brace notation for sets).
2. Understanding the intersection ($\cap$) operator (elements common to both sets).
3. Logical deduction regarding set membership: If $A \cap B = \{2, 3\}$, then the elements 2 and 3 *must* be in set B.
4. Reasoning about set cardinality (size): If B contains at least $\{2, 3\}$, its size $|B|$ must be $\ge 2$.
5. Identifying the contradiction: Recognizing that if $|B| = 1$, it cannot possibly contain both 2 and 3.
6. Eliminating distractors: Recognizing that while B *could* be larger (e.g., $B = \{2, 3, 4, 5\}$), it cannot be smaller than the intersection.
