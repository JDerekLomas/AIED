PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of authentication factors: Distinguishing between "something you know" (password), "something you have" (mobile phone/SIM), and "something you are" (biometrics).
2. Identifying multiple stages: Recognizing that the scenario describes two distinct verification steps (password + SMS code).
3. Concept of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Understanding that combining two different categories of factors constitutes 2FA.
4. Distinguishing primary vs. comprehensive labels: Realizing that while A and B are components of the scenario, D is the most complete description of the *entire* process described.
5. Reading comprehension: Correcting mapping the SMS (received on a physical device) to "what you have" versus the password as "what you know."
6. Avoiding the "Single Factor" trap: Not stopping at option B just because a password is the first thing mentioned.
