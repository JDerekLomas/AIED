PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of SQL `CREATE TABLE` syntax (keyword usage and table naming).
2. Distinguishing between valid SQL delimiters (commas) and invalid ones (semicolons) within the column definition list.
3. Understanding that SQL statements in many DBMS environments and formal definitions require a terminating semicolon (`;`) to be considered a complete, "correct" statement.
4. Mapping the conceptual type `STRING` to a concrete SQL implementation type like `VARCHAR`.
5. Attention to detail in punctuation (recognizing the difference between Option B ending in a comma and Option C ending in a semicolon).
6. Multi-step reasoning to compare three nearly identical strings for minor syntactical differences.
