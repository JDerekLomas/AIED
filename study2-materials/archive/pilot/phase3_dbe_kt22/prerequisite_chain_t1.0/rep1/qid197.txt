PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the specific technical definition of "covert channel" as defined in the context of multilevel security and database security (e.g., Bell-LaPadula model).
2. Distinguishing between "secrecy of data" (the content) and the "nature of the communication path" (the mechanism).
3. Recognizing that covert channels utilize resources for communication that were not designed for that purpose (e.g., storage exhaustion or timing variations).
4. Eliminating distractor B: Students often incorrectly equate "covert" with "top secret data" rather than the method of transport.
5. Eliminating distractor D: Avoiding the confusion between a covert channel and a traditional network perimeter breach or "backdoor."
6. Understanding the terminology "not normally used for communication" as the defining characteristic of a covert channel versus a "legitimate" or "overt" channel.
