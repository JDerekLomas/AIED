PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of standard SQL character types (CHAR vs. VARCHAR).
2. Identifying the specific keyword "String" as a programming language convention (e.g., Java, Python) rather than a native PostgreSQL type.
3. Distinguishing between generic data types (conceptual) and implementation-specific keywords (PostgreSQL).
4. Familiarity with PostgreSQL's specific bit-string support (BIT), which is less common in standard introductory SQL courses.
5. Multi-step reasoning: Evaluating each option against a known list of valid keywords to find the "not supported" exception.
6. Avoiding the "false friend" trap: Many students assume because they use "String" in Java/C#, it must exist in SQL.
