PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of relational algebra/SQL terminology (specifically distinguishing "Join" from other operations).
2. Understanding the mechanism of a Join (horizontal concatenation of attributes based on matching criteria).
3. Distinguishing "Join" from "Union" (Union appends rows vertically and requires compatible schemas, rather than merging pairs into a single tuple).
4. Distinguishing "Join" from "Select" (Select acts on a single relation to filter rows, rather than combining two relations).
5. Reading comprehension of technical definitions (identifying that "merging pairs of matching tuples" implies a horizontal combination).
