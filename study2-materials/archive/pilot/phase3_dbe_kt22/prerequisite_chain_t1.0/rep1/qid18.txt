PREREQUISITES:
1. Identifying the notation for a Set (elements enclosed in curly braces).
2. Understanding the Set Difference operator (-) as "elements in the first set but not the second."
3. Executing the operation (A - B) correctly to get {3}.
4. Executing the operation (B - A) correctly to get {5}.
5. Understanding the Union operator (∪) as the combination of all unique elements from both sets.
6. Executing the final operation ({3} ∪ {5}) correctly to get {3, 5}.
7. Managing the order of operations (parentheses first).
8. Distinguishing the symmetric difference ({3, 5}) from the intersection ({1, 2}) or the simple union ({1, 2, 3, 5}).
