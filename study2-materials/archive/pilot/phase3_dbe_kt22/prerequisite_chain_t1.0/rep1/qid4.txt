PREREQUISITES:
1. **Set Notation Literacy**: Recognizing that curly braces `{}` denote sets and parentheses `()` denote ordered pairs.
2. **Definition of Cartesian Product**: Knowing that $A \times B$ results in the set of all possible ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.
3. **Order Sensitivity (Set level)**: Understanding that the first element of each pair must come from the first set mentioned ($A$) and the second from the second set ($B$). This is necessary to distinguish between $A \times B$ and $B \times A$ (eliminating Option D).
4. **Exhaustive Mapping**: Knowing that every element of $A$ must be paired with every element of $B$ (eliminating Option B).
5. **Precision in Execution**: Correctly verifying each pair in the set to ensure no "imposter" pairs (like $(b, b)$ in Option A) are included.
6. **Independence of Set Order**: Recognizing that the order of pairs within the resulting set does not matter (Option C lists them in a different order than the standard "1-mapping" then "2-mapping," which can confuse novices).
