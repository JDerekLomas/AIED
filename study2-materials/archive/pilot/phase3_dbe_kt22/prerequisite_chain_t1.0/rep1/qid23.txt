PREREQUISITES:
1. Understanding set notation (curly braces and element listing).
2. Understanding the definition of the set difference operator (-), specifically that it is non-commutative in most cases.
3. Ability to perform mental subtraction of elements for A - B (elements in A not in B).
4. Ability to perform mental subtraction of elements for B - A (elements in B not in A).
5. Recognizing that for A - B to equal B - A in these contexts, the result must usually be an empty set for both, implying A = B.
6. Identifying that in set theory, the order of elements within the braces does not change the identity of the set (relevant for options C and D).
7. Sustained attention to detail to compare the lists of numbers across four different options without a "slip" or oversight.
