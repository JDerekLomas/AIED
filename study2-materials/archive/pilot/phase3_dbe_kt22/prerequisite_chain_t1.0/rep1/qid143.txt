PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of Normal Forms definitions: Distinguishing between 3rd Normal Form (3NF) and Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF).
2. Understanding Decomposition Properties: Knowing the definitions of "Lossless Join" and "Dependency Preservation."
3. BCNF Limitations: Recognizing that BCNF cannot always guarantee dependency preservation (the classic trade-off).
4. 3NF Synthesis Algorithm: Recalling the existence of the "3NF Synthesis" (or Minimal Cover) algorithm and its guaranteed properties.
5. Uniqueness Property: Understanding that normalization via decomposition is a process-dependent path and that multiple valid decompositions (non-uniqueness) can exist for the same set of dependencies.
6. Technical Reading/Logic: Evaluating four distinct existential/universal claims and identifying the single mathematically guaranteed statement among them.
