PREREQUISITES: 
1. Vocabulary Mapping: Linking the informal term "table" to the formal mathematical term "relation" within the Relational Model.
2. Distinguishing Components: Differentiating between the set itself (Relation), the rows (Tuples), and the valid values for a column (Domain).
3. Eliminating Distractors: Recognizing that "Range" is a general mathematical term not typically used as a primary definition for a table in this context.
4. Reading Comprehension: Identifying the sentence structure as a request for a synonym or formal definition.
