PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a Super Key (SK) (a set of attributes whose closure contains all attributes in R).
2. Distinguishing between a Super Key and a Candidate Key (knowing that a SK does not have to be minimal).
3. Ability to compute the transitive closure of an attribute set ($A^+$) using a given set of Functional Dependencies ($\Sigma$).
4. Correct execution of the closure algorithm for $A$: 
   - Step 1: $A \to A$ (reflexivity)
   - Step 2: $A \to B$ (given), so $A \to AB$
   - Step 3: $B \to C$ (given), so $A \to ABC$
5. Identifying that the attribute $D$ is missing from the closure $A^+$ (since $D$ does not appear on the right-hand side of any FD, it must be in the key/starting set).
6. Correctly concluding that because $A^+ = \{A, B, C\}$ and $D \notin A^+$, $A$ cannot be a Super Key.
7. Logic processing: Mapping the result "False" to the multiple-choice option B.
