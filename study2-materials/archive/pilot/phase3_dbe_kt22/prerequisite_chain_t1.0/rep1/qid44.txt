1. Understanding the formal definition of a "superkey" as a uniqueness constraint on attributes.
2. Distinguishing between "attributes" (columns) and "tuples" (rows) to reject Option B.
3. Understanding the hierarchical relationship between keys (every candidate key is a superkey, but not every superkey is a candidate key) to reject Option C.
4. Distinguishing between identifying data *within* a relation versus identifying the relation itself (metadata/schema level) to reject Option D.
5. Vocabulary comprehension of the term "uniquely identify" in a relational context.
6. Ability to navigate a "distractor" definition (Option B) that reverses the functional dependency direction.
