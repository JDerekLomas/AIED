PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of set notation (curly braces and elements).
2. Understanding the Cartesian product symbol (x) and how to form a set of ordered pairs.
3. Understanding the subset symbol (⊆) and the condition required for one set to be a subset of another.
4. Ability to compute the elements of A x A (ordered pairs (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)).
5. Ability to compute the elements of A x C (ordered pairs (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)).
6. Applying the subset rule: checking if every element in the first calculated set exists in the second calculated set.
7. Identifying "noise" data: recognizing that sets B and D are irrelevant to the specific calculation (distinguishing relevant vs. irrelevant information).
8. Logical evaluation: concluding that because {1,2} is a subset of {1,2,3}, the Cartesian product A x A must be a subset of A x C.
