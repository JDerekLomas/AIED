To assess this question, we must first look at the schema provided (implied by the data). For the result to be "4, 3" (D), the table `Study` must contain four non-null values for `units` and the smallest value must be 3.

PREREQUISITES:
1. **Schema Reading**: Correcting identifying the `units` column in the `Study` table.
2. **Aggregate Function Logic (COUNT)**: Understanding that `COUNT(column_name)` counts the number of non-null entries in that specific column.
3. **Aggregate Function Logic (MIN)**: Identifying the smallest numerical value in the column.
4. **Distinguishing Nulls**: Recognising whether a cell is empty/null and knowing that `COUNT(column)` excludes it while `COUNT(*)` includes it.
5. **Syntax Ordering**: Understanding that the output follows the order of the SELECT clause (Count first, then Min).
6. **Data Scanning**: Accurately scanning the provided table rows without an oversight error (mechanical accuracy).
7. **Eliminating Distractors**: Distinguishing between the number of rows in the table vs. the number of non-null entries in the specific column.
