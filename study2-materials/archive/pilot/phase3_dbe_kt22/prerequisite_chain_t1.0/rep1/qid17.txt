PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of Set Theory notation: Understanding the symbols for intersection ($\cap$) and proper subset ($\subset$) vs. the "not a subset" negation ($\not\subset$).
2. Order of Operations (Grouping): Recognizing that the operation inside the parentheses $(A \cap C)$ must be performed first.
3. Intersection Logic: Correct identification of elements common to both set A and set C.
4. Subset Definition: Knowing that $B \subset X$ is true if every element in B is in X, and B is not equal to X.
5. Negation Logic: Understanding that the question asks if the subset relationship is *false* (applying the "not" to the result).
6. Precision/Attention to detail: Avoiding the confusion between "subset" ($\subseteq$) and "proper subset" ($\subset$), though in this specific case it may not change the boolean result, it is a common point of hesitation.
7. Set Membership Verification: Mentally or physically mapping $\{3, 5, 7\}$ against the result of $\{3, 5, 7, 9\}$.
