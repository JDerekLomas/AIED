PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (the meaning of $|X|$ as the number of elements).
2. Recognizing the $\times$ operator as the Cartesian product symbol in the context of sets.
3. Knowing the definition of a Cartesian product (the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$).
4. Knowing the mathematical rule for the cardinality of a Cartesian product ($|A \times B| = |A| \times |B|$).
5. Basic arithmetic multiplication ($3 \times 2$).
6. Distinguishing between the Cartesian product and a Set Union (which would result in 5, Option A).
