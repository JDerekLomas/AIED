PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a Cartesian product (the set of all ordered pairs).
2. Correctly identifying the elements of the set A x B.
3. Correctly identifying the elements of the set C x D.
4. Understanding the subset symbol (⊆) and the condition that every element in the first set must exist in the second.
5. Evaluating the inclusion of each specific ordered pair (e.g., recognizing (1,a) is in both).
6. Distinguishing between the elements of the sets (integers/characters) and the elements of the products (ordered pairs).
7. Avoiding the "trap" of comparing the sets A to C and B to D independently without confirming the product logic.
