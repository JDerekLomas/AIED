PREREQUISITES: 
1. Definition of a Candidate Key (CK): Understanding that a CK must be both a superkey (uniqueness) and minimal (no smaller subset is a superkey).
2. Attribute Closure Algorithm: Knowing how to compute the closure of a set of attributes ($X^+$) using the given functional dependencies.
3. Functional Dependency (FD) Application: Correctly applying the augmentation or transitivity rules (e.g., recognizing that if $A \to B$ and $AB \to C$, then $A \to C$).
4. Distinguishing CK from Superkey: Recognizing that while $A$ derives all attributes, one must verify if it is the smallest such set (which it is, as it's a singleton).
5. Schema Interpretation: Identifying that the relation $R$ consists of attributes $\{A, B, C\}$.
6. Logical Evaluation: Correctly concluding that because $A^+ = \{A, B, C\}$, $A$ satisfies both the sufficiency and minimality requirements for a CK.
