PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of set equality (two sets are equal if and only if they contain the exact same elements).
2. Understanding that order does not matter in a set (associating {1, 2, 3} with {2, 1, 3}).
3. Understanding that cardinality must be identical for sets to be equal.
4. Ability to perform a visual one-to-one mapping (checking each element in A exists in B and vice versa).
5. Distinguishing between "subset" relationships and "equality" (avoiding the trap that A is "in" B in option B).
