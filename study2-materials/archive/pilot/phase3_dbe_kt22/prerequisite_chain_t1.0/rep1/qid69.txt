To provide an accurate assessment, I am assuming a standard (though not provided) schema where `Study` is a table containing a `Name` column, and the student is presented with a small sample dataset of approximately 5–10 rows.

**PREREQUISITES:**
1. **Schema Interpretation:** Identifying that `Study` refers to a table name and `Name` is an attribute (column) within that table.
2. **Keyword Semantics (SELECT/FROM):** Understanding that the query retrieves data rows from the specified table.
3. **Filtering Logic (WHERE):** Understanding that the `WHERE` clause acts as a horizontal filter, excluding any rows that do not meet the criteria.
4. **String Literal Matching:** Recognizing that `'Tom'` is a case-sensitive (or case-insensitive depending on the DB engine, but usually literal in exercises) string match and distinguishing it from similar values (e.g., 'Tommy' or 'tom').
5. **Set Cardinality Counting:** Correcting counting the occurrences that satisfy the condition rather than returning the index or the value itself.
6. **Handling "SELECT *":** Understanding that while `*` selects all columns, the question asks for the count of *rows*, requiring the student to realize column count does not affect row count.
7. **Literal vs. Identifier:** Distinguishing between the string value `'Tom'` and a potential column name or variable.

**COUNT: 7**
