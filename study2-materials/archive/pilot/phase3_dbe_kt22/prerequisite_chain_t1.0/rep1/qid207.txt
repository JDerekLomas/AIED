PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) by name.
2. Understanding the specific function of a "Transaction Manager" vs. other components (like the Lock Manager or Integrity Manager).
3. Understanding the mechanism of "Logging" (Write-Ahead Logging) and its role in recovery.
4. Distinguishing between properties maintained via concurrency control (Isolation) and those maintained via recovery/logs (Atomicity and Durability).
5. Identifying "Integrity" (or Consistency) as a property typically maintained by the programmer or constraints, not primarily through the transaction log.
6. Eliminating distractors that combine a logging-related property with a locking-related property.
