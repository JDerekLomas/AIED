PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Definition of 3NF**: Knowing the specific criteria for Third Normal Form (removal of transitive dependencies).
2. **Definition of BCNF**: Knowing that Boyce-Codd Normal Form is a stricter version of 3NF (every determinant must be a superkey).
3. **Understanding the Normal Form Hierarchy**: Recognizing that normal forms are nested (progressive) sets where each higher form (BCNF) is a subset of the previous one (3NF).
4. **Logical Implication/Directionality**: Distinguishing between "A implies B" and "B implies A" in a formal logic context.
5. **Technical Vocabulary**: Understanding the difference between "must be" (necessity) and "cannot be" (mutual exclusivity) in a multiple-choice format.
