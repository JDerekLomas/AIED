PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of "concurrency" in a database context (multiple transactions executing at once).
2. Understanding "throughput" as the number of transactions completed per unit of time.
3. Understanding "average response time" and how interleaving tasks prevents long transactions from blocking short ones (the "convoy effect").
4. Understanding "resource utilisation" (keeping the CPU and Disk busy while one process waits for I/O).
5. Recognizing that these three metrics are positively correlated in a multi-programming/multi-transaction environment.
6. Identifying the "All of the above" structure as a requirement to validate every preceding option rather than just picking the first plausible one.
