PREREQUISITES:
1.  **Defining RBAC core concepts**: Knowing that in Role-Based Access Control, a "role" is an abstraction representing a set of permissions or a job function, not the resource being accessed itself.
2.  **Distinguishing Roles from Resources**: Identifying that "files, printers, and mailboxes" are resources (objects) rather than roles (subjects/actors). This eliminates Option A.
3.  **Distinguishing Roles from Entities/Hardware**: Recognizing that "User" and "Workstation" are the actors or the tools used, but in RBAC, the role acts as the intermediary. This eliminates Option C.
4.  **Applying RBAC to organizational structure**: Understanding that roles are typically mapped to job functions or departments to simplify permission management.
5.  **Filtering irrelevant distractors**: Identifying that "Resource and department" (Option D) is a category description, not a list of specific roles to be implemented in a system.
6.  **Contextual Reasoning**: Matching the four functional departments mentioned in the prompt (Sales, Marketing, Management, Production) to the logical "roles" required to manage their specific access needs.
