PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Domain Vocabulary Mapping**: Ability to distinguish between "Real-world Entities" (Fitness centre, Employee) and "Data Attributes" (ID, Name) within a dense narrative.
2. **Entity vs. Attribute Distinction**: Understanding that an entity (Associate member, Fitness class) is an object with its own properties, while an attribute is a single characteristic of an entity.
3. **Reading Schema Constraints**: Identifying that "Associate member" has its own properties (associate number, name) and a relationship (to a member), disqualifying it as a simple attribute.
4. **Keyword Recognition**: Recognizing that a "unique ID" is the quintessential definition of a primary key/attribute.
5. **Relationship Parsing**: Understanding that "Fitness class" is a central entity around which schedules, members, and trainers revolve, rather than a property of something else.
6. **Contextual Filtering**: Recognizing that "Fitness centre" is the system boundary/root context in this scenario, not a piece of data stored within a table.
7. **Multi-paragraph Information Synthesis**: Maintaining focus on the specific question ("Which of the following...") while filtering out distractors like "status types," "maintenance events," and "time slots."
