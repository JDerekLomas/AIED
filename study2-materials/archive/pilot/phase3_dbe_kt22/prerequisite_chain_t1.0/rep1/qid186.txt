PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of the definition of Discretionary Access Control (DAC) specifically within a database context.
2. Distinguishing between "Discretionary" (owner-based) and "Mandatory" (rule/label-based) access control models.
3. Understanding the concept of "Ownership" in SQL/relational databases (the creator is usually the owner).
4. Identifying the role and limitations of a Database Administrator (DBA) versus an Object Owner in a DAC system.
5. Recognizing that in DAC, the "discretion" belongs to the owner of the specific object, not necessarily a central authority (debunking C).
6. Evaluating Option A by understanding that "unowned" objects are generally not a feature of standard DAC implementations (everything created has a creator/owner).
7. Reading and interpreting technical English phrasing (distinguishing between "an owner" and "the DBA").
