PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of Set Notation: Recognizing that {1,2} represents a set of discrete elements.
2. Understanding Cartesian Product (x): Knowing that (C x D) results in a set of ordered pairs representing all possible combinations of elements from C and D.
3. Calculating Cardinality: Realizing that (C x D) has 3 * 3 = 9 elements and (A x B) has 2 * 2 = 4 elements.
4. Understanding Set Difference (-): Knowing that the operation removes elements found in the second set from the first set, rather than performing arithmetic subtraction on values.
5. Identifying Subsets: Recognizing that (A x B) is a proper subset of (C x D) in this specific case.
6. Execution/Mapping: Correcting mapping the elements to ensure (1,c), (2,c), and all pairs starting with 3 are retained.
7. Distinguishing Options: Carefully comparing the resulting set of 5 elements against the provided distractors (Option B is the subtrahend; Option C is a partial product).
