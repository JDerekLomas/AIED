PREREQUISITES:
1. Distinguishing between DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands.
2. Understanding the specific definition of "remove relation schema" (dropping the entire structure vs. deleting rows).
3. Recalling the exact SQL keyword for structural removal (`DROP` vs. `DELETE`).
4. Identifying the correct syntax for the `DROP` command (requiring the `TABLE` keyword in standard SQL).
5. Avoiding the distractor "relation," which is the formal relational model term but not the SQL keyword.
6. Reading and interpreting the schema notation (understanding that $R$ refers to the table name).
