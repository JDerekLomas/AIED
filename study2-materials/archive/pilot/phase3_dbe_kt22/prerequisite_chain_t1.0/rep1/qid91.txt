PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition and visual representation of a "Key" attribute in an ER diagram (usually underlined).
2. Understanding the definition of a Primary Key (PK) as a unique identifier for an entity.
3. Understanding the definition of a Foreign Key (FK) as a mechanism for cross-referencing between tables.
4. Distinguishing between conceptual modeling (ERD) and logical/relational modeling (Schema/Tables); specifically, knowing that FKs are implementation details of relationships and are typically not explicitly drawn as attributes in a standard ER diagram.
5. Understanding the definition of a Domain Constraint (data types, ranges, or sets of values) and recognizing that standard ER diagrams do not visually enforce or display these constraints.
6. Multi-step reasoning: Evaluating each option against the visual syntax of a standard ER diagram to determine which is explicitly supported.
