PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a SQL View as a derived/virtual table rather than a physical one.
2. Knowledge of the SQL Authorization model (Grant/Revoke) and how ownership differs between base tables and views.
3. Distinguishing between "creation rights" and "functional privileges" (specifically that privileges on a view are bounded by the creator's privileges on the underlying base tables).
4. Understanding the specific criteria for an "updatable view" (e.g., views involving joins, aggregations, or missing non-null columns are not inherently updatable).
5. Recognizing that the term "all privileges" (Option D) includes Delete, Insert, and Update, which may be restricted by the view definition itself.
6. Logical reasoning to identify that "not necessarily" (Option C) is the only statement that accounts for the restrictions imposed by complex view definitions.
7. Careful reading of the word "always" in Options A and B, which acts as a logical trap.
