PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding Functional Dependency (FD) notation (A → BC means A determines B and C).
2. Ability to compute the closure of an attribute set (e.g., determining if A+ or {B,C}+ covers all attributes).
3. Identifying all Candidate Keys (CKs) of the relation (recognizing that both {A} and {B,C} are keys).
4. Distinguishing between Prime and Non-prime attributes (recognizing that A, B, and C are all prime).
5. Formal definition of Third Normal Form (3NF) (understanding the "or" condition: LHS is a superkey OR RHS is prime).
6. Formal definition of Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) (strict requirement: LHS must be a superkey).
7. Applying definitions to a specific case (checking if BC → A violates BCNF despite meeting 3NF criteria).
8. Multi-step logical reasoning to compare results against multiple-choice options.
