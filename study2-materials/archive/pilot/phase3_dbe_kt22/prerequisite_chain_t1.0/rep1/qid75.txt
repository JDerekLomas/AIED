To provide an accurate assessment, it is noted that the schema and data for the `Study` table were not provided in your prompt. However, based on standard pedagogical examples for this specific query type in South African CS curricula (often involving a table with 5–8 rows), I will identify the prerequisites based on the logic required to solve such a problem.

**PREREQUISITES:**
1. **Schema Interpretation:** Ability to identify that `CourseNo` is the grouping attribute.
2. **Mental Grouping Logic:** Understanding that `GROUP BY` collapses multiple rows with the same `CourseNo` into a single bucket.
3. **Aggregate Function Logic:** Knowing that `COUNT(*)` counts the number of rows within each specific bucket, not the total rows in the table.
4. **HAVING Clause Filtering:** Understanding that `HAVING` acts as a filter on the *results* of the aggregation, specifically excluding groups where the count is 1 or 0.
5. **Output Cardinality Recognition:** Realizing the question asks for the number of **rows** in the final result set (the number of groups that passed the filter), rather than a value from within the table.
6. **Distinguishing WHERE vs. HAVING:** Not being confused by the lack of a `WHERE` clause or thinking the filter applies to individual rows before grouping.
7. **Data Processing Accuracy:** Successfully scanning the (implied) dataset and accurately counting occurrences for each unique ID without a clerical error.

**COUNT: 7**
