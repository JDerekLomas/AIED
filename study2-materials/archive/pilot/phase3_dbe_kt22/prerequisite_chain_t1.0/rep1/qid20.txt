PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set subtraction notation ($T - S$): identifying elements in $T$ that are not in $S$.
2. Performing the subtraction operation correctly: $\{1,2,3\} - \{1,2\} = \{3\}$.
3. Understanding the Cartesian product operator ($\times$): knowing it results in a set of ordered pairs, not a union or scalar multiplication.
4. Defining the Cartesian product correctly: $\{1,2\} \times \{3\} = \{(1,3), (2,3)\}$.
5. Distinguishing between a set of single elements (Option A) and a set of ordered pairs (Options B and C).
6. Executing multi-step symbolic reasoning: solving the inner parentheses before the outer operation.
