To answer this question correctly, a student must navigate several specific conceptual and technical hurdles.

**PREREQUISITES:**
1.  **SQL Keyword Recognition:** Understanding that `SELECT *` retrieves all columns and `FROM Study` identifies the target table.
2.  **Schema Reading:** Correcting identifying the "Name" column in the provided (though here implicit) table schema.
3.  **Function Application (`lower`):** Knowing that the `lower()` function transforms string data to lowercase for the duration of the comparison.
4.  **Case-Sensitivity Awareness:** Understanding that in standard SQL (and most pedagogical environments like PostgreSQL or Oracle), string comparisons are case-sensitive unless transformed.
5.  **Literal Matching:** Recognizing that the string literal `'tom'` is all lowercase.
6.  **Data Scanning:** Accurately scanning the rows of the (implicit) table to find entries where the name is "Tom", "TOM", or "tom".
7.  **Counting Logic:** Correcting tallying the matches to arrive at the final integer.
8.  **Distinguishing Metadata from Data:** Not accidentally counting the header row or ignoring rows due to formatting.

**COUNT: 8**

**Your estimate:**
0.65
