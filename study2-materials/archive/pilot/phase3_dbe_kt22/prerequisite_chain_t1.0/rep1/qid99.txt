PREREQUISITES:
1. **Reading Comprehension & Information Filtering**: The ability to parse a long, detail-heavy narrative and extract only the relevant information regarding the structure of "employees" versus their specific roles, while ignoring distractions like "maintenance dates" or "time slots."
2. **Knowledge of EER Modeling Concepts**: Understanding the specific definition of a "Superclass" (a generalized entity type) and a "Subclass" (a specialized subgrouping of an entity type).
3. **Distinguishing Entity vs. Attribute**: Recognizing that "Trainer" is described as a category of "Employee" with its own specific relationships (instructing classes), meaning it is an entity type in its own right, not merely a simple text attribute/domain of the employee.
4. **Recognition of Specialization/Generalization**: Identifying the "is-a" relationship (e.g., a Trainer *is an* Employee) from the phrase "employees are classified into three categories."
5. **Technical Vocabulary Mapping**: Connecting the conceptual "is-a" hierarchy to the specific database terminology of "Superclass and subclass" (Option C).
6. **Elimination of Distractors**: Understanding that "Attribute and domain" refers to data types/values, and "Entity and relationship" refers to how distinct things interact, neither of which describes the categorical hierarchy mentioned.
