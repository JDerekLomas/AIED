PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a **Primary Key** (identifying it as a unique identifier for a tuple).
2. Knowledge of the **Entity Integrity Constraint** (specifically the rule regarding null values in primary keys).
3. Distinguishing between a **simple primary key** and a **composite primary key** (identifying that this schema has three attributes forming one key).
4. Understanding the logical implication of "None" vs. "At least one" in the context of a composite key (recognizing that the constraint applies to *every* component of the key individually).
5. Understanding the term **Null** in a database context (representing missing or unknown data).
6. Multi-step reasoning: Connecting the specific schema (Enrol) to the general rule of Entity Integrity.
