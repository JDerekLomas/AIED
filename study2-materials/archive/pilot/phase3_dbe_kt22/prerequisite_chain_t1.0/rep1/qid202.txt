PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of the "ACID" acronym and the specific definition of each letter.
2. Distinguishing between "Consistency" as a general database state (the 'C' in ACID) and the specific formal criterion for execution correctness in a multi-user environment.
3. Understanding the definition of "Serializability" as the formal benchmark for concurrent transaction execution.
4. Distinguishing between the properties of an individual transaction (Atomicity, Consistency) and the property of an interleaved schedule (Serializability).
5. Recognizing the "distractor" nature of Option D, which appeals to students who vaguely associate all three terms with transaction "correctness" without knowing the technical definition of a "correctness criterion" in concurrency control.
6. Reading and interpreting the technical term "correctness criterion" as a specific academic definition rather than a general English phrase.
