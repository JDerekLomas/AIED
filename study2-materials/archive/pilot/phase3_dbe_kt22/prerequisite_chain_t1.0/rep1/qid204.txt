PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of the Two-Phase Locking (2PL) protocol (Growing Phase vs. Shrinking Phase).
2. Understanding the "Lock Point" rule: the fundamental constraint that no new locks can be acquired once any lock has been released.
3. Distinguishing between Basic 2PL and Strict/Rigorous 2PL (to recognize that while locks *can* be held until commit, releasing them earlier is the defining boundary of the shrinking phase in the general protocol).
4. Recognizing that 2PL does not require pre-declaration of all locks (distinguishing it from Conservative 2PL).
5. Interpreting the logical structure of a "Multiple Choice - All of the above" question.
6. Reading and parsing the specific terminology "can not acquire any more locks" as the definition of the shrinking phase.
