PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the notation of a relation schema $R$ and a set of Functional Dependencies $\Sigma$.
2. Understanding the concept of an attribute closure (the set of all attributes functionally determined by a specific attribute).
3. Knowing the reflexive rule: an attribute always determines itself ($D \to D$).
4. Ability to identify applicable dependencies: recognizing that $D \to ABC$ can be triggered because $D$ is the left-hand side.
5. Ability to perform transitive reasoning (augmentation/transitivity): understanding that if $D \to B$ and $B \to C$, then $C$ is included (though in this specific case, $ABC$ is given directly).
6. Union rule application: combining the results of the initial attribute with the discovered attributes to form the set $\{D, A, B, C\}$.
7. Set comparison: mapping the result $\{A, B, C, D\}$ to the provided multiple-choice options.
