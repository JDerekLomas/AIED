PREREQUISITES:
1. Understanding the syntax and scope of the SQL `GRANT` command (DCL).
2. Distinguishing between schema-level objects (relations/tables) and data-level components (tuples/rows).
3. Knowing that Column-Level Security exists in SQL (the ability to grant privileges on specific attributes).
4. Recognizing that standard SQL does not support granting privileges to individual rows (tuples) via the `GRANT` statement; this usually requires Row-Level Security (RLS) policies or views, not the `GRANT` command itself.
5. Interpreting the phrase "cannot be granted privileges," which requires identifying the exception among the options.
6. Handling the "None of the above" distractor, which requires confidence that at least one of the other options is indeed restricted.
