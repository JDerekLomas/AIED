PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (braces and elements).
2. Understanding the Cartesian Product operator (x) and how to form ordered pairs.
3. Knowing the definition of the Subset operator (⊆).
4. Identifying the specific elements of (A x A) which are {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}.
5. Identifying the specific elements of (C x C) (9 pairs in total).
6. Applying the subset rule: verifying if every ordered pair in the first set exists in the second set.
7. Distinguishing between set elements (integers vs. characters) to ignore irrelevant sets B and D (noise/distractor sets).
8. Recognizing that since A ⊆ C, it follows mathematically that (A x A) ⊆ (C x C).
