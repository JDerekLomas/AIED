PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of 3NF (Third Normal Form).
2. Understanding the definition of BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form).
3. Ability to compare the strictness/hierarchy of normal forms (knowing BCNF is "stronger" or "more restrictive" than 3NF).
4. Distinguishing between "minimizing" and "eliminating" redundancy (understanding that functional dependencies and transitive dependencies are handled, but some redundancy may remain).
5. Recognizing that BCNF was specifically designed to address anomalies that 3NF allows to persist.
6. Reading comprehension to identify that "more restrictive" in Option A is mathematically inverted (BCNF $\subset$ 3NF).
