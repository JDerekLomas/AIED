PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of Set Difference (-): Understanding that $X - Y$ results in elements in $X$ that are not in $Y$.
2. Definition of Set Intersection (∩): Understanding that $X \cap Y$ results in only elements common to both sets.
3. Order of Operations (Parentheses): Recognizing that the operations inside the brackets must be performed before the intersection.
4. Execution of (A - D): Correctly identifying that $\{2, 3, 4, 5\} - \{8, 9, 10, 11\} = \{2, 3, 4, 5\}$ (Disjoint sets).
5. Execution of (B - C): Correctly identifying that $\{4, 5, 6, 7\} - \{6, 7, 8, 9\} = \{4, 5\}$.
6. Execution of Final Intersection: Correctly identifying that $\{2, 3, 4, 5\} \cap \{4, 5\} = \{4, 5\}$.
7. Distinguishing Symbols: Not confusing the intersection symbol (∩) with the union symbol (∪).
