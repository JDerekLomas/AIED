3. Understanding the functional role of the "Concurrency Control" subsystem within a DBMS.
4. Distinguishing "Isolation" (preventing interference) from "Durability" (handled by Recovery Manager).
5. Eliminating distractors (Storage Manager and File Manager) that deal with physical data layout rather than logical transaction properties.
6. Mapping the theoretical concept (Isolation) to the specific architectural component (Concurrency Control).
