PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the `WITH GRANT OPTION` clause (allowing users to pass on privileges).
2. Knowledge of the ownership model (the owner, Linda, holds all rights initially).
3. Tracking the state of the authorization graph after sequential operations.
4. Distinguishing between direct grants (Linda to Peter) and indirect grants (Amy to Peter).
5. Understanding the `CASCADE` keyword and its recursive effect on the authorization graph.
6. Identifying "independent paths" of privilege: recognizing that Peter holds the privilege from two distinct sources (Linda and Amy).
7. Applying the rule that a privilege remains valid if at least one valid granting path exists back to the owner.
8. Reasoning that revoking Amy's privilege only breaks the path Linda -> Amy -> Peter, but does not affect the direct path Linda -> Peter.
