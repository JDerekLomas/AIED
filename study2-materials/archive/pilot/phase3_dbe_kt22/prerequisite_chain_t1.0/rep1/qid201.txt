PREREQUISITES:
1. Understanding the definition of a "Dirty Read" (reading uncommitted data).
2. Understanding the definition of an "Unrepeatable Read" (data changing between two reads in the same transaction).
3. Understanding the definition of a "Phantom Read" (new rows appearing between two reads).
4. Knowledge of the four standard SQL transaction isolation levels (Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable).
5. Mapping the specific combination of allowed/disallowed phenomena to the correct level (specifically, that Read Committed prevents dirty reads but is the "weakest" level to do so).
6. Distinguishing between "Read Committed" and "Repeatable Read" (a common point of confusion where students flip the two).
7. Identifying that the question asks for a level that *does* allow unrepeatable/phantom reads, necessitating a process of elimination or direct recall of the isolation hierarchy.
