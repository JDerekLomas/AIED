To provide an accurate assessment, I am assuming the `Study` table contains data where the `units` column has values such as $\{6, 4, \text{NULL}, 8\}$ or similar, leading to the intended answer **B (3, 4)**.

**PREREQUISITES:**
1. **Understanding Aggregate Functions**: Knowing that `COUNT` and `MIN` summarize rows into a single output row.
2. **Handling NULLs in COUNT**: Understanding that `COUNT(column_name)` ignores `NULL` values, whereas `COUNT(*)` would include them.
3. **Handling NULLs in MIN/MAX**: Knowing that `MIN` ignores `NULL` values and returns the smallest numerical value present.
4. **Schema/Data Interpretation**: Correcting identifying the "units" column in a provided (though implicit here) table and counting the non-null entries.
5. **Positional Mapping**: Mapping the first result of the query (`COUNT`) to the first number in the tuple and the second (`MIN`) to the second.
6. **Distinguishing COUNT from SUM**: Avoiding the common novice error of summing the values instead of counting the occurrences.

**COUNT: 6**
