PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (braces and elements).
2. Understanding the Cartesian product operator (x) and how it generates ordered pairs.
3. Ability to mentally or physically construct the set (A x A) which contains 4 elements.
4. Ability to mentally or physically construct the set (C x C) which contains 9 elements.
5. Understanding the subset symbol (⊆) and its formal definition (every element in the first set must exist in the second).
6. Identifying that A is a subset of C (A ⊆ C).
7. Applying the theorem/rule that if X ⊆ Y, then (X x X) ⊆ (Y x Y).
8. Ignoring "distractor" sets B and D which are irrelevant to the specific expression.
9. Distinguishing between "element of" and "subset of" logic.
