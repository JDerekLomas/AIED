PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of the definition of Discretionary Access Control (DAC) and its primary mechanism (identity-based ownership).
2. Understanding the "discretionary" nature of DAC: that an owner can pass permissions to others.
3. Recognizing the specific security vulnerability of DAC regarding information flow (the Trojan Horse problem where a malicious program acts with the user's permissions).
4. Distinguishing between DAC and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to eliminate Option D.
5. Identifying that DAC is based on identity, not primarily on certificates (which relates more to PKI or specific authentication protocols), to eliminate Option B.
6. Reading comprehension to distinguish between "relies on" and "does not rely on" in Options A and C.
7. Connecting the concept of "inherent flaw" specifically to the Trojan Horse attack in the context of academic database security theory.
