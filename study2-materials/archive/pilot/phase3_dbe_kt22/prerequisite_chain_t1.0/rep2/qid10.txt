PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of set notation (interpreting curly braces and commas as a collection of distinct elements).
2. Understanding the intersection operator (∩) as identifying elements common to both sets A and B.
3. Understanding the set difference operator (-) as the removal of elements in the second set from the first set.
4. Correct order of operations (evaluating the expression inside the parentheses first).
5. Precision in element matching (ensuring 4 and 5 are identified in both sets, while 2 and 3 are not).
6. Distinguishing between set difference (A - B) and symmetric difference or union.
7. Filtering out irrelevant information (recognizing that sets C and D are "distractors" not required for the calculation).
