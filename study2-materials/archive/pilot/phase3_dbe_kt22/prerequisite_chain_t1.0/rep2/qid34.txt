PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a Cartesian product (A x B) as a set of ordered pairs.
2. Recognizing the notation for set equality/assignment (A = {1, 2}).
3. Understanding the definition of the subset relation (⊆), specifically that every element in the first set must exist in the second.
4. Correctly computing the elements of A x A: {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}.
5. Correctly computing (or conceptually verifying) the elements of A x C: {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)}.
6. Evaluating the truth value of the subset statement by comparing the two resulting sets.
7. Distinguishing between a subset (⊆) and a proper subset (⊂) or element-of (∈) symbol (though not strictly required here, confusion leads to hesitation).
8. Logical reasoning to realize that since A ⊆ A and A ⊆ C, it follows that A x A ⊆ A x C without necessarily enumerating all pairs.
