PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of Normal Forms (specifically the definitions and properties of 3NF vs. BCNF).
2. Understanding the concept of "Lossless-Join Decomposition."
3. Understanding the concept of "Dependency Preservation."
4. Distinguishing between the existence of a form and the existence of an algorithmic guarantee for specific properties (3NF guarantees both; BCNF only guarantees losslessness).
5. Knowing that normalization/decomposition is not a unique process (multiple valid sets of tables can satisfy a normal form).
6. Interpreting formal notation (R for the set of attributes, Σ for the set of Functional Dependencies).
7. Identifying the "falsehood" in universal claims (recognizing that "always unique" is a very strong and usually false property in database design).
8. Eliminating distractors by recalling the specific "3NF Synthesis Algorithm" properties.
