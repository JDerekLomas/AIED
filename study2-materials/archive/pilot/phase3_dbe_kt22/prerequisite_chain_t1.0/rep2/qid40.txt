PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Knowledge of Relational Model Terminology**: Distinguishing between the formal mathematical terms used in databases (Relation, Attribute, Tuple) and their common table-based counterparts (Table, Column, Row).
2. **Reading a Schema Declaration**: Understanding the syntax `SchemaName(Property1, Property2, ...)` and identifying that the items inside the parentheses are the components of the schema.
3. **Distinguishing Structure from Data**: Differentiating between the definition of the container (Attribute) and the actual data stored within it (Instance/Tuple).
4. **Vocabulary Mapping**: Specifically identifying that "courseID", "courseName", and "semester" represent categories of data (columns), which map to the term "Attributes".
5. **Elimination of Distractors**: Recognizing that "Relations" refers to the table as a whole and "Tuples" refers to the individual rows/records.
