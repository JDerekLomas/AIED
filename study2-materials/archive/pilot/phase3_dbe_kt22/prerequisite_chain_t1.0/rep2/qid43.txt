PREREQUISITES: 
1. Vocabulary recognition: Understanding the term "Relational data model".
2. Definition recall: Knowing the definition of "Referential Integrity" (the requirement that a value in one relation must exist in another).
3. Concept differentiation: Distinguishing between various types of keys (Candidate, Super, Primary, and Foreign).
4. Functional mapping: Identifying that "Foreign keys" are the specific mechanism used to link tables, whereas the other options relate primarily to uniqueness within a single table.
5. Technical terminology: Understanding that "enforcing" a relationship in a schema context implies the use of a constraint.
