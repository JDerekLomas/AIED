PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a "prime attribute" (an attribute that is a member of at least one candidate key).
2. Knowledge of how to calculate the closure of an attribute set ($X^+$) under a given set of functional dependencies ($\Sigma$).
3. Understanding the definition of a "candidate key" (a minimal superkey).
4. Ability to identify all candidate keys for a relation, not just the first one found.
5. Multi-step reasoning: 
   - Testing $\{A\}^+$ to find it determines $\{A, B, C\}$, making $A$ a candidate key.
   - Testing $\{B\}^+$ to find it determines $\{A, B, C\}$, making $B$ a candidate key.
   - Testing $\{C\}^+$ to find it determines $\{A, B, C\}$, making $C$ a candidate key.
6. Synthesizing the results: Since $A$, $B$, and $C$ are each members of at least one candidate key, they are all prime.
7. Distinguishing between "prime attributes" and "primary key" (students often mistakenly think only the attributes in the *chosen* primary key are prime).
