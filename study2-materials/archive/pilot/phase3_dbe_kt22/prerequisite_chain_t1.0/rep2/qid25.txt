To provide an accurate estimate, I am assuming the "figure" referred to is a standard Venn diagram with two overlapping circles, A and B, where the **entirety of circle A is shaded, excluding the intersection with B** (the "left moon" shape).

PREREQUISITES:
1. **Visual Literacy (Set Diagrams):** Ability to interpret a Venn diagram and identify which logical region is being highlighted.
2. **Symbol Recognition ($\cup$):** Knowing that the "cup" symbol represents the Union of sets (all elements in both).
3. **Symbol Recognition ($\cap$):** Knowing that the "cap" symbol represents the Intersection of sets (common elements only).
4. **Operator Knowledge (Set Difference):** Understanding that the minus sign ($-$) in set theory denotes relative complement (elements in the first set that are not in the second).
5. **Operator Precedence/Grouping:** Understanding that operations inside parentheses must be evaluated before the operation outside (as seen in options B and D).
6. **Logical Elimination:** Recognizing that Option A is incorrect because the shaded area is a subset of A, not all of A.
7. **Mapping Representation to Logic:** Mentally testing each formula against the diagram. For example, realizing that $(A \cup B) - B$ removes all of B from the union, leaving exactly the "A-only" shaded area.

COUNT: 7
