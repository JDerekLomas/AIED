PREREQUISITES: 
1. Definition of a Superkey (a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple).
2. Definition of a Candidate Key (a minimal superkey).
3. Definition of a Primary Key (a candidate key selected by the DBA).
4. Understanding the hierarchy of inclusion (Candidate Keys are a subset of Superkeys).
5. Distinguishing between "minimal" and "non-minimal" sets (All candidate keys satisfy the superkey property, but not all superkeys satisfy the minimality requirement).
6. Distinguishing between a property (being a key) and an administrative choice (selecting a Primary Key).
7. Logical quantifier reasoning (understanding the implications of the word "always" in a set-theoretic context).
