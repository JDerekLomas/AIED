PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of set notation (braces and comma-separated elements).
2. Understanding the intersection operator (∩) as the set of elements common to both sets.
3. Performing the intersection calculation correctly: (A ∩ C) = {3, 5, 7, 9}.
4. Understanding the subset symbol (⊆ or ⊂).
5. Understanding the "not a subset" symbol (⊄).
6. Distinguishing between a "proper subset" (⊂) and a "subset" (⊆) and how the negation (⊄) applies to the specific relationship.
7. Logical evaluation of the statement: B = {3, 5, 7} is a subset of {3, 5, 7, 9}, therefore the claim that it is "not a subset" is false.
8. Avoiding the "double negative" confusion (evaluating a false statement as the answer "False").
