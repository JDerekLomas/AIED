PREREQUISITES: 
1. Vocabulary: Knowing that "tuple" is a formal term for a row/record.
2. Vocabulary: Knowing that "attribute" is a formal term for a column/field.
3. Conceptual Definition: Understanding the mathematical definition of a relation as a *set* (where order does not matter).
4. Physical vs. Logical Distinction: Distinguishing between how data is stored/displayed (which has an order) and the logical model (which does not).
5. Schema comprehension: Understanding that attributes are identified by name, not by position.
6. Eliminating "Common Sense" bias: Overcoming the intuitive assumption that because we read tables top-to-bottom and left-to-right, the order must be "important."
7. Dual-Task Coordination: Correctly mapping the two separate concepts to the correct order in the multiple-choice pairing (avoiding a "swap" error).
