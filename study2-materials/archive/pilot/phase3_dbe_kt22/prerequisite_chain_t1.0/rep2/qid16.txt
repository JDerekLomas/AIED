PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of Set Theory notation: Identifying the symbol $\cup$ as the Union operator (combining elements of both sets).
2. Knowledge of Set Theory notation: Identifying the symbol $\subset$ as the Proper Subset operator (or potentially interpreting it as a general subset $\subseteq$, as some South African high school curricula use these interchangeably).
3. Ability to perform a Union operation: Correcting determining that $A \cup B = \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$ (recognizing that $B$ is already a subset of $A$).
4. Logical evaluation of inclusion: Determining if every element in $B$ is present in the resulting set $(A \cup B)$.
5. Distinguishing between Proper and Improper subsets: Recognizing that for $B \subset (A \cup B)$ to be true, $B$ must be a subset and $B \neq (A \cup B)$.
6. Filtering irrelevant information: Recognizing that Set $C$ is a "distractor" and not required for the calculation.
7. Identifying the relationship between sets: Recognizing that since $B$ is a subset of $A$, $A \cup B$ is simply $A$.
