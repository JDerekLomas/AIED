PREREQUISITES: 
1. Defining DAC: Understanding that Discretionary Access Control is based on the concept of object ownership rather than centralized mandatory labels.
2. Understanding "Discretionary": Recognizing that the "discretion" belongs to the owner of the object, not necessarily a central authority (the DBA).
3. Distinguishing Roles: Differentiating between the privileges of a Database Administrator (DBA) and a private Object Owner.
4. Identifying Ownership Rules: Knowing that in a standard DAC model (like the one implemented in SQL), every object must have an owner (usually the creator).
5. Eliminating Distractors: Recognizing that Option C describes a centralized or mandatory-like control if applied to all objects, which contradicts the "discretionary" nature of individual ownership.
6. Terminology nuances: Understanding that "full control" in Option D includes the right to grant/revoke access to others (GRANT OPTION).
