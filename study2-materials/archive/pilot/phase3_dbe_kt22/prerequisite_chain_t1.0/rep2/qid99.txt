PREREQUISITES: 
1. Reading comprehension: Ability to extract the specific entities (Employee, Trainer, Administrator, Technician) from a dense narrative description.
2. Conceptual Modeling: Understanding the concept of specialization/generalization in E-R modeling.
3. Terminology: Distinguishing between "Entity", "Attribute", "Relationship", and "Domain".
4. Hierarchy recognition: Identifying that "Employee" is the general category and the others are specific types (IS-A relationship).
5. Distractor filtering: Ignoring irrelevant domain constraints (e.g., maintenance dates, time slots, associate members) to focus only on the specific relationship asked.
6. Mapping concepts to labels: Correctly identifying the "Superclass/Subclass" terminology as the formal way to describe a parent-child entity relationship.
