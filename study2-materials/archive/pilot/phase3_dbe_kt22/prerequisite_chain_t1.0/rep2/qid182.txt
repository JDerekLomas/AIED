PREREQUISITES: 
1. Defining the acronym MAC (Mandatory Access Control) and distinguishing it from DAC (Discretionary Access Control) and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
2. Understanding the concept of "labels" or "classifications" (e.g., Top Secret, Secret) inherent to MAC.
3. Identifying that in MAC, access is determined by a central policy/system rule rather than the object owner.
4. Recognizing "GRANT/REVOKE" and "owner-defined access" as characteristics of Discretionary Access Control (DAC), acting as distractors B and C.
5. Distinguishing between "Roles" (Option D) and "Security Levels" (Option A).
6. Ability to map the term "Security Levels" to the hierarchical lattice structure used in MAC implementations like Bell-LaPadula.
