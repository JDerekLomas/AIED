PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of set cardinality notation: Understanding that |X| represents the number of elements.
2. Recognition of set operators: Distinguishing between intersection (∩) and union (∪).
3. Knowledge of the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle: Recalling the formula |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|.
4. Substitution and Arithmetic: Correctly plugging values into the formula (10 + 5 - 2) and performing the subtraction.
5. Avoiding common misconceptions: Not simply adding the sizes of A and B (15) or subtracting the intersection from only one set.
