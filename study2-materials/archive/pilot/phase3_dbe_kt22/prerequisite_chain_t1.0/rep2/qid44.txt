PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of a Superkey: Understanding that it refers to a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a row (tuple).
2. Knowledge of Relational Terminology: Distinguishing between "attribute" (column) and "tuple" (row) to avoid Option B.
3. Key Hierarchy/Relationship: Understanding that a candidate key is a *minimal* superkey, meaning not all superkeys are candidate keys (to eliminate Option C).
4. Scope of Uniqueness: Understanding that keys identify records *within* a relation, not the relation itself globally (to eliminate Option D).
5. Discerning "Attribute" vs "Tuple" roles: Recognizing that attributes identify tuples, not vice versa.
6. Reading comprehension: Careful parsing of the phrasing in Option A vs Option B which flips the subject and object.
