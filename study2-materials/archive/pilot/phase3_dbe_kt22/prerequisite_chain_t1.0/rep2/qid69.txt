To provide an accurate assessment, I am assuming a standard relational schema where `Study` is a table containing a `Name` column, and the student is presented with a small sample dataset (e.g., 5-10 rows) where the name 'Tom' appears a specific number of times.

**PREREQUISITES:**
1.  **Schema Interpretation**: Identifying that `Study` is the table name and `Name` is the attribute/column to be filtered.
2.  **SQL Keyword Proficiency**: Understanding that `SELECT *` retrieves full rows and `FROM` specifies the source.
3.  **Predicate Logic (`WHERE`)**: Understanding that the `WHERE` clause acts as a filter that only includes rows satisfying the condition.
4.  **String Literal Matching**: Recognizing that `'Tom'` is a case-sensitive (usually, depending on collation) string literal and must match exactly.
5.  **Set Cardinality/Counting**: The ability to manually scan the provided data and count the occurrences of the specific value without skipping or double-counting.
6.  **Distinguishing "Rows" from "Columns"**: Ensuring the student counts the horizontal records, not the attributes.
7.  **Handling Nulls/Duplicates**: If the dataset includes "Tommy" or "TOM", the student must correctly exclude them based on exact matching rules.

**COUNT: 7**
