PREREQUISITES: 
1. Vocabulary knowledge: Defining the "Dirty read" phenomenon (reading uncommitted data).
2. Vocabulary knowledge: Defining the "Unrepeatable read" phenomenon (updates/deletes to existing rows).
3. Vocabulary knowledge: Defining the "Phantom read" phenomenon (insertions affecting range queries).
4. Conceptual distinction: Distinguishing between a change to an *existing* row (Unrepeatable) versus the appearance of a *new* row (Phantom).
5. Technical literacy: Understanding the context of "Transaction Isolation Levels" and concurrency control.
6. Reading comprehension: Identifying the specific trigger in the prompt ("new rows... inserted").
7. Eliminating distractors: Recognizing "Lost update" as a write-write conflict rather than a read phenomenon.
