PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of Set Theory notation for Union ($\cup$): Understanding that $A \cup C$ combines all elements from both sets without duplicates.
2. Execution of Set Union: Correcting identifying that $\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\} \cup \{3,5,7,9\} = \{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$.
3. Knowledge of Set Theory notation for Proper Subset ($\subset$): Distinguishing that the symbol means every element of the left set must be in the right set, and the left set must be smaller (not equal).
4. Logical Comparison of Set Cardinality: Recognizing that a larger set (8 elements) cannot be a subset of a smaller set (3 elements).
5. Avoiding "Member of" Confusion: Not confusing the subset symbol ($\subset$) with the element-of symbol ($\in$).
6. Distinguishing Subset directions: Ensuring the student doesn't reverse the logic (i.e., checking if B is a subset of A $\cup$ C).
