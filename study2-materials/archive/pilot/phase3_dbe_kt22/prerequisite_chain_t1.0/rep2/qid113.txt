PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding functional dependency (FD) notation ($X \to Y$).
2. Understanding the definition of "closure of an attribute set" ($X^+$).
3. Ability to execute the attribute closure algorithm (initialization step: $D^+ = \{D\}$).
4. Identifying applicable dependencies from $\Sigma$ based on the current set (matching LHS).
5. Applying the augmentation/transitivity rule (knowing $D \to ABC$ means $D^+$ now includes $\{D, A, B, C\}$).
6. Recognizing that the order of the attributes in the result set does not matter.
7. Identifying the final set $\{A, B, C, D\}$ and mapping it to the correct multiple-choice option (ABCD).
