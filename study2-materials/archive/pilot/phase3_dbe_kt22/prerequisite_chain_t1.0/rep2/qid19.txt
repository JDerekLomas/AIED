PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the notation of sets using curly braces {}.
2. Recognizing the "x" operator as the symbol for a Cartesian Product (Cross Join) rather than arithmetic multiplication.
3. Knowing the definition of a Cartesian Product: the set of all possible ordered pairs (a, b) where a is from the first set and b is from the second.
4. Distinguishing between a set of individual elements and a set of ordered pairs (tuples).
5. Identifying the specific operands (S x S) and ignoring the "distractor" set T.
6. Correct execution of the combinatorial process to ensure all pairs (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2) are generated without omission.
