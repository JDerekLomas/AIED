To provide an accurate estimate, I am assuming the students are provided with a sample **Study** table instance (as the question implies a specific count). If no table is provided, the question is unsolvable; assuming a standard introductory exercise schema where the table contains roughly 4-6 rows with some duplicate `CourseNo` values.

**PREREQUISITES:**
1.  **Schema Interpretation:** Understanding that `Study` is a table name and `CourseNo` is an attribute (column) within that table.
2.  **SQL Keyword Recognition (SELECT):** Knowing that this operation retrieves data from the specified column.
3.  **Keyword Logic (DISTINCT):** Understanding that this keyword forces the engine to eliminate duplicate values from the result set.
4.  **Data Scanning:** Ability to manually scan the provided table instance and identify all unique values in the `CourseNo` column.
5.  **Counting Logic:** Correcting counting the unique set (cardinality) rather than the total number of rows in the table.
6.  **Distinguishing Set vs. Bag:** Avoiding the common pitfall of simply counting all entries because "they are in the table."

**COUNT: 6**
