PREREQUISITES:
1. Identifying the candidate key(s) from a set of functional dependencies (recognizing that A determines all other attributes, so A is the unique candidate key).
2. Distinguishing between prime attributes (A) and non-prime attributes (B, C).
3. Understanding the definition of Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF): every determinant must be a superkey.
4. Applying the BCNF definition to the FD A→BC (identifying that A is a superkey, so it satisfies BCNF).
5. Understanding the definition of Third Normal Form (3NF) and the "relaxation" rule (an FD is valid if the determinant is a superkey OR the RHS consists of prime attributes).
6. Knowing the hierarchy of normal forms (specifically that BCNF implies 3NF).
7. Correctly interpreting the logical conjunctions in the multiple-choice options (e.g., "R is in X and R is in Y").
