PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a "Transaction" in a database context.
2. Knowledge of the Lock Compatibility Matrix (understanding that an Exclusive (X) lock is the most restrictive).
3. Distinguishing between Shared (S) locks and Exclusive (X) locks.
4. Knowing that "Write" operations (Update/Insert/Delete) implicitly require an Exclusive lock.
5. Understanding that holding an Exclusive lock is a "superset" privilege that inherently permits the holder to Read the data (as you cannot modify what you cannot access).
6. Distinguishing between the specific action "Write" and the broader capability "Read and write" in a multiple-choice context.
7. Recognizing that "Update" (Option D) is a subset of "Write" and therefore not the most complete description of allowed operations.
