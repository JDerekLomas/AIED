PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the `GRANT OPTION` and its role in delegating administrative rights.
2. Recognizing "Owner" status (Linda) as the root of the privilege chain.
3. Understanding the syntax and effect of the `GRANT` statement between users.
4. Distinguishing between revoking a specific privilege versus revoking only the `GRANT OPTION`.
5. Understanding the `CASCADE` keyword and how it propagates through a dependency graph.
6. Multi-step reasoning: Realizing that if the *root* privilege (Select) remains but only the *option* to grant it is removed, the dependent grants made while the option was valid typically persist (unless the privilege itself was revoked).
7. Recognizing the specific behavior of SQL standards regarding `REVOKE GRANT OPTION... CASCADE`: specifically, that revoking the option from Amy forces the revocation of privileges from those who received it from her (Peter), because his privilege is dependent on her having the grant option.
8. Distinguishing between Option A and Option B based on the specific mechanics of the "Grant Pipe" being cut.
