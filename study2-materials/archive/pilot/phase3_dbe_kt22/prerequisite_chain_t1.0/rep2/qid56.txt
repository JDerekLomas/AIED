PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of `char(n)`: Recalling that "char" (character) without the "var" prefix represents a fixed-length storage allocation in SQL.
2. Definition of `varchar(n)`: Understanding that "var" is shorthand for "variable" and indicates that the database only stores the actual characters provided plus metadata.
3. Distinguishing similar keywords: Correctly mapping the "Fixed" vs "Variable" concepts to the specific order presented in the sentence (char first, varchar second).
4. English vocabulary/Technical terminology: Understanding the difference between the words "fixed" (constant/unchanging) and "variable" (able to change/proportional to content).
5. Pattern matching: Correctly selecting Option C from a list of four permutations (AA, BB, AB, BA).
