PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set subtraction notation (T - S) to identify elements in T not in S.
2. Correctly performing the subtraction operation ({1,2,3} - {1,2} = {3}).
3. Understanding the Cartesian product symbol (x) as an operation producing ordered pairs.
4. Knowing the definition of a Cartesian product (S x Result) where each element of the first set is paired with each element of the second.
5. Multi-step reasoning: maintaining the order of operations (solving the parentheses first).
6. Distinguishing between a set of single values (Option A) and a set of ordered pairs (Option C).
7. Avoiding the "distributive" trap or mental shortcut of thinking the answer must involve all three numbers in a simple set.
