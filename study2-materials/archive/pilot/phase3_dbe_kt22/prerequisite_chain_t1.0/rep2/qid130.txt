PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of Functional Dependency (FD) notation ($A \to B$) and the concept of a closure set.
2. Understanding the Lossless Join property: knowing that for a decomposition into $R1, R2$ to be lossless, $R1 \cap R2$ must be a superkey for either $R1$ or $R2$ in the context of the original FDs.
3. Identifying the intersection: $R1 \cap R2 = \{B\}$.
4. Applying the Lossless Join rule: Recognizing that because $B \to C$ is a given FD, $B$ is a key for $R2$, thus the decomposition is lossless.
5. Understanding the Dependency Preservation property: knowing that the union of FDs enforceable on the individual projections ($R1$ and $R2$) must be able to derive all original FDs in $\Sigma$.
6. Projecting FDs: Determining that $A \to B$ is preserved in $R1$ and $B \to C$ is preserved in $R2$.
7. Synthesizing the check: Confirming that since both original FDs are directly present in the decomposed schemas, the decomposition is dependency preserving.
8. Distinguishing between "Lossless Join" and "Dependency Preserving" to select the correct combination (Option A).
