PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the formal definition of a "covert channel" as specifically involving the use of mechanisms not intended for communication (e.g., timing, storage exploitation).
2. Distinguishing "covert" (hidden/unintended path) from "secret" (encrypted or classified data content), which addresses Distractor B.
3. Distinguishing "covert" from "secure/trusted" (authorized paths), which addresses Distractor C.
4. Understanding that a security perimeter breach (Distractor D) describes a vulnerability or an intrusion, but not necessarily the *mechanism* of a covert channel.
5. Interpreting technical academic English (especially for English Second Language students) to differentiate between "secretly passing information" and "transmitting secret data."
