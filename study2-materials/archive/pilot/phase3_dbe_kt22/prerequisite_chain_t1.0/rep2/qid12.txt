PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of Set Notation: Understanding that curly braces { } denote a set and commas separate elements.
2. Understanding the Union Operator (∪): Knowing that it combines all unique elements from both sets.
3. Understanding the Intersection Operator (∩): Knowing that it identifies only the elements present in both sets.
4. Order of Operations (Parentheses): Recognizing that the operation inside the parentheses (A ∪ B) must be performed first.
5. Accurate Set Construction: Correctly identifying that A ∪ B = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.
6. Element Matching: Correctly comparing the intermediate set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} with set C {6, 7, 8, 9} to find commonalities.
7. Distinguishing Operators: Not confusing ∪ with ∩ (a common error among students new to Discrete Math/Relational Algebra).
