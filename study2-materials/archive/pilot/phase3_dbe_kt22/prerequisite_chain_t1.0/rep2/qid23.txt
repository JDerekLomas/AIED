PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of Set Theory notation (braces and comma-separated elements).
2. Understanding the definition of the Set Difference operator (A - B), specifically that it is non-commutative in most cases.
3. Recognizing that for A - B to equal B - A, the resulting sets must be identical (usually implying both are the empty set).
4. Ability to perform mental subtraction of elements for Option A (Result: {1} vs {4}).
5. Ability to perform mental subtraction of elements for Option B (Result: ∅ vs {4}).
6. Understanding that set order does not matter (Option C: A and B contain the same elements, thus A = B).
7. Ability to perform an exhaustive comparison of elements in Option D to identify the discrepancy (the number 6).
8. Multi-step reasoning: Evaluating each option independently to find where the symmetric difference is null.
