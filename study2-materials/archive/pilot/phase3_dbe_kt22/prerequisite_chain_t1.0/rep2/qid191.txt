PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of Authentication: Knowing that authentication specifically refers to identity verification (who are you?) rather than permission management.
2. Distinguishing Authentication from Authorization: Recognizing that "restricting access" and "restricting operations" are definitions of Authorization (what can you do?), not Authentication.
3. Reading comprehension of technical distractors: Identifying that options A, B, and C are variations of access control/privileges.
4. Evaluating "All of the above": Recognizing that if the individual components (A, B, C) describe Authorization, the collective option (D) must also be incorrect for a question about Authentication.
5. Vocabulary precision: Understanding that "restricting" implies a policy enforcement (Authorization) rather than a credential check.
