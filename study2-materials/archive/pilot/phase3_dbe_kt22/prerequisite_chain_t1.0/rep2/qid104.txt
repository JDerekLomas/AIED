PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Filtering relevant information**: The ability to isolate the specific sentence regarding the relationship between trainers and fitness classes from a dense, multi-paragraph word problem containing "noise" (e.g., technicians, equipment, associate members).
2. **Definition of Participation Constraint**: Knowing the difference between "Total" (every instance must participate) and "Partial" (some instances may not participate).
3. **Keyword Identification**: Identifying the specific phrase "Not all trainers deliver fitness classes" as the logical anchor for the constraint.
4. **Logical Mapping**: Mapping the phrase "Not all" to the concept of optionality/partial participation.
5. **Entity-Relationship terminology**: Understanding that "instruct" is the name of the relationship and "trainer" is the entity being queried.
6. **Distinguishing Cardinality from Participation**: Ensuring the student does not confuse "only one trainer" (cardinality/ratio) with the participation constraint.
