PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of the ACID properties (specifically distinguishing Atomicity, Consistency, and Isolation).
2. Understanding the technical definition of "correctness" in the context of database concurrency control (as opposed to general data integrity).
3. Distinguishing between a property of a single transaction (Atomicity/Consistency) and a property of an execution schedule (Serializability).
4. Recognizing "Serializability" as the formal criterion that ensures a concurrent schedule is equivalent to a serial one.
5. Overcoming the "All of the above" distractor, which is tempting because all options are "good" database properties.
6. Identifying that Consistency is a prerequisite for correctness but not the *criterion* for evaluating concurrent interleaving.
