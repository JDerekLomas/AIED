PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of the Union ($\cup$) operator: Understanding that it combines elements from sets and removes duplicates.
2. Recognition of mathematical set notation: Understanding that $\{...\}$ represents a collection of elements.
3. Order of operations/Associativity: Recognizing that the parentheses $(A \cup B)$ indicate the first operation, followed by the union with $C$.
4. Set element identification: Correctly identifying the specific members of sets $A$, $B$, and $C$.
5. Accurate execution of the first union: Correctly forming the intermediate set $\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$.
6. Accurate execution of the second union: Correctly adding elements from $C$ to the intermediate set to reach $\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
7. Distinguishing the "distractor" set $D$: Ignoring set $D$, which is irrelevant to the specific expression provided.
8. Pattern matching/Verification: Comparing the derived result against the multiple-choice options without making a clerical error.
