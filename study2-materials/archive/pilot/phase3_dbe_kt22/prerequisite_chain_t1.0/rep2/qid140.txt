PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the hierarchical relationship between normal forms (knowing that BCNF is "stronger" or "stricter" than 3NF).
2. Distinguishing between "eliminating" and "minimizing" redundancy (recognizing that 3NF allows certain functional dependencies, like $X \rightarrow A$ where $A$ is prime, which can still result in redundancy).
3. Recalling the specific definition of 3NF (specifically the third condition regarding prime attributes).
4. Recalling the definition of BCNF (every determinant must be a superkey).
5. Interpreting technical distractors (identifying that "more restrictive" in option A is the inverse of the actual relationship).
6. Evaluating absolute vs. relative claims (recognizing that 3NF is a compromise form compared to the stricter BCNF).
