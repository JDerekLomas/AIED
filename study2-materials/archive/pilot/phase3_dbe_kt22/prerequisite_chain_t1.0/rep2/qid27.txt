PREREQUISITES:
1. Interpretation of a three-set Venn diagram: Mapping physical shaded regions to abstract set relationships.
2. Understanding Set Union ($\cup$): Identifying that $A \cup C$ combines the entirety of both circles.
3. Understanding Set Intersection ($\cap$): Identifying that $B \cap A$ and $B \cap C$ refer to the overlapping segments.
4. Understanding Set Difference (–): Knowing that subtracting a set removes any elements belonging to that set from the result.
5. Operator Precedence/Order of Operations: Correctly processing the sequence of subtractions in Option D.
6. Eliminating Distractors: Recognizing that Option A incorrectly removes the entire circle B (including the middle overlap), whereas the shaded region includes parts of B.
7. Visual Logic Verification: Confirming that subtracting the two specific "petals" ($B \cap A$ and $B \cap C$) from the combined $A$ and $C$ leaves exactly the shaded wings and the central triple intersection.
