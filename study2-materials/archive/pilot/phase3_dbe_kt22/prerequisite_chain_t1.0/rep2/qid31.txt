PREREQUISITES:
1. Understanding the notation for a Set ($A = \{1, 2\}$).
2. Knowledge of the Cartesian Product operator ($\times$) and how to derive the resulting set of ordered pairs.
3. Recognizing that the elements of the resulting set $A \times B$ are ordered pairs (e.g., $(1, a)$), not individual atoms.
4. Understanding the Subset symbol ($\subseteq$) and its formal definition (every element of the LHS must be an element of the RHS).
5. Distinguishing between an element (e.g., $1$) and an ordered pair (e.g., $(1, a)$).
6. Multi-step reasoning: Evaluating the RHS first, then comparing the types of elements in the LHS vs. the RHS.
7. Avoiding the "visual trap" or "commonality heuristic" where students see that set $A$ is used to construct the product and assume it must therefore be a subset.
