PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of the SQL `SELECT` keyword as a data retrieval command.
2. Understanding the specific functionality of the `COUNT()` aggregate function.
3. Recognizing the `*` (asterisk) wildcard in the context of the `COUNT` function (counting rows rather than specific non-null values).
4. Distinguishing between horizontal cardinality (rows) and vertical degree (columns) in a relational table.
5. Ability to ignore the common misconception that `*` always means "show all columns" (as it does in `SELECT *`).
6. Basic English literacy to map the word "count" to "number of".
