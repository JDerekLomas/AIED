PREREQUISITES: 
1. Vocabulary recognition: Identifying "relation" as the formal term for a table.
2. Conceptual understanding of 'Join': Knowing that it horizontally combines attributes from two sources based on a match.
3. Distinguishing Join from Union: Understanding that Union stacks rows (vertical) whereas the prompt describes merging pairs into a "single tuple" (horizontal).
4. Distinguishing Join from Select: Understanding that Select acts on a single relation to filter rows, rather than combining two relations.
5. Terminology mapping: Associating the word "merging" and "matching" specifically with the relational Join operation.
