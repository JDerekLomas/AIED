PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Definition of Cartesian Product ($A \times B$):** Understanding that elements are ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.
2. **Deconstruction of Ordered Pairs:** Ability to extract members of set $A$ from the first coordinates $\{2, 3, 4\}$ and members of set $B$ from the second coordinates $\{5, 7\}$.
3. **Cardinality Logic:** Recognizing that if $|A \times B| = 6$ and we have identified 3 distinct elements in $A$ and 2 distinct elements in $B$, the sets must be exactly $A = \{2, 3, 4\}$ and $B = \{5, 7\}$ because $3 \times 2 = 6$.
4. **Reconstruction of the Full Set:** Ability to systematically generate all possible combinations of $A \times B$ from the identified sets $A$ and $B$.
5. **Set Notation and Matching:** Distinguishing the correct set from distractors that contain incorrect coordinates (like (4,3) or (5,5)) or missing combinations.
6. **Attention to Detail:** Avoiding the "visual trap" of Option D, which contains the three original elements but includes invalid members like (5,5).
