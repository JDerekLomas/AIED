PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
2. Distinguishing between the roles of different database components (Transaction Manager/Recovery Manager vs. Concurrency Control Manager).
3. Knowing the specific mechanism of "Logging" (Write-Ahead Logging) and its purpose in system recovery.
4. Identifying that "Atomicity" requires logging to perform undos (rollbacks) of incomplete transactions.
5. Identifying that "Durability" requires logging to perform redos of committed transactions after a crash.
6. Recognizing that "Isolation" is primarily handled by locking/multiversioning (Concurrency Control), not primarily by the log.
7. Recognizing that "Integrity" (Consistency) is a result of the other properties and application logic, not a direct mechanical output of the transaction log.
8. Eliminating distractors that pair a logging-dependent property with a non-logging-dependent property.
