To provide an accurate count of prerequisites, I am assuming a standard relational schema where the `Study` table contains data, and no specific constraints (like an empty table) have been previously established in the problem context.

**PREREQUISITES:**
1. **Reading a Schema/Instance:** The ability to look at the provided data for the `Study` table and physically count the number of records (rows) present.
2. **SQL Keyword `SELECT`:** Understanding that `SELECT` retrieves data from a table and does not inherently filter rows unless a `WHERE` clause is present.
3. **SQL Keyword `FROM`:** Identifying that the query is targeting the `Study` table specifically and not a related table (like `Student`).
4. **Column Projection vs. Row Selection:** Distinguishing that listing specific columns (`StudentID`, `Name`) affects the *width* of the result set, but does not reduce the *number* of rows (height).
5. **Handling Duplicates:** Knowing that `SELECT` (without `DISTINCT`) returns all rows, even if the values in the selected columns are identical across multiple rows.
6. **Abstracting the Result Set:** Realizing the question asks for the *count* of rows in the output, not the data itself.

**COUNT: 6**
