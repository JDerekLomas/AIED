PREREQUISITES:
1. Understanding set notation (braces and elements).
2. Knowing the definition of the intersection operator (∩) as elements common to both sets.
3. Inferring the minimum composition of set B (B must contain at least {2, 3}).
4. Understanding the constraint imposed by the intersection result (B cannot contain '1', otherwise the intersection would include 1).
5. Reasoning about set cardinality (size) based on the inferred elements.
6. Applying the logic that if B must contain at least two specific elements ({2, 3}), its size $|B|$ cannot be less than 2.
7. Distinguishing between a "must be" and "cannot be" logic in a multiple-choice context.
