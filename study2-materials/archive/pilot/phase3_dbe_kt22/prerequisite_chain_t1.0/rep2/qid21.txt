PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (defining sets S and T using curly braces).
2. Knowing the definition of a Cartesian Product (S x T) as a set of ordered pairs.
3. Calculating the cardinality of (S x T) correctly (2 * 3 = 6 elements).
4. Calculating the cardinality of (S x S) correctly (2 * 2 = 4 elements).
5. Knowing the definition of the set difference operator (-) (removing elements found in the second set from the first).
6. Executing the subtraction accurately (identifying that (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2) must be removed from the result).
7. Distinguishing between the elements remaining in the first set versus those in the second (avoiding the "intersection" or "union" trap).
8. Reading and matching the final calculated set to the provided multiple-choice options.
