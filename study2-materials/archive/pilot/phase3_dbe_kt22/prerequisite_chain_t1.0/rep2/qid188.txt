PREREQUISITES:

2. Knowledge of MAC components: Understanding that MAC relies on system-wide policies and labels rather than user discretion.
3. Terminology association: Linking "Security Clearance" (assigned to subjects) and "Classification" (assigned to objects) specifically to the MAC model (e.g., Bell-LaPadula or Biba models).
4. Distinguishing "Ownership": Recognizing that ownership is a hallmark of DAC, not MAC.
5. Distinguishing "Roles": Identifying that roles belong to RBAC.
6. Reading comprehension: Correctly interpreting the phrase "access decisions" in the context of security policies.
