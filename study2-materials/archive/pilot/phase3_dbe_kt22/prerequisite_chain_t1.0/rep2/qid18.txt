PREREQUISITES:
1. **Understanding Set Notation:** Recognizing that the curly braces `{}` denote a set where order is irrelevant and elements are unique.
2. **Knowledge of the Set Difference Operator (-):** Understanding that $A - B$ results in elements present in $A$ but not in $B$.
3. **Execution of First Set Difference:** Correctly calculating $\{1, 2, 3\} - \{1, 2, 5\} = \{3\}$.
4. **Execution of Second Set Difference:** Correctly calculating $\{1, 2, 5\} - \{1, 2, 3\} = \{5\}$.
5. **Knowledge of the Union Operator ($\cup$):** Understanding that the union combines all distinct elements from both resulting sets.
6. **Execution of Final Union:** Combining $\{3\} \cup \{5\}$ to get $\{3, 5\}$.
7. **Order of Operations:** Recognizing that the operations inside the parentheses must be performed before the union.
8. **Distinguishing Concepts:** Avoiding the common mistake of performing an Intersection ($\cap$) or a Simple Union ($A \cup B$) due to misreading the symbols.
