PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Mathematical Notation Recognition**: Recognizing that curly braces {} denote sets and uppercase letters represent identifiers for those sets.
2. **Set Difference Operator Knowledge**: Knowing that the minus sign (-) in set theory represents the difference operation (elements in the first set not present in the second).
3. **Distinguishing Operations**: Avoiding confusion between set difference and arithmetic subtraction (subtracting values) or set intersection (elements in both).
4. **Information Filtering**: Identifying that sets C and D are "distractors" and are irrelevant to the specific calculation of A - B.
5. **Precise Execution**: Comparing elements of A {2, 3, 4, 5} against B {4, 5, 6, 7} to identify that 4 and 5 must be removed, leaving 2 and 3.
