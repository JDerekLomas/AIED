PREREQUISITES: 
1. Vocabulary Mapping: Knowing that "attribute" is the formal relational model term for a "column."
2. Synonym Recognition: Distinguishing between "attribute" and "tuple" (row).
3. Schema Component Identification: Understanding the structural components of a table (rows vs. columns vs. cells).
4. English Proficiency: Understanding the sentence structure "An X is a Y in a Z" (crucial for students where English is a second or third language).
5. Distinguishing "Value" from "Structure": Recognizing that an attribute refers to the vertical category, not the specific data point (value) within it.
