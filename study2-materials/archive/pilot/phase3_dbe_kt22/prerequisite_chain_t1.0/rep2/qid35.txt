PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (braces and elements).
2. Understanding the Cartesian Product operator (x) and how to form ordered pairs.
3. Understanding the Subset operator (⊆) and the condition required for one set to be a subset of another.
4. Correctly computing the elements of A x B: {(1,a), (1,b), (2,a), (2,b)}.
5. Correctly computing (or conceptually verifying) the elements of C x D.
6. Applying the subset rule: checking if every ordered pair in the first set exists in the second set (e.g., since 1 $\in$ C and a $\in$ D, then (1,a) $\in$ C x D).
7. Distinguishing between the elements of the sets versus the sets themselves (not confusing a set with its cardinality).
8. Logical reasoning to conclude that because A $\subseteq$ C and B $\subseteq$ D, then A x B must be a subset of C x D.
