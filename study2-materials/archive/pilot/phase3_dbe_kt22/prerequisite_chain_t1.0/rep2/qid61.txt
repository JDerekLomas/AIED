PREREQUISITES: 
1. Vocabulary distinction: Distinguishing between Data Manipulation Language (DML) for rows/tuples and Data Definition Language (DDL) for schema objects.
2. Keyword recognition: Knowing that "DELETE" is the SQL keyword for tuple removal, while "DROP" is for object destruction.
3. Syntax recall: Remembering that the standard SQL syntax is `DELETE FROM [table]` rather than `DELETE TABLE [table]`.
4. Avoiding "Natural Language" traps: Resisting the logical-sounding but syntactically incorrect "DROP FROM" or "DELETE TABLE" based on common English usage.
5. Conceptual precision: Understanding that "all tuples" implies the table structure remains (DML), whereas "DROP" removes the container itself.
