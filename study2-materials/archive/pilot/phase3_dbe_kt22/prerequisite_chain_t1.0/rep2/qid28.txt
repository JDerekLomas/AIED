PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Mathematical Notation Literacy**: Recognizing the vertical bars $|X|$ as the symbol for cardinality (size of a set).
2. **Relational Algebra/Set Operator Recognition**: Identifying the "x" symbol as the Cartesian Product operator (Cross Join in a database context).
3. **Conceptual Understanding of Cartesian Products**: Knowing that $A \times B$ results in a set of all possible ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.
4. **Application of the Product Rule**: Applying the specific arithmetic rule that $|A \times B| = |A| \times |B|$.
5. **Basic Arithmetic**: Correctly multiplying 3 and 2.
6. **Distinguishing Operations**: Not confusing the Cartesian Product with a Set Union ($|A \cup B|$), which would lead to selecting 5 (Option A).
