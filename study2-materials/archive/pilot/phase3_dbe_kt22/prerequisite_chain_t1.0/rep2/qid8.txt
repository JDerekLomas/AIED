PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of the Cartesian Product symbol ($\times$) in set theory.
2. Understanding that the Cartesian Product results in a set of ordered pairs $(a, b)$.
3. Identifying the first element of each pair as a member of the first set ($A$).
4. Identifying the second element of each pair as a member of the second set ($B$).
5. Recognition of set notation and the elimination of duplicate elements when defining the source sets (e.g., seeing 'p' twice but knowing it appears once in $A$).
6. Distinguishing between set $A$ and set $B$ to avoid reversing the answer (Option A vs. Option D).
7. Basic symbolic literacy (distinguishing between elements and the sets themselves).
