1. Vocabulary knowledge: Understanding the technical definition of "concurrent" (overlapping in time) versus sequential execution.
2. Domain knowledge: Understanding "throughput" as the number of transactions completed per unit of time.
3. Domain knowledge: Understanding "average response time" and how waiting in a queue (serial execution) affects it.
4. Domain knowledge: Understanding "resource utilisation" (CPU/IO) and how overlapping tasks prevents idle time.
