PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of set notation (understanding that {1, 2} represents a collection of distinct elements).
2. Definition of the Cartesian Product (knowing it results in a set of ordered pairs $(x, y)$).
3. Understanding ordering rules ($A \times B$ implies the first element must come from $A$ and the second from $B$).
4. Exhaustive matching (recognizing that every element of $A$ must be paired with every element of $B$, totaling $n \times m$ pairs).
5. Distinguishing between similar-looking sets (carefully checking individual coordinates to eliminate distractors like A, which contains an invalid element $(b, b)$, or D, which is $B \times A$).
