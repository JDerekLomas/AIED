PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the syntax of the FROM clause when multiple tables are listed without a JOIN condition.
2. Identifying that a comma-separated list of tables results in a Cartesian Product (Cross Join).
3. Knowing the mathematical rule for the cardinality of a Cartesian Product (Rows in A × Rows in B).
4. Ability to read and interpret the provided schema or instance data (implied) to find the row counts for "Course" and "Enrol".
5. Distinguishing a Cross Join from an Inner Join (not looking for matching keys).
6. Basic mental arithmetic/multiplication.

COUNT: 6

0.65
