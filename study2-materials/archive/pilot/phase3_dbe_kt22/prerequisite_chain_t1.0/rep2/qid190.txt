PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Defining RBAC**: Understanding that in Role-Based Access Control, permissions are associated with roles, and users are assigned to those roles based on their organizational function.
2. **Distinguishing Subjects from Roles**: Recognizing that the departments (Sales, Marketing, etc.) represent the functional groups of users (subjects) who require specific access rights.
3. **Distinguishing Resources from Roles**: Identifying that files, printers, and mailboxes are the *objects* being accessed, not the roles themselves.
4. **Distinguishing Hardware from Roles**: Recognizing that workstations are physical assets/locations and irrelevant to the logical role structure in this context.
5. **Applying the "Least Privilege" logic to RBAC design**: Realizing that roles are typically designed to mirror the job functions/departments within an organization to simplify management.
6. **Eliminating Redundant Options**: Discarding Option D because "Resource" and "Department" are categories of entities in the prompt, not specific roles that would be implemented in a schema.
7. **Reading Comprehension**: Filtering out the "distractor" information regarding the number of resource types versus the number of departments.
