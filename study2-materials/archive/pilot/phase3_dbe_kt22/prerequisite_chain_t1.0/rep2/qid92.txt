PREREQUISITES:
1. Recalling the standard Chen notation for ER diagrams (Entity-Relationship modeling).
2. Distinguishing between a "strong" entity and a "weak" entity.
3. Mapping the geometric shape "Rectangle" to the general concept of an Entity.
4. Knowing the specific notation convention that "doubling" a border signifies a "weak" or "identifying" relationship/entity.
5. Distinguishing between the shape for an Entity (Rectangle) and a Relationship (Diamond).
6. Eliminating distractor C (Double diamond), which represents an identifying relationship rather than the entity itself.
