PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of set equality (two sets are equal if and only if they contain exactly the same elements).
2. Recognizing that the order of elements within a set does not affect its identity (unordered property).
3. Distinguishing between a subset and an equal set (avoiding the "containment" trap in option B).
4. Accurately performing a mental comparison/mapping of elements across four different pairs of sets.
5. Understanding the notation of curly braces `{}` as representing a set.
