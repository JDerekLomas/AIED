PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of the specific terminology: Defining "Dirty Read," "Unrepeatable Read," and "Phantom Read."
2. Memorization of the four standard SQL transaction isolation levels (Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable).
3. Understanding the hierarchical relationship between isolation levels (which levels permit which phenomena).
4. Recalling the specific mapping of the "Read Committed" level to its allowed/disallowed phenomena.
5. Multi-step elimination: Evaluating each distractor against the three criteria provided in the prompt (No Dirty Read AND Yes Unrepeatable AND Yes Phantom).
6. Distinguishing between "Unrepeatable Read" and "Phantom Read," as students often conflate these two.
