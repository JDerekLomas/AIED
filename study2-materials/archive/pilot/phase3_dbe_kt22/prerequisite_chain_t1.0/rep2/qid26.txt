PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Venn diagram notation (identifying circles A and B and the meaning of overlapping regions).
2. Understanding the set Union operator (U) as the combination of all elements in both sets.
3. Understanding the set Intersection operator (∩) as the elements common to both sets.
4. Understanding the set Difference/Relative Complement operator (–) as the removal of one set's elements from another.
5. Ability to visually map the "shaded area" (the symmetric difference) to a composite logical expression.
6. Order of operations in set algebra (evaluating terms inside parentheses before the subtraction).
7. Distinguishing between "A union B" (the whole) and "A intersection B" (the middle) to realize the middle has been excluded.
