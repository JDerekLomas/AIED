PREREQUISITES:
1. Ability to read and interpret a relational schema (identifying table names and column relationships).
2. Understanding the `SELECT *` syntax (knowing it retrieves all columns from the target table).
3. Understanding the `WHERE ... IN` clause (set membership logic).
4. Understanding subqueries (executing the inner query first to provide a list of values to the outer query).
5. Understanding table aliasing (`e` for Enrol, `c` for Course) and dot notation.
6. Ability to perform an implicit join or "lookup" logic between the `CourseNo` in the Course table and the `CourseNo` in the Enrol table.
7. Accurate counting of matching records from the provided data instance (data scanning).
8. Distinguishing between the number of columns and the number of rows (cardinality).
9. Recognizing that string literals in SQL are case-sensitive or exact matches (matching ‘Relational Databases’ exactly).
