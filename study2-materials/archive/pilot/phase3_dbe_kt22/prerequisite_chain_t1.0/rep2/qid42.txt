PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of "Superkey": Knowing the formal terminology for a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple.
2. Definition of "Tuple": Understanding that this is the formal relational term for a row/record.
3. Definition of "Attribute": Understanding that this is the formal relational term for a column/field.
4. Distinguishing "Superkey" from "Foreign key": Recognising that a foreign key links tables rather than providing unique identification within the current set.
5. Distinguishing "Superkey" from "Domain": Understanding that a domain refers to a data type/set of valid values, not a collection of attributes.
6. Identifying "Subkey" as a distractor: Recognizing that "subkey" is not a standard formal term in the relational model (unlike primary, candidate, or superkeys).
7. Vocabulary matching: Mapping the phrase "taken collectively" to the set-based definition of a superkey.
