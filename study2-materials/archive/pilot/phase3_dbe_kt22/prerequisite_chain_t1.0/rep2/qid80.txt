To answer this question correctly, a student must navigate several conceptual and technical hurdles. In the South African context, "Natural Join" is often a point of confusion because it is less frequently used in practical industry tutorials compared to explicit `INNER JOIN` syntax.

**PREREQUISITES:**
1.  **Definition of Natural Join:** Understanding that a `NATURAL JOIN` automatically joins tables based on *all* columns with the same name.
2.  **Schema Inspection:** Identifying which column(s) are common between the `Course` and `Enrol` tables (typically `CourseID` or `CourseCode`).
3.  **Relational Algebra Logic:** Knowing that a Join acts as a filter on a Cartesian Product; it only retains rows where the common keys match.
4.  **Directionality/Cardinality:** Recognizing that the result set size is determined by the "many" side of the relationship (the `Enrol` table).
5.  **Multi-step Reasoning:** Realizing that every enrollment must correspond to a valid course, therefore the result count equals the number of records in the `Enrol` table.
6.  **Distinguishing Join Types:** Not confusing a Natural Join with a Cross Join (which would result in $7 \times 4 = 28$ or similar).
7.  **Data Set Interpretation:** Correcting reading the provided (though here implicit) table instances to count the rows accurately.

**COUNT: 7**
