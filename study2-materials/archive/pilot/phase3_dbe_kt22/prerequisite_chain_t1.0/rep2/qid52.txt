PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowing the definition of a "relation" in the context of the relational model (mapping "relation" to "table").
2. Recalling the specific SQL DDL keyword for object creation (`CREATE`).
3. Distinguishing between standard SQL syntax and descriptive English-like terms (e.g., "New").
4. Recognizing that PostgreSQL follows standard SQL naming conventions for basic data structures.
5. Identifying that `CREATE RELATION` is not a valid SQL command, despite "relation" being the formal term used in the question.
