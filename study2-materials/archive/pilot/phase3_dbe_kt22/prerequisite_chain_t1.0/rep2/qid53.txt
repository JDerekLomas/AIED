PREREQUISITES:
1. Distinguishing between DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language).
2. Knowledge of the specific keyword `DROP` for removing schemas/structures.
3. Knowledge of the keyword `DELETE` for removing tuples/data within a relation.
4. Identifying that "Table" is the standard SQL syntax keyword used to represent a Relation in a schema command.
5. Recognizing that `DROP RELATION` is syntactically invalid in standard SQL, despite "relation" being the formal term used in the question.
6. Multi-step reasoning: Mapping the formal relational model term "relation schema" to the SQL implementation term "table".
