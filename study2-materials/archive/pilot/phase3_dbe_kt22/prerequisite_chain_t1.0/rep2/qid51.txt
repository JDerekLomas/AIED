PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of standard SQL character types (CHAR vs. VARCHAR).
2. Awareness of PostgreSQL-specific aliases vs. standard SQL terminology.
3. Distinguishing between programming language type names (e.g., C++, Java, or Python "String") and SQL type names.
4. Identifying `BIT(n)` as a valid, albeit less common, PostgreSQL type used for bit strings.
5. Eliminating `STRING(n)` as a non-standard keyword in the PostgreSQL dialect (which uses `TEXT` or `VARCHAR`).
