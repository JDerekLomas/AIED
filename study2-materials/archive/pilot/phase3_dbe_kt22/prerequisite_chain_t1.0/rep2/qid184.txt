PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of the SQL Data Control Language (DCL) syntax for the REVOKE statement.
2. Understanding the concept of "cascading" in the context of privilege propagation (the `WITH GRANT OPTION`).
3. Distinguishing between the `RESTRICT` and `CASCADE` keywords and their specific functions during a revoke operation.
4. Recognizing that "no cascade" and "no restrict" are not standard SQL keywords for these operations.
5. Identifying that the goal (avoiding cascading) is an action performed during the removal of rights, not the granting of rights, thereby eliminating `GRANT` options.
6. Multi-step reasoning: Connecting the intent ("avoid cascading") to the specific keyword that prevents the action if dependencies exist (`RESTRICT`).
