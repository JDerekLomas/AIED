PREREQUISITES:
1. Understanding the Cartesian Product symbol (x) and the procedure for pairing elements.
2. Understanding the Set Difference symbol (–) and the logic of element removal.
3. Ability to accurately compute the 12 elements of (C x D) without omission.
4. Ability to accurately compute the 4 elements of (A x B).
5. Accurate execution of the subtraction (identifying which pairs in the larger set must be removed).
6. Distinguishing between the order of operations (computing products before the difference).
7. Pattern matching the resulting set against multiple-choice options (identifying that A is the correct remainder).
8. Maintaining focus to avoid "simple" clerical errors in a repetitive symbolic task.
