4. Recognizing the specific multi-part syntax of the `ALTER TABLE` statement.
5. Distinguishing between the keywords `DROP` and `DELETE` within the context of DDL.
6. Recalling the mandatory inclusion of the `COLUMN` keyword (or the specific structure `DROP COLUMN`) as per standard SQL-92/99 requirements often taught in textbooks.
