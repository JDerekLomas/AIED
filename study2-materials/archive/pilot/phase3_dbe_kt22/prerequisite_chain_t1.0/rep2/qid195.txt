PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the specific security model (Bell-LaPadula) and its context (Confidentiality).
2. Understanding the technical definition of a "Subject" (user/process) vs. an "Object" (data/file).
3. Distinguishing between the "Simple Security Property" (Reading) and the "*-Property" (Writing).
4. Mapping the direction of data flow: "retrieving information" implies a Read operation.
5. Interpreting the hierarchical constraint: Moving from a Lower Level to a Higher Level.
6. Eliminating "Read down" and "Write down" by applying the specific "No Read Up" (NRU) axiom.
7. Overcoming potential confusion with the Biba Integrity Model, which uses the inverse rules.
