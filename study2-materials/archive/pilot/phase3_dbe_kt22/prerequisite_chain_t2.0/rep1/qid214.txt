PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the syntax and logical sequence of SQL transaction control commands (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK).
2. Knowing the "Permanence" property of ACID: once a COMMIT is executed, changes are persisted to the database.
3. Distinguishing between an active transaction and a completed (terminated) transaction.
4. Identifying that a ROLLBACK command executed *after* a COMMIT has no transaction left to undo.
5. Avoiding the common misconception that ROLLBACK is an "Undo" button for history rather than a control for current transaction state.
6. Multi-step reasoning: tracing the state of the database through a linear script.
