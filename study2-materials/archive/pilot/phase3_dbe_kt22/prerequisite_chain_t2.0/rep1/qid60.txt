PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of the keyword 'INSERT' as the standard DML command for adding data (distinguishing it from synonyms like 'enter').
2. Knowledge of the mandatory 'VALUES' clause in a standard SQL INSERT statement.
3. Correct sequencing of clauses (command, target relation, then data values).
4. Distinguishing between the 'INSERT INTO table (columns)' syntax and the 'VALUES (data)' syntax (knowing that B is valid while C is missing the keyword).
5. Understanding that relational algebra terms (tuple, relation) map to SQL terms (row, table).
