PREREQUISITES:
1. **Reading Comprehension and Information Filtering**: The ability to ignore a large volume of "noise" (details about equipment, maintenance, and members) to isolate the specific sentence regarding employee categories.
2. **Identification of Hierarchy**: Recognizing that "classified into three categories" implies a generalization/specialization relationship rather than a simple property or a connection between distinct objects.
3. **Conceptual Modeling Vocabulary**: Knowing the specific definitions of "Entity", "Attribute", "Relationship", "Superclass", and "Subclass" in the context of an EER (Enhanced Entity-Relationship) diagram.
4. **Distinguishing Instance vs. Type**: Understanding that "trainers" are not just attributes of an employee, but are themselves entities with specific unique properties (like "specialties") and relationships (instructing classes).
5. **Categorization Logic**: Identifying that "Employee" represents the generalized set, while the three categories are specialized subsets.
