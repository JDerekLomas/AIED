PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Set Theory notation (braces and commas representing a collection of elements).
2. Knowledge of the Specificity of the Difference operator (the "-" symbol in set algebra).
3. Distinguishing between "A minus B" and "B minus A" (directional dependency).
4. Correct execution of the exclusion rule (identifying the intersection {4, 5} and removing it from the first set).
5. Visual scanning accuracy (filtering out irrelevant data: sets C and D are "distractor" information).
6. Precision in mapping the calculated result to the provided multiple-choice options.
