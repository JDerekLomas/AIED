PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of Set Notation: Recognizing that {1, 2} represents a set of distinct elements.
2. Definition of Cartesian Product: Understanding that the result is a set of all possible ordered pairs (x, y).
3. Maintaining Sequence (Ordered Pairs): Knowing that if the operation is $A \times B$, the first element of each pair must come from set A and the second from set B.
4. Exhaustive Pairing: Recognizing that every element in A must be paired with every element in B (avoiding the partial pairing seen in Option A).
5. Cardinality Rule Calculation: Recognizing that since $|A|=2$ and $|B|=2$, the resulting set must contain $2 \times 2 = 4$ unique pairs.
6. Distinguishing Directionality: Being able to differentiate between $A \times B$ (Option C) and $B \times A$ (Option D).
