PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of Set Notation: Recognizing that {1,2} represents a set of discrete elements.
2. Understanding Cartesian Product (x): Knowing how to generate all possible ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \in S$ and $b \in T$.
3. Calculation of $(S \times T)$: Identifying the 6 resulting pairs {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)}.
4. Calculation of $(S \times S)$: Identifying the 4 resulting pairs {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}.
5. Understanding Set Difference (-): Knowing that $A - B$ means taking all elements in $A$ and removing those that also appear in $B$.
6. Precision in Comparison: Carefully identifying which specific pairs are "left over" after the subtraction (not adding them or intersecting them).
7. Identifying the Result: Mapping the remaining set {(1,3), (2,3)} to Option C.
