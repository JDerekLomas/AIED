PREREQUISITES: 
1. Reading comprehension: Ability to filter out "noise" (attributes of technicians, equipment, and administrators) to focus only on the relevant entities ("trainer" and "fitness class").
2. Identifying the relationship: Mapping the narrative description "Each fitness class is ... instructed by only one trainer" and "Not all trainers deliver fitness classes" to the "instruct" relationship mentioned in the prompt.
3. Defining Participation Constraints: Knowing the technical difference between "Total" (every instance must participate) and "Partial" (not every instance must participate).
4. Logical inference: Connecting the phrase "Not all trainers deliver fitness classes" to the conclusion that a trainer entity can exist in the database without being related to a fitness class entity.
5. Distinction: Distinguishing between the cardinality (1:N) and the participation constraint (Partial/Total).
6. Application of Rule: Applying the "optional" nature of the relationship for the trainer to select the "Partial" constraint.
