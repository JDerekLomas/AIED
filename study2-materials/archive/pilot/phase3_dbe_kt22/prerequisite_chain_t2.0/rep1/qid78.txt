PREREQUISITES:
1. Identifying that the comma syntax in the FROM clause represents a Cross Join (Cartesian Product).
2. Recalling the specific mathematical rule for a Cartesian Product: multiplying the number of rows in the first table by the number of rows in the second table.
3. Correctly counting the number of rows in the "Course" table from the provided schema/diagram (implicitly 7 or 4 based on typical problem structures like this).
4. Correctly counting the number of rows in the "Enrol" table from the provided schema/diagram (implicitly 4 or 7).
5. Avoiding the common misconception that the query performs a Natural Join or Inner Join (which would require matching keys and likely yield fewer rows).
6. Basic multiplication of the two totals.
7. Reading the schema/data accurately without skipping rows or confusing columns for rows.
