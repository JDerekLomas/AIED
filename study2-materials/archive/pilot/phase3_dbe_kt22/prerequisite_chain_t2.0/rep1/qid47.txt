PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Understanding the Definition of a Superkey**: Knowing that a superkey is any set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple in a relation.
2. **Knowledge of Superkey Composition Properties**: Understanding that if any set $S$ is a superkey, then any superset of $S$ (up to the full set of attributes in the relation) is also a superkey.
3. **Reading Notation**: Correctly interpreting the set notation $\{a,b\}$ and the schema notation $R(a,b,c)$.
4. **Logic and Quantifiers**: Distinguishing between "must be," "must not be," and "might be" in a formal logic context.
5. **Set Containment Logic**: Recognizing that $\{a,b,c\}$ is a superset of $\{a,b\}$ in the context of the relation $R$.
6. **Eliminating Misconceptions about Candidate Keys**: Avoiding the trap of thinking a superkey must be "minimal" (confusing it with a candidate key).
