PREREQUISITES: 
- Understanding the term "correctness criterion" as a formal technical standard in database theory rather than a general adjective.
- Knowledge of the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and what each specific property ensures.
- Distinguishing between "correctness of a single transaction" (Consistency/Atomicity) vs "correctness of concurrent execution" (Isolation).
- Recognizing "Serializability" as the formal definition of correctness for interleaved execution (the highest level of Isolation).
- Resisting the "distractor trap" of option D, which appeals to students who recall ACID as a general "correctness" suite but do not understand the specific requirements for concurrency.
- Ability to differentiate between the state of the database (Consistency) and the scheduling of operations (Serializability).
