PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the definitions and characteristics of the three specific concurrency phenomena (dirty reads, unrepeatable reads, and phantom reads).
2. Knowledge of the four standard SQL transaction isolation levels (Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable).
3. Ability to map the hierarchy of isolation levels to the phenomena they prevent (the "matrix" of isolation).
4. Distinguishing "Read Committed" from "Repeatable Read" (a frequent point of confusion where students mix up which one prevents unrepeatable reads).
5. Accurate reading of the Boolean logic in the question (identifying a level that *prevents* phenomenon A but *permits* B and C).
6. Recalling the default isolation behavior of common RDBMS (like PostgreSQL or SQL Server) often taught in labs, which aids in identifying "Read Committed" as the middle-ground standard.
