PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of Set Theory notation (recognizing A, B, C, D as sets).
2. Understanding the Cartesian Product (A x B) and how to construct it.
3. Recognizing that the elements of A are atomic (integers), while the elements of A x B are ordered pairs (tuples).
4. Knowledge of the Subset definition ($\subseteq$): that every element in the first set must exist in the second set.
5. Identifying the Type Mismatch: realizing a set of integers cannot be a subset of a set of pairs, even if the symbols look similar.
6. Avoiding the "Symbol Overlap" Distractor: not being misled by the presence of $\{1, 2\}$ in both sets.
7. Logic processing: applying the formal definition rather than a heuristic about "containment."
