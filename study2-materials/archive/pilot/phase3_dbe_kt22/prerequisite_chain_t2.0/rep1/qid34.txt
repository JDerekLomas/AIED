PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the symbol for a Cartesian product (x).
2. Knowledge of how to construct a Cartesian product of two sets.
3. Understanding the symbol for a subset ($\subseteq$).
4. Knowledge of the definition of a subset (every element of the first set must be in the second).
5. Correct identification of the elements of sets A and C from the provided list.
6. Reasoning that if $A \subseteq A$ (trivial) and $A \subseteq C$ (since $\{1,2\} \subseteq \{1,2,3\}$), then their Cartesian product $A \times A$ must be a subset of $A \times C$.
7. Ability to avoid a "distractor" error (confusing the values in $B$ or $D$ or assuming the sizes must be equal for a subset relation).
