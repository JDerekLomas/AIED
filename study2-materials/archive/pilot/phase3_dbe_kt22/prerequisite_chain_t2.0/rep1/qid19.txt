PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Set Notation: Understanding that curly braces { } denote a set of elements.
2. Definition of the Cartesian Product Operator: Knowing that the symbol 'x' in the context of sets represents the Cartesian product, not scalar multiplication or set union.
3. Constructing Ordered Pairs: Understanding that the result of a Cartesian product is a set of tuples (pairs), not individual atoms.
4. Correct Set Identification: Recognizing that the operation is $S \times S$ (self-join/product) rather than $S \times T$.
5. Combinatorial Completion: Ability to systematically pair every element of the first set with every element of the second set without omissions.
6. Distinguishing Parentheses from Braces: Identifying that (1,1) represents a single element (a tuple) within the resulting set.
