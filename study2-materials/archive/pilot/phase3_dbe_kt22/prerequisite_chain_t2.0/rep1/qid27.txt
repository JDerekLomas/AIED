PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Interpreting Venn Diagrams**: Ability to map visual shaded regions to set logic (understanding overlaps and exclusions).
2. **Set Union (∪)**: Understanding that A ∪ C combines the entirety of both sets.
3. **Set Difference (–)**: Understanding that subtracting B removes any part of the shaded region that overlaps with B.
4. **Set Intersection (∩)**: Understanding that intersection represents only the common elements.
5. **Evaluating Boolean Logic/Nesting**: Processing multi-step expressions like option D to see if they simplify to or represent the visual area.
6. **Distinguishing "Exclusive Or" Logic**: Recognizing that the shaded area represents parts of A and C that specifically exclude the intersection with B.
7. **Elimination Strategy**: Comparing the visual "missing piece" (the center-bottom overlap) against the four provided algebraic strings.
