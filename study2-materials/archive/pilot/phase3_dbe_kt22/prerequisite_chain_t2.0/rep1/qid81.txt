PREREQUISITES: 
1. Ability to interpret a physical schema or data instance (mapping table names to the provided data sets).
2. Understanding the specific mechanics of a LEFT JOIN (retaining all rows from the "left" table regardless of matches).
3. Distinguishing between an INNER JOIN and a LEFT JOIN (avoiding the mistake of only counting matches).
4. Correctly identifying the "left" table in the SQL syntax (Course vs. Enrol).
5. Accurate row counting of the source table (knowing that the base count starts with the number of entries in 'Course').
6. Handling "orphaned" records (recognizing that courses with no enrollments still contribute exactly one row to the result).
7. Managing many-to-one or many-to-many matches (recognizing that one course with multiple enrollments creates multiple result rows).
8. Basic arithmetic/summation of the resulting joined rows.

COUNT: 8
