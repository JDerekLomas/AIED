PREREQUISITES: 
- Knowing the formal mathematical definition of a Set (distinct elements, no duplicates).
- Distinguishing between "Relation" (a subset of a Cartesian product) and "Set" (the more fundamental definition of the elements themselves).
- Distinguishing "Tuple" (an ordered sequence) from "Set" (where order often doesn't matter and duplicates are excluded).
- Vocabulary recognition: linking the word "distinct" specifically to set theory terminology taught in introductory database modules.
- Reading comprehension in a multiple-choice format.
