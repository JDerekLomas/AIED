PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of the specific categorization of SQL sub-languages (DDL vs. DML vs. DCL).
2. Distinguishing between schema-level structural changes (Data Definition) and row-level data modification (Data Manipulation).
3. Recognizing that the "DROP" command targets the table object, not the data within it.
4. Recognizing that the "ALTER" command modifies table constraints/columns, not row values.
5. Identifying the "UPDATE" command as a row-level data operation.
6. Overcoming the linguistic intuition that "dropping" or "creating" a table constitutes "manipulating" the database as a whole.
