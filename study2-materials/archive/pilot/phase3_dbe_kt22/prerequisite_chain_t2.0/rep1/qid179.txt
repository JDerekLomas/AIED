PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of SQL Access Control: Understanding the scope and syntax of the `GRANT` statement.
2. Understanding of Database Objects (Schema levels): Distinguishing between structural objects (relations/tables, views) and data instances (tuples/rows).
3. Precision in terminology: Knowing that SQL privileges are typically defined at the schema level (Table/View) or sub-schema level (Attribute/Column), but not at the row/instance level.
4. Interpretation of "None of the above": Ability to evaluate whether the constraint applies to all or none of the provided technical options.
5. Vocabulary mapping: Recognizing that "attribute" maps to "column", "tuple" maps to "row", and "relation" maps to "table" in SQL contexts.
