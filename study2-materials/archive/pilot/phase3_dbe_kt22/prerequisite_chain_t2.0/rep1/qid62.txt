PREREQUISITES: 
1. Vocabulary knowledge: Understanding the technical definition of a "tuple" (as a row/record) and a "relation" (as a table).
2. Distinguishing operations: Differentiating between unary operations (Select) and binary operations (Join, Union).
3. Process recognition: Identifying that "merging pairs of matching tuples" implies horizontal concatenation based on a condition, rather than vertical set-based combination.
4. Schema conceptualization: Visualizing how two separate data structures are synthesized into a single wide structure.
5. Terminology recall: Correctly mapping the specific English description provided in the text to the formal relational algebra/SQL keyword "Join".
