PREREQUISITES: 
1. Vocabulary knowledge: Knowing that "tuples" is a formal synonym for "rows" in the relational model.
2. Terminology distinction: Distinguishing between a "relation" (the table structure and contents) and its "tuples" (the data entries).
3. Keyword command recall: Identifying `DELETE` as the DML command for data manipulation and `DROP` as the DDL command for schema destruction.
4. Syntax recognition: Recognizing that `DELETE FROM` is the syntactically valid SQL clause, whereas `DELETE TABLE` is an invalid hybrid.
5. Functional distinction: Understanding that `DROP TABLE` removes the table structure entirely from the schema, whereas the question specifies deleting the tuples (implying the relation structure remains).
6. Multi-choice filtering: Eliminating the non-existent syntax `DROP FROM`.
