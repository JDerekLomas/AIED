PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Set Notation: Understanding that curly braces { } denote a collection of distinct elements.
2. Definition of the Union Operator (∪): Knowing that the union includes all elements present in either set A or set B (or both).
3. Handling Duplicate Elements: Realizing that in set theory, common elements (like 4, 5, 6, and 7) are only listed once in the resulting set.
4. Procedural Order/Associativity: Executing the multi-step operation (A ∪ B) first, then joining the result with set C.
5. Systematic Comparison: Methodically checking the final calculated set against the distractors to avoid misidentifying a partially correct sequence (e.g., stopping before adding C).
6. Pattern Matching/Visual Attention: Ignoring set D (which is irrelevant to the prompt but provided as a distractor) and spotting missing elements (like '3') in the multiple-choice options.
