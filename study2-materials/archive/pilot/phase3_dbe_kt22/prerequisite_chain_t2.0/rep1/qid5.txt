PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the formal definition of a Cartesian product (the set of all ordered pairs).
2. Recognizing that an ordered pair $(a, b)$ is fundamentally different from the ordered pair $(b, a)$ unless $a=b$.
3. Distinguishing between the commutative property of scalar multiplication (which students know from arithmetic) and the non-commutative property of set-based operations.
4. Applying the definition to the general case (where A and B are arbitrary sets) rather than focusing on a special case (where $A=B$ or one is empty).
5. Interpreting mathematical notation ($A \times B$) in a logical/set-theoretic context rather than a purely numeric one.
