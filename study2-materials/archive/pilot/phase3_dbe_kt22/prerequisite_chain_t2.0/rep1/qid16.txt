PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Set Theory notation: Understanding the curly brace `{}` notation for sets and comma-separated elements.
2. Definition of Union operator ($\cup$): Knowing that $A \cup B$ combines all unique elements from both sets.
3. Computational execution of Union: Correctlly identifying that $\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\} \cup \{3,5,7\} = \{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ (in this specific case, $B$ is a subset of $A$, so the union is $A$).
4. Definition of Proper Subset symbol ($\subset$): Distinguishing between "subset" ($\subseteq$) and "proper subset" ($\subset$), and knowing that $X \subset Y$ is true if all elements of $X$ are in $Y$ AND $X \neq Y$. 
5. Comparison Logic: Comparing set $B$ $\{3,5,7\}$ against the result of the union $\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ to verify if the inclusion holds and the sets are not equal.
6. Evaluation of Boolean statement: Correcting mapping the logic to the "True/False" selection.
7. Identifying "noise" information: Recognizing that Set C is irrelevant to the specific statement being evaluated and must be ignored.
