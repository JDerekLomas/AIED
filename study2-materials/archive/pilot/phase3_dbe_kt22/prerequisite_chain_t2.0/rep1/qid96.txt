PREREQUISITES:
1. **Differentiating Entities from Data Values**: Ability to distinguish between an attribute name (the category/header) and a data value (the instance-level information) within a conceptual model.
2. **Identification of Supertype/Subtype Specialization**: Recognizing that "trainers" are a subtype of "employees" and identifying which descriptive text refers to their specific properties.
3. **Multivalued Attribute Recognition**: Understanding that "one or more specialities" implies that "speciality" is the attribute name, while "weight gain," "weight loss," and "strength building" are specific instances or examples of those values.
4. **Reading Comprehension (Identifying Domain-Specific Terms)**: Ability to parse the phrase "e.g., weight gain, weight loss, strength building" and correctly interpret "e.g." (exempli gratia) as a pointer to examples, not metadata headers.
5. **Ignoring Distractors/Noise**: Maintaining focus on the specific question asked at the end of a very dense, multi-paragraph case study containing irrelevant information (technicians, classes, equipment maintenance).
6. **Understanding Schema vs. Instance**: Applying the rule that a schema (model) consists of attributes that hold varying data values.
