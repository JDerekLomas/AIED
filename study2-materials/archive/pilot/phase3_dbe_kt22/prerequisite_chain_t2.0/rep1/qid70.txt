To provide an accurate estimate, I am assuming a standard relational database schema where the `Study` table exists and contains several records, likely with varying capitalisations of the name 'Tom' (e.g., 'Tom', 'TOM', 'tom'). 

**PREREQUISITES:**
1. **Understanding `SELECT *`**: Knowing that this retrieves columns, but the question asks for the row count.
2. **Schema Reading (Implicit)**: Understanding that the `Study` table must contain a column named `Name`.
3. **Knowledge of the `lower()` function**: Knowing that this function converts string data to lowercase.
4. **Case Sensitivity in SQL**: Understanding that string comparisons in standard SQL (and specifically for a result of 1 or more to be meaningful here) are case-sensitive, otherwise the `lower()` function would be redundant.
5. **String Literal Recognition**: Identifying that `'tom'` is a lowercase literal.
6. **Matching Logic**: Correcting identifying that any variation of "Tom" (TOM, Tom, tOm) will transform to 'tom' and thus be counted.
7. **Distinguishing Rows from Values**: Ensuring the student counts the *number of occurrences* that satisfy the predicate rather than returning a specific value.
8. **Evaluation of "Study" Data**: If this refers to a specific exercise or diagram common in South African curriculum textbooks (like a "University" or "Medical Research" sample database), the student must accurately retrieve the count from memory or the provided diagram.

**COUNT: 8**

Given the range of backgrounds—specifically that students at this level often struggle with the distinction between how data is stored versus how functions transform it for a query—the `lower()` function acts as a significant "distractor" or point of confusion.
