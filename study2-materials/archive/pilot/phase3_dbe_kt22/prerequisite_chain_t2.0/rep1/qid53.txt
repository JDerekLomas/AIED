PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Terminology Translation**: Mapping the formal relational model term "relation schema" to the SQL implementation term "Table".
2. **Distinguishing DDL vs. DML**: Understanding the difference between Data Definition Language (removing a structure/metadata) and Data Manipulation Language (removing tuples/rows).
3. **Keyword Recall (Drop)**: Knowing that `DROP` is the specific SQL verb used for removing entire structures from the schema.
4. **Keyword Recall (Delete)**: Knowing that `DELETE` is used for content removal and requires different syntax (`FROM`).
5. **Command Syntax Recognition**: Recognizing that `DROP TABLE` is the standard SQL-92 syntax, while `DROP RELATION` (though logically consistent with formal theory) is not valid SQL.
6. **Eliminating Distractors**: Identifying that "Delete table R" is syntactically invalid in SQL.
