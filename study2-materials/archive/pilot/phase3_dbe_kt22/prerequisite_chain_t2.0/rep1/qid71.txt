To accurately answer this question, a student must possess a specific set of foundational skills and conceptual understandings.

**PREREQUISITES:**
1.  **Reading a Schema/State:** Ability to interpret a table structure and its populated data (knowing which column is "CourseNo" and distinguishing headers from rows).
2.  **SQL SELECT Syntax:** Understanding that `SELECT [Column] FROM [Table]` extracts a specific attribute from all records.
3.  **Keyword "DISTINCT":** Knowing that this specific keyword mandates the removal of duplicate values from the final result set.
4.  **Value Comparison:** Correctly identifying identical values within the dataset (e.g., recognizing that 'CS101' and 'CS101' are the same entity).
5.  **Counting Operation:** Performing a final count of the unique items identified rather than returning the list itself.
6.  **Eliminating Distractors:** Avoiding the "Automatic Counting" trap, where a student might simply count all rows in the table (4) or assume the column length (4) without applying the filter.

**COUNT: 6**
