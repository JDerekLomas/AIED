PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a Cartesian product (A × B) as a set of ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.
2. Ability to extract the set of first elements from the given pairs to determine set A: {2, 3, 4}.
3. Ability to extract the set of unique second elements from the given pairs to determine set B: {5, 7}.
4. Validating the size of the set: Confirming that |A| × |B| (3 × 2) equals the stated total of 6 elements.
5. Systematically generating the full Cartesian product based on those extracted sets.
6. Distinguishing between the correct product (Option C) and distractors that include transposed coordinates, irrelevant values, or identical pairings (distinguishing between A, B, and C).
7. Recognizing that the order of pairs within the set curly braces does not matter, but the order of values within the parentheses does.
