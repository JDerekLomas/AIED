PREREQUISITES: 
1. Reading comprehension: Ability to filter out "noise" (attributes of technicians, equipment, and administrators) to focus only on the "Trainer" and "Fitness Class" entities.
2. Conceptual mapping: Identifying the specific sentence in the text that defines the business rule for the "instruct" relationship ("Each fitness class is... instructed by only one trainer").
3. Understanding the definition of "Participation Constraint": Knowing that it refers to whether every instance of an entity must participate in a relationship.
4. Distinguishing "Total" vs "Partial": Understanding that "Total" implies a mandatory requirement (must) and "Partial" implies an optional requirement (may/can).
5. Mapping business rules to constraints: Identifying that "each fitness class is... instructed by" implies every class instance in the database must be linked to a trainer, satisfying the definition of Total participation.
6. Avoiding the "inverse" trap: Not getting confused by the rule "Not all trainers deliver fitness classes," which describes the participation of the Trainer entity, not the Fitness Class entity.
7. Logic/Term translation: Correctly identifying that "is [always] instructed by" functions as a mandatory existence dependency.
