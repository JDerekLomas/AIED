PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of "Authentication": Distinguishing it from "Authorization" (knowing that authentication is about identity/proving who you are, whereas the options describe access control/permissions).
2. Distinguishing similar concepts: Recognizing that "restricting access" and "restricting operations" are definitions of Authorization (Access Control), not Authentication.
3. Analyzing distractors: Recognizing that while Authentication is a prerequisite for access control, the definition itself is not the method of restriction.
4. "All of the above" trap: Understanding that even if the student associates Authentication generally with security, the specific phrasing in A, B, and C refers to the same underlying concept (Authorization), making "All of the above" an attractive but incorrect choice if they cannot differentiate the two terms.
5. Vocabulary nuances: Understanding the specific meaning of "method of restricting" in a database security context.
