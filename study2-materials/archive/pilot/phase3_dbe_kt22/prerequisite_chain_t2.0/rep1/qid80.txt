To answer this question correctly, a student must possess the following prerequisites:

PREREQUISITES:
1.  **Reading a Schema Diagram:** Understanding the relationship between the `Course` and `Enrol` tables, specifically identifying the primary keys and foreign keys (e.g., `CourseID`).
2.  **Definition of NATURAL JOIN:** Knowing that a natural join automatically joins tables based on columns with the same name.
3.  **Equi-join logic:** Understanding that rows only appear in the result if there is a matching value in both tables for the join columns.
4.  **Identifying the Common Column:** Determining which specific column is shared between the two schemas (likely `CourseID`).
5.  **Multi-step reasoning (Cardinality):** Recognizing that in a join between a parent table (Course) and a child/transaction table (Enrol), the number of result rows is determined by the number of valid matches in the child table.
6.  **Distinguishing Join Types:** Not confusing a `NATURAL JOIN` with a `CROSS JOIN` (which would result in $7 \times 4 = 28$).
7.  **Data Inspection:** Accurately counting the records in the provided sample data that satisfy the join condition (realizing that if every enrollment points to a valid course, the count equals the number of rows in the `Enrol` table).

COUNT: 7

0.65
