PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a Super Key (SK) (a set of attributes whose closure contains all attributes in R).
2. Distinguishing between a Candidate Key (CK) and a Super Key (SK) (recognizing that an SK doesn't need to be minimal).
3. Knowing how to compute the attribute closure of a set (the $X^+$ algorithm).
4. Correct execution of the closure algorithm for $\{D\}$:
    - Step 1: Initial set is $\{D\}$.
    - Step 2: Apply $D \rightarrow ABC$. The set becomes $\{A, B, C, D\}$.
5. Set membership verification: Confirming that $\{A, B, C, D\}$ contains all attributes in $R=\{A, B, C, D\}$.
6. Multi-step logic: Connecting the result of the closure calculation to the "True/False" status of the Super Key definition.
