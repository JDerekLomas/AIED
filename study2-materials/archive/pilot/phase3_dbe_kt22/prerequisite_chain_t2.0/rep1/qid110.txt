PREREQUISITES: 
- Identification of functional dependency notation ($\Sigma$).
- Understanding the definition of "Attribute Closure" (finding all attributes functionally determined by a starting set).
- Ability to apply the Reflexivity rule (knowing $A$ is always in $A^+$).
- Execution of Armstrong's Transitivity rule (if $A \to B$ and $B \to C$, then $A \to C$).
- Proficiency in the "Union" or "Augmentation" logic to accumulate attributes.
- Recognizing the termination condition (no more attributes can be added because the LHS of $D \to ABC$ is not in the current set $\{A, B, C\}$).
- Distinguishing between a partial closure ($AB$ or $ABC$) and the full closure within the context of the provided options.
