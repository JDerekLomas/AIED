PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a "Transaction" in a database context.
2. Knowing the definition of an "Exclusive Lock" (X-lock) versus a "Shared Lock" (S-lock).
3. Recalling the "Read/Write" capability rule associated specifically with exclusive locks (the power to modify implies the power to read).
4. Distinguishing between a technical operation (Read/Write) and a SQL command (Update).
5. Interpreting the phrase "What operation(s) can a transaction perform" as asking for the maximum set of permitted actions.
6. Eliminating "Update" as a subset of "Write" or a specific command rather than the fundamental operational permission.
