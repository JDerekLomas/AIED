PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (defining elements within curly braces).
2. Understanding the Cartesian Product operator (x) and how to form a set of ordered pairs from two sets.
3. Ability to compute the specific result of (A x A), yielding {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}.
4. Ability to compute the specific result of (C x C) or conceptually recognize that because A is a subset of C, A x A must be a subset of C x C.
5. Understanding the subset symbol (⊆) and the formal requirement that every element in the first set must exist in the second set.
6. Identifying that 1 and 2 are elements of both A and C, thus maintaining the subset relationship.
7. Distinguishing between the elements (numbers) and the tuples (ordered pairs) to ensure the comparison is being made at the correct level of nesting.
8. Boolean evaluation (recognizing that the expression is a statement of fact to be judged True or False).
