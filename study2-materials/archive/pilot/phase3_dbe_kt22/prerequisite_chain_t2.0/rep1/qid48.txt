PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the formal definition of a **candidate key** (uniqueness and minimality).
2. Recalling the formal definition of a **superkey** (uniqueness property only).
3. Understanding the hierarchical relationship between keys (every candidate key is, by definition, a superkey).
4. Understanding the property of **monotonicity** in superkeys (adding any attribute to a superkey results in another superkey).
5. Distinguishing between a **primary/candidate key** and a **minimal key** to avoid the misconception that a larger set cannot be a superkey.
6. Identifying and rejecting a "subset" fallacy (falsely assuming that if a set is a key, its parts must also be keys).
7. Translating abstract set notation `{a, b}` and `{a, b, c}` into the functional dependencies of the relation.
