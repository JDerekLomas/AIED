PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of the definition of "concurrency" in a database context (multiple transactions executing at the same time).
2. Understanding the metric of "throughput" (number of transactions completed per unit of time) and why parallel execution increases it.
3. Understanding the metric of "average response time" and how interleaving prevents short transactions from waiting behind long-running ones (Convoy Effect).
4. Understanding "resource utilisation" (CPU/IO) and how overlapping transactions keeps hardware busy during idle wait times.
5. Ability to distinguish between "concurrency" and "parallelism" (or at least understand their shared benefits in this context).
6. Test-taking strategy for "All of the above" questions (verifying more than one option is correct to select D).
7. Comprehension of technical English terminology as applied in a South African higher education context.
