PREREQUISITES: 
- Understanding the core definition of SQL Injection (the insertion of malicious SQL code via user input).
- Distinguishing between "hard-coded" string literals and "external input" (user-controllable data).
- Identifying the `Request.form` object as a source of untrusted user input (as opposed to static variables).
- Parsing concatenated string syntax (distinguishing between a variable name and its literal value within quotes).
- Recognizing the role of single quotes (`'`) in SQL syntax and how they can be manipulated to terminate a command early.
- Eliminating distractors that look like concatenation but use safe, static values (Option C).
- Knowing that valid syntax does not guarantee safety from injection.
