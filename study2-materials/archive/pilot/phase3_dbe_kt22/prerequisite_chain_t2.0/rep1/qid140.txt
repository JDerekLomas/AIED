PREREQUISITES: 
- Understanding the definition of 3NF (Third Normal Form) and its criteria regarding transitive dependencies.
- Distinguishing between "minimising" and "eliminating" redundancy (conceptual nuance).
- Understanding the hierarchy of normal forms (BCNF is stricter/stronger than 3NF).
- Understanding the definition of BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) to compare its restrictiveness with 3NF.
- Recognizing that 3NF allows certain types of redundancy (due to overlapping candidate keys) that BCNF addresses.
- Multi-step reasoning: evaluating the truth of each comparative statement.
- Distinguishing similar terminology (3NF vs. BCNF hierarchy).
