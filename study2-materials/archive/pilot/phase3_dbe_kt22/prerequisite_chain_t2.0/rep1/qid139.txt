PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the formal definition of 3rd Normal Form (3NF).
2. Understanding the formal definition of Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), specifically the requirement that every determinant must be a candidate key.
3. Identifying the hierarchy of normal forms (the fact that BCNF is "stronger" or "stricter" than 3NF, meaning BCNF $\subset$ 3NF).
4. Distinguishing between "less restrictive" (easier to satisfy) and "stricter" (harder to satisfy) terminology.
5. Understanding that normalization addresses redundancy caused by functional dependencies, but cannot mathematically eliminate all possible forms of redundancy (e.g., temporal or multi-valued redundancies not covered by FDs).
6. Evaluating Option A by comparing the definitions of 3NF and BCNF.
7. Evaluating Option B vs C by distinguishing between "theoretical perfection" (eliminating redundancy) and the reality that BCNF specifically targets anomalies caused by FDs while some redundancy might persist.
