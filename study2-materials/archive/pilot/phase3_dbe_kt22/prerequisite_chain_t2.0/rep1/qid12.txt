PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Set Notation: Understanding that curly braces { } denote a set of elements.
2. Understanding the Union operator (∪): Knowing that it combines all elements from both sets without duplicates.
3. Understanding the Intersection operator (∩): Knowing that it identifies only elements common to both sets.
4. Correct Order of Operations: Interpreting parentheses correctly to perform (A ∪ B) before intersecting with C.
5. Accuracy in Set Derivation: Correcting calculating {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} for (A ∪ B).
6. Pattern Matching/Filtering: Correcting identifying {6, 7} as the overlap between the intermediate set and set C.
7. Identifying the irrelevant set: Recognizing that set D is an "inhibitor" or distractor not used in the calculation.
8. Multiple Choice Selection: Correcting matching the mental result to Option B.
