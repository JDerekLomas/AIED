PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Understanding the scenario**: Identifying that a "password" represents a first layer of security and an "SMS code" represents a second.
2. **Knowledge of "What you know"**: Identifying that a password falls into this category.
3. **Knowledge of "What you have"**: Recognizing that receiving an SMS implies possession of a specific physical device (the registered phone).
4. **Knowledge of "Two-factor authentication" (2FA)**: Understanding that the combination of two different categories (know + have) defines 2FA.
5. **Distinguishing single vs. multi-factor**: Avoiding the trap of selecting only "What you know" (Option B) just because a password was mentioned first.
6. **Vocabulary**: Knowing that "what you are" refers to biometrics and ruling it out.
7. **Synthesis**: Recognizing that while B is true, D is the *most* complete and accurate description of the "example" as a whole.
