PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the ACID acronym (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) in the context of database transactions.
2. Knowing the definition of "Isolation" (preventing concurrent transactions from interfering with one another).
3. Mapping logical properties (ACID) to specific DBMS components (e.g., Recovery Manager handles Atomicity/Durability; Concurrency Control handles Isolation).
4. Distinguishing between "Concurrency Control" and "Recovery Manager," as these are often taught together and frequently confused by novices.
5. Vocabulary comprehension of the "manager" terms within a DBMS architecture.
6. Eliminating irrelevant components like the Storage or File Manager, which handle physical data layout rather than transactional logic.
