PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Venn diagram notation (interpreting shaded vs. unshaded regions).
2. Knowledge of the Set Union ($\cup$) operator (combining elements of both sets).
3. Knowledge of the Set Intersection ($\cap$) operator (identifying common elements).
4. Knowledge of the Set Difference ($-$) operator (removing elements of one set from another).
5. Understanding of operator precedence or the role of parentheses in set algebra.
6. Ability to mentally map the logical expression $(A \cup B) - (A \cap B)$ to the "Symmetric Difference" visual (shaded outer leaves with a white center).
7. Distinguishing the provided visual from the standard Union (which would shade the center) or Difference (which would only shade one side).
