PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Understanding set notation**: Recognizing that `{...}` denotes a set and commas separate elements.
2. **Knowledge of Set Difference (-)**: Knowing that $A - B$ means elements in $A$ that are not in $B$.
3. **Execution of First Sub-calculation**: Correcting identifying $A - B = \{3\}$.
4. **Execution of Second Sub-calculation**: Correcting identifying $B - A = \{5\}$.
5. **Knowledge of Set Union ($\cup$)**: Knowing that the symbol denotes combining elements from both sets without duplication.
6. **Final Synthesis**: Correcting performing $\{3\} \cup \{5\} = \{3, 5\}$.
7. **Mapping result to MCQ**: Identifying that the derived set $\{3, 5\}$ matches option C.
8. **Avoiding Common Misconceptions**: Not confusing Union with Intersection or Symmetric Difference with relative complement.
