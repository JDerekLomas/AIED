PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Knowledge of Set Notation:** Understanding how to interpret sets defined within curly braces.
2. **Set Union Operator ($\cup$):** Knowing how to combine elements from set A and set C while eliminating duplicates.
3. **Subset vs. Proper Subset Operator ($\subset$):** Understanding the specific requirement of the "subset of" relation (all elements of the left set must be present in the right set).
4. **Order of Operations (Parentheses):** Correctly prioritizing the union $(A \cup C)$ before evaluating the subset relationship.
5. **Execution of Union:** Correctly calculating $(A \cup C) = \{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$.
6. **Comparison Logic:** Recognizing that $\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ is significantly larger than and not contained within $\{3,5,7\}$.
7. **Cardinality Reasoning:** Noticing that if $|A \cup C| > |B|$, the statement must be false without needing to check every individual element.
8. **Distinguishing $\in$ from $\subset$:** Avoiding the common confusion between "element of" and "subset of" (though less relevant here, it is a frequent failure point in set theory).
