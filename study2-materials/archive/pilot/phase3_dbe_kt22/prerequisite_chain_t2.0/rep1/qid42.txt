PREREQUISITES: 
- Recall of formal terminology for a Relational Database (knowing a 'tuple' is a row and an 'attribute' is a column).
- Understanding the definition of a 'Superkey' as the most inclusive set of attributes that uniquely identifies a record.
- Distinguishing between 'Superkey' and 'Foreign key' (common point of confusion for beginners who associate keys primarily with relationships).
- Recognition of the phrase 'set of one or more attributes taken collectively' as standard relational algebra nomenclature.
- Identifying that 'Subkey' is a distractor/pseudo-technical term not used in standard relational definitions.
- Distinguishing the definition of 'Domain' (set of permitted values for an attribute) from identifiers.
