PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the formal definition of Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), specifically that the left-hand side of every non-trivial FD must be a superkey.
2. Recalling the formal definition of Third Normal Form (3NF), specifically the disjunctive nature of its requirement (X is a superkey OR A is a prime attribute).
3. Distinguishing between the definitions of BCNF and 3NF, which are frequently conflated by students.
4. Identifying the term "non-trivial functional dependency" and its implications in normalization rules.
5. Identifying the definition of a "prime attribute" (an attribute that is part of some candidate key).
6. Parsing multiple-choice options where the descriptors (BCNF vs. 3NF) and the conditions (Superkey vs. Prime Attribute) are swapped/interchanged (matching Option C to the correct definition of BCNF).
7. Recognizing that Option D is a partial definition of 3NF (it lacks the "X is a superkey" alternative), whereas Option C is the complete and precise definition of BCNF.
