PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the formal definition of Third Normal Form (3NF).
2. Recalling the formal definition of Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF).
3. Understanding the hierarchical/nested relationship between normal forms (the subset/superset principle).
4. Interpreting the logical "If P, then Q" (implication) structure in the context of set membership.
5. Distinguishing between a requirement (must be) and a possibility (can be).
6. Recognising that BCNF is a stricter refinement of 3NF (all BCNF relations satisfy 3NF, but not all 3NF relations satisfy BCNF).
