To provide an accurate estimate, I am assuming a standard teaching context where students have been provided with a schema diagram or a table instance for the `Study` relation containing 6 tuples (a common pedagogical figure) but featuring duplicate `StudentID` values or specific null/unique constraints that might mislead a novice.

PREREQUISITES:
1. **Schema Interpretation**: Identifying the specific table (`Study`) being queried from a potentially larger ERD or schema listing.
2. **Knowledge of SELECT Cardinality**: Understanding that a standard `SELECT` (without `DISTINCT`) returns one row for every row that satisfies the `FROM` clause, regardless of duplicates in the projected columns.
3. **Absence of WHERE Clause**: Recognizing that because there is no filter, the row count of the result must equal the total row count of the source table.
4. **Data Retrieval/Counting**: Accurately counting the records present in the provided instance of the `Study` table without skipping rows or double-counting.
5. **Distinguishing SELECT from relational algebra projections**: Knowing that SQL defaults to multiset (bag) semantics rather than set semantics (where duplicates would be removed).

COUNT: 5
