PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Understanding relational terminology**: Distinguishing between the formal mathematical terms (relation, attribute, tuple) and their common file-system counterparts (table, column, row).
2. **Reading a schema declaration**: Identifying that the names inside the parentheses `Course(...)` represent the headers/columns of the table.
3. **Distinguishing 'Relation' from 'Relation Schema'**: Recognizing that "Course" is the relation (table) while the components within it are its properties.
4. **Knowledge of specific definitions**:
    *   **Attribute**: Knowing this refers to a named column or property.
    *   **Tuple**: Knowing this refers to a record/row (and realizing no data values are present here).
    *   **Instance**: Knowing this refers to the data currently in the table at a specific moment.
5. **English proficiency and context**: Understanding that the "blank" refers back to the specific list provided (courseID, courseName, semester).
