PREREQUISITES: 
1. Vocabulary: Understanding the formal relational model term "Tuple" as a synonym for "Row".
2. Vocabulary: Understanding the formal relational model term "Attribute" as a synonym for "Column".
3. Concept Knowledge: Knowing the mathematical definition of a relation as a *set* (which is unordered) rather than a list.
4. Concept Knowledge: Understanding that attribute identity is determined by name/label rather than ordinal position.
5. Distinction: Differentiating between a physical implementation (where order often exists in storage/display) and the logical relational model (where it does not).
6. Multi-step Matching: Correctly mapping "Not important" to both "Tuple" and "Attribute" and identifying the corresponding multiple-choice option (Option D) without swapping the two in the mental process.
