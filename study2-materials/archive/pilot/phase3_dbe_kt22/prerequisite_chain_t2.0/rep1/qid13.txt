PREREQUISITES: 
1. Set difference notation (understanding the $A - B$ operator means elements in $A$ not in $B$).
2. Set intersection notation (understanding the $\cap$ operator means elements common to both sets).
3. Order of operations/Grouping (evaluating the expressions inside the parentheses before performing the intersection).
4. Accurate execution of set difference 1 (calculating $\{2, 3, 4, 5\} - \{8, 9, 10, 11\} = \{2, 3, 4, 5\}$).
5. Accurate execution of set difference 2 (calculating $\{4, 5, 6, 7\} - \{6, 7, 8, 9\} = \{4, 5\}$).
6. Accurate execution of intersection (finding common elements between $\{2, 3, 4, 5\}$ and $\{4, 5\}$).
7. Attention to detail/avoiding transcription errors (noting the specific numbers in the provided sets correctly).
