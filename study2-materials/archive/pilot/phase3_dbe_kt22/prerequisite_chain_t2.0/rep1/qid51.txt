PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of standard SQL character types (CHAR vs VARCHAR).
2. Distinguishing between generic programming language terminology (e.g., Python or Java's "String") and SQL-specific type keywords.
3. Specific knowledge of PostgreSQL’s documentation or common type aliases (Postgres uses `TEXT` or `VARCHAR`, but not `STRING`).
4. Knowledge of bit-string types (`BIT(n)`), which are less common in introductory tutorials but supported in PostgreSQL.
5. Ability to identify the "negative" question (identifying the one that is *not* supported).
6. Recalling that while many languages use "String," SQL standards and Postgres specifically use "Character" or "Text."
