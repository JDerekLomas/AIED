PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the purpose and symbology of Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams (specifically how they represent conceptual rather than physical schemas).
2. Distinguishing between "Conceptual Modeling" (ER diagrams) and "Physical/Logical Implementation" (SQL constraints).
3. Recalling the specific visual notation for identifiers (underlined attributes) and identifying them as "Primary Key" constraints.
4. Knowing that Foreign Keys are an implementation detail of the relational model (often represented as relationships in ER, but rarely labeled as "foreign keys" themselves).
5. Understanding the definition of a "Domain Constraint" (data types, ranges, nullability) and recognizing that standard ER diagrams do not typically represent these explicitly in the visual model.
6. Eliminating B and C to conclude that A is the standard answer based on basic textbook ER notation (Chen or Crow's Foot).
