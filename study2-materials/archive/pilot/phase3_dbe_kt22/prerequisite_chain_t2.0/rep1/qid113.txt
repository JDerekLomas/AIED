PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the notation of a relation schema $R$ (identifying the set of all available attributes).
2. Understanding Functional Dependency (FD) notation ($X \to Y$) and what it implies for attribute derivation.
3. Knowing the definition of "Attribute Closure" ($X^+$) as the set of all attributes functionally determined by $X$.
4. Ability to initialize the closure set with the starting attribute ($D$).
5. Mastery of Armstrong’s Axioms, specifically the Transitive Rule or the "Closure Algorithm" (iteratively scanning the set $\Sigma$).
6. Multi-step reasoning: Correctly applying $D \to ABC$ to include $\{A, B, C\}$ in the set.
7. Set Union: Recognizing that $\{D\} \cup \{A, B, C\} = \{A, B, C, D\}$.
8. Identifying the stop condition: Realizing that once the closure contains all attributes in $R$, no further steps are needed (even though $A \to B$ and $B \to C$ are present).
