PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of the Cartesian Product symbol ($\times$): Understanding that it represents the set of all ordered pairs from two sets.
2. Notation for sets: Recognizing that $\{\dots\}$ denotes a collection of unique elements.
3. Notation for ordered pairs: Recognizing that $(a, b)$ indicates an element where the first part comes from the first set and the second part comes from the second set.
4. Identifying the First Component Rule: Realizing that the set of all first elements in the pairs $\{p, p, q, q\}$ maps to set $A$.
5. Identifying the Second Component Rule: Realizing that the set of all second elements in the pairs $\{x, y, x, y\}$ maps to set $B$.
6. Set Element Uniqueness: Knowing that duplicates in the derived collections ($p, p$ and $x, y, x, y$) are collapsed into single elements $\{p, q\}$ and $\{x, y\}$ when defining the sets.
7. Distinguishing Order: Differentiating between Choice A and Choice D to ensure $A$ corresponds to the first elements and $B$ to the second elements.
