PREREQUISITES: 
1. Set Notation: Understanding curly braces {} represent a set of discrete elements.
2. Set Intersection Symbol: Correctly identifying '∩' as the intersection operator.
3. Definition of Intersection: Knowing that elements in A ∩ B must exist in both sets A and B.
4. Logical Deduction (Lower Bound): Recognizing that since {2, 3} is in B, set B must contain at least those 2 specific elements.
5. Identifying the Minimum Cardinality: Understanding that if A ∩ B contains two elements, the size (n) of B must be ≥ 2.
6. Negative Constraint Mapping: Understanding the phrase "cannot be" to identify the choice that violates the rule (n ≥ 2).
7. Basic Counting: Recognizing that 1 is the only value less than 2.
