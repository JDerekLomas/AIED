PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Set Theory notation (specifically the intersection symbol $\cap$).
2. Understanding the semantic definition of the intersection operator (finding common elements between $A$ and $C$).
3. Accurately performing the mental or written filtering to determine $A \cap C = \{3, 5, 7, 9\}$.
4. Recognition of the "subset" symbol $\subset$ versus the "not a subset of" symbol $\not\subset$.
5. Understanding the definition of a subset (every element of $B$ must be in the target set).
6. Ability to evaluate the truth value of the "not a subset" claim (negation logic).
7. Distinguishing between a "proper subset" and "subset" if the student overthinks the notation (though not strictly necessary here, it is a common point of confusion).
8. Executing a multi-step logical chain without a clerical error (e.g., misreading the number 9 in set C but its absence in B).
