PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of set equality (two sets are equal if and only if they contain the exact same elements).
2. Knowledge of the "order independence" property of sets (realizing that {1, 2, 3} and {2, 1, 3} are the same collection).
3. Ability to perform element-by-element comparison across different sets.
4. Distinguishing between a subset relationship and a set equality relationship (specifically for options A and B).
5. Scanning accuracy (carefully checking the integers in Option D to notice the 4 vs 3).
