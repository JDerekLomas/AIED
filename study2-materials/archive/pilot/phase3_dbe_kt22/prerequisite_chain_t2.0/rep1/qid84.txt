To accurately answer this question, a student must navigate several conceptual and technical hurdles.

**PREREQUISITES:**
1.  **Reading Schema Diagrams/Data Instances:** The student must correctly identify and parse the sample data for the `Course` and `Enrol` tables (implied as provided in the context of this specific problem).
2.  **Understanding the `SELECT *` scope:** Recognizing that the result count is based on rows from the `Course` table, not the `Enrol` table.
3.  **Core Subquery Logic:** Understanding that a subquery is evaluated in the context of the outer query.
4.  **`EXISTS` Semantics:** Knowing that `EXISTS` returns true if the subquery returns *at least one* row, regardless of how many matches exist in the subquery table.
5.  **Correlated Subquery Mechanism:** Recognizing the link `c.CourseNo = e.CourseNo` and realizing the query iterates through `Course`, checking for presence in `Enrol`.
6.  **Set vs. Multiset Distinction:** Understanding that even if a `CourseNo` appears 20 times in the `Enrol` table (multiple students enrolled), it only satisfies the `EXISTS` condition once for that specific `Course` row.
7.  **Data Matching/Counting:** Accurately performing the visual "join" or lookup between the two tables provided in the exam paper without a "skipping" error or misreading an ID.

**COUNT:** 7
