PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Understanding of the "negative" question format**: The student must correctly identify that they are looking for the *false* statement among three true ones.
2. **Definition of a Trojan Horse**: Knowledge that it is malware disguised as legitimate software.
3. **Knowledge of infection vectors**: Knowing that Trojans rely on social engineering/misleading users rather than autonomous spreading (Rule: Trojans do not self-replicate).
4. **Distinguishing between malware types**: Ability to differentiate the specific characteristics of a Trojan from those of a Virus or a Worm (Self-replication is the defining characteristic of the latter two).
5. **Understanding "payload" behavior**: Recognizing that Trojans typically execute hidden tasks like data exfiltration or system monitoring in the background.
