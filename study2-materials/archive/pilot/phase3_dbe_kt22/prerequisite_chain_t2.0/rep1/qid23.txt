PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of Set Theory notation (braces and commas representing discrete elements).
2. Definition of Set Difference (relative complement): understanding that A - B means elements in A that are NOT in B.
3. Awareness of set order independence: recognizing that {2, 3, 1} is identical to {1, 2, 3} (relevant for options C and D).
4. Conceptual understanding of the Identity property for set subtraction: knowing that A - B = B - A only if A = B (or both are empty).
5. Accurate execution of set subtraction for option A: calculating {1} vs {4}.
6. Accurate execution of set subtraction for option B: calculating ∅ vs {4}.
7. Identifying "equality" in sets: knowing that ∅ is not equal to {4}.
8. Ability to distinguish between the minus operator in arithmetic (where signs might flip) and the set difference operator.
9. Logical elimination: checking all four options to ensure no silly errors in evaluating the curly-brace contents.
