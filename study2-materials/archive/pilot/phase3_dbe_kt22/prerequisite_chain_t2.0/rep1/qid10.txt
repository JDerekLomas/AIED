PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Set Notation: Identifying that curly braces and letters represent discrete sets of elements.
2. Understanding Intersection (∩): Knowing that A ∩ B results in a set containing only elements present in both A and B.
3. Understanding Set Difference (-): Knowing that A - B means removing elements of the second set from the first set, not arithmetic subtraction.
4. Identifying Elements: Correctly scanning the sets to identify that {4, 5} are the shared elements between A and B.
5. Order of Operations: Applying the parenthesis correctly to resolve the intersection before the set difference.
6. Execution of Difference: Correctly "subtracting" {4, 5} from {2, 3, 4, 5} to arrive at {2, 3}.
7. Avoiding Distractors: Ignoring sets C and D, which are irrelevant to the specific calculation but are included to test focus.
