PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of the 2PL definition (the two distinct phases: growing and shrinking).
2. Understanding the specific constraint of the "Shrinking Phase" (no new locks can be acquired once one is released).
3. Ability to distinguish Basic 2PL from Conservative (Static) 2PL (to evaluate Statement C).
4. Ability to distinguish Basic 2PL from Strict/Rigorous 2PL (to evaluate Statement B regarding the release point).
5. Understanding the logic of "All of the above" questions in a multiple-choice context.
6. Technical reading comprehension to identify that Statement A is the fundamental rule of the 2PL protocol, whereas B and C describe specific *variants* (Strict and Conservative) but are not universal requirements of the base protocol.
