PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) by name.
2. Understanding the specific function of the Transaction Manager component in a DBMS architecture.
3. Knowledge of Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) and the recovery subsystem's role.
4. Distinguishing "Consistency" (often conflated with Integrity) from the state-based properties managed via logging.
5. Understanding that Isolation is primarily enforced through concurrency control mechanisms (like Locks or Timestamps) rather than logging.
6. Identifying that logging provides the "undo" information for aborted transactions (Atomicity) and the "redo" information for committed transactions after a crash (Durability).
7. Avoiding the "Integrity" distractor, which relates to schema constraints rather than transaction logs.
