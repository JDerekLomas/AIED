PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of basic SQL DDL syntax (the `CREATE TABLE` command structure).
2. Knowledge of valid SQL delimiters (distinguishing between commas and semicolons within a statement).
3. Distinguishing between a terminal semicolon (end of statement) and a separator within the schema definition.
4. Mapping conceptual data types (STRING) to implementation-specific SQL data types (VARCHAR).
5. Precision in reading syntax (spotting the trailing comma in Option A versus the semicolon in Option C).
6. Understanding that `VARCHAR` is the standard implementation for `STRING` in the context of relational databases.
