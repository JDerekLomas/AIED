PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the `WITH GRANT OPTION` clause and its implication that a recipient becomes a "sub-grantor."
2. Recognizing that a relation owner (Linda) possesses all privileges inherently.
3. Tracking the internal "Grant Diagram" or lineage: recognizing that Peter received the privilege from two distinct sources (Linda directly and Amy).
4. Understanding the `CASCADE` keyword: specifically that it invalidates all privileges that exist *solely* because they were granted by the revoked user (Amy).
5. Distinguishing between dependent and independent privileges: realizing that because Peter has an independent grant from Linda (Step 1), the revocation of Amy’s grant (Step 3) only destroys the path through Amy, not the path through Linda.
6. Applying the rule that a privilege persists as long as at least one valid grant path exists in the authorization graph.
