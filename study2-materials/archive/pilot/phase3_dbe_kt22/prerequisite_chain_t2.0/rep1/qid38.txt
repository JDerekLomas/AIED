PREREQUISITES: 
1. Vocabulary Mapping: Linking the formal relational model term "attribute" to its physical implementation term "column."
2. Synonym Recognition: Identifying that "tuple" is a synonym for "row" and therefore both A and D represent the same (incorrect) concept in this context.
3. Distinction of Components: Distinguishing between a structural component of a table (column/attribute) and the data contained within it (value/cell).
4. Reading Comprehension: Identifying that the question asks for a definition of a structural part of the relational model.
