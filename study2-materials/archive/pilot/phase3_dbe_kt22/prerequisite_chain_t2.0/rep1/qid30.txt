PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (braces, commas, and element identification).
2. Knowledge of the Cartesian Product operator (x) and how it generates ordered pairs.
3. Ability to calculate the cardinality of a Cartesian product (identifying that C x D results in 9 elements).
4. Knowledge of the Set Difference operator (–) and the rule that elements in the first set are removed if they appear in the second.
5. Systematic execution of the subtraction (finding that the 4 elements of A x B are a subset of C x D and must be excluded).
6. Multi-step reasoning to combine the operations in the correct order.
7. Attention to detail/Scanning: Distinguishing between similar-looking ordered pairs in the options (e.g., ensuring all (3,x) elements are present in Option A).
