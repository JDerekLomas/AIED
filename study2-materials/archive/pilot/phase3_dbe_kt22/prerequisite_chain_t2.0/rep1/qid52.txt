PREREQUISITES: 
- Knowing that "Relation" is the formal relational model term for a "Table" in SQL.
- Recalling specific SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) syntax (the keyword `CREATE`).
- Distinguishing between PostgreSQL-specific implementation and theoretical terminology.
- Eliminating plausible but incorrect natural language distractors ("New").
- Identifying the correct syntax structure (space vs no space, though not the primary focus here, the presence of parentheses matters).
