PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of Set Theory notation (identifying { } as a set).
2. Understanding the Cartesian Product operation (A x B) as the set of all possible ordered pairs.
3. Ability to mentally or physically generate the elements of (A x B), which is {(1,a), (1,b), (2,a), (2,b)}.
4. Ability to mentally or physically generate the elements of (C x D), or at least identify that its range covers the elements of (A x B).
5. Understanding the Subset symbol (⊆) and its definition (every element in the first set must exist in the second).
6. Evaluating the truth value by checking if A is a subset of C AND B is a subset of D (a common shortcut or property of Cartesian products).
7. Avoiding a "surface level" distraction where the student might assume False simply because C and D have "extra" elements (3 and c).
