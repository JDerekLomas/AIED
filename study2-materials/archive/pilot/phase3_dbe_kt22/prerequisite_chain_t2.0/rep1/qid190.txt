PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) as an abstraction layer between users and permissions.
2. Distinguishing between a "Resource" (the object being accessed) and a "Role" (the entity to which permissions are assigned).
3. Recognizing that in RBAC, roles typically align with organizational functions, job titles, or departments rather than the technical objects themselves.
4. Identifying "Sales, Marketing, Management, and Production" as the functional entities in the prompt that would logically represent the "subjects/roles" needing grouped permissions.
5. Multi-step reasoning: Filtering out "Workstation" and "Resources" as targets of access rather than holders of access.
6. Reading comprehension: Distinguishing the business structure from the technical asset list within the provided scenario.
