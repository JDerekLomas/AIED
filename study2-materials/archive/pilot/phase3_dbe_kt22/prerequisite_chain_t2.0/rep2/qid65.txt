PREREQUISITES:
1. Syntax knowledge: Identifying the correct keyword for creating a relation schema (`CREATE TABLE`).
2. Schema mapping: Recognizing that the abstract data type `STRING` in a logical schema definition maps to concrete SQL types like `VARCHAR` or `CHAR`.
3. Punctuation (Attribute Separation): Distinguishing between the use of semicolons (invalid) and commas (valid) to separate attribute definitions within the parentheses.
4. Punctuation (Statement Termination): Recognizing the role of the semicolon as the standard SQL statement terminator versus a trailing comma.
5. Pattern Matching: Carefully comparing the minor typographical differences between Option B (ending in a comma) and Option C (ending in a semicolon) to identify the valid SQL statement.
6. Identifying valid parentheses: Knowing that attribute lists must be enclosed in parentheses.
