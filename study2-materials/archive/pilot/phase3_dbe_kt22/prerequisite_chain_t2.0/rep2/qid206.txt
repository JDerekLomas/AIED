PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of "Concurrency": Understanding that it refers to multiple transactions executing at the same time/interleaved rather than serially.
2. Definition of "Throughput": Knowing this measures the amount of work (transactions) completed in a given time period.
3. Definition of "Response Time": Understanding this is the duration from submission to completion for an individual user/task.
4. Definition of "Utilization": Recognizing this relates to keeping system resources (CPU, Disk I/O) busy.
5. Understanding Resource Overlap: Realizing that while one transaction waits for I/O, another can use the CPU (the mechanism behind the advantages).
6. Multi-select logic: Recognizing that if two or more options seem correct, "All of the above" is the necessary choice.
7. Distinguishing Performance from Correctness: Disregarding potential disadvantages (like race conditions/locking overhead) to focus specifically on the benefits.
