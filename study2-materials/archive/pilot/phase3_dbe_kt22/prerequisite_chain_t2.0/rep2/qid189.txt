PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of SQL Injection (SQLi) as a vulnerability occurring when user-supplied data is concatenated into a query string without sanitization.
2. Identifying `Request.form ("City")` as a source of untrusted user input (as opposed to hard-coded strings).
3. Distinguishing between string concatenation with a variable containing user input (A) vs. string concatenation with a static, hard-coded variable (C).
4. Reading and tracing a multi-step sequence of assignments in pseudo-code/JavaScript-like syntax.
5. Understanding that fixed, constant queries (B) are inherently immune to injection attacks because there is no input vector.
6. Recognizing the syntactical "trick" of single quotes used in the concatenation logic to terminate a string literal.
7. Correctly evaluating the "None of the above" option against three distinct code samples.
