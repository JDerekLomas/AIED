PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Set Notation: Understanding that braces `{}` and letters represent sets of distinct elements.
2. Intersection Operator (∩): Knowing that $A \cap B$ identifies elements common to both sets ({4, 5}).
3. Set Difference Operator (-): Knowing that $X - Y$ means removing elements of $Y$ from $X$.
4. Order of Operations: Understanding that parentheses dictate solving the intersection before the subtraction.
5. Identifying "Distractors": Recognizing that sets C and D are irrelevant information (noise) provided to test focus.
6. Execution Accuracy: Correctly performing the arithmetic/exclusion without a "off-by-one" or mental slip (mistaking {4,5} for the final answer instead of the result of the subtraction).
