PREREQUISITES: 
1. Vocabulary recognition: Identifying "INSERT" as the specific SQL keyword for data manipulation (DML).
2. Distinguishing DML from DDL: Understanding that "ALTER TABLE" modifies the structure/schema, not the data rows.
3. Distinguishing SQL syntax from natural language: Recognizing that "Add row" and "Append" are intuitive English terms but syntactically invalid in standard SQL.
4. Schema terminology: Understanding that "adding new rows" refers to the process of data insertion.
