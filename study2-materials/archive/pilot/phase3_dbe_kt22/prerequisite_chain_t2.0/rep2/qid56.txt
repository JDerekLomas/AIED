PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the specific definition of the `CHAR` data type as static/padding-based.
2. Recalling the specific definition of the `VARCHAR` data type as dynamic/variable.
3. Distinguishing between "fixed" and "variable" as technical descriptors in a data storage context.
4. Mapping the sequential blanks in the question to the sequential pairs in the multiple-choice options (pattern matching).
5. Understanding that the `(n)` parameter represents a maximum bound rather than a forced size for both types simultaneously.

COUNT: 5
