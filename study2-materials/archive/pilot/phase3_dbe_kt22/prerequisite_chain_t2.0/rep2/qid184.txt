PREREQUISITES: 
- Distinguishing between the `GRANT` and `REVOKE` DDL statements (knowing that avoiding "cascading of revoking" happens during the revocation phase, not the granting phase).
- Understanding the default behavior of the `REVOKE` command in standard SQL (which is often `CASCADE` depending on the DBMS).
- Knowledge of the `RESTRICT` keyword specifically as the mechanism to prevent a revocation if it would cause orphaned privileges.
- Knowledge of standard SQL syntax (identifying that `no cascade` and `no restrict` are syntactically invalid or non-standard).
- Ability to distinguish between the two types of revocation dependencies: manual cascading (dropping downstream permissions) vs. restricting the action entirely.
