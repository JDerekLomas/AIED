PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the Cartesian Product operator (x) and how to form ordered pairs.
2. Understanding the Set Difference operator (–) and that order matters (C-A vs A-C).
3. Accuracy in exhaustive manual computation: correctly generating the 9 pairs for (C x D).
4. Accuracy in exhaustive manual computation: correctly generating the 4 pairs for (A x B).
5. Pattern recognition/comparison: identifying which specific elements from (A x B) are subsets of (C x D) to be removed.
6. Reading comprehension: identifying the sets by their assigned labels (distinguishing A/B/C/D) rather than assuming alphabetical order.
7. Filtering Distractors: recognizing that Choice B is actually the subtrahend (A x B) and Choice C is a partial calculation, then selecting the remaining elements correctly.
