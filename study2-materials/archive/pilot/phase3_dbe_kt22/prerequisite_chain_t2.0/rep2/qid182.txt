PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Defining MAC**: Knowing the fundamental definition of Mandatory Access Control (the "Mandatory" aspect) as being system-enforced rather than owner-defined.
2. **Identifying the Lattice Model**: Understanding that MAC relies on security labels/clearances (hierarchical or non-hierarchical levels) to classify both subjects and objects.
3. **Distinguishing MAC from DAC**: Differentiating it from Discretionary Access Control (Option B) and the "ownership" principle.
4. **Distinguishing MAC from SQL Implementation**: Recognizing that standard SQL `GRANT`/`REVOKE` syntax (Option C) is a DAC mechanism, not MAC.
5. **Distinguishing MAC from RBAC**: Recognizing that role-based structures (Option D) represent Role-Based Access Control, not Mandatory Access Control.
6. **Elimination Skills**: Successfully filtering through distractor options that describe more common, day-to-day access control methods students encounter in web development.
