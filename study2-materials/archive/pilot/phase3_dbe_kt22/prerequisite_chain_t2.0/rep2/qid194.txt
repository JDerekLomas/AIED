PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the "CIA Triad" (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) as the standard framework for database security.
2. Defining **Confidentiality** (restricting access to authorized users) and recognizing that it focuses on *viewing* rather than *modifying* data.
3. Defining **Integrity** as the maintenance of accuracy and consistency, specifically focusing on unauthorized or improper *modification*.
4. Defining **Availability** and recognizing it relates to system uptime and access, not the content of the data itself.
5. Interpreting the phrase "shouldn't change data unless they are supposed to" as authorization/access control (Entity Integrity/Security).
6. Interpreting the phrase "shouldn't change data in ways different from how they are supposed to" as maintaining the correctness or validity of data (Semantic/Domain Integrity).
7. Distinguishing between Accountability (tracking who did what) and the state/quality of the data itself (Integrity).
8. Navigating the specific phrasing of the question, which uses a simplified, layperson-style description of a formal technical term.
