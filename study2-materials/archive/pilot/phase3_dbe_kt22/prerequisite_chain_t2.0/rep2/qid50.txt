PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of a Superkey: Understanding that it is any set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple, including sets with redundant data.
2. Definition of a Candidate Key: Understanding the concept of "minimality" or being a "minimal superkey."
3. Definition of a Primary Key: Understanding that it is a single candidate key chosen by the DBA from the available set.
4. Set Inclusion Reasoning: Distinguishing between a superset (Superkey) and a subset (Candidate Key) to determine which concept "is always" the other.
5. Vocabulary nuances: Distinguishing between "Candidate" and "Primary" (many students mistakenly believe a table has only one key).
6. Logical quantifier interpretation: Correctly applying "is always" vs. "can be" across four similar-looking options.
