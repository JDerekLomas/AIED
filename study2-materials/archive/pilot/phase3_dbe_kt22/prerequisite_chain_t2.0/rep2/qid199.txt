PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of the ACID acronym (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
2. Definition of "Isolation" in the context of concurrent transaction execution (preventing interference).
3. Distinguishing between the specific roles of database engine components (Buffer/Storage Manager vs. Transaction/Recovery Manager).
4. Mapping the "Isolation" property specifically to "Concurrency Control" mechanisms (locks, timestamps) rather than general "Recovery."
5. Reading comprehension: identifying that "Recover manager" (sic) and "Concurrency control" refer to distinct sub-modules of the Transaction Manager.
6. Eliminating "Storage manager" and "File manager" as low-level physical management layers unrelated to logical transaction properties.
