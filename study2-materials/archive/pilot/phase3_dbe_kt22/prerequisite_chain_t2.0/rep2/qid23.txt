PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of the set difference operation (A - B vs. B - A).
2. Recognizing that the order of subtraction in set theory matters (non-commutativity) except in specific cases.
3. Recognizing that for A - B to equal B - A, both sets must result in the empty set (i.e., A must equal B).
4. Understanding that element order within set notation curly braces {} is irrelevant.
5. Ability to manually perform set difference for Option A (identifying unique elements {1} vs {4}).
6. Ability to manually perform set difference for Option B (identifying { } vs {4}).
7. Ability to compare contents of Option C across different positions to confirm equality.
8. Ability to compare contents of Option D to detect the missing element (6) which breaks equality.
9. Distinguishing between a "subset" relationship and an "identity" relationship.
