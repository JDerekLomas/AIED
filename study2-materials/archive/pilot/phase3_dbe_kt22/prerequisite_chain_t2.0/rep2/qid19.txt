PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Set Notation: Identifying that curly braces `{}` denote a set and parentheses `()` denote an ordered pair.
2. Definition of Cartesian Product: Knowing that the symbol `x` (cross product) refers to the set of all possible ordered pairs between the two sets, rather than scalar multiplication or set union.
3. Operands Identification: Noticing that the operation is `S x S` (self-join/product) and not `S x T`, despite set `T` being provided as a distractor.
4. Completeness/Combinatorics: Understanding that every element in the first set must be paired with every element in the second set (2 elements * 2 elements = 4 pairs).
5. Distinguishing Operations: Ability to distinguish the Cartesian product from a Set Union (A) or the original set (C).
