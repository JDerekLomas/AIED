PREREQUISITES: 
- Understanding the definition of 3NF (Third Normal Form) and its criteria regarding transitive dependencies.
- Distinguishing between "minimising" and "eliminating" redundancy in the context of database theory.
- Understanding the hierarchical relationship between normal forms (specifically that BCNF is stricter/stronger than 3NF).
- Understanding the definition of BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form).
- Identifying that "more restrictive" implies a smaller subset of valid relations, which applies to BCNF over 3NF, not vice versa.
- Evaluating a multiple-choice set where two options (B and C) are direct opposites, requiring a precise technical distinction rather than a general intuition.
- Recognising that 3NF allows certain types of redundancy to preserve functional dependencies (the "trade-off" concept).
