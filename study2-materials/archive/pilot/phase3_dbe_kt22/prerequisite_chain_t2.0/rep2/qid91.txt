PREREQUISITES: 
1. Visual Literacy: Ability to read and interpret a standard ER diagram (noting that the question implies a diagram is visible).
2. Knowledge of Entity Attributes: Identifying that underlined attributes signify a primary key (A).
3. Knowledge of Relationships: Understanding that while relationships imply connections, the specific "foreign key" syntax (B) is a physical schema concept, not a visual component of basic ER modeling.
4. Definition of Domain Constraints: Recognizing that "Domain constraints" (C) refer to data types or specific value ranges, which are typically omitted from standard ER visual notation.
5. Distinction between conceptual and physical models: Realizing that "primary keys" are explicitly marked in ER diagrams while "foreign keys" are represented by lines/diamonds rather than specific attribute constraints.
6. Evaluation Strategy: Processing the "Which" (implying potentially one or more) to select the most fundamentally visible constraint.
