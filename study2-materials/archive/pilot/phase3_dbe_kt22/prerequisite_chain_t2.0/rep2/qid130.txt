PREREQUISITES: 
1. Reading and interpreting relational notation (Relation R and set of Functional Dependencies Σ).
2. Understanding the definition of a decomposition (splitting attributes into R1 and R2).
3. Recalling the Lossless Join property criterion for a decomposition of two relations: $(R1 \cap R2) \to (R1 - R2)$ or $(R1 \cap R2) \to (R2 - R1)$.
4. Correctly identifying the intersection: $\{A, B\} \cap \{B, C\} = \{B\}$.
5. Evaluating if $B \to A$ or $B \to C$ holds based on $\Sigma$.
6. Logical deduction that $B \to C$ is explicitly in $\Sigma$, confirming the Lossless Join property.
7. Recalling the Dependency Preservation property definition (the union of dependencies local to each projection must imply all original dependencies).
8. Identifying dependencies for R1: $\{A \to B\}$ is preserved.
9. Identifying dependencies for R2: $\{B \to C\}$ is preserved.
10. Confirming the union $\{A \to B, B \to C\}$ equals the original set $\Sigma$.
11. Multi-step reasoning to combine the outcomes of both properties to select the correct multiple-choice option.
