PREREQUISITES: 
1. Set Difference Notation: Identifying that (T - S) represents the elements in T that are not in S.
2. Set Difference Calculation: Correcting calculating {1, 2, 3} - {1, 2} = {3}.
3. Cartesian Product Definition: Understanding that S x {3} involves pairing every element of S with the element(s) of the result set.
4. Ordered Pair Representation: Recognizing that the Cartesian product results in a set of coordinates/tuples, not a flattened set of numbers.
5. Identifying S correctly: Recalling that S is {1, 2} during the final multiplication step (and not accidentally using T).
6. Distinguishing set vs. tuple notation: Choosing option C {(1,3), (2,3)} over set-like lists or partial products.
