PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (the curly brace syntax representing a collection of elements).
2. Knowledge of the set difference operator symbol (-).
3. Defining set difference correctly (elements in the first set that are NOT in the second set).
4. Correct identification of the intersection between sets A and B ({4, 5}).
5. Distinguishing between set difference (A - B) and symmetric difference or union.
6. Execution of the subtraction (removing {4, 5} from {2, 3, 4, 5} while ignoring {6, 7} in set B).
7. Recognizing that sets C and D are irrelevant distractors.
