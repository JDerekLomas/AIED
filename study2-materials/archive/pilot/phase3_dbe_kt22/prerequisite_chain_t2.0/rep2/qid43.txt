PREREQUISITES: 
1. Vocabulary recognition: Identifying "Relational data model" as the structural context for the question.
2. Definition recall: Understanding the specific meaning of "referential integrity" (consistency between related tables).
3. Terminology differentiation: Distinguishing between the different types of keys (Super, Candidate, Primary, and Foreign).
4. Logical mapping: Associating the concept of "referential integrity" specifically with the "Foreign key" mechanism.
5. Functional understanding: Knowing that while Primary keys identify rows within a table, Foreign keys create the link *between* two tables as specified in the prompt.
