PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of Set Notation: Recognizing that {1,2} defines a set of discrete elements.
2. Understanding Cartesian Products (x): Knowing that A x A results in a set of ordered pairs, not a single value or a sum.
3. Calculating Ordered Pairs: Correctly identifying that A x A contains (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2).
4. Understanding Subset Definition (⊆): Knowing that X ⊆ Y means every single element in set X must be present in set Y.
5. Domain Logic: Recognizing that if every element in A is also in C (A ⊆ C), then any combination of elements from A must necessarily exist in the combinations of elements from C.
6. Filtering Irrelevant Information: Disregarding sets B and D which are decoys designed to distract the student.
7. Distinguishing Symbols: Ensuring the student doesn't confuse the Cartesian product (x) with a cross-join or intersection, or the subset symbol with an element-of symbol.
