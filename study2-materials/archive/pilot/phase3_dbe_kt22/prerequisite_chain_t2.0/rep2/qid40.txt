PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the formal definition of "Attributes" in the context of the Relational Model.
2. Distinguishing between a Relation Schema (the blueprint) and a Relation Instance (the data).
3. Correctly interpreting SQL-like or formal notation where column names are listed in parentheses after the relation name.
4. Distinguishing "Attributes" (columns/headers) from "Tuples" (rows/records).
5. Eliminating "Relations" as a choice by recognizing that the items listed are components of the schema, not the table itself.
6. Eliminating "Instances" by recognizing these are placeholders/metadata, not specific data values.
