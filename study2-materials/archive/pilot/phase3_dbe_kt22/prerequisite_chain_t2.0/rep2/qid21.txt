PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (defining sets S and T).
2. Knowledge of the Cartesian Product operator (x) and how to form ordered pairs.
3. Accurate computation of the set (S x T), resulting in 6 pairs.
4. Accurate computation of the set (S x S), resulting in 4 pairs.
5. Understanding the Set Difference operator (-) and the "left-only" rule.
6. Execution of the subtraction (removing matching pairs from the first set).
7. Recognizing that the order of elements in a pair matters.
