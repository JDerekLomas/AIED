PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (defining elements within curly braces).
2. Knowledge of the Cartesian Product operator (x) and how to form ordered pairs.
3. Ability to calculate the specific elements of A x B: {(1,a), (1,b), (2,a), (2,b)}.
4. Ability to calculate or conceptually grasp the elements of C x D.
5. Understanding the subset symbol (⊆) and the definition of a subset (every element in the first set must exist in the second).
6. Executing a point-by-point comparison (e.g., checking if (1,a) is in C x D by verifying 1 ∈ C and a ∈ D).
7. Recognizing that if the constituent sets are subsets (A ⊆ C and B ⊆ D), then their Cartesian product is also a subset.
8. Evaluating the truth value of a mathematical statement and mapping it to a True/False option.
