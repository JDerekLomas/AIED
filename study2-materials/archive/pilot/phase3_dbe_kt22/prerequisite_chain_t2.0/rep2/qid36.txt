PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of formal relational model terminology (mapping informal terms like "table," "row," and "column" to formal terms like "relation," "tuple," and "attribute").
2. Distinguishing between a mathematical "Relation" and the "Relational Data Model" naming convention.
3. Ability to differentiate "Relation" from "Relationship" (a common point of confusion for students introduced to ER modeling simultaneously).
4. Familiarity with specific distractors: knowing that a "Tuple" refers to a row, and a "Domain" refers to a set of permitted values for an attribute.
5. Vocabulary comprehension: identifying "Range" as an outlier term not typically used as a core definition for a structure in this context.
