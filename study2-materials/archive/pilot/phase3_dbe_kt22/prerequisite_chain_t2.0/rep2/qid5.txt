PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of the formal definition of a Cartesian product (the set of all ordered pairs (a, b)).
2. Understanding the mathematical definition of "equality" for sets (having identical elements).
3. Understanding that order matters within an ordered pair (the tuple (a, b) is not equal to (b, a) unless a = b).
4. Distinguishing between the cardinality of a join (which is commutative) and the specific set-theoretic definition of the product.
5. Recognizing the significance of the word "always" (the universal quantifier), which requires the statement to hold for all possible sets A and B, including non-empty and non-identical sets.
6. Ability to construct a simple counter-example (e.g., A={1}, B={2}) to test the property of commutativity.
