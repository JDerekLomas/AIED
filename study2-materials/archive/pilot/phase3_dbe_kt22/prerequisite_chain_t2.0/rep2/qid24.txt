PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Venn diagram symbology (two overlapping circles labeled A and B).
2. Knowledge of Set Theory notation/operators ($\cap$ for Intersection, $\cup$ for Union).
3. Mapping visual "shading" to logical inclusion (identifying that the central overlapping region represents elements common to both sets).
4. Distinguishing the visual representation of intersection from union (the entire shaded area vs. just the middle).
5. Mapping the visual representation to a specific multiple-choice variable.
