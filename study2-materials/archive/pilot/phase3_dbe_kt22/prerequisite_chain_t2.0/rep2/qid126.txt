PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Understanding Functional Dependencies (FDs):** Knowing how to interpret the notation $X \rightarrow Y$.
2. **Definition of a Candidate Key (CK):** Distinguishing between a Superkey (attributes that determine all others) and a Candidate Key (a *minimal* superkey).
3. **Closure Algorithm knowledge:** Ability to calculate the attribute closure $(A)^+$, $(B)^+$, and $(C)^+$ manually.
4. **Symmetry/Transitivity reasoning:** Recognizing that because the FDs form a cycle ($A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow A$), any single attribute can reach all others.
5. **Set Exhaustion:** Realizing that just because $A$ is a CK does not mean it is the *only* one; testing other attributes for the "minimal" property.
6. **Understanding the word "only":** Interpreting the logical quantifier in the statement correctly (existence vs. uniqueness).
