PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Understanding the Definition of a Cartesian Product ($A \times B$):** Knowing that the first element of each tuple belongs to set $A$ and the second belongs to set $B$.
2. **Set Element Extraction:** Ability to correctly identify the distinct elements of set $A$ from the given tuples ($\{2, 3, 4\}$).
3. **Set Element Extraction:** Ability to correctly identify the distinct elements of set $B$ from the given tuples ($\{5, 7\}$).
4. **Verifying Cardinality:** Confirming that $|A| \times |B| = 3 \times 2 = 6$, which matches the constraint given in the problem statement.
5. **Systematic Construction:** Being able to generate the complete set of ordered pairs by combining every element of $\{2, 3, 4\}$ with every element of $\{5, 7\}$.
6. **Distinguishing between $A \times B$ and $B \times A$:** Ensuring the order within the pairs is consistent with the derived sets (avoiding Option B, which mixes the order).
7. **Pattern Matching/Elimination:** Identifying Option C as the only set containing all original given elements plus the remaining three calculated pairs.
