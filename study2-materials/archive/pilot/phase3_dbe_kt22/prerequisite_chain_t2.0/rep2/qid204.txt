PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of the specific Two-Phase Locking (2PL) protocol definition (Growth vs. Shrinkage phase).
2. Understanding that the "Shrinkage phase" prohibits acquiring new locks once the first lock is released (Statement A).
3. Distinguishing between Basic 2PL and Strict/Rigorous 2PL (knowing that Statement B is characteristic of 2PL variations but Statement A is the core invariant of all 2PL).
4. Understanding concurrency control timing (knowing that Statement C describes "Pre-declaration" or "Static Locking," which is not a requirement of 2PL).
5. Reasoning about "All of the above" logic: identifying if one statement is false to eliminate Option D, or if multiple are true.
6. Reading comprehension: identifying that "Statement A" is the fundamental defining rule that gives the protocol its "Two-Phase" name.
