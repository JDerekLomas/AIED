PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Understanding Logical Entailment ($\Sigma2 \models \Sigma1$):** Knowing that for $\Sigma2$ to entail $\Sigma1$, every functional dependency in $\Sigma1$ must be logically derivable from the set of dependencies in $\Sigma2$.
2. **Identifying the failure condition:** Recognizing that if even one dependency in $\Sigma1$ cannot be derived from $\Sigma2$, the statement is false.
3. **Applying Armstrong's Axioms / Closure Algorithm:** Calculating the attribute closure of $A$ under $\Sigma2$ ($A^+_{\Sigma2}$).
4. **Distinguishing directionality:** Understanding that $\Sigma1 \models \Sigma2$ is true (via transitivity $A \to B \to C$), but the question asks for the reverse ($\Sigma2 \models \Sigma1$).
5. **Evaluating the specific missing dependency:** Observing that in $\Sigma2$, there is no path (direct or transitive) to determine $B$ from $A$ ($A \to B$ is missing), meaning $A^+_{\Sigma2} = \{A, C\}$.
6. **Abstract Notation Fluency:** Reading and interpreting the Greek symbol Sigma ($\Sigma$) and the entailment symbol ($\models$) in a formal logic context.
