PREREQUISITES: 
1. Vocabulary knowledge: Understanding the technical definition of "transaction" in a database context.
2. Conceptual distinction: Distinguishing between a change to *existing* data (Unrepeatable Read) vs. the addition of *new* data (Phantom Read).
3. Keyword association: Connecting the "insertion of new rows" specifically to the term "Phantom".
4. Negative exclusion: Knowing that "Dirty Read" refers to uncommitted data and "Lost Update" refers to concurrent writes, not subsequent reads.
5. Reading comprehension: Correctly identifying that the scenario involves a second read within the same transaction scope.
