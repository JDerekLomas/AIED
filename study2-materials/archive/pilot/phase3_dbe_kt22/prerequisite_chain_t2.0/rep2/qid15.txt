PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Set Notation: Identifying that curly braces {} denote a set and commas separate elements.
2. Knowledge of Set Union Operator (∪): Understanding that (A ∪ C) requires combining all unique elements from both sets.
3. Computational Accuracy (Union): Correctly deriving the set {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} by merging A and C.
4. Knowledge of Proper Subset Symbol (⊂): Distinguishing this from the standard subset symbol (⊆) and understanding it means "is a subset of and is not equal to."
5. Evaluating Subset Condition: Recognizing that for X ⊂ B to be true, every element in X must be in B.
6. Identifying Set Magnitude: Noticing that (A ∪ C) contains 8 elements while B contains only 3 elements, making the subset relationship mathematically impossible.
7. Boolean Selection: Mapping the conclusion (False) to the provided MCQ options.
