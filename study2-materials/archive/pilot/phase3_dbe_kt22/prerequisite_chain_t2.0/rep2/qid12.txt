PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Set Notation: Understanding that curly braces { } denote a set and elements are individual units.
2. Knowledge of Union Operator: Knowing that A ∪ B represents all elements that are in A OR in B.
3. Knowledge of Intersection Operator: Knowing that X ∩ C represents elements that are in BOTH X AND C.
4. Order of Operations: Understanding that the parentheses dictate that the Union operation must be performed before the Intersection.
5. Systematic Evaluation (A ∪ B): Correctly identifying the intermediate set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.
6. Systematic Evaluation (Intersection with C): Correctly filtering the intermediate set against {6, 7, 8, 9} to find commonalities.
7. Attention to Detail: Avoiding "distractor" errors, such as confusing ∪ with ∩ or misreading the members of the sets (e.g., stopping at {4, 5} from A ∩ B).
