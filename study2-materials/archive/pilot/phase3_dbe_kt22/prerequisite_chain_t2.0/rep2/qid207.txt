PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the ACID acronym and the specific meaning of each property (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
2. Distinguishing between the "Consistency" (C) of ACID and general "Integrity" constraints.
3. Identifying the functional role of a Transaction Manager versus a Lock Manager or Scheduler.
4. Knowing the mechanism of Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) and its role in recovery (ensuring partial transactions can be undone and committed ones kept).
5. Mapping "Logging" to the specific need to survive crashes (Durability).
6. Mapping "Logging" to the ability to rollback incomplete transactions (Atomicity).
7. Recognizing that Isolation is typically handled by concurrency control (locking/multiversioning) rather than logging alone.
