PREREQUISITES: 
1. Mathematical definition of set equality (elements must be identical).
2. Knowledge that set order is irrelevant ({1, 2, 3} is the same as {2, 1, 3}).
3. Understanding that cardinality must be equal for sets to be equal.
4. Distinguishing between a subset and an equal set (avoiding distractors like A or B).
5. Visual pattern matching/scanning for specific elements across two lists.
