PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (curly braces for sets).
2. Knowledge of the intersection ($\cap$) operator (elements common to both sets).
3. Recognizing that if $A \cap B = \{2, 3\}$, then elements $\{2, 3\}$ must fundamentally exist within set $B$.
4. Logical deduction that the cardinality (size) of $B$ must be at least equal to the number of elements in the intersection.
5. Counting the elements in the intersection set (size = 2).
6. Evaluating the multiple-choice options against the constraint $|B| \ge 2$.
7. Identifying "1" as the only value that violates this constraint.
8. Attentiveness to the negative phrasing ("cannot be") in the question stem.
