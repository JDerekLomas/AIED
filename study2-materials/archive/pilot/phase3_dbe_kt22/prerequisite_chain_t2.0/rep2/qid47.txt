PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the formal definition of a "superkey" (a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple).
2. Knowledge of the property of monotonicity/closure in relational algebra: if a set $S$ is a superkey, any superset of $S$ is also a superkey.
3. Reading and interpreting schema notation $R(a,b,c)$ to identify the universal set of attributes.
4. Distinguishing between a "candidate key" (which must be minimal) and a "superkey" (which does not have to be minimal).
5. Applying set theory logic to realize that $\{a,b,c\}$ is a superset of $\{a,b\}$.
6. Logical deduction: recognizing that "must be" implies a functional necessity derived from the definition.
