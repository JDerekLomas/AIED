PREREQUISITES:
1. Identifying the "Universe" of attributes (U = {A, B, C, D}).
2. Understanding the definition of a Candidate Key (CK) as a minimal superkey.
3. Ability to compute the closure of an attribute set ($X^+$) using Armstrong's Axioms/Closure algorithm.
4. Recognizing the "Heuristic Rule" for attributes: Identifying that if an attribute (C) appears only on the left-hand side of dependencies (or not at all on the right-hand side), it **must** be part of every candidate key.
5. Identifying that 'C' does not appear on the RHS of any functional dependency in $\Sigma$.
6. Distinguishing between a primary key and a candidate key.
7. Multi-step reasoning: Realizing that if C is not in a set, its closure can never include C, and thus can never be a key.
