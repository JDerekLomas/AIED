PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Mathematical Set Notation**: Recognizing that curly braces {} denote a set and parentheses () denote an ordered pair.
2. **Definition of Cartesian Product**: Knowing that $A \times B$ consists of all possible ordered pairs where the first element is from set A and the second is from set B.
3. **Ordering of Pairs**: Distinguishing between $(1, a)$ and $(a, 1)$ to ensure set A elements are consistently in the first position (eliminating D).
4. **Exhaustive Mapping (Completeness)**: Understanding that every element of A must be paired with every element of B (2 x 2 = 4 pairs).
5. **Pattern Matching/Attention to Detail**: Identifying that Option A contains a typo/distractor $(b, b)$ while Option C contains the four correct unique pairings.
