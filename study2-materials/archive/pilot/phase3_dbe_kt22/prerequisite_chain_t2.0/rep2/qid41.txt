PREREQUISITES: 
1. Vocabulary knowledge: Understanding the formal relational model term "tuple" as a synonym for a row/record.
2. Vocabulary knowledge: Understanding the formal relational model term "attribute" as a synonym for a column/field.
3. Conceptual definition: Recalling the mathematical definition of a relation as a *set* (where order is inherently irrelevant).
4. Distinguishing theory from practice: Recognizing that while SQL queries may return data in a specific order (and schemas are written left-to-right), the underlying relational model dictates that order is logically unimportant for both dimensions.
5. Identifying the correct pair: Matching the "Not important; Not important" logical conclusion to the correct multiple-choice option without misreading the sequence.
