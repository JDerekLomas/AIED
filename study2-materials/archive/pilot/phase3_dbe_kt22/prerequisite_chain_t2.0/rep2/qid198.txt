PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Defining Authentication Factors:** Distinguishing between the three primary categories of authentication: knowledge (what you know), possession (what you have), and inherence (what you are).
2. **Identifying a Password:** Recognizing that a password is "something you know."
3. **Identifying an SMS/Mobile Phone:** Recognizing that a physical mobile device or a dynamic token received via that device constitutes "something you have."
4. **Conceptualizing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA):** Understanding that the presence of two *different* categories of authentication in a sequence constitutes two-factor authentication.
5. **Evaluating Completeness (Distractor Analysis):** Realizing that while Option A and Option B describe parts of the process, they are individually incomplete as a description of the *entire* example, making Option D the most comprehensive and correct term.
6. **English Reading Comprehension:** Interpreting the phrase "which of the following terms describes this example" as a request for the overarching classification.
