PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Terminology definition**: Knowing the technical distinction between *authentication* (identity verification) and *authorization/access control* (permissions/restrictions).
2. **Precision in language**: Recognizing that options A, B, and C describe various levels of "restricting access," which is the definition of authorization, not authentication.
3. **Keyword identification**: Spotting the word "method" as a distractor and focusing on the outcome described (restriction vs. identification).
4. **Exclusion reasoning**: Identifying that if A, B, and C are logically similar forms of "restricting access," they are likely all incorrect if the goal is defining authentication.
5. **Overcoming the "All of the Above" bias**: Resisting the common test-taking instinct to select "All of the above" when multiple options seem plausible or related to the general theme of security.
6. **Understanding the Database Security Stack**: Distinguishing between system-level entry (login) and internal data-level privileges.
