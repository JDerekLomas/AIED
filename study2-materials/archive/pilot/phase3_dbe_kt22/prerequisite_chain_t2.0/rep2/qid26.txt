PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of the visual representation: Identifying the diagram as a Venn diagram.
2. Understanding of Set Union ($\cup$): Knowing that A $\cup$ B covers both circles entirely.
3. Understanding of Set Intersection ($\cap$): Knowing that A $\cap$ B is the central overlapping area.
4. Understanding of Set Difference ($-$): Knowing that subtracting a set removes those specific elements from the original area.
5. Visual processing of the shaded area: Correctly perceiving that only the outer crescents are shaded while the middle is white.
6. Symbolic mapping: Matching the visual "hollowed-out union" to the compound expression (A $\cup$ B) – (A $\cap$ B).
7. Elimination strategy: Distinguishing that options A, C, and D describe significantly different visual regions.
