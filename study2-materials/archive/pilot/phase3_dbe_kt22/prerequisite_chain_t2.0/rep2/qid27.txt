PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Interpretation of Euler/Venn Diagrams**: Ability to map physical shaded regions in a three-set diagram to logical set operations.
2. **Knowledge of Set Union ($\cup$)**: Understanding that $A \cup C$ represents the total combined area of sets A and C.
3. **Knowledge of Set Intersection ($\cap$)**: Identifying overlapping regions between sets.
4. **Knowledge of Set Difference ($-$)**: Understanding that subtracting a set removes any portion of that set from the existing selection.
5. **Operator Precedence and Order of Operations**: Processing the expressions from left to right or evaluating parentheses first.
6. **Elimination of "Distractor" Complexity**: Recognizing that Option D, while looking sophisticated and using intersections, simplifies to the same area as Option A.
7. **Visual Matching**: Confirming that the region $(A \cup C)$ is correct, but specifically excludes any part belonging to $B$.
