PREREQUISITES:
1. Identifying `StudentID` as the Foreign Key in the `Enrol` table based on the `FOREIGN KEY ... REFERENCES` syntax.
2. Identifying `Student` as the Parent (referenced) table and `Enrol` as the Child (referencing) table.
3. Recalling the definition of Referential Integrity (that a value in the child table must exist in the parent table).
4. Distinguishing between the primary key constraint (which relates to Option C) and the referential integrity constraint (which relates to Option A).
5. Interpreting the directionality of the relationship (A vs B): recognizing that the "many" side (Enrol) depends on the "one" side (Student), not vice versa.
6. Reading and parsing SQL DDL syntax across two separate `CREATE TABLE` statements.
7. Filtering out the "Not Null" property which, while often true for Primary Keys, is not the definition of referential integrity (Option D).
