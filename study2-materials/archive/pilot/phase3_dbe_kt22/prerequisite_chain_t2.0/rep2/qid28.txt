PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Mathematical Notation Recognition**: Recognizing $|X|$ as the notation for cardinality (size of a set).
2. **Set Theory Terminology**: Understanding that "elements" refers to the distinct items within a set.
3. **Cartesian Product Definition**: Knowing that $A \times B$ denotes the Cartesian product, not set union or a different operation.
4. **Cardinality Rule for Products**: Applying the rule that $|A \times B| = |A| \times |B|$.
5. **Basic Arithmetic**: Performing the multiplication ($3 \times 2 = 6$).
6. **Distinguishing Operations**: Not confusing the product ($A \times B$) with the sum of elements ($3 + 2 = 5$) or more complex operations (like the size of a Power Set).
