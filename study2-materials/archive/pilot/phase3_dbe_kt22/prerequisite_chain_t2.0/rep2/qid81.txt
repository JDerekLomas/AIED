To accurately answer this question, a student must correctly process multiple conceptual and technical layers. 

**PREREQUISITES:**
1. **Schema Interpretation:** Ability to read and map the relationship between two tables (Course and Enrol) based on the `CourseNo` key.
2. **Knowledge of Left Outer Join:** Understanding that `LEFT JOIN` retains all rows from the left table (`Course`), even if no match exists in the right table (`Enrol`).
3. **Knowledge of Inner Join Mechanics:** Correcting for the rows that *do* match (preserving those records) while adding the non-matching ones.
4. **Data Scanning/Counting:** Physically counting the records in the provided tables (not provided here, but implied as necessary for a specific numerical answer) without error.
5. **Handling Nulls:** Recognizing that "orphaned" rows in the left table result in a row with NULLs, rather than being excluded from the result count.
6. **Cartesian Product Awareness:** Understanding that if one `CourseNo` has multiple entries in `Enrol`, it results in multiple rows in the output (one-to-many logic).
7. **SQL Syntax Fluency:** Recognizing the `SELECT *` and `FROM...JOIN...ON` structure as a standard query format.

**COUNT: 7**

In a South African undergraduate context, the gap between students who "sort of know SQL" and those who understand the specific mechanics of Outer Joins is often where the class splits. Many students mistakenly treat all joins as Inner Joins or struggle with the "duplicate" rows generated by one-to-many relationships.
