PREREQUISITES: 
- Definition of a transaction (ACID properties)
- Understanding the specific meaning of "correctness criterion" in the context of concurrency control
- Distinguishing between the *goal* of isolation (Serializability) and the *properties* of a single transaction (Consistency/Atomicity)
- Identifying the difference between "correctness" as an internal state vs. "correctness" as a scheduling outcome
- Knowledge of the Serializability Theorem
- Recognizing "All of the above" as a common distractor in ACID-related questions (navigating the ambiguity between ACID being a general "correctness" framework and Serializability being the technical "criterion" for schedules)
