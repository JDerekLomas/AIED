PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of the set notation symbols (curly braces and commas) and member identification.
2. Definition of the Cartesian Product operator (x) as a set of ordered pairs.
3. Ability to calculate the result of B x B (yielding a set of tuples: {(a,a), (a,b), (b,a), (b,b)}).
4. Definition of the Subset operator (⊆), specifically that every element of the first set must be an element of the second set.
5. Distinction between an atomic element (e.g., 'a') and an ordered pair (e.g., (a,a)).
6. Evaluating the truth value: recognizing that the elements of B (single letters) are not present in the set B x B (pairs), even though they appear as components within the pairs.
7. Filtering out the "distractor" sets A, C, and D which are irrelevant to the specific expression but might cause cognitive load or confusion.
