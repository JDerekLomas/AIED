PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (defining elements within braces).
2. Understanding the Cartesian Product operator (x) and how to form sets of ordered pairs.
3. Knowledge of the Subset operator (⊆) and the condition required for one set to be a subset of another.
4. Correctly identifying that the values in set B and set D are irrelevant "distractors" for this specific problem.
5. Performing the expansion of A x A (4 elements).
6. Performing the expansion of A x C (6 elements).
7. Verifying containment (checking if every (x,y) where x ∈ A and y ∈ A is also in the set where x ∈ A and y ∈ C).
8. Logic application: Realizing that because A ⊆ C, it follows mathematically that A x A ⊆ A x C without necessarily listing all elements.
9. Distinguishing between a "True/False" Boolean result and the sets themselves.
