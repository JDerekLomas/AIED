PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of a Minimal Cover (Standard form, no redundant FDs, no extraneous attributes).
2. Concept of Logical Equivalence between sets of Functional Dependencies (FDs).
3. Ability to compute attribute closures (specifically $A^+$ and $B^+$) under $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$.
4. Identification of redundancy: recognizing that in $\Sigma_1$, $AB \to C$ reduces to $A \to C$ because $A \to B$ exists (extraneous attribute $B$).
5. Distinguishing between "equivalent to" and "is a minimal cover of" (A set cannot be a minimal cover of a *different* set unless they are logically equivalent).
6. Multi-step reasoning: checking if $A \to C$ is derived from $\Sigma_1$ and if $B \to C$ is derived from $\Sigma_1$ (it is not), leading to the realization that $\Sigma_1 \not\equiv \Sigma_2$.
