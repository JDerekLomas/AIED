PREREQUISITES: 
- Identifying and distinguishing between set theory operators (Difference vs. Intersection).
- Knowledge of the Relative Difference operation: understanding that (A - D) means elements in A that are not in D.
- Knowledge of the Intersection operation: understanding that (X ∩ Y) means elements present in both sets.
- Order of operations: correctly prioritizing the operations inside the parentheses before performing the intersection.
- Sequential data matching: accurately comparing small integer elements across four distinct sets without making a clerical/transcription error.
- Set-to-Multiple-Choice mapping: evaluating the resulting set {4, 5} against the provided distractors.
