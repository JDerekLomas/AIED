PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the formal definition of Third Normal Form (3NF).
2. Recalling the formal definition of Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF).
3. Understanding the hierarchical/nested relationship between normal forms (the "containment" property).
4. Interpreting logical "If-Then" implication statements in a multiple-choice format.
5. Distinguishing between "must be" (necessity) and "cannot be" (exclusivity) in a technical context.
6. Identifying that BCNF is a stricter refinement of 3NF (every BCNF violation is a 3NF violation, but not vice-versa).
