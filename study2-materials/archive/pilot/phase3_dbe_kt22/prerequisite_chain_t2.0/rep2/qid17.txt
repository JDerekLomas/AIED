PREREQUISITES:
1. Identifying set membership: Recognizing which specific elements are contained within the given sets A, B, and C.
2. Understanding the Intersection ($\cap$) operator: Knowing that $A \cap C$ refers to the set of elements common to both A and C.
3. Calculating the intersection: Correctlly deriving $\{3, 5, 7, 9\}$ from A and C.
4. Understanding the Subset ($\subseteq$ or implied by context) / Proper Subset ($\subset$) notation: Distinguishing between a subset and an element.
5. Understanding the Not-a-Subset ($\not\subset$ or $\not\subseteq$) notation: Knowing the slash through the symbol denotes the negation of the relationship.
6. Logical Evaluation of "B is NOT a subset of (A $\cap$ C)": Correctlly assessing that since $B = \{3, 5, 7\}$ and $(A \cap C) = \{3, 5, 7, 9\}$, B is indeed a subset, making the statement "B is NOT a subset" False.
7. Distinguishing between Truth Values: Ensuring that a logical "No" to the statement translates to selecting "B. False."
