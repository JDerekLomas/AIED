PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of the SQL Data Control Language (DCL) and the specific syntax/purpose of the `GRANT` command.
2. Understanding the "Granularity of Access Control" in relational databases (what level of objects can be secured).
3. Distinguishing between schema-level/metadata objects (Relations, Attributes) and instance-level data (Tuples).
4. Recognizing that standard SQL `GRANT` applies to named persistent objects (tables, views, columns) rather than specific rows/tuples (which are typically handled via row-level security policies or views, not `GRANT` statements).
5. Interpreting the negative phrasing of the question ("which... cannot").
6. Understanding "None of the above" in the context of a "cannot" question (logical negation).
