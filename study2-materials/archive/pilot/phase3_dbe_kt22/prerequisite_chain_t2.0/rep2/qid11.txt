PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Set Notation: Understanding that braces { } denote a collection of unique elements and commas are delimiters.
2. Definition of Union (∪) Operator: Knowing that the union of sets includes all elements present in either set, without duplicating identical elements.
3. Order of Operations / Associativity: Recognizing that the parentheses (A ∪ B) imply an intermediate step, or knowing that the union operation is associative.
4. Set Membership Verification (Step 1): Correctly identifying the combined elements of A and B ({2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}).
5. Set Membership Verification (Step 2): Correctly adding the elements of C ({6, 7, 8, 9}) to the intermediate result, while handling duplicates (6 and 7).
6. Precision in Scanning/Matching: Meticulously comparing the derived set against the four options provided, ensuring no numbers (like '3') are skipped.
7. Distinguishing Sets: Correctly ignoring set D, which is extraneous information (a common distractor in database/logic problems).
