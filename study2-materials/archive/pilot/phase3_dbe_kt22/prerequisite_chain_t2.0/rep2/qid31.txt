PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of Set Theory notation (interpreting curly braces `{}` as a set).
2. Definition of a Subset (recognizing that $X \subseteq Y$ requires every element of $X$ to be an element of $Y$).
3. Definition of a Cartesian Product ($A \times B$ yields a set of ordered pairs).
4. Distinguishing between Set Elements and Ordered Pairs (realizing that a scalar/integer like $1$ is fundamentally different from a tuple like $(1, a)$).
5. Avoiding the "Lexical Trap" (ignoring the visual similarity where set $A$ appears on both sides of the operator and assuming the relationship must be true).
6. Basic Type Checking (applying the rule that a set of individuals cannot be a subset of a set of pairs unless those individuals are themselves those specific pairs).
