PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Differentiating Entities and Attributes**: Understanding the fundamental conceptual difference between an "Object" (Entity) and a "Property" (Attribute).
2. **Knowledge of SQL/Relational Keys**: Identifying "Unique ID" as a common property used to describe an entity rather than being an entity itself.
3. **Filtering Distractors (Noun vs. Attribute)**: Recognizing that "Associate member", "Fitness class", and "Fitness centre" are all nouns representing complex objects with their own properties (multivalued or composite) described in the text.
4. **Relational Contextualization**: Mapping the specific text "unique IDs of employees" to a specific field within the Employee entity.
5. **Managing Narrative Complexity**: Sifting through a long, detail-heavy scenario (maintenance dates, time slots, specialities) to focus on the specific question asked at the very end.
6. **English Language Proficiency**: Accurately parsing the technical English used to describe relationships (e.g., "identified by," "records the name of").
