PREREQUISITES: 
- Knowing the relational model definition of a 'tuple' as a row in a table.
- Knowing the relational model definition of an 'attribute' as a column/field.
- Understanding the concept of 'unique identification' within a database context.
- Recalling the formal definition of a 'Superkey'.
- Distinguishing 'Superkey' from a 'Foreign key' (which links tables but does not necessarily uniquely identify tuples in its own table).
- Distinguishing 'Superkey' from 'Domain' (which refers to the set of allowable values for an attribute).
- Recognizing 'Subkey' as a plausible-sounding distractor that is not a standard relational term in this context.
