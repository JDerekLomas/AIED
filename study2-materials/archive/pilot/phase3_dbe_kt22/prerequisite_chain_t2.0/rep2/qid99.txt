PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Reading Comprehension (Information Filtering)**: The ability to parse a long narrative text and extract only the relevant entities ("employee", "trainers", "administrators", "technicians") while ignoring irrelevant details (equipment, maintenance dates, time slots).
2. **Knowledge of ER Modeling Hierarchy (Is-A relationship)**: Identifying that trainers, administrators, and technicians are specific types/categories of the general category "employee".
3. **Conceptualizing Superclasses/Subclasses**: Recognizing the formal database design terms for "General" vs. "Specialized" entity types.
4. **Distinguishing Entities from Attributes**: Understanding that a trainer is a person (entity) with their own properties, not just a property (attribute) of an employee.
5. **Vocabulary Association (Terminology Mapping)**: Matching the identified conceptual hierarchy to option C (Superclass/Subclass) rather than the "Domain" or "Relationship" terminology.
6. **Understanding Mutual Exclusivity/Categorization**: Processing the phrase "classified into three categories" as a structural specialization rather than a simple data entry field.
