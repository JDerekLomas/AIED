PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the definition of the set Union operator ($\cup$).
2. Executing the set Union operation correctly ($A \cup B$) to produce $\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$.
3. Recalling the definition of the Proper Subset symbol ($\subset$).
4. Distinguishing between a Subset ($\subseteq$) and a Proper Subset ($\subset$) (identifying if $B$ is strictly "smaller" than the resulting set).
5. Performing the membership check (verifying if every element of $\{3,5,7\}$ is in $\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$).
6. Multi-step reasoning: combining the result of the parenthesis with the comparison operator.
