PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the formal mathematical definition of a "set" (specifically the properties of being unordered and containing unique/distinct elements).
2. Distinguishing a "set" from a "tuple" (which allows duplicates and is ordered).
3. Distinguishing a "set" from a "relation" (which is a specific application/subset of set theory in databases, rather than the general definition of the collection itself).
4. Familiarity with standard terminology used in the first chapter of a Database Systems textbook (Relational Model fundamentals).
5. Reading comprehension of the specific constraint "distinct elements."
