PREREQUISITES: 
- Identifying the SQL `SELECT` clause as the mechanism for projection.
- Distinguishing between DQL (Data Query Language) and DML/DDL (Update, Delete, Create).
- Understanding the terminology "attributes" as synonyms for table columns.
- Recognizing the mapping of the "projection" operation in relational algebra to the `SELECT` keyword in SQL.
- Avoiding the common novice confusion between the `SELECT` clause (columns) and the `FROM` clause (tables) or `WHERE` clause (filtering).
