PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of a Superkey: Understanding that a superkey is a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a row (tuple).
2. Vocabulary Mastery (Attribute vs. Tuple): Distinguishing that attributes are columns and tuples are rows to avoid confusion with option B.
3. Logical Subsets (Superkey vs. Candidate Key): Understanding the hierarchical relationship—that all candidate keys are superkeys, but not all superkeys are minimal (candidate) keys—to eliminate option C.
4. Entity vs. Relational scope: Identifying that keys function within a relation to distinguish records, rather than distinguishing between entire table schemas, to eliminate option D.
5. Identifying precise terminology: Recognizing that "uniquely identify a tuple" is the technical standard for the definition.
