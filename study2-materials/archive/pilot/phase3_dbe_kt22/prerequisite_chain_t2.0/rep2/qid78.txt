PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the syntax of a multi-table FROM clause (the comma notation).
2. Recognizing that a JOIN without an explicit ON or WHERE clause results in a Cartesian Product (Cross Join).
3. Ability to retrieve or count the number of rows in the 'Course' table from a provided schema/data set (mental or visual).
4. Ability to retrieve or count the number of rows in the 'Enrol' table from a provided schema/data set (mental or visual).
5. Knowing the mathematical rule for the cardinality of a Cartesian Product (Rows in A × Rows in B).
6. Basic arithmetic (multiplication of the two row counts).
7. Distinguishing the query result count from the sum of the rows (a common mistake for beginners).
8. Distinguishing the query result count from the count of the larger table (another common misconception).

COUNT: 8

0.65
