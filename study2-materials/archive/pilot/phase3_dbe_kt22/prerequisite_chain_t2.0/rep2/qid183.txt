PREREQUISITES:
1. Identifying the "Negative Logic" (The question asks which is NOT correct).
2. Knowledge of the mechanism of SQL injection (String concatenation/lack of sanitization).
3. Understanding of the impact/scope of SQL injection (Privilege escalation/command execution).
4. Distinguishing between risk mitigation and prevention (Privilege reduction follows the principle of least privilege, which limits damage but does not prevent the injection vulnerability itself).
5. Evaluation of "None of the above" as a potential distractor vs. valid choice.
6. Multi-step reasoning: recognizing that Statement C describes a good security practice (Least Privilege) but identifying it as a false statement regarding *prevention*.
