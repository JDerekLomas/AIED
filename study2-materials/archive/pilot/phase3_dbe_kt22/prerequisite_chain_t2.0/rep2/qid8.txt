PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of the Cartesian Product (A × B): Knowing that it represents the set of all possible ordered pairs where the first element is from A and the second is from B.
2. Understanding Set Notation: Recognizing curly braces `{}` and the representation of elements within a set.
3. Distinguishing Order in Tuples: Understanding that in the pair `(first, second)`, the position determines which set the element belongs to.
4. Set Uniqueness: Identifying that repeating elements (like 'p' or 'x') in the pairs doesn't mean they are repeated in the set definition.
5. Systematic Extraction: Correcting mapping the set of first coordinates {p, q} to set A and the set of second coordinates {x, y} to set B.
6. Avoiding Position Inversion: Distinguishing between A × B and B × A to ensure the sets aren't swapped (Option A vs Option D).
