To provide an accurate estimate, I am assuming a standard relational table `Study` where the `units` column contains several numerical values, at least one `NULL` value, and a minimum value of 4. A typical pedagogical example for this specific question usually involves a dataset like: `{6, 4, NULL, 8}`.

**PREREQUISITES:**
1.  **Reading a Schema/Instance:** Ability to identify the "units" column within a table and extract the relevant data points.
2.  **Understanding `COUNT(column)` vs `COUNT(*)`:** Knowing that `COUNT(column_name)` ignores `NULL` values, whereas students often mistakenly count all rows.
3.  **Aggregate Function Application:** Correctly identifying the smallest non-null numerical value for `MIN()`.
4.  **Result Ordering:** Mapping the first result to the first column in the `SELECT` clause and the second to the second (avoiding C vs B swap).
5.  **Distinguishing Nulls from Zeros:** Understanding that `NULL` is not 0 and should not be considered the minimum or part of the count.

**COUNT:** 5

0.65
