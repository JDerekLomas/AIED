PREREQUISITES: 
- Knowing that "Relation" is the formal relational model term for a "Table" in SQL.
- Recalling the specific SQL DDL keyword syntax (`CREATE`).
- Distinguishing between standard SQL/PostgreSQL syntax and pseudocode/natural language (eliminating "New").
- Identifying the correct object type keyword in PostgreSQL (it uses `TABLE` rather than `RELATION` in its command structure).
- Recognizing the requirement for parentheses to define columns, even if represented abstractly.
