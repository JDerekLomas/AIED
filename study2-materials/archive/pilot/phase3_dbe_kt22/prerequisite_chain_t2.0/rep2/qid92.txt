3. Recalling the visual mapping for a weak entity (the "double" convention).
4. Distinguishing between the symbol for an entity (rectangle) and the symbol for a relationship (diamond).
5. Interpreting English terminology in a technical context (the term "double rectangle" as a literal descriptor of the graphic).
