PREREQUISITES: 
1. Reading and interpreting a database schema diagram or table instance (identifying the "Study" table).
2. Understanding the function of the `SELECT` clause (specifying columns, not rows).
3. Understanding the function of the `FROM` clause (identifying the source table).
4. Recognizing that a basic `SELECT...FROM` statement without a `WHERE` clause returns all rows in the table.
5. Proficiency in "visual parsing"—scanning the provided table instance and accurately counting the total number of records/rows without skipping or double-counting.
6. Distinguishing between the count of columns (attributes) and the count of rows (tuples).
