PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of the specific security model: Recalling that Bell-LaPadula (BLP) focuses on Confidentiality/Secrecy (protecting "levels" of sensitivity).
2. Knowledge of the Simple Security Property (No Read Up): Remembering that subjects cannot read objects at a higher security clearance.
3. Terminology mapping: Recognizing that "retrieving information" is synonymous with "Read" operations in security definitions.
4. Distinguishing directionality: Differentiating between "up" and "down" movements in a hierarchical security lattice.
5. Vocabulary precision: Avoiding confusion with the Biba model (Integrity), which uses inverted rules (No Read Down/No Write Up).
6. Handling distractors: Correcting the "Write down/Write up" options by identifying that the question specifically asks about retrieval (Reading).
