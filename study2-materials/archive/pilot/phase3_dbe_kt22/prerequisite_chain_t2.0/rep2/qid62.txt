PREREQUISITES: 
- Knowing the basic definition of the Relational Algebra "Join" operation.
- Distinguishing "Join" from "Union" (Union stacks compatible rows; Join merges attributes of matching rows).
- Distinguishing "Join" from "Select" (Select acts on a single relation; Join requires two).
- Understanding the term "tuple" as a synonym for a row/record.
- Interpreting the phrase "merging pairs of matching tuples" as a horizontal concatenation based on a condition rather than a vertical set operation.
