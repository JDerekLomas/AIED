PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of Set Theory notation: Understanding that $|X|$ denotes the cardinality (size) of a set.
2. Symbol recognition (Intersection): Distinguishing the symbol $\cap$ as "AND" (overlap) rather than "OR".
3. Symbol recognition (Union): Distinguishing the symbol $\cup$ as "OR" (combination) rather than "AND".
4. Application of the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle: Recalling or deriving the formula $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$.
5. Arithmetical execution: Performing the specific subtraction and addition correctly $(10 + 5 - 2)$ without a "double-counting" error or a "forgetting to subtract" error.
6. Reading comprehension: Correctly mapping the provided values (10, 5, 2) to their respective variables in the formula.
