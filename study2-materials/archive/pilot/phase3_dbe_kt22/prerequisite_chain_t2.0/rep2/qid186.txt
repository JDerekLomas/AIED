PREREQUISITES: 
- Defining Discretionary Access Control (DAC) correctly versus Mandatory Access Control (MAC).
- Understanding the specific definition of "ownership" in a database security context.
- Distinguishing between the capabilities of a standard Object Owner and the Database Administrator (DBA).
- Recognizing that in DAC, "discretion" belongs to the owner, not exclusively a central authority.
- Eliminating the distractor that every object must be under DBA control (B and C).
- Interpreting the technical meaning of "full control" as including the power to grant/revoke privileges.
- Understanding that "no owner" is generally a non-state in DAC models (all objects are created by an identity).
