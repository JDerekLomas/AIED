PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (the curly brace syntax).
2. Knowing the definition of the set difference operation ($A - B$ means elements in $A$ not in $B$).
3. Recognizing that $A - B$ is generally non-commutative (order matters).
4. Identifying the specific mathematical condition where $A - B = B - A$ (only when $A = B$).
5. Understanding set equality (that order of elements within the braces does not matter, e.g., $\{1,2,3\} = \{2,3,1\}$).
6. Executing the mental calculation/subtraction for each option to test the equality.
7. Avoiding the common misconception that "intersection" or "symmetric difference" logic applies here.
8. Handling distractors (like option B, where $A$ is a subset of $B$ but not equal).
