PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the formal definition of 3NF (every non-prime attribute is non-transitively dependent on the key).
2. Understanding the formal definition of BCNF (every determinant must be a candidate key).
3. Recognizing the subset relationship between normal forms (specifically that BCNF is "stronger" or "more restrictive" than 3NF).
4. Distinguishing between "minimizing" and "eliminating" redundancy (and knowing that functional-dependency-based redundancy is fully addressed by BCNF, while other forms like multi-valued dependencies are not).
5. Interpreting technical phrasing such as "less restrictive" in a logical/mathematical context.
6. Identifying that while BCNF targets redundancy from FDs, it doesn't "eliminate" all theoretical redundancy (as 4NF or 5NF exist), making the comparison between options B and C a subtle nuance.
