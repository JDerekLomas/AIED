PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowing the definition of the Cartesian product ($B \times B$ yields a set of ordered pairs).
2. Knowing the definition of the subset symbol ($\subseteq$).
3. Recognizing set membership types (identifying that $B$ contains atomic elements $\{a, b\}$, while $B \times B$ contains pairs $\{(a,a), (a,b), ...\}$).
4. Distinguishing between a set and its power set (understanding that a set is not typically a subset of its own Cartesian product unless the elements themselves are the resulting pairs).
5. Disregarding the distractor sets $A, C,$ and $D$ which are irrelevant to the core expression.
6. Logic application (realizing that $a \in B$ but $a \notin B \times B$ because an element is not an ordered pair).
