PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the basic terminology of the Relational Model (recognizing that "relation" means table and "tuple" means row).
2. Knowledge of the specific function of the JOIN operator (combining columns from different tables based on a relationship).
3. Distinguishing "Join" from "Union" (Union combines rows vertically from similar schemas, whereas the prompt describes horizontal merging of matching pairs).
4. Distinguishing "Join" from "Select" (Select filters rows based on a predicate rather than combining relations).
5. Interpreting the phrase "matching tuples" as a reference to a join condition (e.g., primary key to foreign key mapping).
