PREREQUISITES: 
- Knowing the mathematical definition of a "Set".
- Understanding the term "distinct" in a formal logic/mathematical context.
- Distinguishing between a "Set" and a "Relation" (as a relation is defined as a subset of a Cartesian product, but a set is the fundamental primitive).
- Distinguishing between a "Set" and a "Tuple" (where order matters and elements need not be distinct).
- English language proficiency to parse a formal definition.
