1. Recalling the context of the Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model (Confidentiality).
2. Understanding the specific terminology of "Subject" vs "Object" in a security context.
3. Defining the "Simple Security Property" (No Read Up).
4. Defining the "*-Property" (No Write Down).
5. Distinguishing between the formal rule names (Simple/Star) and the colloquial descriptive names used in the options (Read up/down, Write up/down).
6. Correctly mapping "retrieving information" to the "Read" operation.
7. Identifying that "preventing access to higher levels" implies a restriction on "Reading Up".
8. Distinguishing between the "Simple Security Property" and its converse (the Biba Integrity model), as students often swap the two models in their minds during exams.
