To provide an accurate estimate, I am assuming the `Study` table contains a standard set of records typically found in such a problem (e.g., 4 rows, one null value, and values like 6, 4, 10). Based on the options provided:

PREREQUISITES:
1.  **Reading a Schema/Table:** Correct Identifying which column (`units`) to scan in the `Study` table.
2.  **SQL COUNT Behavior:** Understanding that `COUNT(column_name)` counts non-null entries, whereas `COUNT(*)` counts all rows.
3.  **SQL MIN Behavior:** Understanding how the `MIN` aggregate function identifies the lowest numeric value in a set.
4.  **Handling NULLs:** Realizing that aggregate functions (except `COUNT(*)`) generally ignore `NULL` values.
5.  **Output Ordering:** Mapping the results of the two functions (`COUNT` then `MIN`) to the order presented in the options (Result 1, Result 2).
6.  **Syntactic Interpretation:** Recognizing that the result is a single row of output because no `GROUP BY` clause is present.

COUNT: 6

0.65
