PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Set Notation: Understanding that curly braces { } denote a collection of unique elements.
2. Definition of Union operator (∪): Knowing that the union of two sets includes all elements that are in either set, without duplicating shared elements.
3. Order of Operations / Associativity: Understanding that parentheses group the first operation, but also realizing that nested unions are associative and can be treated as one combined operation.
4. Precision in Element Comparison: Methodically tracking and comparing numbers from the input sets (A, B, and C) to the provided options.
5. Identifying Extraneous Data: Realizing that set D is irrelevant to the specific calculation requested.
6. Error Checking/Verification: Detecting that option B contains all elements from A, B, and C without missing any (like '3') or adding any (like '10').
