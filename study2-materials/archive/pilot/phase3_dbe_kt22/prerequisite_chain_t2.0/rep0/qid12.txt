PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Set Theory notation (braces and commas representing discrete sets).
2. Understanding of the Union operator (∪) as the combination of all unique elements from two sets.
3. Understanding of the Intersection operator (∩) as identifying only the elements common to two sets.
4. Mastery of Order of Operations involving parentheses (calculating the contents of brackets before the outer operator).
5. Accurate visual scanning/matching (avoiding "eye-skip" when comparing elements across three different sets).
6. Distinguishing between the Intersection (∩) and Union (∪) symbols (preventing sign reversal).
