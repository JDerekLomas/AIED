PREREQUISITES: 
1. Identifying ER notation symbols: Knowledge that underlining an attribute represents a primary key.
2. Understanding relationship semantics: Recognizing that a line between entities represents a relationship, which implicitly functions as a foreign key constraint in a relational mapping, even if the "FK" notation isn't explicitly on the diagram.
3. Defining domain constraints: Knowing that domain constraints (data types, ranges) are typically specified in the Data Dictionary or DDL, not the visual ER diagram.
4. Distinguishing model layers: Understanding the difference between a logical/physical constraint and its graphical representation in a conceptual model.
5. Evaluating "All of the above" scenarios: Students often struggle when multiple options appear correct; they must realize that ER diagrams explicitly show PKs (via underlining) and structural relationships (representing FKs), making it a multi-answer or "most correct" identification task.
6. Interpretation of "captured": Determining if the student interprets "captured" as "explicitly labeled" vs "structurally implied."
