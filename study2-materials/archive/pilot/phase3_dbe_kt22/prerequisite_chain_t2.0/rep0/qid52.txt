PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Terminology mapping**: Knowing that a "relation" in relational database theory is implemented as a "table" in SQL/PostgreSQL.
2. **SQL Keyword Syntax**: Identifying that `CREATE` is the standard DDL command word, rather than `NEW`.
3. **PostgreSQL-specific syntax knowledge**: Recalling that PostgreSQL follows standard SQL for object creation and does not have a bespoke `CREATE RELATION` command.
4. **Syntax differentiation**: Distinguishing between a theoretical command that "makes sense" linguistically (Option B) and the actual syntactical implementation (Option A).
5. **Basic schema manipulation knowledge**: Having performed or seen the basic "Hello World" of database setup (Table creation).
