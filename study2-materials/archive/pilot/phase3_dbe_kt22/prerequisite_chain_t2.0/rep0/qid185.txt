PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a SQL View as a derived/virtual table rather than a physical one.
2. Knowledge of SQL Data Control Language (DCL) and how "ownership" differs between base tables and views.
3. Distinguishing between "Select" privileges (often inherent) and "Update" privileges (dependent on updatability rules).
4. Understanding "Updatability" criteria: Knowing that not all views are updatable (e.g., those with joins, aggregations, or missing NOT NULL columns) even if the user has table-level permissions.
5. Understanding the Grantor/Grantee logic: A user can only grant or hold privileges on a view that they possess on the underlying schema.
6. Reading comprehension of logical qualifiers: Distinguishing "always" (A, B) and "all privileges" (D) from "not necessarily" (C).
7. Identifying a counter-example: Realizing that a view involving a JOIN or a GROUP BY prevents the creator from having "Update" privileges, even if they own the source tables.
