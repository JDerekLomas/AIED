PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of 3rd Normal Form (3NF): Knowledge that it allows either $X$ to be a superkey OR $A$ to be a prime attribute.
2. Definition of Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF): Knowledge of the stricter requirement that $X$ must be a superkey.
3. Terminology: Understanding "non-trivial functional dependency" ($X \to A$).
4. Terminology: Understanding "prime attribute" (part of a candidate key).
5. Terminology: Understanding "superkey."
6. Distinction/Mapping: Correctly matching the strict definition (C) to BCNF and recognizing that A and B are swapped versions of standard rules.
7. Logic: Recognizing that D is only one half of the 3NF condition (it's the sufficient part of the OR condition, but A and B provide "if" structures that test the definition itself).
8. Elimination/Precision: Not confusing the BCNF superkey requirement with the 3NF "prime attribute" loophole.
