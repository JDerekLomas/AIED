PREREQUISITES:
1. **Differentiating Entities**: Identifying the difference between an Entity (e.g., Fitness Class) and an Attribute (e.g., Time slot).
2. **Definition of a Key Attribute**: Understanding that a key must be unique for every instance of that entity set and cannot be null.
3. **Multivalued Attribute Recognition**: Recognizing that a technician might have multiple phone numbers (or share one), and specifically that the text doesn't explicitly state the phone number is a unique identifier.
4. **Relationship Cardinality Analysis**: Recognizing that multiple maintenance events can occur on the same date (Date is not unique).
5. **Schema Common Sense/Domain Knowledge**: Recognizing that "Name" is rarely a key for employees because names are not guaranteed to be unique.
6. **Distinguishing Candidates through Constraints**: Identifying the specific business rule in the text: "No two fitness classes have the same daily time slot."
7. **Entity Mapping**: Understanding that "Fitness Class" is the entity and "Time Slot" is the attribute designated as unique by the narrative.
8. **Handling Distractors**: Not being confused by the mention of "Unique IDs" for employees and equipment, which are not listed as options.
