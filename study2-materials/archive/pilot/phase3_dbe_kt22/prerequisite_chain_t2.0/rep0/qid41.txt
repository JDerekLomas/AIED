PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the technical definition of a "Relation" in the relational model (distinguishing it from a visual SQL table).
2. Understanding the term "Tuple" as a synonym for a row/record.
3. Understanding the term "Attribute" as a synonym for a column/field.
4. Knowing the set-theoretic definition of a relation (a relation is a set of tuples, and sets are unordered).
5. Knowing the definition of a tuple as a function from attribute names to values, rather than an ordered n-tuple (or knowing that column headers are unordered sets).
6. Distinguishing between the conceptual Relational Model and physical SQL implementations (where `ORDER BY` or `SELECT *` might imply a specific sequence).
7. Accurate mapping of the "Not important; Not important" logic to the correct multiple-choice letter (D) without switching the order.
