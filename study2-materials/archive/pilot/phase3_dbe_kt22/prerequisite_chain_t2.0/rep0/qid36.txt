PREREQUISITES:
* Knowledge of relational model terminology (mapping informal terms like "table" to formal terms like "relation").
* Distinguishing between specific relational components (Row vs. Tuple, Column vs. Attribute).
* Understanding the definition of a Domain (the set of valid values for an attribute) to eliminate it as a distracter.
* Recognizing that "Range" is a mathematical term not typically used to define a table in this context.
* Ability to map the conceptual entity (the container of data) to its mathematical foundation.
