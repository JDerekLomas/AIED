PREREQUISITES:
1.  **Reading Comprehension (English)**: Ability to parse a dense narrative description and extract structural relationships.
2.  **Conceptual Mapping (Entity vs. Attribute)**: Distinguishing between an object that exists independently (Entity) and a property that describes an object (Attribute).
3.  **Schema Context (System Boundary)**: Recognising that "Fitness centre" represents the database context/scope rather than a data point to be stored.
4.  **Identifying Multi-valued Dependencies**: Recognising that "Associate member" describes a set of entities with their own properties (name, number) rather than a simple property.
5.  **Keyword Recognition**: Identifying "Unique ID" in the text as a characteristic/identifier of the Employee entity.
6.  **Complex Data Structures Recognition**: Understanding that "Fitness class" is a complex object with multiple properties (dates, times, names) and relationships (members, trainers), qualifying it as an entity.
7.  **Process of Elimination**: Systematically evaluating four distinct noun phrases against the functional requirements of the provided text.
