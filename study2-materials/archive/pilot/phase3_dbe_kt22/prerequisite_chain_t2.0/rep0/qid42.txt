PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of "Superkey" (knowing it is the most general formal term for a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple).
2. Vocabulary comprehension: mapping the term "tuple" to a row or record in a table.
3. Vocabulary comprehension: mapping the term "attribute" to a table column.
4. Distinguishing between a "Superkey" and a "Foreign key" (which identifies rows in a *different* table).
5. Eliminating "Domain" as a set of permissible values for an attribute rather than a unique identifier.
6. Identifying "Subkey" as a distractor (it is not a standard relational model term).
7. Recognizing the phrase "taken collectively" as referring to the potential for composite keys (a core property of superkeys).
