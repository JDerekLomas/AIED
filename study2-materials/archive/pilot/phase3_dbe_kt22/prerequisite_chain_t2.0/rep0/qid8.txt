PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the definition of a Cartesian Product ($A \times B$).
2. Understanding set notation (the use of curly braces and commas).
3. Understanding ordered pair notation $(element1, element2)$.
4. Mapping the order of elements in the result set to the specific sets (recognizing that the first element in each pair originates from set $A$ and the second from set $B$).
5. Performing set reduction/deduplication (identifying that $\{p, p, q, q\}$ simplifies to the set $\{p, q\}$).
6. Distinguishing between set $A$ and set $B$ to avoid the "inverse" trap (Option D).
