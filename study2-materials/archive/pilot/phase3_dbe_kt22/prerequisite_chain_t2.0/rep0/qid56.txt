PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the technical definition of "fixed-length" versus "variable-length" in the context of storage and memory allocation.
2. Recall of the specific SQL standard keyword `char` and its behavioral property (padding with spaces to length $n$).
3. Recall of the specific SQL standard keyword `varchar` and its behavioral property (storing only the actual characters provided up to length $n$).
4. Ability to distinguish between two highly similar terms that differ only by a prefix ("var").
5. Matching the identified concepts to the correct sequential order required by the blanks in the sentence (Mapping $char \rightarrow$ blank 1 and $varchar \rightarrow$ blank 2).
