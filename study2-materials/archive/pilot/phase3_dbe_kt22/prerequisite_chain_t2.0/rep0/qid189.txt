PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a SQL injection attack (malicious code injected via user input).
2. Distinguishing between static hard-coded strings (Option B) and dynamically constructed strings.
3. Distinguishing between developer-defined internal variables (Option C) and untrusted external input (Option A).
4. Identifying the source of external data (recognizing `Request.form` as user-controllable input).
5. Understanding string concatenation in programming (the `+` operator) and how it builds a query string.
6. Recognizing that single quotes (`'`) in a concatenated SQL string provide the necessary syntax boundary for an attacker to break out of the data literal.
7. Identifying the "None of the above" trap (ruling out B and C successfully).
