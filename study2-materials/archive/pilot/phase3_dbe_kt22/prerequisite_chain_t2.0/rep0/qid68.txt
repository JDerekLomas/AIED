To provide an accurate estimate, I am assuming the students are provided with a visual representation of a `Study` table containing sample data (e.g., 6 rows with potentially duplicate student IDs or varying columns) alongside this question.

PREREQUISITES:
1. **Understanding the SELECT clause**: Identifying that `StudentID, Name` determines which columns are returned but does not filter the number of rows.
2. **Understanding the FROM clause**: Correctlly identifying the target table (`Study`) from a schema diagram or data set.
3. **Knowledge of row-level processing**: Understanding that a standard `SELECT` (without `DISTINCT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, or `LIMIT`) returns one row in the result set for every row existing in the source table.
4. **Distinguishing between Columns and Rows**: Ensuring the student counts vertical entries (records) rather than horizontal headers or specific data cells.
5. **Ability to count accurately**: Performing the basic cardinality count of the provided dataset without an off-by-one error.
6. **Understanding NULLs/Duplicates**: Recognizing that the presence of duplicate IDs or null values (if present in the sample data) does not automatically reduce the row count unless a specific keyword is used.

COUNT: 6
