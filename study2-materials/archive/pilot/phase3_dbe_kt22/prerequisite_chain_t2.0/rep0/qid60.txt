PREREQUISITES:
1. Recall the specific SQL keyword for Data Manipulation Language (DML) additions (distinguishing "insert" from synonyms like "enter").
2. Knowledge of the standard SQL `INSERT INTO` clause structure.
3. Recognition of the required `VALUES` keyword to precede the tuple data.
4. Identification of the correct positional ordering of keywords (subject-verb-object-value sequence).
5. Distinguishing between a schema-shorthand representation and valid executable SQL syntax.
6. Eliminating plausible-sounding but syntactically invalid distractors (specifically Option C, which looks like a column list but lacks the mandatory `VALUES` keyword).
