PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the technical definition of "correctness" in the specific context of database transaction management (concurrency control).
2. Distinguishing between the ACID properties (General properties) and the formal criterion used to evaluate schedule execution (Serializability).
3. Recognizing "Consistency" as a goal/requirement rather than the operational criterion for concurrency.
4. Identifying "Atomicity" as a property of individual transactions (all-or-nothing) rather than a multi-transaction scheduling criterion.
5. Overcoming the "All of the above" trap, which is an attractive distractor when students recognize multiple terms from the same chapter (ACID).
6. Recalling the specific definition: A concurrent schedule is "correct" if it is equivalent to some serial execution of the same transactions.
