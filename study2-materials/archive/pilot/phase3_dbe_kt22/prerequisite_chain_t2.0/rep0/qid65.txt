PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of basic SQL DDL (Data Definition Language) syntax for table creation (`CREATE TABLE`).
2. Knowledge that commas (`,`) are used to separate column definitions within the parentheses, not semicolons (`;`).
3. Understanding the difference between a list separator (comma) and the command terminator (semicolon).
4. Distinguishing between the logical data type name provided in the schema definition (STRING) and its concrete SQL implementation (VARCHAR).
5. Attention to detail regarding statement termination: recognizing that Option B lacks the semicolon required to end the SQL command in most DBMS environments/standard conventions, whereas Option C includes it.
6. Reading a schema diagram/definition: correctly mapping the logical fields (StudentID, CourseNo, Semester) to the provided options.
