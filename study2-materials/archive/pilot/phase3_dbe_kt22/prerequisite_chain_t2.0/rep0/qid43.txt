PREREQUISITES: 
- Recall the definition of the relational model term "referential integrity" (connecting data across tables).
- Distinguish between different types of keys (Primary, Foreign, Candidate, Superkey).
- Understand the specific functional purpose of a Foreign Key as a constraint/link rather than just a unique identifier.
- Map the concept of a "link between two tables" specifically to the attribute(s) in the referencing table.
- Interpret the sentence structure to identify that it is looking for a mechanism/tool (a "is used to...").
