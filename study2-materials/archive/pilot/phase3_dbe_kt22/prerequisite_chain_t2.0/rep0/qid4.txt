PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Mathematical Set Notation**: Recognizing that curly braces `{}` denote a set and commas separate individual elements.
2. **Definition of Cartesian Product**: Knowing that the result of $A \times B$ is a set of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ where $x \in A$ and $y \in B$.
3. **Concept of Ordered Pairs**: Understanding that $(x, y)$ is not the same as $(y, x)$, and the sequence within the parenthesis matters relative to the sets provided.
4. **Exhaustive Matching (Completeness)**: Knowing that every element in the first set must be paired with every element in the second set (finding all 4 combinations).
5. **Set Membership Identification**: Distinguishing that elements from $A$ must be in the first position of the pair and elements from $B$ in the second position for $A \times B$ (ruling out D).
6. **Error Spotting (Constraint Checking)**: Noticing that elements must come specifically from the provided sets (ruling out "b, b" in option A).
7. **Mapping Sets to SQL JOIN logic**: In a South African CS context, students often first encounter this concept in Relation Algebra; they must correctly translate the abstract math to the choices provided without confusing it with a "Self Join" (Option B).
