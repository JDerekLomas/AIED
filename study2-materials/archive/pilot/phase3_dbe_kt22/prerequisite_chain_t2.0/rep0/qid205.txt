PREREQUISITES: 
1. Vocabulary recognition: Identifying the specific technical definitions of the "Three Read Phenomena" (Dirty, Unrepeatable, and Phantom).
2. Distinguishing granularity: Understanding the difference between a change to an *existing* row (Unrepeatable) vs. the addition of *new* rows (Phantom).
3. Mapping scenarios: Connecting the specific phrase "inserted into a table" to the concept of a range or set-based change.
4. Concept exclusion: Knowing that a "Dirty read" involves uncommitted data and a "Lost update" involves write-write conflicts.
5. Understanding transaction isolation context: Recognizing that these are concurrency anomalies addressed by isolation levels.
