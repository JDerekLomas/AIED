PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the "CIA Triad" (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) framework.
2. Understanding the specific definition of "Integrity" as protecting data against unauthorized modification.
3. Distinguishing between "Confidentiality" (protecting access) and "Integrity" (protecting accuracy/correctness).
4. Interpreting the second part of the phrasing ("in ways different from how they are supposed to") as a reference to data consistency/logical correctness.
5. Vocabulary mapping: Connecting "changing data" to the concept of integrity rather than accountability.
6. Reading comprehension: Distinguishing the "who" (authorization) from the "how" (validity).
