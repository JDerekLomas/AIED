PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation for cardinality ($|X|$).
2. Recognizing the "$\times$" operator as the Cartesian product in the context of set theory (as opposed to standard arithmetic multiplication of numbers).
3. Knowing the definition/formula for the cardinality of a Cartesian product: $|A \times B| = |A| \times |B|$.
4. Applying the multiplication rule to the specific values provided ($3 \times 2 = 6$).
5. Distinguishing between set union ($3 + 2 = 5$) and set product ($3 \times 2 = 6$).
