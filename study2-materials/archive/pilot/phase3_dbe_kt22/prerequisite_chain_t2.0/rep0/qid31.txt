PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the symbol for a subset ($\subseteq$) and its definition (all elements of the left set must be present in the right set).
2. Understanding the Cartesian Product operator ($\times$) and that its elements are ordered pairs, not individual atoms.
3. Identifying the elements of set A as integers ({1, 2}).
4. Correcty calculating (or conceptually grasping) the elements of A x B as pairs (e.g., {(1,a), (1,b), (2,a), (2,b)}).
5. Distinguishing between different types/domains (comparing an integer element to an ordered pair element).
6. Resisting the "visual pattern match" trap where the presence of "A" on both sides suggests a true statement to a novice.
