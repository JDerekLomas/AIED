PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of Set Theory notation (braces representing sets).
2. Understanding the Set Difference operator symbol (minus sign).
3. Ability to identify common elements (intersection) between Set A and Set B.
4. Correct application of the "Relative Complement" rule (removing elements from the first set that appear in the second, rather than performing a symmetric difference or a union).
5. Accurate manual execution/calculation without oversight (preventing "visual noise" errors where values from sets C or D distract the student).
