PREREQUISITES: 
1. Set difference notation: Understanding that $(A - B)$ refers to elements in A that are not in B.
2. Set union notation: Understanding that $\cup$ combines the resulting elements from both sides.
3. Computation of $(A - B)$: Correct identifying that $\{1, 2, 3\} - \{1, 2, 5\} = \{3\}$.
4. Computation of $(B - A)$: Correct identifying that $\{1, 2, 5\} - \{1, 2, 3\} = \{5\}$.
5. Set synthesis: Combining the intermediate results $\{3\}$ and $\{5\}$ to get $\{3, 5\}$.
6. Distinguishing "Set Difference" from "Intersection": Avoiding the common mistake of picking elements they share (which leads to choice B).
7. Recognizing the concept: Identifying this as a Symmetric Difference, even if the term isn't used.
8. Operational ordering: Following the parentheses correctly before applying the union operator.
