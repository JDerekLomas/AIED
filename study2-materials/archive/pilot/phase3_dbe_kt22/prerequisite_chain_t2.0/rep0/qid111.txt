PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a Superkey (SK) (as a set of attributes whose closure contains all attributes in R).
2. Distinguishing between a Superkey (SK) and a Candidate Key (CK) (realizing that an SK does not have to be minimal).
3. Knowing how to compute the transitive closure of an attribute set under a given set of functional dependencies ($\Sigma$).
4. Correctly applying the augmentation/transitivity rules: Identifying that $A \to B$ and $B \to C$ implies $A \to ABC$ but lacks attribute $D$.
5. Recognizing that the attribute $D$ does not appear on the right-hand side of any dependency in $\Sigma$ and therefore must be part of any key.
6. Multi-step reasoning: Concluding that because $D \notin A^+$, the set $\{A\}$ cannot functionally determine $D$, thus $\{A\}$ cannot be a superkey.
7. Reading the schema and set notation correctly.
