PREREQUISITES: 
- Knowledge of Data Control Language (DCL) syntax for `GRANT` and `REVOKE`.
- Understanding the concept of "Cascading Revokes" (how permissions propagate through the `WITH GRANT OPTION`).
- Ability to distinguish between the command used to provide permissions (`GRANT`) and the command used to take them away (`REVOKE`) in the context of the question's goal.
- Knowledge of the specific SQL standard keywords `RESTRICT` and `CASCADE` used as modifiers in a `REVOKE` statement.
- Distinguishing between the keyword that causes the action (`CASCADE`) and the keyword that prevents the action if dependencies exist (`RESTRICT`).
- Identifying that `no cascade` and `no restrict` are syntactically invalid/invented distractors in standard SQL.
