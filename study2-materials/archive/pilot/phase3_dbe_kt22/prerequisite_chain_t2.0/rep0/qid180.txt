PREREQUISITES: 
1. Defining confidentiality as the protection of data from unauthorized access or disclosure (distinguishing it from integrity and availability).
2. Understanding that data encryption obscures information to ensure confidentiality.
3. Understanding that access controls (authorization) restrict who can see specific data to ensure confidentiality.
4. Understanding that authentication verifies identity, serving as the gatekeeper for confidentiality.
5. Identifying the definition of auditing as the retrospective recording of actions (detective) rather than a proactive restriction on access (preventative).
6. Interpreting the negative phrasing ("is not used") correctly.
7. Distinguishing between security measures that actively hide/protect data versus those that merely log activity.
