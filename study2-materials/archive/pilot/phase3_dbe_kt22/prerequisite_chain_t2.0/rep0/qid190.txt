PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a "Role" in the context of RBAC (it represents a set of permissions associated with a job function or responsibility, not the object being accessed).
2. Distinguishing between the *subject* (who needs access) and the *object/resource* (what is being accessed).
3. Distinguishing between the *Role* (e.g., Sales) and the *Permissions* (e.g., access to files).
4. Identifying that "Files, printers, and mailboxes" are resources/objects, not roles (Eliminating A).
5. Identifying that "Users and workstations" are subjects or hardware entities, not roles (Eliminating C).
6. Understanding that RBAC typically maps users to functional organizational units or job titles to simplify permission management (Selecting B).
7. Recognizing that "Resource and department roles" (D) is a distractor that confuses the classification of roles with the roles themselves.
8. Linguistic decoding of a scenario-based word problem (mapping the ToyWorld structure to database security theory).
