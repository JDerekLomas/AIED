PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the ACID properties of database transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
2. Understanding the specific definition of "Isolation" (multiple transactions executing without interference).
3. Mapping transaction properties to their corresponding sub-systems in a DBMS (e.g., Durability/Recovery vs. Isolation/Concurrency).
4. Distinguishing "Concurrency control" as the mechanism that manages simultaneous access, rather than a physical "Storage" or "File" manager.
5. Vocabulary comprehension (identifying "Recover manager" as an agent of Durability).
6. Ability to exclude distractors (C and D) which relate to physical data organization rather than logical transaction behavior.
