PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Set Notation: Identifying that curly braces denote a collection of elements.
2. Definition of Union operator (∪): Knowing that $A \cup C$ combines all unique elements from both sets.
3. Correct execution of Union: Performing the mental or written calculation $\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} \cup \{3, 5, 7, 9\} = \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
4. Definition of Proper Subset operator (⊂): Distinguishing it from "element of" ($\in$) or "subset" ($\subseteq$), and knowing it implies every element in the first set must exist in the second.
5. Comparison logic: Evaluating if the resulting large set $\{2, \dots, 9\}$ is contained within the much smaller set $B = \{3, 5, 7\}$.
6. Logical validation: Identifying that since $\{2, 4, 6, 8, 9\}$ are in the union but not in $B$, the statement is mathematically impossible.
