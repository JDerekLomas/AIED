PREREQUISITES: 
1. Set Notation Literacy: Recognizing that curly braces {} denote a set and identifying individual elements.
2. Operator Identification (Difference): Understanding that '-' represents the set difference (elements in the first set not present in the second).
3. Operator Identification (Intersection): Understanding that '∩' represents the intersection (common elements between two sets).
4. Order of Operations: Applying the algebraic logic that operations within parentheses must be solved before the intersection.
5. Execution of (A - D): Correctly identifying that {2,3,4,5} minus {8,9,10,11} results in {2,3,4,5} (disjoint sets).
6. Execution of (B - C): Correctly identifying that {4,5,6,7} minus {6,7,8,9} results in {4,5}.
7. Final Intersection Execution: Finding the common elements between {2,3,4,5} and {4,5}.
8. Distractor Resistance: Avoiding the "visual match" error (e.g., choosing A or D because they appear prominently in the original set definitions).
