PREREQUISITES:
1. **Understanding Functional Dependency notation**: Recognizing that $X \rightarrow Y$ means $X$ determines $Y$.
2. **Knowledge of the Attribute Closure Algorithm**: Understanding the iterative process of expanding a set of attributes based on dependencies.
3. **Application of the Reflexivity Rule**: Knowing that the closure of $A$ ($A^+$) must include $A$ itself as the starting point.
4. **Execution of the Transitive Property (Step 1)**: Correctly applying $A \rightarrow B$ to add $B$ to the set $\{A\}$.
5. **Execution of the Transitive Property (Step 2)**: Correctly applying $B \rightarrow C$ to add $C$ to the set $\{A, B\}$.
6. **Constraint Analysis**: Correctly identifying that $D \rightarrow ABC$ cannot be triggered because $D$ is not in the set $\{A, B, C\}$.
7. **Identifying the Termination Condition**: Recognizing that no more dependencies can be applied and the final set is $\{A, B, C\}$.
8. **Mapping result to Multiple Choice**: Connecting the computed set $\{A, B, C\}$ to option C.
