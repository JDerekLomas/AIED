PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the acronyms R (Relational Schema) and Σ (Set of Functional Dependencies).
2. Distinguishing between Normal Forms (3NF vs. BCNF) and their specific properties regarding dependency preservation.
3. Recalling the existence of the "3NF Synthesis Algorithm" and its guarantees.
4. Recalling the fundamental trade-off: BCNF can guarantee losslessness but cannot always guarantee dependency preservation.
5. Understanding the mathematical meaning of "uniqueness" in decompositions (knowing that different choices of dependencies can lead to different sets of tables).
6. Ability to evaluate existential vs. universal quantifiers (the difference between "always unique" and "exists an algorithm").
7. Identifying "Lossless-Join" and "Dependency-Preservation" as distinct, necessary criteria for a high-quality decomposition.
