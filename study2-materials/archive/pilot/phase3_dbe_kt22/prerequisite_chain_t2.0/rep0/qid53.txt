PREREQUISITES: 
- Knowing the specific SQL keyword used for Data Definition Language (DDL) vs Data Manipulation Language (DML).
- Distinguishing between "Drop" (removing a structure) and "Delete" (removing tuples).
- Knowing that "Relation" is the formal relational model term, but "Table" is the required SQL keyword for this command.
- Recognizing the correct syntax structure (DROP TABLE [name]) vs intuitive but incorrect alternatives like "DROP RELATION".
- Multi-step reasoning: Eliminating option D as it is for record deletion, C for incorrect keyword, and B for incorrect object identifier.
