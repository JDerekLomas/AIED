PREREQUISITES: 
- Definition of a Cartesian product (the set of all possible ordered pairs).
- Concept of commutativity in mathematical operations.
- Understanding the nature of an "ordered pair" (that (a, b) is not the same as (b, a) unless a = b).
- Identifying that for sets to be equal, their elements must be identical.
- Logical reasoning to find a counterexample (e.g., if A={1} and B={2}, then {(1,2)} ≠ {(2,1)}).
- Distinguishing between set cardinality (which is equal) and the sets themselves.
- Interpretation of the quantifier "always" (requires the condition to hold for all possible sets A and B, including those that are disjoint).
