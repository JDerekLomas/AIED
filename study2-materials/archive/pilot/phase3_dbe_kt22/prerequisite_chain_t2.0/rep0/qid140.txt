PREREQUISITES: 
- Understanding the definition of 3NF (Third Normal Form) and its criteria regarding transitive dependencies.
- Distinguishing between "minimising" and "eliminating" redundancy in the context of database theory.
- Recalling the hierarchy of Normal Forms (1NF < 2NF < 3NF < BCNF).
- Understanding the definition of BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) to identify that it is more restrictive than 3NF, not vice versa.
- Evaluating a set of propositions to identify that 3NF still allows some redundancy (specifically when multiple overlapping candidate keys exist) which only BCNF or higher forms address.
- Eliminating distractor A (incorrect hierarchy) and distractor C (absolute claim vs. relative claim).
