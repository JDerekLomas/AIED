PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of SQL DCL (Data Control Language) syntax specific to the GRANT statement.
2. Understanding the specific functional requirement of "privilege delegation" (transitive permissions).
3. Distinguishing between "Privilege" (the action being permitted) and "Option" (the right to delegate the action) within the SQL keyword structure.
4. Distinguishing between the prepositions "With" and "Allow" (knowing "With" is the standard SQL clause prefix for this feature).
5. Elimination of plausible-sounding distractors that use synonymous English terms (e.g., "Allow" vs "With").
