PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of the visual representation: Identifying the diagram as a Venn diagram.
2. Understanding Set Theory notation: Knowing the meaning of symbols for Union (∪), Intersection (∩), and Difference (–).
3. Interpreting the "A ∪ B" region: Understanding it represents all elements in both circles.
4. Interpreting the "A ∩ B" region: Understanding it represents only the overlapping center segment.
5. Performing set subtraction (Set Difference): Understanding that (A ∪ B) – (A ∩ B) means taking the whole area and "removing" the center overlap.
6. Visual mapping: Connecting the visual "hollowed out" centers to the specific algebraic operation in option B.
7. Distinguishing similar terms: Not confusing the symbols for union and intersection (a common error for students with minimal prior exposure).
