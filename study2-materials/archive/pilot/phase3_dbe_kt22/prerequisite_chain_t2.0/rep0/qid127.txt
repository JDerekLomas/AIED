PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a "prime attribute" (an attribute that is a member of at least one candidate key).
2. Knowledge of the definition of a "candidate key" (a minimal superkey).
3. Ability to compute the transitive closure of an attribute set under a given set of functional dependencies (e.g., finding $A^+$).
4. Ability to identify all candidate keys in a relation, not just the first one found.
5. Identifying the cyclic nature of the dependencies ($A \to B \to C \to A$) to conclude that $\{A\}$, $\{B\}$, and $\{C\}$ are each individual candidate keys.
6. Multi-step reasoning to map each attribute to its membership in the set of candidate keys.
7. Distinguishing between "prime attributes" and "primary key attributes" (students often think there is only one key).
