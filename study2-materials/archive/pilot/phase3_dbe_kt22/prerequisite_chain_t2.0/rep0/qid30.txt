PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Understanding Cartesian Product Notation**: Knowing that the symbol 'x' represents the set of all possible ordered pairs between two sets.
2. **Executing the Cartesian Product (A x B)**: Correcting identifying the 4 pairs: (1,a), (1,b), (2,a), (2,b).
3. **Executing the Cartesian Product (C x D)**: Correcting identifying all 9 pairs, particularly recognizing that 3 is a member of C and 'c' is a member of D.
4. **Understanding Set Difference Notation**: Knowing that the '-' symbol represents removing elements of the second set from the first set.
5. **Ordered Pair Mapping**: Distinguishing between (1,c) and (c,1) to ensure the subtraction only removes exact matches.
6. **Set Complementation Logic**: Recognizing that only elements present in (C x D) that are *not* in (A x B) remain.
7. **Attention to Detail/Distractor Management**: Identifying that Option A contains the 5 remaining elements, while Option B is actually the set (A x B) and Option C is an incomplete subset.
