PREREQUISITES: 
1. Definition of a Superkey: Understanding that a set of attributes must functionally determine all attributes in the relation (calculating the closure $\{A,B\}^+$).
2. Functional Dependency (FD) Logic: Ability to apply the transitivity rule or the closure algorithm (if $A \to B$ and $AB \to C$, then $\{A, B\}$ covers $\{A, B, C\}$).
3. Definition of a Candidate Key (CK): Understanding the two-part requirement: (a) it is a superkey and (b) it is **minimal** (no proper subset is a superkey).
4. Subset Identification: Recognizing that $\{A\}$ is a subset of $\{A, B\}$.
5. Minimal Testing: Testing if $A^+$ or $B^+$ alone cover the relation.
6. Execution: Realizing $A \to B$ implies $\{A\}^+ = \{A, B, C\}$, meaning $A$ is a superkey.
7. Conclusion: Recognizing that because $A$ is a superkey, $AB$ fails the minimality test for a Candidate Key.
8. Distinguishing CK from Superkey: Not confusing "is a key" with "is a Candidate Key" (a common pitfall).
