- Recall of basic Data Manipulation Language (DML) keywords.
- Ability to distinguish between Schema-modifying commands (Data Definition Language) and Data-modifying commands (Data Manipulation Language).
- Identification of "INSERT" as the standard SQL keyword, rather than synonymous English terms like "ADD" or "APPEND".
- Recognizing that "ALTER TABLE" is used for structural changes (adding columns), not adding data (rows).
- Ignoring "natural-sounding" but non-existent SQL syntax like "Add row".
