PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of Set Theory notation (braces for sets, elements separated by commas).
2. Understanding of the Cartesian Product operator (x) and how to form ordered pairs.
3. Recognition of the Subset operator (⊆) and the rule that every element in the first set must exist in the second.
4. Correct computation/visualization of the set A x A (the "left-hand side").
5. Correct computation/visualization of the set A x C (the "right-hand side").
6. Logical evaluation of the inclusion relationship (determining if {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)} is a subset of {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)}).
7. Identifying "distractor" information (recognizing that sets B and D are irrelevant to the specific expression provided).
