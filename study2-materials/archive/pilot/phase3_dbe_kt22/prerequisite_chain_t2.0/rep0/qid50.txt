PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of a Superkey (a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple).
2. Definition of a Candidate Key (a minimal superkey; a superkey with no proper subset being a superkey).
3. Definition of a Primary Key (the specific candidate key chosen by the database designer).
4. Understanding Set Inclusion Relationships (all candidate keys are superkeys, but not all superkeys are candidate keys).
5. Understanding Election vs. Necessity (a primary key must be a candidate key, but a candidate key is not "always" a primary key until it is selected).
6. Distinguishing "Always" vs. "Sometimes" (handling the logical quantifiers in the options).
7. Ability to reject the common misconception that "Super-" implies a higher status or stricter requirement (minimalist property).
