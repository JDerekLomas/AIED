PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a Cartesian product (A × B) as a set of ordered pairs (a, b).
2. Deconstructing given ordered pairs to extract distinct elements of set A (the first coordinates: 2, 3, 4).
3. Deconstructing given ordered pairs to extract distinct elements of set B (the second coordinates: 5, 7).
4. Applying the Cardinality Rule for Cartesian products (|A| * |B| = |A × B|) to verify that 3 elements in A and 2 elements in B yield exactly 6 elements.
5. Systematic generation/reconstruction of the full set A × B based on the discovered elements of A and B.
6. Pattern matching the derived set against the multiple-choice options (distinguishing C from distractions like B or D which swap elements or include incorrect values).
