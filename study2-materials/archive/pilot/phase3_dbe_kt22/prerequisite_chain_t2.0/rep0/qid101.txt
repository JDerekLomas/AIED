PREREQUISITES:
1. **Filtering Distractors:** The ability to ignore a large amount of irrelevant narrative (employee types, equipment status, administrators) to focus solely on the "member" and "fitness class" entity types.
2. **Entity-Relationship Mapping:** Correctly identifying that the question asks about the participation of the "member" entity in the "participate" relationship.
3. **Definition of Partial vs. Total Participation:** Knowing that Total participation implies *every* instance of an entity must participate in the relationship, while Partial means an instance *can* exist without being part of the relationship.
4. **Natural Language Parsing (Modality):** Recognizing the significance of the word "may" in the sentence: "A member **may** choose to participate in one or more fitness classes."
5. **Logic Mapping:** Understanding that "may" implies an optional action, which directly maps to a (0,n) cardinality/Partial participation constraint.
6. **Discerning Relationships:** Distinguishing the "participate" relationship from the "personal trainer" or "add associate member" relationships mentioned in the same context.
