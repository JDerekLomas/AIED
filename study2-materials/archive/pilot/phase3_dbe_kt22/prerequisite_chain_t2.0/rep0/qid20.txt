PREREQUISITES: 
1. Set Difference Operator: Understanding that (T - S) removes elements of S from T.
2. Cartesian Product Operator: Knowing that "x" denotes the set of all ordered pairs between two sets.
3. Order of Operations: Recognizing that the parentheses require solving the set subtraction before the multiplication.
4. Set Notation Recognition: Identifying curly braces as sets and parenthetical pairs as coordinates/tuples.
5. Tuple Construction: Correctly pairing every element of the first set with every element of the result set.
6. Eliminating Distractors: Distinguishing between a set of single values (Option A), a full Cartesian product (Option B), and the specific subset resulting from the operation (Option C).
