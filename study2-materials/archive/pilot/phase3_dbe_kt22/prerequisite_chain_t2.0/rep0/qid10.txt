PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recalling the notation for sets (braces and commas) and the definition of a set as a collection of elements.
2. Understanding the intersection ($\cap$) operator: identifying only elements common to both set A and set B.
3. Executing the operation $A \cap B$ correctly ({4, 5}).
4. Understanding the set difference ($-$) operator: removing elements of the second set from the first set.
5. Order of operations: recognizing that the expression inside the parentheses must be evaluated first.
6. Distinguishing set difference from symmetric difference (ensuring only elements from the original A are kept, not including elements unique to the subtrahend).
7. Navigating "distractor" information: identifying that sets C and D are irrelevant to the specific calculation.
8. Precision in set membership: ensuring no elements (like 4 or 5) are accidentally left in or incorrectly removed (like 2 or 3).
