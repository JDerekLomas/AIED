To accurately answer this question, a student must navigate several cognitive and technical hurdles.

**PREREQUISITES:**
1.  **Visual Set Identification:** Ability to map the visual region (shaded) to a logical set-theoretic concept (specifically identifying that it represents "only A").
2.  **Operator Knowledge (Union):** Understanding that the symbol $\cup$ represents the combination of all elements in both sets.
3.  **Operator Knowledge (Intersection):** Understanding that the symbol $\cap$ represents only the elements shared by both sets.
4.  **Operator Knowledge (Difference):** Understanding that the minus symbol $-$ (or set difference) represents the removal of elements of one set from another.
5.  **Order of Operations/Parentheses:** Recognizing that operations inside brackets must be performed before the subtraction.
6.  **Boolean Equivalent Recognition:** Realizing that the expression $(A \cup B) - B$ (taking everything and then removing all of $B$) is functionally equivalent to the shaded region "only A".
7.  **Distinguishing Visual Cues:** Differentiating between Choice A (the whole circle) and the shaded region (which excludes the intersection).
8.  **Elimination Logic:** Correctly rejecting $A \cap B$ (the middle) and $B - (A \cap B)$ (only B).
