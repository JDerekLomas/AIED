PREREQUISITES:
1. Definition of a Superkey: Understanding that it refers specifically to an attribute or set of attributes, not data values (tuples) themselves.
2. Understanding Relational Terminology: Distinguishing between an "attribute" (column) and a "tuple" (row) to reject distractor B.
3. Directionality of Identification: Recognizing that keys identify tuples, not the other way around.
4. Set Theory Relationships: Distinguishing between a Superkey (any uniquely identifying set) and a Candidate Key (a minimal superkey) to reject statement C.
5. Scope of Uniqueness: Understanding that keys provide uniqueness within a specific relation, not distinguishing the table/schema as a whole from other relations (rejecting distractor D).
6. English Language Proficiency: Navigating the dense, similar phrasing characteristic of formal database definitions (a significant factor for students who are non-native English speakers).
