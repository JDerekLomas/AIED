PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Set Theory notation (braces indicating a set, commas separating elements).
2. Knowledge of the Cartesian Product operator symbol (x) as distinct from multiplication or set union.
3. Understanding the definition of a Cartesian Product as a set of ordered pairs.
4. Ability to identify the cardinality of the result (knowing that a 2-element set crossed with a 2-element set must result in 4 elements).
5. Distinguishing between the input set S and the input set T (noticing that the operation is S x S, not S x T).
6. Precision in reading ordered pair notation vs. flat set elements (distinguishing option B from A and C).
