PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the `WITH GRANT OPTION` clause (allowing a user to pass privileges to others).
2. Recognizing that a user can receive the same privilege from multiple different grantors independently (redundant granting).
3. Understanding the mechanism of the `REVOKE... CASCADE` command (revoking from a user and all others who received it through them).
4. Tracking the ownership and delegation chain (lineage) of privileges in a dependency graph.
5. Identifying that Linda granted to Peter directly, creating a "backup" path for Peter's privilege that is independent of Amy's chain.
6. Realizing that a REVOKE from Amy only severs the path through Amy, but does not affect the path originating directly from Linda to Peter.
7. Distinguishing between the person performing the action (the Grantor) and the privilege being revoked.
