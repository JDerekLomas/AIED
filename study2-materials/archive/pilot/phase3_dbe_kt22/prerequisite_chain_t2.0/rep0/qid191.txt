PREREQUISITES: 
1. Defining the term "authentication" specifically as identity verification rather than authorization (access control).
2. Distinguishing between "Who are you?" (Authentication) and "What are you allowed to do?" (Authorization).
3. Recognizing that Options A, B, and C describe forms of access control or privileges, not the process of proving an identity.
4. Evaluating "All of the above" as an attractive distractor when multiple technical-sounding definitions are presented.
5. Understanding that even if the student knows what authentication is, they must realize that none of the provided definitions accurately describe it (since the correct technical answer is "none of the above," though it isn't an option, making the question a likely trick or test of precision).
6. Multi-step reasoning to compare three slightly different versions of "restriction" against a process that is fundamentally about "verification."
