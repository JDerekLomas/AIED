PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Understanding Set Notation**: Recognizing that the symbols {} denote a set and identifying the individual elements within.
2. **Knowledge of Set Intersection ($\cap$)**: Understanding that $A \cap B$ represents the elements common to both sets $A$ and $B$.
3. **Cardinality Logic**: Recognizing that if $A \cap B = \{2, 3\}$, then both 2 and 3 *must* be present in set $B$ by definition of intersection.
4. **Lower Bound Derivation**: Deducing that the size of $B$ (the number of elements) must be at least equal to the number of elements in the intersection.
5. **Set Counting (Cardinality of intersection)**: Correcting counting that $\{2, 3\}$ contains 2 distinct elements.
6. **Logical Negation in Question**: Correcting interpreting the word "cannot" to seek the impossible scenario rather than the possible one.
7. **Multiple Choice Evaluation**: Comparing the derived lower bound ($|B| \ge 2$) against the provided options to identify that "1" violates this condition.
