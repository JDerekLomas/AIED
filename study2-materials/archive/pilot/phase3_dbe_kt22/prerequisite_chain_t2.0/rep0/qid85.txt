PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the `SELECT *` syntax (result returns all columns).
2. Understanding Table Aliasing (`Enrol e`, `Course c`) and dot notation (`e.CourseNo`).
3. Reading and interpreting a relational schema diagram or sample data (implied).
4. Understanding the `IN` operator logic (set membership).
5. Understanding the mechanics of a Subquery (inner query executes first).
6. Filtering logic: applying a `WHERE` clause condition to find specific records in the `Course` table.
7. Identifying the Join Key: mapping `CourseNo` from the `Course` result set to the `Enrol` table.
8. Distinguishing between rows in the 'filtering' table vs. rows in the 'source' table (avoiding the common mistake of choosing the count of courses instead of the count of enrolments).
9. Counting accuracy: scanning the `Enrol` table data correctly based on the matches found.
