PREREQUISITES:
1. Knowledge of Set Theory notation: Understanding the vertical bar symbol ($|X|$) as representing cardinality/count.
2. Symbol recognition: Distinguishing between the intersection symbol ($\cap$) and the union symbol ($\cup$).
3. Recall of the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle formula: $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$.
4. Logical reasoning: Understanding why the intersection must be subtracted (to avoid double-counting the 2 overlapping elements).
5. Basic arithmetic execution: Performing the calculation $10 + 5 - 2$.
6. Distinguishing from additive intuition: Resisting the common mistake of simply adding all provided numbers or ignoring the intersection.
