PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of Set Notation: Identifying the elements within curly braces and understanding set membership.
2. Definition of Cartesian Product ($\times$): Understanding that $S \times T$ creates a set of all possible ordered pairs where the first element is from the first set and the second is from the second.
3. Calculating $S \times T$: Correctly generating the set {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)}.
4. Calculating $S \times S$: Correctly generating the set {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}.
5. Definition of Set Difference ($-$): Understanding that $A - B$ removes all elements found in set $B$ from set $A$.
6. Executing the Subtraction: Correctly identifying that {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)} must be removed from the first result.
7. Distinguishing Ordered Pairs: Realizing that (1,3) and (2,3) are distinct from the elements being subtracted.
8. Pattern Matching to Options: Correctly mapping the calculated result to the provided multiple-choice letters.
