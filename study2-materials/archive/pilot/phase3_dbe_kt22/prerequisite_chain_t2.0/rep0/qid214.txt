PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the syntax and logical sequence of SQL transaction control statements (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK).
2. Knowing the functional definition of a COMMIT (permanently saving changes to the database).
3. Understanding the "point of no return" principle: that a transaction ends once a COMMIT is issued.
4. Distinguishing between an active transaction and a completed transaction.
5. Identifying that a ROLLBACK only affects uncommitted changes.
6. Multi-step reasoning: processing the chronological order of commands to see that COMMIT precedes ROLLBACK.
7. Overcoming the semantic distractor: in common English, "rollback" implies undoing an action regardless of state, which differs from formal DBMS logic.
