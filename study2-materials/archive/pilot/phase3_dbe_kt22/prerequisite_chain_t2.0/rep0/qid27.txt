PREREQUISITES:
1. Interpretation of a Venn diagram: Correct identification of regions belonging to specific sets (A, B, and C).
2. Understanding the Union operator ($\cup$): Knowing it includes elements in either or both sets.
3. Understanding the Intersection operator ($\cap$): Knowing it includes only elements present in both sets.
4. Understanding the Set Difference operator (– or \): Knowing it removes elements of the second set from the first.
5. Operator Precedence and Parentheses: Correctly sequencing the order of operations in set algebra.
6. Pattern Matching/Process of Elimination: Testing each algebraic expression against the visual shaded area.
7. Identifying the "donut hole" logic: Recognizing that the shaded area represents elements in A or C that are specifically *not* part of B.
