PREREQUISITES: 
1. **Defining a Trojan Horse**: Understanding that a Trojan is malware disguised as legitimate software that relies on social engineering/deception to be executed.
2. **Defining a Virus**: Understanding the specific biological metaphor of self-replication and "infecting" existing files.
3. **Distinguishing Malware Types**: Knowing the specific technical distinction between a Trojan (non-replicating) and a Virus/Worm (self-replicating).
4. **Logical Negative Processing**: Correcting for the "Which of the following is NOT true" phrasing, which requires identifying the false statement rather than the true ones.
5. **Technical Nuance**: Recognizing that while a Trojan can "infect" a system via a payload, it does not possess the inherent mechanism to spread copies of itself to other files or systems independently.
6. **Reading Comprehension**: Discerning between Option B (misleading a user - a hallmark of Trojans) and Option D (self-replication - a hallmark of viruses).
