PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding set notation (defining elements within curly braces).
2. Knowledge of the Cartesian Product operator (x) and how to form ordered pairs.
3. Ability to compute the specific members of a Cartesian Product for small sets (A x A and C x C).
4. Understanding the Subset operator (⊆) and its formal definition (every element in the first set must exist in the second).
5. Recognizing that (A ⊆ C) is a necessary condition for (A x A ⊆ C x C).
6. Multi-step reasoning to evaluate the truth value of the entire expression.
7. Distinguishing between "element of" and "subset of" symbols to ensure the relation is interpreted correctly.
