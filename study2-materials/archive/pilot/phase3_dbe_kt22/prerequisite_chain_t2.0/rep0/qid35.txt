PREREQUISITES: 
1. Understanding the definition of a Cartesian product (A x B) as a set of ordered pairs.
2. Knowing the definition of the subset operator (⊆) and that it requires every element of the first set to be present in the second.
3. Ability to mentally or physically construct the set A x B: {(1,a), (1,b), (2,a), (2,b)}.
4. Ability to verify if an arbitrary pair (x, y) belongs to C x D by checking if x ∈ C and y ∈ D.
5. Multi-step reasoning: checking if all 4 elements of (A x B) satisfy the conditions of being in (C x D) based on the definitions of C and D.
6. Distinguishing between a set of values (e.g., A) and a set of ordered pairs (e.g., A x B) to avoid "type mismatch" confusion.
7. Identifying that because A ⊆ C and B ⊆ D, it follows logically that A x B ⊆ C x D.
