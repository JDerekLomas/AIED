PREREQUISITES: 
1. Recognition of Set Theory notation (specifically the intersection symbol $\cap$).
2. Understanding the semantic definition of "Intersection" (finding common elements between $A$ and $C$).
3. Ability to perform an error-free mental or scratchpad comparison of two sets ($A$ and $C$) to derive the set $\{3, 5, 7, 9\}$.
4. Recognition of the "Proper Subset" symbol ($\subset$).
5. Recognition of the negation stroke ($\not\subset$), interpreted as "is not a proper subset of."
6. Understanding the strict definition of a proper subset (all elements must be present, and the subset cannot be equal to the superset).
7. Ability to compare Set $B$ $\{3, 5, 7\}$ to the derived result $\{3, 5, 7, 9\}$.
8. Identifying that $\{3, 5, 7\}$ is indeed a proper subset of $\{3, 5, 7, 9\}$ because it is contained within it and has fewer elements.
9. Evaluating the logical truth of the full statement (since $B$ *is* a proper subset, the statement claiming it *is not* a proper subset must be False).
10. Selecting the correct Boolean choice (B. False) based on the logical evaluation.
