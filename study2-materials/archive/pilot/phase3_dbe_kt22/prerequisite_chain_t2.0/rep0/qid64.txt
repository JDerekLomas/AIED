PREREQUISITES: 
1. Vocabulary: Recognizing the "SELECT" keyword as the command to retrieve data.
2. Syntax: Understanding that the "FROM" clause specifies the source table ("person").
3. Function Knowledge: Identifying "COUNT()" as an aggregate function used for tallying rather than displaying data.
4. Wildcard/Argument Interpretation: Knowing that the asterisk (*) inside a COUNT function refers to the rows/tuples in the table.
5. Distinction of Dimensions: Ability to distinguish between the cardinality (number of rows) and the arity/degree (number of columns) of a relation.
6. Eliminating Distractors: Recognizing that a basic SELECT query without a * or column list after the keyword does not automatically imply a "SELECT *" (which would result in Choice A).
