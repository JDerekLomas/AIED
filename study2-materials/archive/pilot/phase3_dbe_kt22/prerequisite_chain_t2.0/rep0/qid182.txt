PREREQUISITES: 
1. Defining the acronym MAC (Mandatory Access Control) vs. DAC (Discretionary Access Control) and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
2. Distinguishing the concept of "ownership" (characteristic of DAC) from "central authority" (characteristic of MAC).
3. Associating security labels (clearances and classifications) specifically with the MAC paradigm.
4. Recognizing SQL commands (GRANT/REVOKE) as mechanisms for implementing DAC, not MAC.
5. Identifying "roles" as the core component of RBAC, thereby eliminating Distractor D.
6. Reading comprehension to differentiate between the agent of control (the system/policy vs. the user).
