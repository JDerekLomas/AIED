PREREQUISITES: 
1. Knowledge of Set Theory notation (specifically the $\cup$ symbol for Union).
2. Knowledge of Set Theory notation (specifically the $\subset$ symbol for "Proper Subset").
3. Ability to perform a Union operation between sets A and B (calculating $A \cup B$).
4. Recognition that $B \subseteq A$, which simplifies the union $A \cup B$ to set $A$ (or simply correctly calculating the union as $\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$).
5. Understanding the specific definition of a proper subset (that set $B$ must be contained in the result and not be equal to the result).
6. Multi-step logical processing (evaluating the parentheses first, then the outer relation).
7. Identifying the "distractor" set (Set C), which is irrelevant to this specific logical statement but may confuse students with low attention to detail.
