To evaluate this question, we must look at the specific table provided in the context of the question (assuming a typical schema provided in a South African CS1/CS2 database module).

PREREQUISITES:
1. **Schema Literacy**: Identifying the correct column ("Name") in the provided `Study` table.
2. **Case Sensitivity Mastery**: Understanding that standard SQL string comparisons (like the '=' operator) are case-sensitive (unlike default MySQL configurations), making 'Tom' $\neq$ 'tom'.
3. **Function Knowledge**: Understanding that the `lower()` function transforms 'Tom' into 'tom' before the comparison takes place.
4. **Exact Matching**: Recognizing that 'Tommy' or 'Tomas' will not match 'tom' after the transformation because they have different character lengths.
5. **Literal Syntax**: Distinguishing between a column name and a string literal (single quotes).
6. **Counting Logic**: Accurately scanning the table and counting all matches without skipping rows or double-counting.
7. **Operator Mechanics**: Understanding that `SELECT *` returns the full row but the row count is determined solely by the `WHERE` clause evaluation.
