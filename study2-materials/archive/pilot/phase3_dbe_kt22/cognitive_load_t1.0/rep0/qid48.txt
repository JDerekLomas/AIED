ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Definition of a candidate key (uniqueness and minimality).
2. Definition recall: Definition of a superkey (uniqueness property only).
3. Logical relationship: Understanding that any superset of a candidate key is a superkey.
4. Distinguishing concepts: Differentiating between "must be" (necessity) and "could be" (possibility) regarding minimality.
5. Evaluating constraints: Testing if the addition of attribute 'c' to a candidate key {a,b} preserves the uniqueness property required for a superkey.
6. Logical elimination: Recognizing that if {a,b} is minimal, a subset like {a} cannot be assumed to be a superkey without further information.
