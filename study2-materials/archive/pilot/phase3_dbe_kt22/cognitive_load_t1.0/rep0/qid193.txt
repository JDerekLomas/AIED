ELEMENTS:
1.  **Ownership Rules**: Recalling that the owner (Linda) holds absolute privileges and the power to revoke.
2.  **GRANT OPTION Semantics**: Understanding that `WITH GRANT OPTION` allows a grantee to pass privileges to others.
3.  **Grant Dependency Graph**: Mapping the flow of privileges (Linda → Amy → Peter) and (Linda → Peter).
4.  **REVOKE CASCADE Logic**: Understanding that revoking from a grantor automatically revokes privileges from all subjects who received it from them.
5.  **Redundancy Tracking**: Evaluating whether Peter retains a privilege from a secondary source (Linda directly) after the path through Amy is severed.
6.  **SQL Syntax/Statement Sequencing**: Processing the chronological order of operations and their cumulative effect on the state of the database.
7.  **Logical Evaluation of Options**: Comparing the final state of the privilege table against four distinct Boolean combinations.
