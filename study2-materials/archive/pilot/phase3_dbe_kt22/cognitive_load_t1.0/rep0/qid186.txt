ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The fundamental principle of Discretionary Access Control (DAC) versus Mandatory Access Control (MAC).
2. Concept distinction: Distinguishing between the role of the "Object Owner" and the "Database Administrator" (DBA) regarding privilege delegation.
3. Evaluating logical conditions: Assessing the validity of "ownership" constraints (e.g., whether all objects must have owners or if the DBA owns everything).
4. SQL/Security Syntax: Recalling the `GRANT` mechanism logic (specifically the `WITH GRANT OPTION` nuance implied in DAC).
5. Eliminating distractors: Differentiating between administrative supremacy (Option C) and the decentralized nature of DAC ownership (Option D).
