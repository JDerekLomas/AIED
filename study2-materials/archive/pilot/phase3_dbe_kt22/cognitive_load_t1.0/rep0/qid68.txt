To provide an accurate assessment, I am assuming the students have been provided with a schema or a sample instance of the **Study** table (which typically contains 4-6 rows in standard textbook examples). If no table instance was provided, the question is unsolvable; however, assuming the context of a provided diagram:

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **SQL Syntax Recognition:** Identifying that `SELECT` and `FROM` define the structure of the query.
2.  **Mapping Clause to Action:** Understanding that `SELECT` specifies columns but does not filter rows.
3.  **Table Identification:** Locating the "Study" table within a provided schema or diagram.
4.  **Cardinality Evaluation:** Counting the total number of records (rows) in the identified table.
5.  **Distinguishing Projection from Selection:** Realizing that restricting columns (StudentID, Name) does not change the number of rows returned (no `WHERE` clause or `DISTINCT` present).

**ELEMENT COUNT:** 5

**PROPORTION ESTIMATE:**
At a South African university, this is a "recall and apply" level question typically found in the first third of the semester. Students with strong programming backgrounds will find this trivial. Students struggling with the paradigm shift to declarative languages often confuse rows and columns or assume the `SELECT` list limits the "size" of the output in terms of rows. Given the wide variance in ability, most will grasp basic cardinality early on.
