ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall: Superkey (a set of one or more attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple).
2. Definition recall: Candidate Key (a minimal superkey; a superkey with no redundant attributes).
3. Definition recall: Primary Key (a candidate key selected by the DBA).
4. Conceptual distinction: Minimality requirement (the difference between a superkey and a candidate key).
5. Logical set inclusion: Evaluating the "is always a" relationship between nested sets (All candidate keys $\subset$ Superkeys).
6. Logical evaluation: Testing counter-examples for each distractor (e.g., finding a superkey that is not minimal to disprove A).
