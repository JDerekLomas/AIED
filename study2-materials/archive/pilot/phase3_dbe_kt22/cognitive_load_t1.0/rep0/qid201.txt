ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The specific definition of "dirty read" (reading uncommitted data).
2. Definition recall: The specific definition of "unrepeatable read" (data changing between two reads in the same transaction).
3. Definition recall: The specific definition of "phantom read" (new rows appearing between two reads).
4. Relational mapping: Associating the presence/absence of these three phenomena with the four standard SQL isolation levels.
5. Constraint satisfaction: Simultaneously filtering the options to find the level that satisfies a "No" for dirty reads AND a "Yes" for the other two.
