ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of Set Intersection (recall that $A \cap C$ requires elements common to both).
2. Execution of Intersection (identifying the specific resulting set $\{3, 5, 7, 9\}$).
3. Definition of Subset ($\subset$) vs. Not a Subset ($\not\subset$) notation.
4. Logical Evaluation of Membership (checking if every element of $B$ is contained within the result of $A \cap C$).
5. Negation Processing (interpreting the "False" result of the subset check against the "Not a Subset" statement to determine the final truth value).

ELEMENT COUNT: 5

Your estimate:
