ELEMENTS:
1. **Definition recall**: Identifying that a comma-separated list in a FROM clause without a WHERE clause represents a Cartesian Product (Cross Join).
2. **Mathematical procedure**: Recalling the rule that the cardinality of a Cartesian Product is the product of the row counts of the participating tables (Rows in A × Rows in B).
3. **Data extraction**: Inspecting the provided tables (implied context) to identify the specific number of rows in the 'Course' table.
4. **Data extraction**: Inspecting the provided tables to identify the specific number of rows in the 'Enrol' table.
5. **Arithmetic calculation**: Performing the multiplication of the two values to find the total.
6. **SQL syntax rules**: Recognizing that "SELECT *" does not filter rows, only columns, and thus does not affect the row count.
