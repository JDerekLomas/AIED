As a university instructor, I evaluate this question as having relatively low element interactivity, as it focuses on a core definition within relational algebra rather than complex procedural execution.

**ELEMENTS:**
1. **Definition recall (Superkey):** Understanding that a superkey is any set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple.
2. **Set Theory/Inclusion Logic:** Recognizing that if $\{a, b\}$ uniquely identifies a row, any superset (adding $c$) will also inherently maintain that uniqueness.
3. **Formal Notation Interpretation:** Mapping the abstract notation $R(a,b,c)$ and $\{a,b\}$ to the concept of columns and sets.
4. **Distinction between Key and Superkey:** Differentiating between a "minimal" key (candidate key) and a "superkey" (which has no minimality constraint).

**ELEMENT COUNT:** 4

Students often struggle with the distinction between "Key" and "Superkey." Stronger students will find this trivial, while those with minimal exposure often incorrectly assume a superkey must be minimal (confusing it with a Candidate Key) or get tripped up by the "must" phrasing. In a South African undergraduate context, where English as a Medium of Instruction (EMI) can impact the nuance of "must" versus "could," some errors occur despite knowing the math.

Your estimate:
