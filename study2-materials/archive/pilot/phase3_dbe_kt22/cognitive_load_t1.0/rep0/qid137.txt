ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: 3NF formal definition (non-prime attributes must not be transitively dependent on a key).
2. Definition recall: BCNF formal definition (every determinant must be a superkey).
3. Candidate Key derivation: Computing attribute closures (e.g., $\{AB\}^+ = \{A,B,C,D\}$ and $\{BC\}^+ = \{A,B,C,D\}$) to identify keys.
4. Prime Attribute identification: Recognizing that $\{A, B, C\}$ are all prime attributes because they belong to at least one candidate key.
5. Evaluation of $AB \to CD$: Checking if $AB$ is a superkey for BCNF/3NF.
6. Evaluation of $BC \to A$: Checking if $BC$ is a superkey for BCNF/3NF.
7. Evaluation of Prime Status: Recognizing that in $BC \to A$, even if $BC$ were not a key, $A$ being prime satisfies the 3NF condition but violates BCNF.
8. Logical synthesis: Comparing the results of both dependencies against both normal form criteria simultaneously to select the correct combination (A, B, C, or D).
