ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of a **superkey** (a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple).
2. Definition of a **candidate key** (a minimal superkey).
3. The **monotonicity property** of superkeys (if K is a superkey, any superset of K is also a superkey).
4. Logical evaluation of Option A (Testing if adding an attribute 'c' can "undo" the superkey property).
5. Logical evaluation of Option B (Testing if a superset can be a "minimal" superkey).
6. Definition/Rules of **Primary Keys** (distinguishing between a property that *must* be true vs. a design choice).
