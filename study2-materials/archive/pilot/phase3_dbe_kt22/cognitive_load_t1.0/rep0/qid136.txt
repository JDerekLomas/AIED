ELEMENTS: 
1. **Definition recall (Candidate Key)**: Identifying that a key must functionally determine all attributes in the relation.
2. **Procedure (Key Derivation)**: Calculating the closure of $\{A\}$ to determine that $A$ is the sole candidate key ($A^+ = \{A, B, C\}$).
3. **Definition recall (Prime vs. Non-prime attributes)**: Categorizing $\{A\}$ as prime and $\{B, C\}$ as non-prime.
4. **Logic/Condition evaluation (3NF)**: Testing $B \to C$ against 3NF rules (Is $B$ a superkey? No. Is $C$ a prime attribute? No. Result: Fails 3NF).
5. **Logic/Condition evaluation (BCNF)**: Testing $A \to B$ and $B \to C$ against BCNF rules (Is $B$ a superkey? No. Result: Fails BCNF).
6. **Transitive dependency identification**: Recognizing that $A \to B \to C$ constitutes a transitive dependency on a candidate key, which violates 3NF.
7. **Logical elimination/Comparison**: Mapping the findings (not 3NF, not BCNF) to the provided multiple-choice options.
