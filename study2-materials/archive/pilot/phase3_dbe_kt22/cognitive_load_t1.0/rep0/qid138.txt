ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of Candidate Key (CK) and Superkey.
2. Procedure for calculating attribute closures to identify all CKs (e.g., finding that {A,B} and {B,C} are the candidate keys).
3. Identification of "Prime" vs "Non-prime" attributes (Prime: {A, B, C}; Non-prime: {D}).
4. Definition recall of 3NF requirements (No transitive dependencies of non-prime attributes on a key).
5. Evaluation of the first FD (AB → CD) against 3NF: AB is a CK, so it satisfies 3NF.
6. Evaluation of the second FD (C → A) against 3NF: A is a prime attribute, so it satisfies 3NF even though C is not a key.
7. Definition recall of BCNF requirements (For every X → Y, X must be a superkey).
8. Evaluation of the second FD (C → A) against BCNF: Determining if C is a superkey (it is not, as its closure is {A, C}).
9. Comparison and integration of the 3NF and BCNF results to select the matching multiple-choice option.
