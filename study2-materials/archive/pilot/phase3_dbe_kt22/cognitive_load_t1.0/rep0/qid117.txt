ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of logical entailment ($\Sigma_1 \models \Sigma_2$): Understanding that every dependency in $\Sigma_2$ must be derivable from $\Sigma_1$.
2. Attribute Closure procedure: Knowing how to calculate $X^+$ under a set of functional dependencies.
3. Transitivity rule: Recalling that if $A \to B$ and $B \to C$, then $A \to C$.
4. Evaluation of $A \to C$ in $\Sigma_1$: Checking if $C \in A^+$ using $\Sigma_1$.
5. Evaluation of $B \to C$ in $\Sigma_1$: Checking if $C \in B^+$ using $\Sigma_1$.
6. Logical conjunction: Recognizing that both dependencies in $\Sigma_2$ must hold for the statement to be true.
7. Set differentiation: Maintaining the distinction between the "source" set ($\Sigma_1$) and the "target" set ($\Sigma_2$) without swapping them.
