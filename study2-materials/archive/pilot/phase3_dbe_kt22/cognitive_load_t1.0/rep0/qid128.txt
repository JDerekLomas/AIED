ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Candidate Key (CK) (must uniquely identify the tuple and be minimal).
2. Definition recall: Attribute Closure (computing $X^+$).
3. Functional Dependency (FD) analysis: Evaluating the given set $\Sigma$.
4. Logical heuristic: Identifying "essential" attributes (attributes that never appear on the right-hand side of any FD).
5. Procedure: Checking if $C$ appears on the RHS of $A \to B$, $B \to AD$, or $CD \to AB$.
6. Procedure: Calculating the closure of $(R - \{C\})$ or specifically testing $\{A, B, D\}^+$ to see if $C$ can be derived.
7. Constraint satisfaction: Verifying if $C$ is a "source" attribute that must be included in any starting set to achieve closure $\{A, B, C, D\}$.
