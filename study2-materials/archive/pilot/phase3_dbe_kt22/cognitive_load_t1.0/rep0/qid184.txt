ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The conceptual difference between 'CASCADE' and 'RESTRICT' in the context of authorization.
2. Syntax recognition: Identifying that 'RESTRICT' is a keyword specifically used with the 'REVOKE' statement, not 'GRANT'.
3. Logical mapping: Connecting the goal ("avoid cascading") to the negative constraint behavior of the 'RESTRICT' clause.
4. Distinguishing similar concepts: Differentiating between the command to perform an action (Option D) and the command to prevent the side effect (Option B).
5. Evaluation of distractors: Filtering out fabricated syntax (e.g., "no cascade", "no restrict") that mimics valid SQL patterns.
