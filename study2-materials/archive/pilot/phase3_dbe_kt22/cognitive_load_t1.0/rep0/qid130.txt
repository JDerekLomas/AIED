ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of Lossless Join Property (the intersection must functionally determine one of the schemas).
2. Definition of Dependency Preservation (the union of projected dependencies must be equivalent to the original set).
3. Identification of the intersection of R1 and R2 ($R1 \cap R2 = \{B\}$).
4. Evaluation of the functional dependency $B \to C$ against the intersection $\{B\}$ to satisfy the Lossless Join condition.
5. Identification of local dependencies for R1 ($A \to B$) and R2 ($B \to C$).
6. Logical comparison of the union of local dependencies ($\{A \to B, B \to C\}$) against the original set $\Sigma$ to verify Preservation.
7. Evaluating four multiple-choice combinations of these two independent binary states.
