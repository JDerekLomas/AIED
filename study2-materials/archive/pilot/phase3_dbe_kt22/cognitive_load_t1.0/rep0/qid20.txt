ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of set subtraction (Difference): Recognizing that $T - S$ requires identifying elements in $T$ that are not in $S$.
2. Definition of Cartesian product ($\times$): Understanding that the result must be a set of ordered pairs $(a, b)$.
3. Execution of subtraction: Calculating $\{1, 2, 3\} - \{1, 2\} = \{3\}$.
4. Execution of product: Mapping elements of $S \{1, 2\}$ to the result of the subtraction $\{3\}$.
5. Evaluation of logical constraints: Ensuring the order of the product is $S \times \text{Result}$, not the reverse.
6. Distinction between set types: Differentiating between a flat set of integers (Option A) and a set of tuples (Options B and C).
