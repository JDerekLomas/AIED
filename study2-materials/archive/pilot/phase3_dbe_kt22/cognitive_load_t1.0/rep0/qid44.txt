ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall of "superkey" (attribute set vs. tuple set).
2. Definition recall of "candidate key" (minimality requirement).
3. Logical evaluation of directionality (does the key identify the tuple, or the tuple identify the key?).
4. Distinction between "relation" (the table) and "tuple" (the row).
5. Evaluation of Option A: Matching the definition of uniqueness.
6. Evaluation of Option B: Distinguishing the reversal of "attribute" and "tuple" logic.
7. Evaluation of Option C: Testing the subset relationship (All candidate keys are superkeys, but not vice-versa).
8. Evaluation of Option D: Understanding the scope of keys (internal to a relation vs. external between relations).
