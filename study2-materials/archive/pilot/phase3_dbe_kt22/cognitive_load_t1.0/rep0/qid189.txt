ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Understanding the mechanism of a SQL injection attack (user-controlled input concatenated into a query string).
2. SQL syntax rules: Identifying string delimiters and how they are manipulated in code.
3. Variable tracing: Tracking the source of the `City` variable across different code snippets (input vs. hardcoded).
4. Distinguishing similar concepts: Differentiating between dynamic string concatenation with external input (unsafe) versus internal constants (safe).
5. Evaluation of logical conditions: Comparing the four options to determine which satisfies the "potential" vulnerability criteria.
6. Syntax interpretation: Recognizing the specific pattern of `Request.form` as an external data source.
