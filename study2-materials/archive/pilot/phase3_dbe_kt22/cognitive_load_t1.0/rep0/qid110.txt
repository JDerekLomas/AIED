ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall of the definition of attribute closure ($X^+$).
2. Recognition of the set of attributes $R$ and initial set $\{A\}$.
3. Evaluation of FD1 ($A \to B$): checking if the LHS is a subset of the current closure.
4. Set union operation: adding $\{B\}$ to the closure.
5. Evaluation of FD2 ($B \to C$): checking if the LHS is now a subset of the expanded closure.
6. Set union operation: adding $\{C\}$ to the closure.
7. Evaluation of FD3 ($D \to ABC$): determining that $\{D\}$ is not in the current closure and the rule cannot be triggered.
8. Termination condition: verifying no more changes occur to the set $\{A, B, C\}$.
