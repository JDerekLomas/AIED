As a university instructor, I evaluate this question as having **moderate element interactivity**. While the question is multiple-choice, it requires more than simple rote recall; the student must map the hierarchical relationship between normal forms and navigate logical implications (If P, then Q).

For many South African undergraduate students, the challenge lies in the transition from memorizing definitions to understanding the "nested" nature of database normalization theory.

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **Definition Recall (3NF):** Recalling the criteria for Third Normal Form (transitive dependencies).
2.  **Definition Recall (BCNF):** Recalling the criteria for Boyce-Codd Normal Form (determinants must be superkeys).
3.  **Hierarchy Logic:** Understanding the subset/superset relationship (BCNF is a stricter version of 3NF).
4.  **Logical Implication (If/Then):** Evaluating the direction of the conditional statement (sufficiency vs. necessity).
5.  **Distinction/Elimination:** Distinguishing between "must be" (necessity) and "cannot be" (exclusivity) to rule out distractors C and D.

**ELEMENT COUNT:** 5

**Estimated proportion of correct answers:**
The question is a "classic" check for understanding. Stronger students will immediately recognize BCNF as the more restrictive set. However, a significant portion of the cohort often reverses the logic (thinking 3NF implies BCNF because 3NF is more commonly discussed) or gets tripped up by the abstract phrasing. In a typical diverse South African CS classroom, roughly 60-65% usually grasp this foundational theory correctly under exam conditions.

Your estimate:
