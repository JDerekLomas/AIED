ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of equivalence for sets of functional dependencies (mutual entailment).
2. The transitive rule of inference (Armstrong's Axioms) to evaluate if A → C can be derived from Σ1.
3. The process of computing the closure of attributes (specifically A+) under Σ2 to check if A → B is missing.
4. Distinguishing between "equivalent" (covers each other) and "implied by" (one-way).
5. Evaluation of logical conditions: Checking if Σ1 ⊨ Σ2 AND Σ2 ⊨ Σ1.
6. Recalling that for equivalence, every dependency in Σ1 must be in Σ2+ and vice versa.
