ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of a Cartesian product (pairing elements from two sets).
2. Calculation of the set (A x A): {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}.
3. Calculation of the set (C x C): {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)}.
4. Definition of the subset symbol (⊆) as a logical condition (every element in the first must exist in the second).
5. Evaluation of membership for each ordered pair from (A x A) within (C x C).
6. Recognition/Filtering of "noise" variables (Sets B and D are irrelevant to the specific expression).
