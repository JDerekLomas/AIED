ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of a Set (understanding A, B, C, D as collections of elements).
2. Definition of the Cartesian Product (recognizing that $A \times B$ results in a set of ordered pairs).
3. Definition of the Subset relationship ($\subseteq$).
4. Structural comparison: Distinguishing between a set of atomic elements (integers in $A$) and a set of ordered pairs (tuples in $A \times B$).
5. Evaluating the logical truth value of the inclusion statement based on the type mismatch.
