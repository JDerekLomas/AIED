ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall of set theory notation and terminology (cardinality symbols | |, intersection ∩, union U).
2. Recall of the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion formula: |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|.
3. Retrieval of specific values from the problem statement (|A|=10, |B|=5, |A∩B|=2).
4. Application of the logical relationship (adding the two sets while accounting for the overlap to avoid double-counting).
5. Arithmetic execution (10 + 5 - 2).

ELEMENT COUNT: 5

The success rate is likely high because this is a foundational discrete mathematics concept required for database prerequisites, though a small percentage may confuse the union/intersection symbols or forget to subtract the intersection.
