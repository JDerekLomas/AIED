ELEMENTS:
1. **SQL Syntax Recognition**: Identifying the structure of a correlated subquery and the `EXISTS` operator.
2. **Schema Mapping**: Understanding the relationship between the `Course` and `Enrol` tables via the `CourseNo` foreign key.
3. **Logical Condition (EXISTS)**: Recalling that `EXISTS` returns true if the subquery returns *at least one* row, regardless of how many matches exist in the child table.
4. **Correlation Logic**: Processing the row-by-row evaluation where the inner query depends on the current row of the outer query.
5. **Set Deduction**: Identifying that the result set size equals the number of *distinct* courses that appear in the enrollment table.
6. **Data Processing/Counting**: Mentally (or physically) filtering the `Course` table against the `Enrol` table data provided in the schema context (assuming the students have the table instances available).
7. **Distinction between Joins and Subqueries**: Avoiding the common pitfall of counting the total number of rows in a JOIN (11) versus the filtered rows in the parent table.
