ELEMENTS:
1. SQL Syntax Recognition: Identifying the `PRIMARY KEY` and `FOREIGN KEY...REFERENCES` keywords.
2. Definition Recall: Recalling the formal definition and purpose of Referential Integrity.
3. Logical Directionality: Distinguishing that the constraint applies from the child table (`Enrol`) to the parent table (`Student`), rather than vice versa (distinguishing A from B).
4. Table Relationship Mapping: Identifying `Student` as the parent and `Enrol` as the child based on the schema structure.
5. Distinction of Concepts: Differentiating between Entity Integrity (Primary Key/Nulls) and Referential Integrity (Foreign Keys) to eliminate options C and D.
6. Evaluation of Conditions: Mapping the specific column `StudentID` across both table definitions to verify the link.
