ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The Two-Phase Locking (2PL) protocol rules (Growing Phase vs. Shrinking Phase).
2. Logical evaluation of Option A: Understanding the "no new locks after first release" constraint (the Shrinking Phase rule).
3. Logical evaluation of Option B: Understanding the behavior of Strict 2PL versus Basic 2PL regarding commit-time release.
4. Logical evaluation of Option C: Understanding "Conservative 2PL" (Static 2PL) as a valid variation of the protocol.
5. Integration: Evaluating "All of the above" by determining if A, B, and C are mutually exclusive or different valid configurations/properties of the 2PL family.
6. Distinction: Differentiating between the general requirements of 2PL and specific optimizations/variations (Basic, Strict, Conservative).
