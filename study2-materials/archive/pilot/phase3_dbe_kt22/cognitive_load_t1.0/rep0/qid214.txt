ELEMENTS:
1. SQL Syntax Recall: Understanding `UPDATE`, `SET`, and `WHERE` clauses.
2. Transaction Control Logic: Understanding the sequential nature of `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`.
3. ACID Properties (Atomicity/Durability): Recognizing that a `COMMIT` permanently persists changes to the database.
4. Logical State Evaluation: Identifying that once a transaction is committed, the "active" transaction context ends or is finalized.
5. Concept Distinction: Distinguishing between a `ROLLBACK` that occurs *before* a commit (which reverts changes) versus a `ROLLBACK` called *after* a commit (which has no target transaction to undo).
