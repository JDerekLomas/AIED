ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) and its specific constraints regarding functional dependencies.
2. Definition of 3NF (Third Normal Form) and its allowance for prime attributes on the right-hand side.
3. Concept of "Uniqueness" in the context of decomposition (recognizing that multiple valid covers or synthesis paths exist).
4. Concept of "Lossless-join" property and how it applies to decomposition algorithms.
5. Concept of "Dependency-preservation" and the fundamental theoretical trade-off between BCNF and 3NF.
6. Recall of the 3NF Synthesis Algorithm (which guarantees both losslessness and dependency preservation).
7. Recall of the BCNF Decomposition Algorithm (and the knowledge that it may sacrifice dependency preservation).
8. Distinguishing between the existential claim ("There exists an algorithm") and the universal property ("is always").
