ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Distinction between "Entity" (a thing) and "Attribute" (a property).
2. Distinction: Differentiating between a subclass/category (Trainer, Technician) and its specific properties (Employee ID).
3. Logic: Evaluating the relationship between Associate Member and its identifiers (name/number).
4. Analysis: Determining if "Fitness class" is a standalone object with multiple properties (name, dates, slots) or a single property.
5. Analysis: Determining if "Fitness centre" is the system boundary or a specific data property.
6. Filtering: Parsing a large paragraph of irrelevant operational constraints (maintenance frequency, phone numbers) to find the specific descriptors for "Employee".
