ELEMENTS:
1. **Cartesian Product (Cross Join) logic**: Recognizing that referencing two tables in the FROM clause without a modern JOIN keyword implies a product that must be filtered.
2. **Equi-join condition**: Understanding the primary-key/foreign-key relationship (Course.CourseNo = Enrol.CourseNo) used to filter the product.
3. **Filtering constraint**: Applying the specific attribute filter (Year = 2018).
4. **Mental Model of Schema**: Inferring the relationship between a 'Course' and its 'Enrolments' (one-to-many).
5. **Set Cardinality Calculation**: Simultaneously applying the join and the year filter to the (unseen) underlying data set to arrive at a count.
6. **SQL Syntax Interpretation**: Recalling the order of execution (FROM -> WHERE -> SELECT).
