ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of a view as a virtual table derived from a query.
2. Recall of the SQL GRANT/REVOKE security model for derived objects.
3. Distinction between base table privileges and view-specific privileges.
4. Evaluation of the "Updatability" constraint (rules governing when a view can be modified, e.g., no joins, no aggregations).
5. Logical evaluation of universal quantifiers ("always") vs. conditional scenarios.
6. Distinction between "Select" and "Update" privilege inheritance.
7. Understanding that privilege assignment on views is limited by the creator's own permissions on underlying schemas.
