ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of logical entailment ($\Sigma \vDash \sigma$): Understanding that $\Sigma_2 \vDash \Sigma_1$ means all dependencies in $\Sigma_1$ must be derivable from $\Sigma_2$ using Armstrong's Axioms or closure algorithms.
2. Definition of Functional Dependency (FD): Recalling what $X \to Y$ represents in a relation.
3. Attribute Closure Algorithm: The step-by-step procedure to calculate $A^+$ under $\Sigma_2$.
4. Evaluation of Condition 1: Checking if $A \to B$ holds in $\Sigma_2$ (Calculating $A^+$ under $\{A \to C, B \to C\}$ results in $\{A, C\}$, which does not include $B$).
5. Evaluation of Condition 2: Checking if $B \to C$ holds in $\Sigma_2$ (This is a direct match).
6. Logical Conjunction/Quantification: Realizing that for the set $\Sigma_1$ to be entailed, *every* dependency within it must be satisfied.
7. Distinction between Equivalence and Entailment: Ensuring the student doesn't confuse $\Sigma_1 \equiv \Sigma_2$ with the one-way entailment $\Sigma_2 \vDash \Sigma_1$.
