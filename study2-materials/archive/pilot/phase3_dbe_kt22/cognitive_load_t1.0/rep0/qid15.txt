ELEMENTS:
1. Recall and apply the Union (∪) operation (combining A and C).
2. Recall and apply the Proper Subset (⊂) operation definition.
3. Mentally store or track the result of (A ∪ C), which is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
4. Evaluate the logical relationship: checking if every element in the union result is in Set B.
5. Identify the "proper" constraint (the subset cannot be equal to the superset).
6. Compare the cardinalities (Set B is smaller than the union, making the statement immediately false).
