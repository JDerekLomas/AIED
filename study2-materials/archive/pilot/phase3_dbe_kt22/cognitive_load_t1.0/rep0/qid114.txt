ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Understanding what a Super Key (SK) is (a set of attributes whose closure contains all attributes in R).
2. Functional Dependency (FD) syntax: Interpreting the meaning of the arrows in $\Sigma$.
3. Closure procedure: Knowing the algorithmic steps to compute $D^+$.
4. Logical evaluation (Step 1): Applying $D \to ABC$ to find $\{A, B, C, D\}$.
5. Set comparison: Checking if the resulting closure $\{A, B, C, D\}$ matches the schema $R = \{A, B, C, D\}$.
6. Distinction: Differentiating between a Super Key (any set that determines all) and a Candidate Key (a minimal super key), ensuring the question only asks for SK status.
