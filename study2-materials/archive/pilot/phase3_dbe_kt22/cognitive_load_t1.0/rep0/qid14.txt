ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of a Cartesian Product ($A \times B$): Understanding that the first element of each tuple belongs to set $A$ and the second to set $B$.
2. Set Extraction (Set A): Identifying the distinct first coordinates from the given tuples $\{2, 3, 4\}$.
3. Set Extraction (Set B): Identifying the distinct second coordinates from the given tuples $\{5, 7\}$.
4. Cardinality Constraint: Verifying that $|A| \times |B| = 3 \times 2 = 6$, matching the problem statement.
5. Systematic Generation: Constructing the full set of ordered pairs by combining every element of $A$ with every element of $B$.
6. Pattern Matching: Comparing the generated set $\{(2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7)\}$ against the provided multiple-choice options to identify Option C.
