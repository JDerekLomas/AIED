ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Understanding the formal requirements of a "key attribute" (uniqueness and non-nullity).
2. Distinction: Distinguishing between an attribute that *must* be unique by business rule vs. one that is unique only by coincidence.
3. Logical condition (Entity context): Identifying that "Phone number" for technicians is not specified as unique, whereas equipment IDs are.
4. Logical condition (Temporal/Composite): Evaluating if "Date of maintenance" can uniquely identify an event (it cannot, as multiple pieces of equipment can be maintained on the same day).
5. Logical condition (Ambiguity/Overlap): Recognizing that "Name of employee" is insufficient for a key because the prompt explicitly mentions "unique IDs" for employees.
6. Constraint evaluation (Domain rule): Processing the specific business rule: "No two fitness classes have the same daily time slot."
7. Table relationships: Understanding the "Class" entity's attributes to determine if the time slot functions as a natural key within that specific entity context.
