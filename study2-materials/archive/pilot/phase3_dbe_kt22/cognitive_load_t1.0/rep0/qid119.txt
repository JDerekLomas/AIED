ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The concept of "equivalence" in functional dependencies (Σ1 ≡ Σ2 iff Σ1⁺ = Σ2⁺).
2. Procedural knowledge: Computing the closure of attributes under a set of dependencies.
3. Logical evaluation (Σ1 ⊆ Σ2): Checking if A→B and AB→C can be derived from {A→B, B→C}.
4. Logical evaluation (Σ2 ⊆ Σ1): Checking if A→B and B→C can be derived from {A→B, AB→C}.
5. SQL/Relational Logic: Distinguishing between simple dependencies (A→B) and composite/transitive ones (AB→C vs B→C).
6. Working memory: Holding the specific mappings of Σ1 while processing Σ2 to prevent interference.
7. Augmentation/Transitivity rules: Applying Armstrong's Axioms (specifically realizing that if A→B, then AB is functionally equivalent to A, making AB→C and A→C equivalent).
