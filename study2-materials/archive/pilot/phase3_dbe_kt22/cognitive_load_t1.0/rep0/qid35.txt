ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of Cartesian product (understanding how to form ordered pairs from sets A and B).
2. Construction of set A x B (generating the set of 4 ordered pairs).
3. Construction of set C x D (generating the set of 9 ordered pairs).
4. Definition of subset (understanding that every element in the first set must exist in the second).
5. Comparing elements of A x B against C x D (checking if {1,a}, {1,b}, {2,a}, {2,b} are present in the larger set).
6. Set notation/membership (handling the abstract mapping of integers and characters within the same structure).
