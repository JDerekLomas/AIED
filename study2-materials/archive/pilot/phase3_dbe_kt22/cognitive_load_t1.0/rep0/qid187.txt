ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of DAC (Discretionary Access Control) core mechanism (identity-based vs. role-based).
2. Understanding of the "Discretionary" nature (the ability of a user to pass permissions to others).
3. Concept of a Trojan Horse in the context of access control (unauthorized data flow via an authorized user's program).
4. Distinguishing between identity-based access (DAC) and attribute/role-based access (RBAC/MAC) to eliminate distractors.
5. Evaluating logical conditions in the options (matching the correct mechanism to the correct vulnerability).
