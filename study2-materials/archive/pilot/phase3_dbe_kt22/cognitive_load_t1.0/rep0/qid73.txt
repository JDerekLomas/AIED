ELEMENTS:
1. SQL Syntax Recall: Understanding the `SELECT` structure and the specific behavior of aggregate functions (`COUNT` and `MIN`).
2. Table Data Retrieval: Locating and isolating the specific "units" column within the "Study" table.
3. Logical Evaluation of `COUNT(units)`: Remembering that `COUNT(column_name)` excludes NULL values (unlike `COUNT(*)`).
4. Logical Evaluation of `MIN(units)`: Identifying the smallest numerical value within the specific data set.
5. Procedural Step/Ordering: Maintaining the correct sequence of results (COUNT first, MIN second) to match the options.
6. Working Memory Constraint: Holding the calculated values for both functions simultaneously to compare against the multiple-choice distractors.
