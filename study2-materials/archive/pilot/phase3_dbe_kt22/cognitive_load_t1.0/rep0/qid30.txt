ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of Cartesian product (understanding how to pair elements from two sets).
2. Definition of Set Difference (understanding that elements of the second set are removed from the first).
3. Recall of Set A elements {1, 2}.
4. Recall of Set B elements {a, b}.
5. Recall of Set C elements {1, 2, 3}.
6. Recall of Set D elements {a, b, c}.
7. Execution of (C x D): Mental construction or visualization of a 9-element set.
8. Execution of (A x B): Mental construction of a 4-element set.
9. Logical comparison: Identifying the intersection (overlap) between the two generated sets.
10. Final subtraction: Filtering the 9-element set to arrive at the 5-element result.
