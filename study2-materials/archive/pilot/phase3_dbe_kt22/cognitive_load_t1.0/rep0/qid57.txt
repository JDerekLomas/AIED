As a university instructor, I would classify this as a low-complexity retrieval task. It tests basic vocabulary recognition rather than relational logic or procedural execution.

ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall (Definition of the projection operation in SQL).
2. Distinction between similar concepts (Differentiating DQL from DDL/DML commands).
3. SQL syntax rules (Identifying the role of a clause within a standard query block).

ELEMENT COUNT: 3

Most students, even those with minimal prior exposure, encounter this in the first week of lectures. The error margin usually accounts for students who confuse "Select" with "Update" or who are still acclimating to technical English.

Your estimate:
0.92
