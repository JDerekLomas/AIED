ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of a Candidate Key (identifying that {A} is the only key for R).
2. Definition of Prime vs. Non-prime attributes (A is prime; B and C are non-prime).
3. 3NF Definition/Rule (checking if $A \to BC$ violates 3NF; it doesn't because A is a superkey).
4. BCNF Definition/Rule (checking if $A \to BC$ violates BCNF; it doesn't because A is a superkey).
5. Evaluation of the specific FD ($A \to BC$) against both sets of constraints simultaneously.
6. Logical elimination of the four multiple-choice combinations based on the results of steps 3 and 4.
