ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of Set Notation: Recognizing the representation of elements within curly braces.
2. Definition of Cartesian Product (x): Understanding that the operator produces a set of ordered pairs.
3. Mapping Procedure: The systematic process of pairing each element of the first set with each element of the second set (1 with 1, 1 with 2, 2 with 1, 2 with 2).
4. Distinguishing Identifiers: Differentiating between Set S and Set T to ensure the operation uses S twice (S x S) rather than S x T.
5. Notation for Ordered Pairs: Recognizing that the result must be contained in parentheses (x, y) rather than a flat list of integers.
