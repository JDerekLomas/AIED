ELEMENTS:
1. Recall and application of the **Lossless Join Theorem** (checking if $R_1 \cap R_2$ forms a superkey for $R_1$ or $R_2$).
2. Recall and application of the **Dependency Preservation** definition (checking if the union of projected dependencies $(\Sigma_1 \cup \Sigma_2)^+$ equals $\Sigma^+$).
3. Evaluating the **Closure of Attribute** $\{A\}$ with respect to the functional dependency set $\Sigma$.
4. Identifying the **Candidate Keys** of the original relation $R$.
5. Determining the **Projected Dependencies** for $R_1$ (mapping $A \to B$ to $R_1$).
6. Determining the **Projected Dependencies** for $R_2$ (mapping $A \to C$ to $R_2$).
7. Identifying the **Missing Dependency** ($B \to C$) and checking if it is implied by the union of the projected sets (logical evaluation of transitivity across decomposed schemas).
