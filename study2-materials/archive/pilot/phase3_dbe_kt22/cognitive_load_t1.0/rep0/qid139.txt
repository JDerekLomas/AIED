ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The formal definition of Boyee-Codd Normal Form (BCNF).
2. Definition recall: The formal definition of Third Normal Form (3NF).
3. Concept distinction: The hierarchical relationship between 3NF and BCNF (BCNF is stricter/stronger than 3NF).
4. Logical evaluation: Assessing the impact of functional dependencies on data redundancy.
5. Constraint satisfaction: Understanding that BCNF specifically targets redundancy caused by functional dependencies, but cannot eliminate all forms of redundancy (such as those caused by multi-valued dependencies).
