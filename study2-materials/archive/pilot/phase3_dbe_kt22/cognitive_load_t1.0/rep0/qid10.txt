ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Set Intersection (finding common elements between A and B).
2. Definition recall: Set Difference (removing elements of one set from another).
3. Memory retrieval: Values within Set A.
4. Memory retrieval: Values within Set B.
5. Execution of step 1: Identifying {4, 5} as the intersection.
6. Execution of step 2: Subtracting the intersection from A ({2, 3, 4, 5} - {4, 5}).
7. Maintenance of order of operations: Ensuring the parentheses are processed before the difference.
8. Constraint satisfaction: Distinguishing Set C and Set D as irrelevant distractors to avoid cognitive overload.
