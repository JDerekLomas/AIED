ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Set notation and membership (identifying the elements within brackets).
2. Definition recall: The Union operator ($\cup$) and the procedure for combining sets.
3. Logical operation: Performing the union of A and B to form a resultant set.
4. Definition recall: The Proper Subset operator ($\subset$) and its specific requirement (B must be contained in the result, but not equal to it).
5. Comparison/Evaluation: Checking if every element of B is in $(A \cup B)$ and verifying if there is at least one element in $(A \cup B)$ not in B.
6. Distinction: Distinguishing between a subset ($\subseteq$) and a proper subset ($\subset$) to ensure the condition of "not equal" is met.
