ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of attribute closure ($X^+$).
2. The initial set of attributes (starting with $D$).
3. Evaluation of FD 1 ($A \to B$): checking if $A$ is in the current set.
4. Evaluation of FD 2 ($B \to C$): checking if $B$ is in the current set.
5. Evaluation of FD 3 ($D \to ABC$): checking if $D$ is in the current set.
6. The union operation (adding $A, B, C$ to the set).
7. Iterative processing (re-checking FDs until no more attributes can be added).
8. Comparing the final set $\{D, A, B, C\}$ to the multiple-choice options.
