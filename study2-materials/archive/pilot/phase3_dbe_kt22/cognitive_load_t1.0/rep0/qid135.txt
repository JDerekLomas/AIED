ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of a Candidate Key (finding all attributes that functionally determine R).
2. Closure calculation (computing $\{A\}^+$ and $\{BC\}^+$ to verify keys).
3. Identification of Prime Attributes (attributes that are part of any candidate key).
4. Definition of 3NF (checking if every FD $X \to Y$ is such that $X$ is a superkey or $Y$ is prime).
5. Definition of BCNF (checking if every FD $X \to Y$ is such that $X$ is a superkey).
6. Evaluating $A \to BC$ against BCNF/3NF criteria.
7. Evaluating $BC \to A$ against BCNF/3NF criteria.
8. Logical synthesis (combining evaluations of both FDs to select the correct intersection of normal forms).
