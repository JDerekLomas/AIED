1. Definition of Cartesian product (understanding how to form ordered pairs from sets).
2. Definition of the subset relation ($\subseteq$) and its logical requirements.
3. Elements of set A (recall/holding $\{1, 2\}$).
4. Elements of set C (recall/holding $\{1, 2, 3\}$).
5. Evaluation of $A \times A$ (generating the set of 4 ordered pairs).
6. Evaluation of $A \times C$ (generating the set of 6 ordered pairs).
7. Comparison logic (verifying if every pair in the first set exists in the second set).
