ELEMENTS:
1. SQL Syntax Recall: Structure of a SELECT statement with a GROUP BY clause.
2. Table Identification: Differentiating between the `Enrol` and `Student` tables based on where enrolment data and `CourseNo` would logically reside.
3. Column Selection: Identifying the correct attributes (`CourseNo` vs `StudentID`) to return.
4. Filtering Logic: Applying the `WHERE` clause condition for the specific year (2019).
5. Aggregation Logic: Understanding that `COUNT(*)` counts rows per group.
6. Grouping Constraint: The crucial rule that non-aggregated columns in the SELECT list must match the columns in the GROUP BY clause.
7. Distractor Discrimination: Simultaneously evaluating the mismatch between `CourseNo` in the SELECT and `StudentID` in the GROUP BY (Option B).
