ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) requirements regarding functional dependencies.
2. Definition of Third Normal Form (3NF) requirements regarding functional dependencies.
3. The concept of "Dependency Preservation" (the ability to recover all FDs from the decomposed relations).
4. Recall of the specific theorem/property: 3NF decomposition guarantees both lossless join and dependency preservation.
5. Recall of the specific property: BCNF decomposition guarantees lossless join but *cannot* always guarantee dependency preservation.
6. Logical evaluation of universal quantifiers ("always") vs. existential possibilities ("cannot").
7. Distinguishing between the trade-offs of 3NF (preserves dependencies, may have redundancy) vs. BCNF (no redundancy, may lose dependencies).
