ELEMENTS:
1. Identifying the visual representation of Set A.
2. Identifying the visual representation of Set B.
3. Recalling the definition of Union (U).
4. Recalling the definition of Intersection (∩).
5. Recalling the definition of Set Difference/Relative Complement (–).
6. Evaluating the spatial overlap of the shaded area (specifically, elements in A or B but not both).
7. Mentally testing Option B by combining the union and removing the intersection (multi-step logical procedure).
8. Distinguishing between the shaded area and the standard intersection (Option D) or single set difference (Option C).
