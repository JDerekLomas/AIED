ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The formal definition of Third Normal Form (3NF) regarding transitive dependencies.
2. Definition recall: The formal definition of Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) regarding determinants being superkeys.
3. Comparative hierarchy: Understanding the nested relationship between normal forms (1NF ⊂ 2NF ⊂ 3NF ⊂ BCNF).
4. Conceptual distinction: Differentiating between "minimizing" and "eliminating" redundancy (specifically that 3NF allows certain redundancies that BCNF resolves).
5. Evaluation of logical quantifiers: Assessing the truth values of "more restrictive" vs "less restrictive" in the context of schema constraints.
