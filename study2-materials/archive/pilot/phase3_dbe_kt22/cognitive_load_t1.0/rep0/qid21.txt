ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of Cartesian Product ($S \times T$): Recalling that it results in all ordered pairs $(s, t)$.
2. Definition of Cartesian Product ($S \times S$): Recognizing the same set used as both operands.
3. Execution of $S \times T$: Generating the set $\{(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\}$.
4. Execution of $S \times S$: Generating the set $\{(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\}$.
5. Definition of Set Difference ($- \text{ or } \setminus$): Recalling that elements in the second set must be removed from the first.
6. Evaluation/Filtering: Simultaneously comparing the two generated sets to identify which pairs in $S \times T$ are not present in $S \times S$.
7. Distinction between elements: Distinguishing between pairs like $(1,2)$ and $(1,3)$ to ensure correct subtraction.
