ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) model (distinguishing between subjects, roles, and permissions).
2. Distinction between "Resources" (objects) and "Departments/Functions" (potential roles).
3. Evaluation of logical mapping: Identifying that roles represent job functions/departments rather than the resources themselves or the hardware (workstations).
4. Filtering irrelevant information: Disregarding the "workstation" and "resource types" as candidates for the role entity in this specific organizational context.
5. Application of the Principle of Least Privilege: Recognizing that access is grouped by department function to satisfy the RBAC definition.
