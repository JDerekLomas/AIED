ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of "Minimal Cover" (Canonical Cover) requirements: (a) implication $\Sigma_1 \equiv \Sigma_2$, (b) no redundant dependencies, (c) no redundant attributes (left-hand side).
2. Definition recall of "Equivalence" ($\Sigma_1 \equiv \Sigma_2$ means $\Sigma_1^+ = \Sigma_2^+$).
3. Logical evaluation of functional dependency (FD) implication: Does $\Sigma_1 \models A \to C$? (Using transitivity: $A \to B$ and $AB \to C$ implies $A \to C$ because $A \to AB$).
4. Logical evaluation of reverse implication: Does $\Sigma_2 \models AB \to C$? (Using augmentation or decomposition).
5. Evaluation of "Minimality" (Step 1): Checking for extraneous attributes in $\Sigma_1$. Specifically, identifying that in $AB \to C$, attribute $B$ is extraneous because $A \to B$.
6. Comparison of sets: Identifying that after reducing $AB \to C$ to $A \to C$, $\Sigma_1$ becomes $\{A \to B, A \to C\}$, which is identical to $\Sigma_2$.
7. Distinction between "equivalent sets" and "minimal cover" status.
