ELEMENTS:
1. SQL Syntax Recall: Identifying the structure of a `SELECT` statement and the specific behavior of the `UNION` operator (distinct vs. all).
2. Table Data Analysis: Scanning the `Study` table to identify rows matching `CourseNo='COMP2400'`.
3. Table Data Analysis: Scanning the `Study` table to identify rows matching `CourseNo='STAT2001'`.
4. Logic/Set Operations: Identifying the overlapping `StudentID` values (intersection) present in both result sets.
5. Constraint Satisfaction: Applying the `UNION` rule to eliminate duplicate rows from the final count.
6. Mental Calculation: Summing the unique entries to arrive at the final integer.
