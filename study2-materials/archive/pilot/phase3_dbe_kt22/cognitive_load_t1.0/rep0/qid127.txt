ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Definition of a "prime attribute" (an attribute that is part of at least one candidate key).
2. Definition recall: Definition of a "candidate key" (a minimal superkey).
3. Logical evaluation: Applying the Transitive Property/Closure rules to the given FDs (A→B, B→C, C→A).
4. Analytical procedure: Determining all candidate keys for relation R (finding that {A}, {B}, and {C} are all individual candidate keys due to the cyclic nature of the dependencies).
5. Constraint satisfaction: Checking if each attribute (A, B, and C) belongs to at least one of the identified candidate keys.
6. Evaluation: Determining the truth value of the statement based on the synthesis of the above steps.
