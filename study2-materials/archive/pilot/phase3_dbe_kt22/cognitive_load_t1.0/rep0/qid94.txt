ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of "Entity Type" versus "Attribute" or "Relationship".
2. Recognition of the Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) specialization/generalization hierarchy (Employee as the supertype for trainers, admins, and technicians).
3. Distinguishing between a multi-valued attribute (status type) and a distinct entity.
4. Distinguishing between a weak entity (maintenance event/report) and its parent entities.
5. Evaluating the cardinality/uniqueness constraint of "Time slot" to determine if it is an attribute of a "Class" entity or a standalone entity.
6. Processing the complex narrative to map "Employee" to the shared attributes (ID, Name, Address) across all subtypes.
7. Filtering out irrelevant constraints (start/end date logic, landline vs. mobile phone numbers) that act as "noise" in the problem statement.
