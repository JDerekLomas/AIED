ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of a Candidate Key (CK): Must be both a superkey and minimal.
2. Definition recall of Functional Dependencies (FDs) and the closure algorithm ($X^+$).
3. Logic of attribute closure: Computing $A^+$ using $\Sigma$.
4. Evaluation of first FD: $\{A\} \rightarrow B$ (yields $\{A, B\}$).
5. Evaluation of second FD: $\{AB\} \rightarrow C$ (requires $A$ and $B$ to be present to derive $C$).
6. Logical synthesis: $\{A, B, C\}$ contains all attributes of $R$, confirming $A$ is a superkey.
7. Minimality check: Since $A$ is a single attribute, it has no proper subsets to check (trivial minimality).
8. Validation of the final truth value against the statement.
