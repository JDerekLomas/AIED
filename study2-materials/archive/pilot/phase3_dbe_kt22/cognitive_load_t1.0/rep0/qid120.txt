ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of equivalence for sets of Functional Dependencies (FDs) (Σ1 ≡ Σ2 iff Σ1⁺ = Σ2⁺).
2. Armstrong’s Axioms/Inference rules (specifically Transitivity and Decomposition/Union).
3. The attribute closure algorithm (computing A⁺ under Σ1).
4. The attribute closure algorithm (computing A⁺ under Σ2).
5. Evaluation of Σ2 under Σ1: Checking if Σ1 implies A → C (given A → B and AB → C).
6. Evaluation of Σ1 under Σ2: Checking if Σ2 implies AB → C (given A → C).
7. Comparison of the resultant sets/closures to determine logical equivalence.
