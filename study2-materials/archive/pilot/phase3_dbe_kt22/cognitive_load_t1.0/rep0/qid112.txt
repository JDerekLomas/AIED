ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall: Understanding the notation $\Sigma \models X \to Y$ (logical implication in functional dependencies).
2. Rule retrieval: Recalling Armstrong’s Axioms (specifically the Transitivity rule).
3. Logical evaluation: Identifying the chain $A \to B$ and $B \to C$ from the given set $\Sigma$.
4. Inference application: Combining the two dependencies to derive $A \to C$.
5. Distinction: Recognizing that the third dependency ($D \to ABC$) is irrelevant noise for this specific derivation.
