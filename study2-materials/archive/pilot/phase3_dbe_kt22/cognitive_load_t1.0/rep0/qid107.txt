ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Understanding the concept of a "key attribute" (uniqueness and minimality).
2. Entity recognition: Identifying the "administrator" entity within the narrative.
3. Attribute mapping: Connecting specific attributes (Landline, Address, ID, Name) to the administrator entity.
4. Inheritance/Generalization logic: Recognizing that administrators are a sub-category of "employees" and thus inherit the "unique ID" mentioned in the first sentence.
5. Constraint evaluation: Filtering out "Landline number" as a potential key despite it being specific to administrators (as it is not explicitly defined as unique in the text).
6. Distinguishing noise: Filtering out irrelevant information about trainers, technicians, members, and equipment.
