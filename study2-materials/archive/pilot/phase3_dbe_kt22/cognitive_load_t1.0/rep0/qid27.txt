ELEMENTS:
1. Identifying set labels (A, B, C) and their spatial boundaries in the Venn diagram.
2. Recalling the definition of Union (∪) as the combination of sets.
3. Recalling the definition of Intersection (∩) as the shared region.
4. Recalling the definition of Set Difference (–) as the exclusion of elements.
5. Evaluating the order of operations/parentheses (logical grouping).
6. Mental mapping of Option A: Combining A and C, then subtracting the entire circle B.
7. Mental mapping of Option B: Starting with B and subtracting A and C (identifying it results in the opposite of the shaded area).
8. Mental mapping of Option C: Identifying the triple intersection (the center only).
9. Mental mapping of Option D: Complex multi-step exclusion (A union C, then removing two specific intersections).
10. Comparative elimination: Holding the visual target in memory while testing each logical expression against it.
