ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The formal definition of a "trivial" functional dependency ($X \to Y$ is trivial if $Y \subseteq X$).
2. Syntax recognition: Interpreting the arrow notation ($\to$) and concatenation of attributes (XY, XYZ).
3. Set inclusion evaluation: Comparing the right-hand side (RHS) attributes against the left-hand side (LHS) attributes for Option A.
4. Set inclusion evaluation: Comparing the RHS attributes against the LHS attributes for Option B.
5. Set inclusion evaluation: Comparing the RHS attributes against the LHS attributes for Option C.
6. Set inclusion evaluation: Comparing the RHS attributes against the LHS attributes for Option D.
7. Discrimination/Logic: Identifying which specific case satisfies the subset condition while rejecting those that add new information.
