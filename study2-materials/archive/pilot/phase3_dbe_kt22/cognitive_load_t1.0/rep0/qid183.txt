ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Mechanics of SQL injection (concatenation/lack of sanitization).
2. Definition recall: Potential impact and privilege exploitation of an attack.
3. Logical evaluation: The causal relationship between privilege management and prevention (distinguishing between "mitigation of impact" vs. "prevention of the vulnerability").
4. Distinction: Sanitization/parameterization (true prevention) versus Least Privilege (security-in-depth).
5. SQL Syntax/Structure: Understanding how "commands" are executed in a database context.
6. Negative phrasing constraint: Filtering for "not correct" while evaluating three individual truth claims.
7. Logic of "None of the above" in a "Which is not correct" format (double negative logic).
