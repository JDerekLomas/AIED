ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Distinction between "Partial" and "Total" participation constraints (Optional vs. Mandatory).
2. Entity identification: Locating the "Member" and "Fitness Class" entities within a dense narrative.
3. Relationship isolation: Identifying the specific "Participate" relationship amidst multiple other interactions (register, personal trainer, associate members).
4. Logical evaluation: Analyzing the phrase "A member **may** choose to participate in one or more fitness classes" to determine if every member must participate.
5. Filtering irrelevant constraints: Disregarding unrelated information (ISA hierarchies for employees, equipment status, technician maintenance, administrator approvals).
6. Distinguishing roles: Separating the "Member" entity from the "Associate Member" entity and their respective rules.
