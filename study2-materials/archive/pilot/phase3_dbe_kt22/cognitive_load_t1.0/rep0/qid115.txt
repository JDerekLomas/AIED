ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall of definition: Functional Dependency (FD) and Logical Entailment ($\Sigma \models X \to Y$).
2. Recall of procedure: Attribute Closure algorithm ($D^+$).
3. Initialization: Starting the set with the left-hand side attribute $\{D\}$.
4. Rule application (Step 1): Identifying that $D \to ABC$ applies to the current set.
5. Set Union: Expanding the set to $\{D, A, B, C\}$.
6. Logical Evaluation: Checking if the target right-hand side $\{A, C\}$ is a subset of the resulting closure.
7. Distinguishing notation: Understanding that $AC$ is shorthand for $\{A, C\}$.
8. Transitivity recognition: Recognizing that while $B \to C$ exists, it is redundant if $D \to ABC$ is already processed.
