ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall: Candidate Key (uniqueness and minimality).
2. Definition recall: Functional Dependency (FD).
3. Logical procedure: Computing the attribute closure of {A, B}.
4. Logical evaluation: Applying A → B to the closure set.
5. Logical evaluation: Applying AB → C to the closure set.
6. Constraint satisfaction: Checking if {A, B}+ contains all attributes in R {A, B, C}.
7. Distinction: Evaluating minimality (Checking if A+ or B+ are also superkeys to disqualify AB as a Candidate Key).
8. SQL/Relation mapping: Recognizing R as the set of all attributes.
