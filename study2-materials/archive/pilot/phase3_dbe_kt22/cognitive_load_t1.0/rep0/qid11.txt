ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The concept of the Union ($\cup$) operator in set theory (combining sets while removing duplicates).
2. Set retrieval: Identifying the specific elements within Set A.
3. Set retrieval: Identifying the specific elements within Set B.
4. Set retrieval: Identifying the specific elements within Set C.
5. Procedural execution: Performing the first union operation $(A \cup B)$.
