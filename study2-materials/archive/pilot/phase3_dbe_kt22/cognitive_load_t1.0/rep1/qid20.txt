ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of set difference (T - S): Identifying elements in T not present in S.
2. Result of set difference: Holding the resulting set {3} in memory.
3. Definition of Cartesian product (x): Understanding the operation produces ordered pairs (a, b).
4. Procedural execution: Mapping each element of S {1, 2} to the result of the subtraction {3}.
5. Constraint satisfaction: Distinguishing between a union of sets (Option A), a partial product (Option B), and the correct ordered pairs (Option C).
