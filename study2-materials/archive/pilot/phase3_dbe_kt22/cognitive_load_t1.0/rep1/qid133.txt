ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The formal definition of Boye-Codd Normal Form (BCNF).
2. Definition recall: The formal definition of Third Normal Form (3NF).
3. Concept distinction: The specific difference between the "superkey" requirement and the "prime attribute" allowance.
4. Logical evaluation: Identifying the "if-then" conditional structure within each statement.
5. Distinction: The definition of a "prime attribute" (part of a candidate key).
6. Distinction: The definition of a "non-trivial" functional dependency.
7. Comparative analysis: Mapping the four permutations of (BCNF/3NF) vs (Superkey/Prime Attribute) to identify the single correct pairing.
