ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Set Union operation (∪)
2. Definition recall: Set Intersection operation (∩)
3. Procedural step: Evaluating the expression inside the parentheses first (Order of operations)
4. Working memory: Storing the intermediate result of (A ∪ B)
5. Comparison logic: Identifying common elements between the intermediate set and Set C
6. Distinguishing between similar symbols (∪ vs ∩) to avoid operation reversal
