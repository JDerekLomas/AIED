ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of "superkey" (attribute-based vs. tuple-based).
2. Definition recall of "candidate key" (minimality constraint).
3. Distinguishing between "identifying a tuple" vs. "identifying an attribute."
4. Evaluation of the logical relationship between sets (Every candidate key is a superkey, but not every superkey is a candidate key).
5. Distinguishing between identifying instances within a relation (A) vs. identifying the schema/relation itself (D).
6. Technical terminology mapping (mapping "tuple" to "row" and "attribute" to "column").
