ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of Functional Dependency (FD) and identifying the given set $\Sigma$.
2. Condition for Lossless Join (checking if $R1 \cap R2$ is a superkey for $R1$ or $R2$).
3. Evaluation of the intersection: $R1 \cap R2 = \{A\}$.
4. Testing if $\{A\} \to \{B\}$ or $\{A\} \to \{C\}$ exists in the closure of $\Sigma$ (confirming $A$ is a key for $R1$ or $R2$).
5. Definition of Dependency Preservation (checking if $(\Sigma_1 \cup \Sigma_2)^+ = \Sigma^+$).
6. Projecting FDs onto $R1$: $\{A \to B\}$.
7. Projecting FDs onto $R2$: $\{A \to C\}$.
8. Identifying the "lost" dependency: checking if $B \to C$ can be derived from the projections $\{A \to B\}$ and $\{A \to C\}$.
9. Logical synthesis: Combining the Lossless result (True) and Dependency Preservation result (False) to select the correct multiple-choice option.
