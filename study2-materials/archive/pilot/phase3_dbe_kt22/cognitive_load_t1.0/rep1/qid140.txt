ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The formal definition of Third Normal Form (3NF) regarding transitive dependencies.
2. Definition recall: The formal definition of Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) regarding determinants.
3. Distinction between concepts: Comparing the hierarchical strictness of 3NF vs. BCNF (is BCNF stronger or weaker?).
4. Definition recall: The theoretical objective of normalization (redundancy vs. anomalies).
5. Logical evaluation: Assessing the sufficiency of 3NF to prevent all redundancy (e.g., handling overlapping candidate keys).
6. Logical evaluation: Differentiating between "minimizing" and "eliminating" in a database theory context.
