ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of a Cartesian Product ($A \times B$): Understanding that the first element of each tuple belongs to set $A$ and the second to set $B$.
2. Set Extraction (Set $A$): Identifying the unique first components from the given tuples $\{(2, 3, 4)\}$.
3. Set Extraction (Set $B$): Identifying the unique second components from the given tuples $\{(5, 7)\}$.
4. Cardinality Constraint: Verifying that $|A| \times |B| = 3 \times 2 = 6$ to satisfy the problem statement.
5. Systematic Generation: Mentally constructing the full set of 6 pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \in \{2, 3, 4\}$ and $b \in \{5, 7\}$.
6. Pattern Matching/Verification: Comparing the generated set against the distractors, specifically looking for the inclusion of the three original points and the exclusion of "flipped" or "self-paired" coordinates (e.g., $(3,4)$ or $(5,5)$).
