ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The formal definition of Boyee-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) regarding determinants and candidate keys.
2. Definition recall: The formal definition of Third Normal Form (3NF).
3. Comparative analysis: Understanding the hierarchical relationship between normal forms (BCNF is stricter/stronger than 3NF).
4. Conceptual distinction: Evaluating the difference between "minimizing" and "eliminating" redundancy (and the nuance that BCNF eliminates redundancy arising from functional dependencies, but not necessarily all redundancy).
5. Evaluation of logical truth: Determining the validity of "less restrictive" (Option A) vs "more restrictive."
