ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The function and scope of the SQL Data Control Language (DCL) `GRANT` command.
2. Conceptual distinction: Differentiating between schema-level objects (relations/tables) and data-level instances (tuples/rows).
3. Syntax rules: Recalling that while SQL allows column-level (attribute) permissions, it does not natively support row-level (tuple) permissions via the standard `GRANT` syntax.
4. Logical evaluation: Testing each option (A, B, C) against the recalled constraints of the command.
5. Distractor analysis: Evaluating "None of the above" to ensure no nuances of specific DBMS implementations (like Row Level Security) are being conflated with the standard `GRANT` command.
