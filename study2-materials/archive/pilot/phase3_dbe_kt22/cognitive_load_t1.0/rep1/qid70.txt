ELEMENTS:
1. SQL Syntax Recall: Understanding the structure of a `SELECT * FROM Table` statement.
2. Table Retrieval: Accessing the specific 'Study' table schema/data (implied context).
3. Function Application: Understanding the `lower()` scalar function and its transformation of string data.
4. Case Sensitivity Logic: Recognizing that SQL string comparisons are case-sensitive (or insensitive depending on the RDBMS) and how `lower()` affects the match against the literal 'tom'.
5. String Literal Comparison: Evaluating the logical condition `Name = 'tom'` across all rows in the dataset.
6. Counting/Aggregation: Maintaining a mental tally of rows that satisfy the boolean condition to arrive at a final integer.
