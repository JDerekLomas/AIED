ELEMENTS:
1. SQL Syntax Recall: Understanding the structure of a SELECT statement and aggregate functions.
2. Conceptual distinction: Differentiating between COUNT (tally of values) and MIN (the smallest value).
3. Null Handling: Recognizing that COUNT(column) ignores NULL values (assuming the table "Study" contains the typical 4 rows/values implies a null or specific distribution to differentiate options).
4. Data Retrieval: Accessing the specific "units" column from the "Study" table in working memory.
5. Procedural Execution: Sequential calculation of the two different aggregate results.
6. Mapping/Matching: Correlating the computed values to the ordered pairs in the multiple-choice options.
