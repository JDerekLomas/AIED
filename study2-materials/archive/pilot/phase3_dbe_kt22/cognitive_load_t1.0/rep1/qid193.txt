ELEMENTS:
1. Ownership rules (Implicitly, Linda has all privileges and the right to grant/revoke).
2. `GRANT` syntax and semantics (Effect of granting privileges to Amy and Peter).
3. `WITH GRANT OPTION` (Understanding that Amy now has the power to grant privileges to others).
4. Privilege Dependency Graph (Tracking that Peter received the privilege from two distinct sources: Linda and Amy).
5. `REVOKE ... CASCADE` semantics (Understanding that revoking from Amy also removes any privileges Amy granted).
6. Privilege Independence (Recognizing that Peter’s privilege from Linda remains valid even if his privilege from Amy is revoked).
7. Working memory of the state after each of the 3 discrete steps.
8. Distinguishing between the specific privileges of the two different actors (Amy vs. Peter) in the final state.
