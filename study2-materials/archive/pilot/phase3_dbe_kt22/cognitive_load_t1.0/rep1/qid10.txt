ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of Set Intersection ($\cap$): Identifying common elements between A and B.
2. Memory retrieval of Set A: Holding the specific values {2, 3, 4, 5} in mind.
3. Memory retrieval of Set B: Holding the specific values {4, 5, 6, 7} in mind.
4. Definition of Set Difference ($-$): Understanding that elements of the second set must be removed from the first.
5. Order of operations: Recognizing the parentheses require solving the intersection before the difference.
6. Execution of Logical Subtraction: Filtering {4, 5} out of {2, 3, 4, 5} to reach the final result.
7. Distractor Filtering: Ignoring irrelevant sets C and D (noise/redundant information).
