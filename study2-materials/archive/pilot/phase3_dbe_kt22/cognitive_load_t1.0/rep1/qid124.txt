ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Candidate Key (uniqueness and minimality).
2. Definition recall: Functional Dependency (FD) and closure.
3. Logical condition: Computing the attribute closure of {A, B} using the provided set Σ.
4. Evaluation: Checking if {A, B}⁺ covers the entire schema {A, B, C}.
5. Minimality check: Determining if any proper subset of {A, B} (i.e., {A} or {B}) is also a superkey.
6. Evaluation of FD (A → B): Recognizing that because A can determine B, the attribute B is redundant in the key {A, B}.
7. Constraint satisfaction: Concluding that while {A, B} is a superkey, it fails the minimality requirement for a Candidate Key.
