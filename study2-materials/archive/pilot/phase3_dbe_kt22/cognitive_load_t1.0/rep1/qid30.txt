ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of Cartesian Product ($A \times B$): Understanding that it results in a set of ordered pairs $(x, y)$.
2. Definition of Set Difference ($-$): Understanding that elements in the second set must be removed from the first.
3. Logical mapping of Set A: Recalling $\{1, 2\}$.
4. Logical mapping of Set B: Recalling $\{a, b\}$.
5. Logical mapping of Set C: Recalling $\{1, 2, 3\}$.
6. Logical mapping of Set D: Recalling $\{a, b, c\}$.
7. Execution of $(C \times D)$: Generating/visualizing 9 ordered pairs.
8. Execution of $(A \times B)$: Generating/visualizing 4 ordered pairs.
9. Comparative evaluation: Matching the 4 pairs of $(A \times B)$ against the 9 pairs of $(C \times D)$ to identify remainders.
10. Distinguishing between similar concepts: Ensuring $(1, a)$ is distinct from $(a, 1)$ and checking options for completeness.
