ELEMENTS:
1. Recall of the definition and properties of Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), specifically regarding dependency preservation.
2. Recall of the definition and properties of Third Normal Form (3NF), specifically its "relaxed" requirements compared to BCNF.
3. Distinguishing between "Lossless-Join" and "Dependency-Preserving" properties.
4. Evaluation of the uniqueness constraint for decomposition algorithms (recognizing that multiple valid covers or synthesis paths exist).
5. Recall of the 3NF Synthesis Algorithm vs. the BCNF Decomposition Algorithm.
6. Logical evaluation of four distinct theoretical propositions to identify the single correct statement.
