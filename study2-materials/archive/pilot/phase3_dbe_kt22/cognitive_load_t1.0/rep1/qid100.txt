To evaluate this question, we must look at the "signal-to-noise" ratio. While the paragraph is long, the specific question asks only for the cardinality between "member" and "fitness class." However, to arrive at the answer, a student must parse a dense narrative and isolate specific constraints while ignoring "distractor" entities (technicians, equipment, etc.).

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **Entity Identification:** Identifying "Member" and "Fitness Class" as the relevant entities within a large block of text.
2.  **Constraint Extraction (Forward):** Processing the rule "A member may choose to participate in one or more fitness classes."
3.  **Constraint Extraction (Backward):** Processing the rule "Each fitness class is attended by one or more members."
4.  **Concept Recall (Cardinality):** Recalling that Many-to-Many (N:N) is the result of "one-to-many" mappings in both directions.
5.  **Selective Attention:** Filtering out irrelevant data points (administrators, associate members, start/end dates, equipment status) that compete for working memory.

**ELEMENT COUNT:** 5

**ESTIMATE:**
This is a classic "needle in a haystack" problem. While the logic itself is fundamental, the high linguistic load and the length of the text can overwhelm students with lower reading comprehension or those who struggle with "word problems." Stronger students will quickly scan for keywords, while weaker students will attempt to model the entire schema (technicians, equipment, etc.) before answering, leading to cognitive overload. Because it is a multiple-choice question with a very common relationship type (N:N), the success rate is generally high.
