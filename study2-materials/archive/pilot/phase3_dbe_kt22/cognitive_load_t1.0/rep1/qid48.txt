ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of a "candidate key" (uniqueness and minimality).
2. Definition of a "superkey" (uniqueness property).
3. The relationship between candidate keys and superkeys (all candidate keys are superkeys; adding attributes to a candidate key preserves uniqueness).
4. Evaluating Option A: Applying the minimality constraint (adding 'c' violates minimality if {a,b} is already a candidate key).
5. Evaluating Option B: Applying the superset logic (if {a,b} determines all rows, any superset {a,b,c} also determines all rows).
6. Evaluating Option C: Applying the minimality definition (if {a,b} is a candidate key, no proper subset like {a} can be a superkey/key).
