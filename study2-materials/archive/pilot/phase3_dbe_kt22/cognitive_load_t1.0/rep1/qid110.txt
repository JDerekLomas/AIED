ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall of the definition of "Attribute Closure" (the set of all attributes functionally determined by a starting set).
2. Recall of Armstrong’s Axioms (specifically the Reflexive rule: A determines itself).
3. Processing the first dependency (A → B): checking if A is in the current set and adding B.
4. Processing the second dependency (B → C): checking if B is in the current set and adding C.
5. Processing the third dependency (D → ABC): evaluating the left-hand side (D) against the current set {A, B, C} to determine if it can be triggered.
6. Maintaining the state of the "current set" in working memory while iterating through the list of functional dependencies until no more attributes can be added.
7. Distinguishing between the final set {A, B, C} and the distractors (particularly D, which requires recognizing that functional dependencies are directional and D is not reachable from A).
