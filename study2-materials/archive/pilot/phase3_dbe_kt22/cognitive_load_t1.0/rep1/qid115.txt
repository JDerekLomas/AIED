ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of logical implication (entailment) in functional dependencies (Σ ⊨ X→Y).
2. Armstrong’s Axioms or the attribute closure algorithm ($D^+$).
3. Initialization of the attribute set (start with {D}).
4. Application of rule $D \rightarrow ABC$ (expanding set to {D, A, B, C}).
5. Iterative check of remaining dependencies (though closure is already complete here).
6. Subset evaluation (checking if {A, C} $\subseteq$ {D, A, B, C}).
7. Mapping the result of the closure set to the True/False boolean choice.
