ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Characteristics of an Entity (must have attributes, unique identity) vs. an Attribute or Relationship.
2. Distinction: Entity type vs. Instance vs. Subclass (Generalization/Specialization).
3. Entity 1 (Employee): Identifying "Employee" as a superclass containing Trainers, Administrators, and Technicians with shared attributes (Names, IDs).
4. Entity 2 (Maintenance): Evaluating "Report of maintenance event" as a potential associative entity or event-based entity.
5. Constraint/Attribute (Status): Distinguishing "Status type" as a multi-valued attribute or lookup rather than an independent entity.
6. Constraint/Attribute (Time slot): Recognizing "Time slot" as an attribute of the Class entity, not a standalone entity.
7. Semantic Mapping: Correlating the text "employees are classified into..." to the structural concept of a Generalization hierarchy.
