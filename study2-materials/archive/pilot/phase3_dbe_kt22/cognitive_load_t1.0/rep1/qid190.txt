ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) principles (associating roles with functions/responsibilities rather than specific resources or hardware).
2. Logical evaluation: Identifying the "acting entities" (departments) versus the "objects" (resources/workstations) within the ToyWorld organizational structure.
3. Distinction between concepts: Differentiating between "Permissions/Resources" (files, printers) and "Roles" (Sales, Marketing).
4. Constraint satisfaction: Selecting the option that minimizes administrative overhead by grouping users based on job function rather than individual assets.
5. Scenario filtering: Identifying that "workstations" are extraneous information in an RBAC context.
