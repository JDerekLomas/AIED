ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall of "Cartesian product" (pairing every element of the first set with every element of the second).
2. Maintaining the specific ordered sequence of the sets (A first, then B).
3. Evaluating the logical completeness of the resulting set (ensuring all 4 pairs exist).
4. Distinguishing between the correct pairs and distractor patterns (e.g., self-pairing or reversed order).

ELEMENT COUNT: 4
