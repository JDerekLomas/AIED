ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of equivalence for sets of Functional Dependencies (FDs): Understanding that $\Sigma_1 \equiv \Sigma_2$ if and only if $\Sigma_1^+ = \Sigma_2^+$.
2. Armstrong’s Axiom (Transitivity): Evaluating if $A \to B$ and $AB \to C$ implies $A \to C$ (Logical derivation).
3. Decomposition/Union Rules: Recognizing that $\{A \to B, A \to C\}$ is equivalent to $A \to BC$.
4. Attribute Closure Procedure: Calculating $A^+$ under $\Sigma_1$ (which is $\{A, B, C\}$).
5. Comparing closures: Verifying if $\Sigma_2$ can derive all dependencies in $\Sigma_1$ and vice versa.
6. Distinguishing between "minimal covers" and "equivalent sets": Identifying if the presence of $B$ in $AB \to C$ is redundant given $A \to B$.
