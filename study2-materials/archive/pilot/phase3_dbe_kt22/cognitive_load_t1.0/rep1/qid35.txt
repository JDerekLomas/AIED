ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of a Cartesian Product ($A \times B$): Understanding that the result is a set of ordered pairs.
2. Construction of $A \times B$: Generating the pairs $\{(1,a), (1,b), (2,a), (2,b)\}$.
3. Construction of $C \times D$: Generating the pairs $\{(1,a), (1,b), (1,c), (2,a), (2,b), (2,c), (3,a), (3,b), (3,c)\}$.
4. Definition of a Subset ($\subseteq$): Recalling that every element of the first set must exist in the second.
5. Comparative Evaluation: Checking if each pair from $A \times B$ is present in $C \times D$.
6. Set Membership Logic: Recognizing that since $A \subseteq C$ and $B \subseteq D$, the relationship $A \times B \subseteq C \times D$ must hold true.
