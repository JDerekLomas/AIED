ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The formal definition of a "superkey" (a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple).
2. Set theory logic/Superset property: Understanding that if a subset $S$ uniquely identifies a row, any superset $S \cup \{x\}$ must also uniquely identify that row.
3. Logical evaluation: Evaluating the relationship between the given set $\{a, b\}$ and the proposed set $\{a, b, c\}$.
4. Distinction between concepts: Distinguishing between a "superkey" (any unique identifier) and a "candidate key" (a minimal unique identifier) to avoid the misconception that adding attributes "breaks" the key status.
