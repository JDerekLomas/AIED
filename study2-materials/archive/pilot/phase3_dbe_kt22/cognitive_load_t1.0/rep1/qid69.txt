ELEMENTS:
1. SQL Syntax Recall: Identifying that `SELECT *` retrieves all columns and `FROM Study` specifies the source table.
2. Filter Logic: Understanding the `WHERE` clause as a row-selection mechanism based on a specific attribute value.
3. String Matching: Evaluating the equality condition `Name = 'Tom'` against data records (case sensitivity and literal matching).
4. Counting Operation: Aggregating the identified matches into a single numerical total.
5. Missing Information Handling: Recognizing that without being provided the contents or schema of the "Study" table, the question is impossible to answer definitively (or requires an assumption of a specific dataset).
