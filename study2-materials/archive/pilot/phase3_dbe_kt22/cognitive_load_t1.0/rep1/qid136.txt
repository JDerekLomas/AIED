ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of a Functional Dependency (FD): Recall how $X \to Y$ operates.
2. Candidate Key derivation: Use the closure algorithm (calculating $\{A\}^+$) to determine that $A$ is the only candidate key.
3. Definition of Prime vs. Non-prime attributes: Identifying $A$ as prime and $\{B, C\}$ as non-prime.
4. 3NF criteria evaluation: Checking if for each FD, the left side is a superkey OR the right side is a prime attribute (Transitive dependency check).
5. BCNF criteria evaluation: Checking if for each FD, the left side is a superkey (identifying that $B \to C$ violates this as $B$ is not a superkey).
6. Distinction between 3NF and BCNF: Recalling that BCNF is stricter and that 3NF allows non-prime attributes to be determined by a superkey or be part of a key.
7. Logical elimination: Matching the results of the 3NF and BCNF checks to the provided multiple-choice combinations.
