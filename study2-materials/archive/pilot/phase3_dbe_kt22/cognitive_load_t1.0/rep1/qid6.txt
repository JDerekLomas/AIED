ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall (Definition of "cardinality" provided in the prompt).
2. Definition recall (Definition of "odd").
3. Definition recall (Definition of "positive integer").
4. Evaluation of a logical constraint ("less than 10").
5. Procedure (Enumerating the set: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}).
6. Procedure (Counting the enumerated elements).

ELEMENT COUNT: 6

At a South African university level, even with varying backgrounds, basic arithmetic and set concepts are covered in secondary school mathematics. The provision of the definition of "cardinality" within the question significantly reduces the cognitive load by removing the need for prior specialized recall. Most students should comfortably identify the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.
