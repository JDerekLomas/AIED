ELEMENTS: 
1. Recalling the definition and algorithm for attribute closure ($X^+$).
2. Identifying the starting set (the element $D$).
3. Scanning and parsing the functional dependencies in $\Sigma$.
4. Evaluating the logical condition for the first applicable dependency ($D \rightarrow ABC$).
5. Performing the set union operation to expand the closure ($\{D\} \cup \{A, B, C\}$).
6. Recognizing that the resulting set $\{A, B, C, D\}$ contains all attributes in $R$, satisfying the termination condition.
7. Mapping the final set to the provided multiple-choice options.

ELEMENT COUNT: 7
