ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Definition of a "key attribute" (uniqueness and non-nullity).
2. Distinction: Entity types vs. Attributes (identifying which concepts in the text are objects and which are properties).
3. Logical condition: "No two fitness classes have the same daily time slot" (Evaluating uniqueness of Time slot).
4. Logical condition: Relationship cardinality between Technician and Phone number (Evaluating if a phone number uniquely identifies a technician).
5. Logical condition: Relationship cardinality between Employee and Name (Evaluating if names are unique identifiers).
6. Logical condition: Frequency of maintenance events (Evaluating if a date can uniquely identify an event given multiple pieces of equipment and technicians).
7. Constraint satisfaction: Identifying that "ID" is explicitly mentioned for Employees and Equipment, making other attributes less likely to be keys unless specified as unique.
8. Textual filtering: Navigating a dense narrative with multiple overlapping entities (Trainers, Admins, Technicians, Members, Associates, Equipment, Classes) to isolate the specific attributes mentioned in the options.
