ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) requirements.
2. Definition recall of Third Normal Form (3NF) requirements.
3. Recall of the specific existence theorem for 3NF (it is always possible to achieve dependency preservation).
4. Recall of the specific limitation of BCNF (it is not always possible to achieve dependency preservation).
5. Evaluation of universal quantifiers ("always") against counter-examples or existence proofs.
6. Evaluation of negative existential quantifiers ("cannot") to identify false exclusions.
7. Distinguishing between losslessness (implied/required in both) and dependency preservation (the differentiator here).
