ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Definition of a "prime attribute" (an attribute that is part of at least one candidate key).
2. Definition recall: Definition of a "candidate key" (a minimal superkey).
3. Logical evaluation: Determining the closure of $\{A\}$ to check if it is a key ($A^+ = \{A, B, C\}$).
4. Logical evaluation: Determining the closure of $\{B\}$ to check if it is a key ($B^+ = \{B, C, A\}$).
5. Logical evaluation: Determining the closure of $\{C\}$ to check if it is a key ($C^+ = \{C, A, B\}$).
6. Pattern recognition: Identifying the cyclic nature of the functional dependencies.
7. Minimality constraint: Confirming that no subset of these keys (which are singletons) can be a key.
8. Synthesis: Mapping the set of all candidate keys $\{A, B, C\}$ to the set of all attributes to verify primality.
