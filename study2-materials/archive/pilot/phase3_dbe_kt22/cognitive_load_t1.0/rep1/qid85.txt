ELEMENTS:
1. SQL Syntax Recall: Understanding the `SELECT *`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` clauses.
2. Table Aliasing: Mapping `e` to `Enrol` and `c` to `Course`.
3. Subquery Evaluation: Processing the inner `SELECT` before the outer query.
4. Join Logic/Relationship: Understanding how `CourseNo` links the `Enrol` and `Course` tables.
5. Membership Operator (`IN`): Evaluating the logical condition for filtering rows.
6. Data Mapping (Mental Model): Since the actual table data is missing from the prompt, the student must realize they cannot answer without it or must map the logical relationship between a course and its enrollees.
7. Cardinality Concept: Distinguishing between a single course record and multiple enrollment records (one-to-many relationship).
