ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of a view as a virtual table derived from underlying base tables.
2. Recall of the SQL privilege model (GRANT/REVOKE mechanism).
3. Logical distinction between ownership of a view and inherent rights (ownership vs. granted privileges).
4. Evaluation of the "Updatability" constraint (understanding that not all views are inherently updatable, even if the user has permissions on base tables).
5. Distinction between universal statements ("always," "all") and conditional constraints in database security.
6. Comparison of four similar-sounding logical propositions to identify the most restrictive/accurate case (C).
