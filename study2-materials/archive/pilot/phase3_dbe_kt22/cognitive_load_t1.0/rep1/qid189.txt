ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Understanding what a SQL injection attack is (the manipulation of a query via user input).
2. SQL syntax rules: Recognizing string concatenation and how single quotes define boundaries in a query.
3. Logical condition evaluation: Distinguishing between static hard-coded strings (Option B and C) and external input sources (Option A).
4. Data flow analysis: Identifying that `Request.form` represents untrusted user-supplied data.
5. Code tracing: Distinguishing between the variable assignment in Option C (internal) versus the dynamic input in Option A (external).
6. Distinguishing similar concepts: Differentiating between a dynamically built string that is "safe" (because the source is controlled) and one that is "unsafe."
