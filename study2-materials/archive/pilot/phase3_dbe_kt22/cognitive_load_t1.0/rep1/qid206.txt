ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall of the definition of "concurrent transactions" (executing multiple transactions simultaneously).
2. Recall of the definition of "throughput" (number of transactions per unit time) and its relationship to concurrency.
3. Recall of the definition of "response time" (latency for a single transaction) and how interleaving reduces the waiting time for short transactions.
4. Recall of the definition of "resource utilisation" (keeping CPU and I/O busy) and how concurrency masks idle time.
5. Evaluation of the "All of the above" logical constraint (checking if more than one option is correct to validate the distractor).
