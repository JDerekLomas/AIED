ELEMENTS:
1. Recall and apply the Union (∪) operation: Combining elements of Set A and Set C while removing duplicates.
2. Recall and apply the Proper Subset (⊂) definition: Checking if every element of the result exists in Set B AND the result is not equal to Set B.
3. Logical Evaluation (Set A ∪ C): Holding the specific members of Set A {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} and Set C {3,5,7,9} in memory to form the intermediate set {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.
4. Comparison/Matching: Comparing the large intermediate set {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} against the much smaller Set B {3,5,7}.
5. Boolean Decision: Evaluating the truth value of the subset relationship (which is False because A ∪ C is much larger than B).
