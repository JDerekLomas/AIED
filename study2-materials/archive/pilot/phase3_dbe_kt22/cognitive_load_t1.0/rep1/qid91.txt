ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall: The semantic meaning of an ER diagram (what visual notations represent).
2. Definition recall: The definition of a Primary Key (uniqueness and identification).
3. Definition recall: The definition of a Foreign Key (relationships between entities).
4. Definition recall: The definition of a Domain Constraint (valid values/data types for an attribute).
5. Evaluation/Mapping: Mapping ER components (underlined attributes) to Primary Keys.
6. Evaluation/Mapping: Mapping ER components (relationships) to Foreign Keys.
7. Distinction: Recognizing that while ER diagrams imply relationships, "Foreign Keys" are a relational model implementation detail rather than an ER primitive.
8. Distinction: Recognizing that specific domain constraints (e.g., age > 18) are typically not visually represented in standard ER diagrams.
