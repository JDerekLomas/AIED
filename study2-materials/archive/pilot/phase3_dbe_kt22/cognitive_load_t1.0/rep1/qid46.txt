ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of a superkey (a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple).
2. Definition of a candidate key (a minimal superkey).
3. Superkey property of monotonicity/closure (if K is a superkey, any superset of K is also a superkey).
4. Logical evaluation of Option A: Testing the superset property against the "must not" constraint.
5. Logical evaluation of Option B: Testing the minimality requirement of candidate keys against the given superkey {a,b}.
6. Distinction between "must be" and "can be" (modal logic) regarding primary key selection in Option C.
