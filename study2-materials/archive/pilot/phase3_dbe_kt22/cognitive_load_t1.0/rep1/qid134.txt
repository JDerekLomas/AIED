ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of a Candidate Key (identifying that {A} is the only key for R).
2. Definition of Prime vs. Non-prime attributes (A is prime; B and C are non-prime).
3. 3NF definition/rule application (checking if the determinant is a superkey OR the dependent is a prime attribute).
4. BCNF definition/rule application (checking if the determinant is a superkey).
5. Relationship between 3NF and BCNF (knowing that BCNF is stricter; if it's in BCNF, it must be in 3NF).
6. Logical evaluation of the specific FD {A→BC} against both sets of constraints simultaneously.
