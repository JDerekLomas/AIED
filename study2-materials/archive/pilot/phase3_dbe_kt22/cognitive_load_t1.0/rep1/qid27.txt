ELEMENTS:
1. Identifying set labels (A, B, C) and their corresponding spatial boundaries in the Venn diagram.
2. Recall of the Union (∪) operator definition (combining areas).
3. Recall of the Intersection (∩) operator definition (overlap area).
4. Recall of the Difference (–) operator definition (removal of areas).
5. Application of order of operations/parentheses to spatial visualization.
6. Evaluating Option A: Calculating A U C, then mentally subtracting the entire B circle.
7. Evaluating Option B: Calculating B – A, then subtracting C from the remainder.
8. Evaluating Option C: Identifying the triple intersection (center only).
9. Evaluating Option D: Calculating A U C, then identifying and subtracting the A/B overlap and the B/C overlap individually.
10. Comparing the mental result of each logical expression against the specific visual shaded area (the "outer" portions of A and C that do not touch B).
