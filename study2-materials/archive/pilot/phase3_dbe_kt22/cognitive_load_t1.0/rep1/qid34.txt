ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of Cartesian product (understanding that A x A and A x C produce sets of ordered pairs).
2. Set member evaluation (generating/visualizing the specific ordered pairs in A x A: {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}).
3. Set member evaluation (generating/visualizing the specific ordered pairs in A x C: {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)}).
4. Definition of subset (⊆) (understanding that every element in the first set must exist in the second).
5. Comparison/Mapping (simultaneously holding the contents of the first generated set against the second to verify the subset condition).
6. Distinguishing between extraneous information (recognizing that sets B and D are distractors and irrelevant to the calculation).

ELEMENT COUNT: 6
