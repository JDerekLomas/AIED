ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of Set Intersection (∩): Recalling that only common elements between A and C are included.
2. Definition of Proper Subset (⊄): Recalling that the symbol represents "is not a proper subset of" and understanding the criteria for a proper subset (all elements of B must be in the result, and the result must have at least one additional element).
3. Retrieval of Set A: Holding the values {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} in memory.
4. Retrieval of Set C: Holding the values {3, 5, 7, 9} in memory.
5. Computational Step (A ∩ C): Performing the intersection to derive {3, 5, 7, 9}.
6. Retrieval of Set B: Holding the values {3, 5, 7} in memory.
7. Logical Comparison: Evaluating if {3, 5, 7} is a proper subset of {3, 5, 7, 9} (it is).
8. Negation Logic: Processing the "not" (⊄) operator to determine that since it IS a proper subset, the statement "it is NOT a proper subset" is False.
