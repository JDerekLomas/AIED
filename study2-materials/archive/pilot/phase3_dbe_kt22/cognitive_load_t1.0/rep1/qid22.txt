ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of set intersection (elements common to both sets).
2. Evaluation of the specific subset relationship ( {2, 3} must be contained within B).
3. Logical deduction of the minimum cardinality of B (B must have at least 2 elements).
4. Comparison of the constraint "B must have at least 2 elements" against the provided multiple-choice options.
5. Interpretation of the negative constraint "cannot be" (identifying the value that violates the cardinality rule).
