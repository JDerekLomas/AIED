ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of Cartesian Product (S x T): Recalling the procedure to form ordered pairs.
2. Definition of Cartesian Product (S x S): Recognizing the self-join/product operation.
3. Definition of Set Difference (-): Understanding that elements in the second set are removed from the first.
4. Set Membership Evaluation: Identifying the specific ordered pairs in $S \times T$ (6 elements).
5. Set Membership Evaluation: Identifying the specific ordered pairs in $S \times S$ (4 elements).
6. Logical Comparison: Simultaneously holding the results of both products to identify the relative complement (pairs in $S \times T$ not in $S \times S$).
