ELEMENTS:
1. Recall and application of the **Lossless Join Theorem** (checking if $R_1 \cap R_2$ forms a superkey for $R_1$ or $R_2$).
2. Identification of the intersection of the decomposition: $\{B\}$.
3. Evaluation of the functional dependency $B \to C$ to determine if $B$ is a key for $R_2$.
4. Definition of **Dependency Preservation**: checking if the union of projected dependencies $(\Sigma_{R1} \cup \Sigma_{R2})^+$ covers the original set $\Sigma$.
5. Identifying the "lost" dependency: $A \to C$.
6. Executing the **Transitivity Rule** or attribute closure to see if $A \to C$ is preserved via $A \to B$ and $B \to C$.
7. Mental integration of both property results to select the correct multiple-choice combination.
