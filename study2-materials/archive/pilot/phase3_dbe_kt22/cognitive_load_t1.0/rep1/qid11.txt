ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The Union (∪) operator means combining all unique elements from the involved sets.
2. Set A content: {2, 3, 4, 5}
3. Set B content: {4, 5, 6, 7}
4. Set C content: {6, 7, 8, 9}
5. Procedural step 1: Perform the operation (A ∪ B) by merging sets A and B and removing duplicates.
6. Working memory storage: Holding the result of (A ∪ B) → {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.
7. Procedural step 2: Perform the union of the previous result with Set C.
8. Constraint satisfaction: Ensuring no elements are omitted and duplicates (like 6 and 7) are handled correctly.
9. Distinctions/Comparison: Comparing the final calculated set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} against the multiple-choice distractors.
