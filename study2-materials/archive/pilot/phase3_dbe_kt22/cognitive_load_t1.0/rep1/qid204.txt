ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The fundamental rule of the Two-Phase Locking (2PL) protocol (Growing phase vs. Shrinking phase).
2. Logical evaluation of Option A: Understanding the "no new locks after first release" constraint (the Shrinking phase boundary).
3. Logical evaluation of Option B: Distinguishing between basic 2PL and Strict/Rigorous 2PL (understanding that releasing locks at commit is a valid, though specific, application of the shrinking phase).
4. Logical evaluation of Option C: Distinguishing between basic 2PL and Conservative (Static) 2PL (understanding that pre-declaration of locks is a valid way to enter the shrinking phase immediately).
5. Distinguishing between "Necessary/Mandatory" vs. "Permissible" behavior: Recognizing that while A is a *requirement* of the protocol, B and C are *variations* or specific implementations that satisfy the protocol.
6. Synthesizing A, B, and C to evaluate the "All of the above" condition.
