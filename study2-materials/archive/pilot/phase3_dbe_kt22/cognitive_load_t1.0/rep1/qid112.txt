ELEMENTS:
1. Recall the definition of logical entailment (⊨) in the context of Functional Dependencies.
2. Recall Armstrong’s Axiom of Transitivity (If A→B and B→C, then A→C).
3. Evaluate the first dependency in Σ: A→B.
4. Evaluate the second dependency in Σ: B→C.
5. Apply the transitive rule to the specific attributes: combine (A→B) and (B→C) to derive A→C.
6. Compare the derived dependency with the target statement to determine the truth value.
7. Filter out the irrelevant information (D→ABC) which acts as a distractor.
