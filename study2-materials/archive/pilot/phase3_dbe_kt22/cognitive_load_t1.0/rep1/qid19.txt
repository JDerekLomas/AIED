ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall: Set theory notation (curly braces for sets, parentheses for ordered pairs).
2. Definition recall: The Cartesian Product operator (x) as the set of all possible ordered pairs.
3. Logical procedure: Iterating through elements of S to form pairs with elements of S (nested loop logic).
4. Constraint satisfaction: Identifying that set T is irrelevant "noise" data to be ignored.
5. Distinction: Differentiating between a union of sets (Option A) and a Cartesian product (Option B).
