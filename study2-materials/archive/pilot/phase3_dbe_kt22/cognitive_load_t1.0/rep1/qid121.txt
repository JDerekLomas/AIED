ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall of the formal definition of a "Minimal Cover" (equivalence, no redundant functional dependencies, no extraneous attributes).
2. Understanding the definition of Logical Equivalence between two sets of functional dependencies (Σ1 ≡ Σ2).
3. The procedure to check if Σ1 ⊨ Σ2 (computing attribute closures under Σ1 for A→B and B→C).
4. The procedure to check if Σ2 ⊨ Σ1 (computing attribute closures under Σ2 for A→B and AB→C).
5. Evaluation of the transitivity rule (A→B, B→C ⊨ A→C) to determine if AB→C is redundant or implied.
6. Identifying the specific constraint of "minimality" (checking if Σ1 is already minimal or if Σ2 contains redundancies).
7. Distinguishing between "Equivalent sets" and the directional requirement of one being a "cover" for another.
