ELEMENTS:
1. **Visual decoding**: Interpreting the Venn diagram and identifying the spatial relationship of the shaded region.
2. **Set Theory Symbolism**: Recalling the meaning of operators for Union (U), Intersection (∩), and Difference (-).
3. **Logical Mapping**: Mentally mapping the visual region to the abstract set notation for each option.
4. **Procedure/Order of Operations**: Evaluating parenthetical expressions first (e.g., evaluating A U B before subtracting B).
5. **Distinction Analysis**: Differentiating between Option A (the whole circle) and the specific sub-segment shown (A excluding the overlap).
6. **Constraint Matching**: Verifying that the chosen notation excludes all elements of B while including elements of A.
