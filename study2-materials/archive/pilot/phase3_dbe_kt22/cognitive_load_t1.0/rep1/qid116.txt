ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall: The formal definition of equivalence for sets of functional dependencies (mutual entailment/closure).
2. Distinction: Distinguishing between equivalence (Σ1+ = Σ2+) and mere consistency or overlapping dependencies.
3. Logical derivation (Σ1 ⊨ Σ2): Checking if A→C and B→C can be derived from Σ1 using transitivity (A→B, B→C ∴ A→C).
4. Logical derivation (Σ2 ⊨ Σ1): Checking if A→B can be derived from Σ2 (evaluating the closure of A under Σ2).
5. Constraint satisfaction: Identifying that while Σ1 implies Σ2, Σ2 does not imply A→B.
6. SQL/Relational logic: Mapping the abstract notation to the concept of attribute closures.
