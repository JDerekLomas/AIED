ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of a **superkey** (a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple).
2. Definition of a **candidate key** (a minimal superkey).
3. The **superset property** of superkeys (if K is a superkey, any superset of K is also a superkey).
4. Logic of **minimality** (the requirement that no proper subset can be a superkey for it to be a candidate key).
5. Evaluation of Option A: Testing the superset property (realizing that adding 'b' maintains the superkey status, making the statement false).
6. Evaluation of Option B: Distinguishing between a superkey and a candidate key (recognizing that {a,c} is a superkey but not necessarily minimal, as {a} is a subset).
7. Evaluation of Option C: Distinguishing between the possibility and the necessity (recognizing that {a} is a superkey, but whether it is the *minimal* superkey depends on whether the empty set or subsets exist—though in this schema, it depends on whether {a} itself contains a smaller key).
