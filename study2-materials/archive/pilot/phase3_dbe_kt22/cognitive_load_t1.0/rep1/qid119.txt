ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The concept of "equivalence" in functional dependencies (Σ1 ≡ Σ2 if Σ1+ = Σ2+).
2. Distinction: Recognizing that equivalence requires checking two directions (Σ1 ⊨ Σ2 and Σ2 ⊨ Σ1).
3. Logical condition (Closure 1): Computing the closure of {A} under Σ1 to see if it implies Σ2's dependencies.
4. Logical condition (Closure 2): Computing the closure of {B} under Σ1 to see if it implies B → C.
5. Logical condition (Closure 3): Computing the closure of {A} under Σ2 to see if it implies Σ1's dependencies (A → B, AB → C).
6. SQL/Relational Logic: Maintaining the specific attribute sets (R={A,B,C}) to ensure no attributes outside the schema are used.
7. Procedural steps: Executing the Armstrong’s Axioms or the attribute closure algorithm iteratively for multiple sets.
