ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Set notation (curly braces and element identification).
2. Definition recall: The Union operator (A ∪ B) and the procedure for combining sets.
3. Definition recall: The Proper Subset operator (⊂) and its logical requirement (all elements must exist in the parent set, and the parent set must be larger/not equal).
4. Logical evaluation: Performing the union of A and B (A ∪ B = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}).
5. Comparative evaluation: Comparing elements of B {3, 5, 7} against the result of (A ∪ B).
6. Constraint satisfaction: Determining if B is a *proper* subset (it is, because 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 are in the union but not in B).
