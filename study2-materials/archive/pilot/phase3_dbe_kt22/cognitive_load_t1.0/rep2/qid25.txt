ELEMENTS:
1. Visual perception of the shaded area (identifying it as "A only").
2. Set Theory notation for Union (U).
3. Set Theory notation for Intersection (∩).
4. Set Theory notation for Difference (-).
5. Evaluation of option B: Combining sets and then subtracting the entirety of B.
6. Evaluation of option D: Identifying the intersection and subtracting it from B (resulting in "B only").
7. Distinguishing between the visual "A only" and the logical derivation of the same area via set operations.
