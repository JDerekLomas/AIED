ELEMENTS:
1. Recall of the specific SQL command syntax for table definition (`CREATE TABLE`).
2. Recognition of PostgreSQL terminology (understanding that a "relation" in the relational model maps to a "table" in SQL).
3. Distinction between standard SQL keywords and descriptive natural language distractors (e.g., "New").
4. Evaluation of case sensitivity and formatting in syntax (though not strictly tested here, it is a piece of information to verify against the options).
