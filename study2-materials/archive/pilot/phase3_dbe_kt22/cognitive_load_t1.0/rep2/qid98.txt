ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Definition of a "key attribute" (uniqueness and non-nullity).
2. Distinction: Differentiating between a primary key, a partial key, and a non-key attribute.
3. Constraint evaluation: "Each technician has a mobile phone number" (does not imply uniqueness).
4. Constraint evaluation: "No two fitness classes have the same daily time slot" (implies uniqueness for that entity).
5. Entity-Relationship context: Identifying that "Date of maintenance" is an attribute of a relationship or a multi-valued event.
6. Entity-Relationship context: Identifying that "Name of employee" is non-unique according to general database principles.
7. Filtering: Distinguishing between the primary ID provided in the text (e.g., Employee ID) and whether the options provided *could* function as a key based on the business rules described.
8. Logical condition: "No two classes have the same daily time slot" creates a functional dependency where Time Slot uniquely identifies a Class.
