ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Candidate Key (CK) property (uniqueness and minimality).
2. Definition recall: The concept of an "Attribute Closure".
3. SQL/Relational logic: Identifying "Prime" vs. "Non-prime" attributes based on FD analysis.
4. Logical evaluation: Recognizing that 'C' does not appear on the right-hand side of any Functional Dependency in Σ.
5. Logical evaluation: Deducing that if an attribute is not determined by any other attribute, it must be part of every key.
6. Procedural step: Computing the closure of {C} or combinations involving C to verify coverage of {A, B, D}.
7. Constraint satisfaction: Checking if C alone is sufficient or if other attributes are needed to form the CK.
