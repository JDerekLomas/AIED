As an instructor, I would classify this as a "low element interactivity" question. It primarily tests simple recall of a fundamental definition rather than the application of logic or the synthesis of multiple constraints.

ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition recall (The function of the 'SELECT' clause).
2. Distinction between similar concepts (Differentiating DQL from DML/DDL commands).
3. SQL syntax rules (Keyword identification).

ELEMENT COUNT: 3

Most students, even those with minimal prior exposure, encounter this within the first hour of learning SQL.
