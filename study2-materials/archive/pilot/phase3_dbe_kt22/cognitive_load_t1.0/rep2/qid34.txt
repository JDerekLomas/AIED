ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of Cartesian product (understanding $A \times B$ as the set of all ordered pairs).
2. Definition of the Subset relation ($\subseteq$) (understanding that every element in the first set must exist in the second).
3. Set member identification for $A \times A$ (computing/visualizing pairs like $(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)$).
4. Set member identification for $A \times C$ (computing/visualizing pairs like $(1,1), (1,2), (1,3) \dots (2,3)$).
5. Logic evaluation/Comparison (checking if all pairs from the first set are present in the second set based on the domain of the second coordinates).
6. Distinguishing between the sets $B$ and $D$ vs $A$ and $C$ (ignoring the "distractor" sets $B$ and $D$ provided in the prompt).
