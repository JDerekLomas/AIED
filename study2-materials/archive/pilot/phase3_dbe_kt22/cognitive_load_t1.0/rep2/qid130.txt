ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of Lossless Join Property (R1 ∩ R2 → R1 or R1 ∩ R2 → R2).
2. Definition recall of Dependency Preservation (F+ = (F1 ∪ F2)+).
3. Identification of the intersection of R1 and R2 ({B}).
4. Evaluation of the functional dependency A→B against the intersection.
5. Evaluation of the functional dependency B→C against the intersection.
6. Verification of the closure of the intersection to determine if it is a superkey for either schema (B+ = {B, C}).
7. Mapping specific dependencies to the decomposed schemas (A→B is in R1, B→C is in R2).
8. Logic integration: synthesizing both property results to match the correct multiple-choice option.
