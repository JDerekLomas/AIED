3. Working memory: Holding the result of the intermediate calculation (A ∪ B = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}).
4. Logical evaluation: Comparing the intermediate set against Set C.
5. Procedural order: Recognizing the significance of the parentheses (order of operations).
6. Pattern matching: Filtering out irrelevant data (Set D is a distractor).
