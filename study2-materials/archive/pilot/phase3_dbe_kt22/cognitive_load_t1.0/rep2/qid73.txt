ELEMENTS:
1. SQL syntax recall: Understanding the `SELECT` statement structure and the purpose of `COUNT()` vs `MIN()`.
2. Schema identification: Locating the specific column (`units`) and the table (`Study`) from the provided data.
3. Logical distinction: Understanding how `COUNT()` handles potential NULL values compared to total rows (if any are present).
4. Procedural execution (Aggregation 1): Scanning the `units` column to count occurrences.
5. Procedural execution (Aggregation 2): Scanning the `units` column to identify the minimum numerical value.
6. Constraint satisfaction: Maintaining the specific order of the output (Count first, Min second) to select the correct multiple-choice option.
