ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of a Candidate Key (uniqueness and minimality).
2. Definition of a Superkey (uniqueness property).
3. The relationship between Candidate Keys and Superkeys (all candidate keys are superkeys, and any superset of a candidate key is a superkey).
4. Logical evaluation of Option A (identifying that adding 'c' violates the minimality requirement of a candidate key).
5. Logical evaluation of Option B (identifying that adding 'c' to a candidate key satisfies the definition of a superkey).
6. Logical evaluation of Option C (identifying that if {a,b} is the candidate key, a proper subset like {a} cannot be assumed to be a superkey without more information).
