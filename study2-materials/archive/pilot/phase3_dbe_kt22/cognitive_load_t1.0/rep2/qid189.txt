ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Understanding what constitutes a "SQL injection" vulnerability (user-controlled input concatenated into a query string).
2. Code syntax analysis: Interpreting the assignment and concatenation logic across multiple lines of JavaScript/VBScript-style code.
3. Distinction between variables: Differentiating between hard-coded string literals (Options B and C) and dynamic request-driven input (Option A).
4. Logical evaluation: Recognizing that `Request.form` represents external, untrusted data entry.
5. SQL syntax rules: Identifying how the single quotes function within the string concatenation to form a valid (but vulnerable) query.
