ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Minimal cover requirements (standard form, no redundant dependencies, no redundant attributes).
2. SQL/Functional Dependency syntax: Interpreting the arrow notation and set representation.
3. Logical evaluation (Σ1 implies Σ2): Checking if $A \to B$ and $B \to C$ can be derived from $\{A \to B, AB \to C\}$.
4. Logical evaluation (Σ2 implies Σ1): Checking if $A \to B$ and $AB \to C$ can be derived from $\{A \to B, B \to C\}$.
5. Attribute closure procedure: Calculating $A^+$ and $AB^+$ under both sets of dependencies.
6. Redundancy check: Evaluating if $AB \to C$ is reducible to $A \to C$ or $B \to C$ within the context of the equivalence.
7. Distinguishing Equivalence vs. Minimal Cover: Recognizing that being "equivalent" is a necessary but not sufficient condition for being a "minimal cover" of a different set.
