ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall of the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion formula for sets: |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|.
2. Definition recall of the cardinality symbol (|X|).
3. Definition recall of the Union operator (∪).
4. Definition recall of the Intersection operator (∩).
5. Mapping the provided numerical values (|A|=10, |B|=5, |A ∩ B|=2) to the correct variables in the formula.
6. Execution of multi-step arithmetic (addition followed by subtraction).

ELEMENT COUNT: 6

Based on the profile of South African undergraduate CS students—where discrete mathematics is typically a prerequisite or co-requisite for Database Systems—most students will find this a high-recall, low-complexity task, though some may stumble on the notation if their mathematical foundation is weak.
