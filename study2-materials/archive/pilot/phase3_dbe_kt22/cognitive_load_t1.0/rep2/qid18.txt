ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of set difference (A - B): identifying elements in A not in B.
2. Evaluation of (A - B): {3}.
3. Definition of set difference (B - A): identifying elements in B not in A.
4. Evaluation of (B - A): {5}.
5. Definition of set union (∪): combining elements from two sets.
6. Logical synthesis: performing the union of the two intermediate results {3} ∪ {5}.
7. Constraint satisfaction: ensuring no duplicates and comparing the final set {3, 5} to the multiple-choice options.
