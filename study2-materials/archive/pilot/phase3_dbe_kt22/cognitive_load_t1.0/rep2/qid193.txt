ELEMENTS:
1. Ownership rules: Recognizing Linda as the root source of privileges.
2. Syntax/Command recall: Understanding `GRANT`, `WITH GRANT OPTION`, and `REVOKE`.
3. Grant Dependency Graphs: Mapping the flow of privileges from Linda -> Amy -> Peter.
4. Redundant Privileges: Identifying that Peter received the privilege from two different sources (Linda and Amy).
5. `CASCADE` semantics: Understanding that revoking from Amy nullifies privileges she granted to others.
6. Independent Path evaluation: Realizing that Peter's privilege from Linda remains unaffected by the revocation of the path through Amy.
7. Logical elimination: Comparing the final state of the dependency graph against the four multiple-choice options.
