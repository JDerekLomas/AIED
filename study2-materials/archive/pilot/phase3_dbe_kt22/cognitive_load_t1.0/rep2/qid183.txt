ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Understanding the mechanism of SQL injection (input concatenation vs. sanitized parameters).
2. Knowledge of security principles: Understanding the "Principle of Least Privilege" vs. absolute prevention.
3. Logical evaluation: Analyzing the causal link between removing user privileges and the total prevention of an injection attack (i.e., realizing that even limited privileges allow for data theft or unauthorized access).
4. Distinguishing between mitigation and prevention: Recognizing that reducing privileges limits impact but does not "prevent" the vulnerability itself.
5. Negative constraint processing: Maintaining the "not correct" filter while evaluating three separate technical propositions.
6. SQL syntax/execution context: Understanding how an application connects to a database (the proxy user model).
