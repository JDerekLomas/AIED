ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of "Entity Type" versus "Attribute" or "Relationship".
2. Recognition of the Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) concept: Subclasses (Trainers, Administrators, Technicians) vs. Superclass (Employee).
3. Evaluation of Option A: Identifying "maintenance event" as a relationship (associative entity) between Technician and Equipment with a date attribute.
4. Evaluation of Option B: Distinguishing between a multi-valued/pre-defined attribute ("status type") and a standalone entity.
5. Evaluation of Option C: Synthesizing the description of shared attributes (names, addresses, IDs) across categories into a single superclass entity.
6. Evaluation of Option D: Recognizing a specific constraint/attribute of a "Fitness Class" vs. an independent entity.
7. Processing business rules: Mapping cardinalities (e.g., 1-to-many, many-to-many) to determine which objects warrant entity status.
8. Distinguishing between physical objects (Equipment) and logical events/constraints described in the text.
