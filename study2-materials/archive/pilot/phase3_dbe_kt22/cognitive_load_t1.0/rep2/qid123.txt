ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of a Candidate Key (CK): Must be a superkey and minimal.
2. Understanding of Functional Dependency (FD) notation: Interpreting $A \to B$ and $AB \to C$.
3. Concept of Attribute Closure: Knowing the procedure to calculate $A^+$.
4. Execution of Closure Algorithm: Step-by-step evaluation ($A \to B$ implies $A^+ = \{A, B\}$; then checking if $AB \to C$ can be applied).
5. Set comparison: Checking if the result $\{A, B, C\}$ matches the full set of attributes $R$.
6. Logical evaluation: Determining if $A$ is a superkey based on the closure.
7. Minimality check: Verifying if any subset of $A$ (the empty set) is a key (trivial in this case, but still a cognitive step).
