ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of a **superkey** (a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple).
2. Definition of a **candidate key** (a minimal superkey).
3. The **subset/superset relationship** property (if K is a superkey, any superset of K is also a superkey).
4. Logic of **minimality** (the requirement that no proper subset can be a superkey for it to be a candidate key).
5. Evaluation of Option A: Testing the superset rule (counter-intuitive to many novices).
6. Evaluation of Option B: Distinguishing between "possible" and "must" regarding minimality.
7. Evaluation of Option C: Distinguishing between a superkey and a candidate key (the "must" implies it could not have a smaller subset, which is true here but requires verifying {a} has no smaller non-empty subset).
