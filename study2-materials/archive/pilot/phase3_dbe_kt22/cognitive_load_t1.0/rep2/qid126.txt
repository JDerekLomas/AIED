ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Candidate Key (CK) (must be a superkey and minimal).
2. Definition recall: Functional Dependency (FD) and closure ($X^+$).
3. Procedural step: Computing the closure of $\{A\}$ using $\Sigma$ ($A \to B, B \to C \implies \{A, B, C\}$).
4. Procedural step: Computing the closure of $\{B\}$ to test minimality/uniqueness ($B \to C, C \to A \implies \{B, C, A\}$).
5. Procedural step: Computing the closure of $\{C\}$ to test minimality/uniqueness ($C \to A, A \to B \implies \{C, A, B\}$).
6. Logical evaluation: Comparing the set of all CKs $(\{A\}, \{B\}, \{C\})$ against the specific claim ("$A$ is the *only* CK").
7. Distinction: Recognizing that while $A$ is a CK, the existence of other CKs makes the statement "False."
