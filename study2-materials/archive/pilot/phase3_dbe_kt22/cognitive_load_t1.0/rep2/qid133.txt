ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) requirements (X must be a superkey).
2. Definition recall of Third Normal Form (3NF) requirements (X is a superkey OR A is prime).
3. Definition recall of "prime attribute" (part of a candidate key).
4. Definition recall of "non-trivial FD" (A is not a subset of X).
5. Distinction between BCNF and 3NF formal definitions.
6. Logical evaluation of Option A (Incorrect: This describes a partial requirement of 3NF, not BCNF).
7. Logical evaluation of Option B (Incorrect: This is the BCNF definition, 3NF is less restrictive).
8. Logical evaluation of Option C (Correct: Standard definition of BCNF).
9. Logical evaluation of Option D (Incorrect: This is only one half of the disjunctive 3NF condition).
10. Comparative analysis of all four options to ensure the "most correct" answer is selected.
