ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Characteristics of a weak entity type (existence dependency and lack of a primary key).
2. Entity identification: Distinguishing between entities (Associate Member, Fitness Class) and attributes (Speciality, Status).
3. Relationship mapping: "Associate member" to "Member" (identifying relationship).
4. Relationship mapping: "Fitness class" to "Trainer"/"Member" (evaluating if it has its own unique ID/time slot constraint).
5. Cardinality/Participation analysis: "One or more associate members" per "Member".
6. Key attribute evaluation: Recognizing that "Associate number (1, 2...)" is a partial key, not a global unique identifier.
7. Constraint evaluation: Processing the "unique ID" mention for equipment to rule out its status as an entity.
8. Distinction: Multi-valued attributes (Speciality) vs. Weak Entities.
