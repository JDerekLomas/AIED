ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of the Two-Phase Locking (2PL) protocol (Growing and Shrinking phases).
2. Logical evaluation of the "Shrinking Phase" constraint: the rule that no new locks can be acquired after any lock is released (Statement A).
3. Logical evaluation of the "Commit" condition: understanding that releasing locks at the end of a transaction is a valid (and often required) subset of 2PL, specifically Strict 2PL (Statement B).
4. Logical evaluation of "Pre-declaration": understanding that 2PL allows, but does not forbid, acquiring all locks at the start, as seen in Conservative 2PL (Statement C).
5. Distinguishing between Basic 2PL and its variants (Strict, Rigorous, Conservative) to determine if "All of the above" is logically sound across the protocol family.
6. SQL/Concurrency syntax and conceptual rules regarding lock modes (Shared vs. Exclusive).
