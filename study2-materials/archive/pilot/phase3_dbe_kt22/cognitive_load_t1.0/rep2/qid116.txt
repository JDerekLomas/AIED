ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The formal definition of equivalence for sets of functional dependencies (Σ1 ≡ Σ2 if and only if Σ1⁺ = Σ2⁺).
2. Procedural knowledge: The algorithm to determine if one set of FDs covers another (computing closures).
3. Logical condition (Σ1 covers Σ2): Testing if A → C and B → C can be derived from {A → B, B → C}.
4. Logical condition (Σ2 covers Σ1): Testing if A → B and B → C can be derived from {A → C, B → C}.
5. Distinguishing concepts: Recognizing that while Σ1 and Σ2 both imply B → C and A → C (via transitivity in Σ1), they are not identical in their ability to derive A → B.
6. Transitivity rule: Applying A → B and B → C implies A → C.
7. Evaluation of the specific counter-example: Realizing that in Σ2, the attribute B is not reachable from A.
