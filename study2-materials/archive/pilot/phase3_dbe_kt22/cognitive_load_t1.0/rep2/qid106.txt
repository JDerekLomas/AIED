ELEMENTS:
1.  **Distinguishing between entity and attribute**: Recalling the conceptual difference between a standalone object and a property of an object.
2.  **Multivalued attribute definition**: Recognizing that "one or more specialities" implies a cardinality that standard single-valued attributes cannot hold.
3.  **Weak entity constraints**: Evaluating if "speciality" has its own independent properties or if it only exists as a dependent extension of "trainer" (identifying relationship).
4.  **Information filtering (Noise reduction)**: Isolating the specific sentences regarding trainers and specialities from a dense paragraph containing unrelated details about administrators, technicians, equipment, and classes.
5.  **Relational mapping rules**: Mentally testing how each option (A, B, C, D) would be implemented in a schema to determine which is "best" (most normalized/efficient) for the specific requirement.
