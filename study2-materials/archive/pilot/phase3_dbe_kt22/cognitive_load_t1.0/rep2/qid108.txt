2. Logical evaluation of Option A (Temporal constraint: "start date < end date").
3. Logical evaluation of Option B (Frequency constraint: "at least twice a year").
4. Logical evaluation of Option C (Cardinality "one trainer" vs. Participation "not all trainers").
5. Logical evaluation of Option D (Domain/Attribute constraint: "three status types").
6. Distinguishing between relationship cardinality (representable) and complex data integrity rules (non-representable in standard ER).
