3. Distinguishing between "lossless-join" and "dependency-preserving" properties as distinct constraints.
4. Recall of the uniqueness (or lack thereof) of decompositions based on different sets of Functional Dependencies ($\Sigma$).
5. Evaluating the logical truth of existential claims (the existence of an algorithm) versus universal claims (uniqueness for any $R$ and $\Sigma$).
