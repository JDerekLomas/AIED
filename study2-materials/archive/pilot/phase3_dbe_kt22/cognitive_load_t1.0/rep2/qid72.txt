1. SQL Syntax Recall: Understanding the `SELECT` and `FROM` clauses.
2. Logical Operator Processing: Evaluating the `OR` condition (inclusive logic).
3. Data Matching: Scanning the (implied) `Study` table for rows matching `StudentID = 102`.
4. Data Matching: Scanning the (implied) `Study` table for rows matching `StudentID = 103`.
5. Set Aggregation: Combining the identified rows to determine the total count.
6. Distinction between Projection and Cardinality: Recognizing that the number of rows is independent of the `CourseNo` column being selected (unless `DISTINCT` was used).
