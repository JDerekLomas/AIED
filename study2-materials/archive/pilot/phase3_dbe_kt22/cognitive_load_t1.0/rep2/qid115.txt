ELEMENTS: 
1. **Definition of Logical Entailment ($\Sigma \vDash X \rightarrow Y$):** Recalling that the dependency must hold in every relation instance that satisfies $\Sigma$.
2. **Closure Algorithm ($X^+$):** Recalling the procedural steps to compute the attribute closure of the left-hand side ($D$).
3. **Set Membership Rule:** Understanding that $D \rightarrow AC$ is entailed if and only if $\{A, C\} \subseteq D^+$.
4. **Step 1 of Procedure:** Initializing the result set $D^+ = \{D\}$.
5. **Step 2 of Procedure (Rule 3):** Evaluating $D \rightarrow ABC$ against $\{D\}$, updating $D^+$ to $\{A, B, C, D\}$.
6. **Step 3 of Procedure (Rule 1/2):** Checking if any other rules ($A \rightarrow B$ or $B \rightarrow C$) add new attributes (they are already present).
7. **Subset Evaluation:** Comparing the final closure $\{A, B, C, D\}$ against the target attributes $\{A, C\}$.
8. **Boolean Mapping:** Concluding that since the subset condition is met, the statement is "True".
