ELEMENTS:
1. SQL Syntax for Table Creation: Recognizing the `CREATE TABLE` keyword structure and parentheses usage.
2. Delimiter Requirements: Distinguishing between the use of commas (`,`) to separate column definitions versus semicolons (`;`).
3. Data Type Mapping: Mapping the conceptual type `STRING` from the prompt to the SQL implementation `VARCHAR`.
4. Statement Termination Rules: Identifying that a standard SQL statement must end with a semicolon (`;`) rather than a comma (`,`) or no terminator at all.
5. Visual Pattern Matching: Discriminating between three nearly identical strings of text to find the specific syntactic difference at the end of the line.
