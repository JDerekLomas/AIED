ELEMENTS:
1. **SQL Syntax Rules**: Recognizing that a comma-separated list in the `FROM` clause indicates a Cross Join (Cartesian Product) before filtering.
2. **Table Relationships**: Identifying the primary key-foreign key relationship between `Course` and `Enrol` via `CourseNo`.
3. **Implicit Schemas**: Recalling or inferring the structure of the `Course` and `Enrol` tables to identify which table contains the `Year` attribute.
4. **Logical Condition (Join)**: Evaluating the equality constraint `Course.CourseNo = Enrol.CourseNo` to filter the Cartesian product.
5. **Logical Condition (Filter)**: Evaluating the selection constraint `Year = 2018`.
6. **Data Processing/Counting**: Holding the intermediate result of filtered rows in memory to produce a final count.
7. **Procedural Execution**: Executing the conceptual order of operations (From -> Where -> Select).
