ELEMENTS:
1. SQL Syntax Recognition: Identifying the `PRIMARY KEY` and `FOREIGN KEY...REFERENCES` clauses within the DDL statements.
2. Definition Recall: Retrieving the specific definition of "referential integrity" (as opposed to entity integrity).
3. Table Relationship Mapping: Identifying "Student" as the parent/referenced table and "Enrol" as the child/referencing table.
4. Logical Evaluation of Constraint Direction: Determining that the foreign key ensures the child's value exists in the parent, not vice versa.
5. Distinction between Concepts: Distinguishing between a Referential Integrity constraint (Option A) and a Not Null/Entity Integrity constraint (Options C and D).
6. Distinguishing Directionality: Evaluating Option A against Option B (the inverse relationship).
