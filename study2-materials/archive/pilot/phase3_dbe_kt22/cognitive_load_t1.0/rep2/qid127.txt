ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Definition of a "prime attribute" (an attribute that is part of at least one candidate key).
2. Definition recall: Definition of a "candidate key" (a minimal superkey).
3. Logical evaluation: Applying the Transitive Property/Closure rules to the set of Functional Dependencies (Σ) to find all possible keys.
4. Procedural step: Determining the closure of attribute A ({A}+ = {A, B, C}).
5. Procedural step: Determining the closure of attribute B ({B}+ = {B, C, A}).
6. Procedural step: Determining the closure of attribute C ({C}+ = {C, A, B}).
7. Comparison: Checking if each attribute (A, B, and C) belongs to the set of identified candidate keys ({A}, {B}, {C}).
8. Distinction: Differentiating between a single primary key and the set of all candidate keys.
