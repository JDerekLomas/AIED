ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of Cartesian product (understanding that A x B results in a set of ordered pairs).
2. Construction of the set A x B (forming all combinations of {1, 2} and {a, b}).
3. Construction of the set C x D (forming all combinations of {1, 2, 3} and {a, b, c}).
4. Definition of the subset relation (checking if every element in the first set is present in the second).
5. Comparing specific ordered pairs (e.g., verifying if (1, a) is in both sets).
