ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of logical entailment ($\Sigma_1 \models \Sigma_2$): Understanding that all dependencies in $\Sigma_2$ must be derivable from $\Sigma_1$.
2. Armstrong’s Axioms/Transitivity Rule: Recognizing that if $A \to B$ and $B \to C$, then $A \to C$.
3. Evaluation of $A \to C$ against $\Sigma_1$: Testing if the first dependency of $\Sigma_2$ holds in $\Sigma_1$ (True via transitivity).
4. Evaluation of $B \to C$ against $\Sigma_1$: Testing if the second dependency of $\Sigma_2$ holds in $\Sigma_1$ (True via direct match).
5. Closure calculation ($X^+$): The procedural knowledge required to verify the entailment for each functional dependency.
6. Distinction between Equivalence and Entailment: Ensuring they only check if $\Sigma_1$ implies $\Sigma_2$, not necessarily the reverse.
