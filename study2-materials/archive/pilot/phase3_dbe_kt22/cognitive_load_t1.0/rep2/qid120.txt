ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of equivalence (Σ1 covers Σ2 and Σ2 covers Σ1).
2. Transitivity rule (Armstrong's Axioms): If A→B and B is part of AB, does A→C follow from Σ1?
3. Augmentation rule: Understanding how AB→C differs from A→C.
4. Attribute Closure algorithm: Calculating {A}+ under Σ1 (A+ = {A, B, C}).
5. Attribute Closure algorithm: Calculating {A}+ under Σ2 (A+ = {A, B, C}).
6. Comparison step: Checking if the closure of the LHS of each dependency in Σ1 satisfies the RHS in Σ2.
7. Comparison step: Checking if the closure of the LHS of each dependency in Σ2 satisfies the RHS in Σ1.
8. Logical evaluation: Recognizing that if A→B and A→C, then A→BC (Union rule), and since A→BC implies AB→C (Decomposition/Augmentation), the sets are equivalent.
