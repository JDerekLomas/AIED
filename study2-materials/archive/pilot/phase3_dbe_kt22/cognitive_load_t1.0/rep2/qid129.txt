ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of a Candidate Key (CK): Must be a superkey and minimal.
2. Attribute closure procedure: Knowing how to calculate $\{A\}^+$.
3. Functional Dependency (FD) evaluation: Applying $A \to BCD$ to determine $\{A\}^+ = \{A, B, C, D\}$.
4. Identification of "prime" attributes: Recognizing that $A$ is a CK.
5. Search for alternative keys: Checking other attributes or combinations (e.g., $CD$).
6. Logical negation: Understanding that "only" requires proving no other set of attributes is a CK.
7. Attribute closure of $CD$: Applying $CD \to AB$ to find $\{C, D\}^+ = \{C, D, A, B\}$.
8. Comparison of sets: Determining if $\{C, D\}$ is minimal and satisfies the CK definition, thereby falsifying the "only" claim.
