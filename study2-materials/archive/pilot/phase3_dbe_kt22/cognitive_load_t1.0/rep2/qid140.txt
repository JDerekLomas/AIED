ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The formal definition of Third Normal Form (3NF) regarding transitive dependencies.
2. Definition recall: The formal definition of Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) regarding determinants being candidate keys.
3. Comparative hierarchy: Understanding the subset relationship between normal forms (BCNF ⊂ 3NF).
4. Conceptual distinction: Differentiating between "minimizing" redundancy and "eliminating" redundancy in the context of functional dependencies.
5. Evaluation of logical truth: Assessing the validity of Option A (identifying that BCNF is actually the stricter form).
6. Evaluation of logical truth: Assessing the validity of Option B vs C (recognizing that 3NF allows certain redundancies that BCNF or higher forms address).
