ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Distinction between an "Entity Type" vs. an "Attribute" or "Relationship".
2. Logic evaluation: Filtering out "Fitness centre" as a singleton/context rather than a collection of instances.
3. Attribute identification: Recognizing "Equipment ID" as a primary key/attribute of an entity, not an entity itself.
4. Multi-valued attribute recognition: Evaluating "Trainers' speciality" as a property of a trainer (even if multi-valued) rather than a standalone entity in this context.
5. Cardinality analysis: Understanding that a "Fitness class" has its own unique attributes (name, dates, slots) and relationships with trainers and members.
6. Constraint processing: Filtering through the distractors of the business rules (dates, status types, maintenance frequency) to identify the core objects.
7. Class hierarchy recognition: Understanding the specialization of "Employee" and how it relates to the potential entity types.
