ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of a Functional Dependency (FD): Recall how the arrow notation represents relationships.
2. Candidate Key identification: Determine the closure of attributes (specifically finding that {A}+ = {A,B,C}) to identify the primary/candidate key.
3. Definition of 3NF: Recall the two-part condition (either the left side is a superkey OR the right side is a prime attribute).
4. Definition of BCNF: Recall the stricter condition (every determinant must be a superkey).
5. Transitive Dependency recognition: Identify that B → C represents a transitive dependency because B is not a superkey.
6. Logical Evaluation of A → B: Test it against 3NF/BCNF rules.
7. Logical Evaluation of B → C: Test it against 3NF/BCNF rules.
8. Boolean Comparison: Synthesize the findings to match the specific "X and not Y" structures in the multiple-choice options.
