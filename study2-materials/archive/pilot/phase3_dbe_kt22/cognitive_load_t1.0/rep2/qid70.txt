To evaluate this question, we must consider the specific cognitive load placed on a South African undergraduate student who may be navigating both technical syntax and the specific data state of the "Study" table (which is implied but not provided in your prompt; for this analysis, I am assuming the students are looking at a provided schema/table instance).

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **SQL Syntax Recognition:** Identifying the `SELECT *` and `FROM` structure.
2.  **Function Application:** Understanding that `lower()` transforms the column data to lowercase.
3.  **Literal Comparison:** Recognizing that the string literal `'tom'` is already in lowercase.
4.  **Case-Sensitivity Logic:** Distinguishing how the DBMS handles the equality operator when a function is applied (e.g., 'Tom' vs 'tom').
5.  **Data Retrieval/Scanning:** Mentally (or visually) scanning the `Name` column in the provided `Study` table.
6.  **Counting/Aggregation:** Keeping a running tally of matches that satisfy the `WHERE` condition to arrive at the final integer.

**ELEMENT COUNT: 6**

**Estimation Rationale:**
In the South African context, many students struggle with "hidden" logic like case sensitivity in SQL (which varies between MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server). If the provided table contains "Tom" or "TOM", a novice student often misses the transformation required by `lower()`. While the syntax is simple, the "trick" lies in the interaction between the data values and the function. For those with minimal exposure, the jump from "reading a table" to "applying a functional transformation while scanning" often leads to off-by-one errors or selecting 0.

Your estimate:
0.72
