ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of "Minimal Cover" (canonical cover) and its three requirements: no redundant FDs, no redundant attributes (left-hand side), and every FD in standard form (singleton right-hand side).
2. Distinction between "Equivalence" ($\Sigma1 \equiv \Sigma2$) and "Minimal Cover" status (a minimal cover must be equivalent, but not all equivalent sets are minimal covers).
3. Logical evaluation of $A \rightarrow B$ (present in both sets).
4. Logical evaluation of functional dependency transitivity/augmentation: Can $A \rightarrow C$ be derived from $\{A \rightarrow B, AB \rightarrow C\}$? (Yes, via $A \rightarrow AB$ and $AB \rightarrow C$).
5. Logical evaluation of reverse entailment: Can $AB \rightarrow C$ be derived from $\{A \rightarrow B, A \rightarrow C\}$? (Yes, via $A \rightarrow C$ and decomposition/augmentation).
6. Procedural step: Checking if $\Sigma1$ is minimal (it is not, as $B$ is extraneous in $AB \rightarrow C$ given $A \rightarrow B$).
7. Comparison of the two sets: Recognizing that while $\Sigma2$ is a minimal cover for $\Sigma1$, the question asks if it *is* a minimal cover, requiring simultaneous validation of equivalence and minimality rules.
