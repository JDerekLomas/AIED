To evaluate this question from the perspective of Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), we must identify the interacting elements required to solve it. While the question appears simple, for an undergraduate student, it requires synthesizing several discrete pieces of information.

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **SQL Syntax Recognition:** Identifying that `SELECT` and `FROM` are keywords defining an operation and a source.
2.  **Schema Mapping:** Linking the table name `Study` to the provided dataset (assuming the schema was provided in the context of the assessment).
3.  **Projection Logic:** Understanding that selecting specific columns (`StudentID`, `Name`) affects the *width* (attributes) but not the *height* (cardinality) of the result set.
4.  **Absence of Filtering:** Recognizing the lack of a `WHERE` clause, which means no rows are excluded.
5.  **Counting Procedure:** Accurately tallying the records present in the source table `Study`.

**ELEMENT COUNT: 5**

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**
This is a foundational "knowledge and comprehension" level question. Most students will correctly identify that a `SELECT` statement without a `WHERE` clause returns all rows. However, students with minimal exposure sometimes confuse columns with rows or expect the query to "collapse" duplicates if they have just been introduced to the concept of sets. In a South African undergraduate context with diverse prior exposure, most will succeed on this item as it tests a singular, basic retrieval operation.
