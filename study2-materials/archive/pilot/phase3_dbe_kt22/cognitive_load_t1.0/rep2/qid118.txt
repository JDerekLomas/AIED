ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of logical entailment ($\models$) in functional dependencies (FDs).
2. Syntax and notation of sets of FDs ($\Sigma$).
3. Armstrong’s Axioms or the Transitivity Rule (to evaluate $A \to C$ from $\Sigma_1$).
4. Attribute Closure algorithm (calculating $\{A\}^+$ under $\Sigma_2$).
5. Comparison logic: Checking if every FD in $\Sigma_1$ is satisfied by $\Sigma_2$.
6. Identifying the specific counter-example: $\Sigma_2$ cannot derive $A \to B$.
7. Distinction between equivalence ($\equiv$) and entailment ($\models$).
