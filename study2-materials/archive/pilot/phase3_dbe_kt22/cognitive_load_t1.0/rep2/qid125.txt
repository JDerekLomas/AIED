ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Candidate Key (uniqueness and minimality).
2. Definition recall: Functional Dependency (FD) and Attribute Closure.
3. Rule application: Reflexivity/Augmentation (understanding how to combine A and B to reach C).
4. Procedural step: Computing the closure of {A} ($A^+ = \{A, B\}$).
5. Evaluation of logical condition: Does $\{A\}^+$ contain all attributes in R? (No, C is missing).
6. Procedural step: Computing the closure of {AB} or identifying other combinations.
7. Constraint satisfaction: Determining if a superkey is minimal.
8. Distinction: Distinguishing between a Prime Attribute and a Candidate Key.
9. Logical evaluation: Comparing the result of the closure $(A \to B \implies \{A\}^+=\{A,B\})$ against the requirement for $R=\{A,B,C\}$.
