ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: The specific definition of the "Entity Integrity Constraint."
2. SQL/Relational constraint logic: Understanding the "NOT NULL" requirement as it applies to primary keys.
3. Composite key logic: Recognizing that the constraint applies to *all* components of a composite key {StudentID, CourseNo, Semester}, not just the set as a whole or a single attribute.
4. Distinguishing between similar concepts: Differentiating between Entity Integrity (primary keys) and Referential Integrity (foreign keys).
5. Evaluation of logical quantifiers: Comparing "At least one" (Option A) vs "None" (Option B) vs "All" (Option C) in a Boolean context.
