ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of a database view as a virtual table.
2. Recall of the specific rule regarding authorization and privilege propagation (granting/revoking).
3. Distinguishing between ownership of a base table versus ownership of a view.
4. Evaluating the "always" constraint in Option A (negated by views that are read-only or lack base table permissions).
5. Evaluating the "always" constraint in Option B (negated by the requirement that a view must be updatable by its definition, such as lacking joins or aggregations).
6. Logical distinction between "all privileges" and "subset of privileges" based on the underlying schema permissions.
7. Identifying the nuance of "not necessarily" as the correct legal state in SQL standards.
