ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of the set difference operator ($A - D$): removing elements of $D$ from $A$.
2. Definition of the set difference operator ($B - C$): removing elements of $C$ from $B$.
3. Definition of the intersection operator ($\cap$): identifying common elements between two resulting sets.
4. Set $A$ members $\{2, 3, 4, 5\}$ and Set $D$ members $\{8, 9, 10, 11\}$ to evaluate $(A - D)$.
5. Set $B$ members $\{4, 5, 6, 7\}$ and Set $C$ members $\{6, 7, 8, 9\}$ to evaluate $(B - C)$.
6. Intermediate result storage: Holding $\{2, 3, 4, 5\}$ in memory.
7. Intermediate result storage: Holding $\{4, 5\}$ in memory.
8. Comparison logic: Matching $\{2, 3, 4, 5\}$ against $\{4, 5\}$ to find the intersection.
