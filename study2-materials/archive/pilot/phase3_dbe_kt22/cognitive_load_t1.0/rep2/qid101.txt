ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Distinction between "Partial" vs "Total" participation constraints.
2. Entity identification: Locating the "Member" entity within the narrative.
3. Entity identification: Locating the "Fitness Class" entity within the narrative.
4. Relationship identification: Isolating the "Participate" relationship from other interactions (like "Add Associate" or "Choose Trainer").
5. Logical evaluation: Processing the specific phrase "A member may choose to participate in one or more fitness classes."
6. Constraint mapping: Determining if the "may choose" modal verb implies that participation is optional (0 to many) or mandatory (1 to many) for every instance of a member.
7. Filtering: Disregarding significant "noise" or distractors in the text (technicians, equipment, administrators, date constraints) that are irrelevant to this specific cardinality sub-question.
