As an instructor, I would classify this as a **low element interactivity** question. It primarily tests the recognition of a single keyword (`DISTINCT`) and the application of a simple counting procedure on a small data set.

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **SQL Syntax Recall:** Understanding that `SELECT [Column] FROM [Table]` retrieves data from a specific column.
2.  **Keyword Definition (`DISTINCT`):** Recalling that this operator filters out duplicate values, leaving only unique occurrences.
3.  **Data Scanning/Set Evaluation:** Mentally processing the list of values in the `CourseNo` column to identify unique entries.
4.  **Logical Counting:** Tracking the number of unique elements found while ignoring repeats.

**ELEMENT COUNT: 4**

Given the diverse background of South African undergraduate students, most will find this manageable if they have attended the introductory lectures. The primary "trap" for weaker students is ignoring the `DISTINCT` keyword and simply counting all rows in the table.

**Your estimate:**
0.85
