As an instructor, I have evaluated this question based on the Cognitive Load Theory framework, specifically focusing on element interactivity.

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **Textual Filtering:** Navigating a dense paragraph of requirements to locate the specific entity ("administrator").
2.  **Entity-Attribute Mapping:** Identifying which attributes are explicitly associated with the administrator in the text (Name, Address, ID, Landline).
3.  **Inheritance/ISA Relationship Logic:** Recognizing that "administrator" is a subtype of "employee" and therefore inherits the properties of the supertype.
4.  **Concept Recall (Primary Key):** Recalling the definition of a "key attribute" (uniqueness and non-nullity).
5.  **Constraint Evaluation:** Distinguishing between a unique identifier (ID) and a shared or non-unique attribute (Landline, Name, Address) within the context of the business rules.
6.  **Distractor Discrimination:** Evaluating whether a landline (specifically mentioned for administrators) or the inherited ID serves as the formal key.

**ELEMENT COUNT: 6**

**Instructor’s Note:** While the text is long, the question is a "needle in a haystack" task. Stronger students will immediately look for the "Employee" attributes to find the ID. Weaker students often get "lost in the noise" of the classes and equipment descriptions or mistakenly choose "Landline" because it is the only attribute unique to the administrator paragraph. In the South African context, where English is often a second language for many students, the linguistic density of the prompt increases the perceived interactivity.

**Your estimate:**
0.72
