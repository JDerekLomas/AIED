ELEMENTS:
1. SQL Syntax Knowledge: Understanding the `SELECT *`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` structure.
2. Subquery Execution Logic: Recognizing that the inner query must be evaluated before the outer query.
3. Join Logic/Relationship: Understanding the foreign key relationship between `Enrol` and `Course` via `CourseNo`.
4. The `IN` Operator: Evaluating the membership condition between a set of values and a column.
5. Missing Data Values: Since the specific table data (the instances) is not provided in the prompt text, the student must realize they cannot solve this without a schema instance/diagram, or they must search for an associated diagram from their course materials.
6. Semantic Distinction: Distinguishing between the number of courses (usually 1 for a specific name) and the number of enrollments (potentially many).
