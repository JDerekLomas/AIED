As an instructor, I would evaluate this question as follows:

**ELEMENTS:**
1.  **Definition Recall (Superkey):** Recalling the formal definition of a superkey (a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple).
2.  **Definition Recall (Candidate Key):** Recalling the specific constraint of a candidate key (a minimal superkey) to evaluate Option C.
3.  **Terminology Distinction (Attribute vs. Tuple):** Distinguishing between columns and rows to identify the direction of identification in Option B.
4.  **Terminology Distinction (Relation vs. Tuple):** Distinguishing between the schema/table level and the record level to evaluate Option D.
5.  **Logical Evaluation:** Comparing each distractor against the retrieved definition to identify subtle inaccuracies (e.g., "identifying an attribute" vs "identifying a tuple").

**ELEMENT COUNT: 5**

**RATIONALE:** 
While this is a multiple-choice question, it requires more than simple recognition. Students must navigate "word salad" distractors that swap key database terms (tuple, attribute, relation). In a South African undergraduate context, students often struggle with the precise English terminology used in database theory. While the concept is foundational, the similarity of the options increases the cognitive load as they must hold the definitions of three different entities (Superkey, Candidate Key, and Tuple) in memory simultaneously to eliminate the incorrect choices.
