ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall: Recalling the core mechanism of Discretionary Access Control (DAC) versus Mandatory Access Control (MAC) or Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
2. Concept distinction: Distinguishing between identity-based access (DAC) and attribute/label-based access (MAC).
3. Logical evaluation of vulnerability: Understanding the mechanism of a Trojan Horse attack (where a process inherits the user's permissions regardless of the data's sensitivity).
4. Distractor discrimination: Evaluating the validity of "certificates" (Option B) versus "roles" (Option D) as the defining characteristic of DAC.
5. Syntax/Semantic matching: Identifying that the vulnerability stems from the system relying *only* on identity without global constraints on information flow.
