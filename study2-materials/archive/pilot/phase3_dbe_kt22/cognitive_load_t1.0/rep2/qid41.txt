1. Definition recall: The mathematical definition of a relation as a set (unordered) versus a list (ordered).

3. Distinguishing between horizontal components (tuples/rows) and vertical components (attributes/columns).
4. Logical evaluation: Mapping the "Important/Not important" status to both components simultaneously to select the correct pair.
