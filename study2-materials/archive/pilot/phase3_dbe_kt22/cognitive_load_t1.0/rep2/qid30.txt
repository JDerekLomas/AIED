ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of Cartesian product (understanding how to form ordered pairs from sets)
2. Evaluation of set A x B (generating 4 pairs)
3. Evaluation of set C x D (generating 9 pairs)
4. Definition of Set Difference (understanding that elements of the second set are removed from the first)
5. Comparison/Matching logic (systematically identifying which pairs in C x D exist in A x B to exclude them)
6. Set Membership verification (recognizing that set A is a subset of C and B is a subset of D, making the subtraction straightforward)
7. Distinguishing between the correct resulting set and distractors (A and B)
