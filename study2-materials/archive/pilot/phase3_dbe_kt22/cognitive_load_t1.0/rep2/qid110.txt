ELEMENTS: 
1. Recall of the definition of attribute closure (the set of all attributes functionally determined by a starting set).
2. Knowledge of the reflexivity rule (A determines itself).
3. Evaluation of the first dependency (A → B): checking if the left-hand side is in the current set and adding the right-hand side.
4. Evaluation of the second dependency (B → C): checking if the new attribute B allows for the inclusion of C.
5. Evaluation of the third dependency (D → ABC): checking if D is present in the current set (logical condition evaluation).
6. Execution of the iterative procedure (continuing until no more attributes can be added).
7. Comparison of the final calculated set {A, B, C} against the provided multiple-choice options.
