ELEMENTS:
1. Recall and application of the Union operator (A ∪ C): combining elements of both sets while removing duplicates.
2. Recall and application of the Proper Subset operator (⊂): identifying that all elements of the first set must be in the second, and the first set cannot be equal to the second.
3. Mental storage of Set A's elements.
4. Mental storage of Set B's elements.
5. Mental storage of Set C's elements.
6. Execution of the union operation result: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
7. Logical comparison of the resulting set against Set B ({3, 5, 7}) to evaluate the subset condition.
