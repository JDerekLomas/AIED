ELEMENTS: 
1. Definition of attribute closure (the concept that $X^+$ is the set of all attributes functionally determined by $X$).
2. Syntax/Notation of functional dependencies ($\Sigma$).
3. Initial state of the result set (starting with $D$).
4. Identification of the FD $D \to ABC$.
5. Application of the Transitive Rule or Decomposition Rule (inferring $D \to A$, $D \to B$, $D \to C$).
6. Set union operation (combining $\{D\}$ and $\{A, B, C\}$).
7. Evaluation of termination (checking if any other FDs like $A \to B$ or $B \to C$ add new attributes not already present).
