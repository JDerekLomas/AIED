ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of Set A (retrieval of specific members).
2. Definition of Set C (retrieval of specific members).
3. Set Intersection operation (A ∩ C): identifying common elements between A and C.
4. Definition of Set B (retrieval of specific members).
5. Proper Subset definition (⊄): understanding the condition for one set NOT being a subset of another.
6. Logical Evaluation: comparing the resulting intersection {3, 5, 7, 9} against Set B {3, 5, 7}.
7. Boolean Logic Mapping: determining if the statement B ⊄ (A ∩ C) is true or false (recognizing that because B is a subset, the "not a subset" statement is False).

ELEMENT COUNT: 7
