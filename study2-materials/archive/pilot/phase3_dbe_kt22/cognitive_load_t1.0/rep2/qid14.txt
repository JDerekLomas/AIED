ELEMENTS:
1. Definition of the Cartesian Product ($A \times B$): Understanding that the first element of each tuple belongs to set $A$ and the second to set $B$.
2. Identifying elements of set $A$: Extracting the unique first components from the given tuples $\{(2, 3, 4)\}$.
3. Identifying elements of set $B$: Extracting the unique second components from the given tuples $\{(5, 7)\}$.
4. Cardinality constraint: Verifying that $|A| \times |B| = 3 \times 2 = 6$, matching the problem statement.
5. Systematic construction: Generating all possible pairs from $\{2, 3, 4\}$ and $\{5, 7\}$ to form the full set.
6. Pattern matching/Verification: Comparing the constructed set against the four multiple-choice options to identify the exact match (Option C).
