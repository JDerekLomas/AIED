ELEMENTS:
1. Definition recall of ER diagram components (Entities, Attributes, Relationships).
2. Definition recall of a Primary Key (uniqueness and notation in ER, usually underlining).
3. Definition recall of a Foreign Key (referential integrity and how it is implicitly represented by a relationship line rather than an explicit attribute).
4. Definition recall of a Domain Constraint (data types/ranges).
5. Distinction between structural constraints (captured graphically) vs. integrity constraints (captured in DDL/schema).
6. Evaluation of the options against the visual capabilities of standard ER notation.
