**Contrastive Analysis of Question Difficulty:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic understanding of nouns and count nouns (apples).
    *   Basic understanding of quantity words (some, any).
    *   Implicit understanding of positive vs. negative/interrogative sentence structures, even if not explicitly taught in grammatical terms.
    *   Crucially, this relies on a *native speaker-like intuition* or explicit grammatical rule knowledge for 'some' in affirmative sentences and 'any' in negative/interrogative ones.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "apples," "basket" are very basic, likely familiar even to students with limited English. "There are" is also a common, simple construction.
    *   **Grammar:** The challenge lies entirely in the grammatical choice between "some" and "any." While "some" is often used naturally, the distinction can be tricky. Students might guess if they don't have explicit instruction or sufficient exposure to internalize the rule. The prompt is short and syntactically simple, reducing processing load beyond the target grammar point.
    *   **Reading Comprehension:** Minimal, as the sentence is very short and uses basic vocabulary.

3.  **Nature of the Task:**
    *   This is an **application** of a specific grammatical rule (or an intuitive understanding of usage). It's not recall of facts, nor complex reasoning. It's a fill-in-the-blank choice that tests correct word usage in a common sentence structure.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very common type of exercise in elementary English language learning textbooks, particularly those focusing on determiners and quantifiers. It's usually introduced relatively early, as "some/any" is fundamental for expressing quantity.
    *   However, "typical textbook exercises" in an Indian government school context might be limited by teaching quality, availability of supplementary materials, and opportunities for spoken English practice which helps naturalize such distinctions. If teachers merely explain a rule without sufficient practice, mastery will be low.
    *   Compared to the anchors:
        *   **Lower than 5% & 15% (analytical/descriptive tasks):** It's far less demanding than writing a theme or differentiating between historical sources. Those require complex thought, multi-sentence production, and higher-order reasoning. This is a single, isolated grammatical choice.
        *   **Comparable to or Slightly Easier than 30% (paragraph writing):** The "My favorite season" task requires sentence generation, organization, and a longer output, which is generally harder than choosing a single word.
        *   **Similar to 50% (recall facts from story):** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" requires recall and translation/rephrasing. "Some/any" is also a form of recall (of a grammatical rule) or recognition based on practice. This item is simpler in output requirement.
        *   **Potentially harder than 66% (name two Fundamental Rights):** Naming fundamental rights might be rote memorization from a Civics lesson. While simple in output, it relies on content memorization. The "some/any" task relies on a more abstract linguistic rule that requires understanding context, even if the context is simple.

**Key Factors Driving the Estimate:**

*   **Simplicity of vocabulary and sentence structure:** Low bar for reading comprehension.
*   **Fundamental grammar point:** 'Some'/'any' is usually taught early in English grammar.
*   **Economic Background & Hindi-Medium:** This is the most significant dampener. While "some/any" is basic, the *nuance* between them can be very hard for non-native speakers, especially if explicit grammar instruction is weak or opportunities for naturalistic language exposure are limited. Rote memorization of a rule (e.g., "some for positive, any for negative/question") can lead to correctness if drilled, but without it, it's guesswork.
*   **Average pass rate (29%):** The overall exam is quite challenging for this demographic. This suggests that even seemingly simple items can trip students up due to the general low proficiency level.

**Estimate Justification:**

Many students will likely make a 50/50 guess, and some may have learned the rule through instruction. However, the lack of strong English environment and potentially inconsistent grammar instruction means that the intuitive grasp needed for "some/any" will not be universal. The task is simple, but the specific grammatical point requires either explicit knowledge or a level of fluency unlikely to be widespread. It's more of an applied knowledge item than a pure recall. It's simpler than the 30% anchor, but likely less straightforward
