This is a fairly straightforward application of a geometric formula. Let's break down the factors affecting its difficulty for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering the provided anchors and context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students need to know the formula for the area of a triangle (`1/2 * base * height`). This is typically introduced in Class 6 or 7. They also need basic multiplication and division by 2.
    *   **Comparison to anchors:**
        *   The 5% and 15% items are *much* higher-order thinking or demand more complex recall/differentiation. The 5% item requires deep textual understanding and abstract thought (theme). The 15% item requires differentiating concepts with specific examples, involving both recall and understanding.
        *   The 30% item ("My favorite season") is descriptive writing, testing language and creativity, not a specific factual recall or application.
        *   The 50% item ("three questions the king wanted to answer") is direct recall from a story. This is closer in *type* (recall/direct application) but still relies on memory of specific plot points.
        *   The 66% item ("Fundamental Rights") is direct recall of facts taught in Social Science. This is the closest in *cognitive demand* (recall/simple application) to the triangle area problem, as both require knowing a specific piece of information and then potentially applying it.

*   **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   "Find the area of a triangle whose base is `8` cm and height is `6` cm."
    *   This is very clear and uses common mathematical terminology: "area," "triangle," "base," "height." The numbers are digits, not spelled out.
    *   **Comparison to anchors:**
        *   The language in the anchors varies greatly. The 5% (theme of poem) and 15% (differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources) items have significant language demands, both for understanding the prompt and articulating a complex answer.
        *   The 30% (favorite season) has moderate language demands for expressing ideas.
        *   The 50% (king's questions) and 66% (fundamental rights) have relatively low language demands for understanding the prompt, though providing a correct answer in English might still be a minor hurdle.
    *   For the current question, the language barrier should be minimal for students who have studied mathematics in English or even those who translate "area," "base," and "height" mentally. These are fundamental terms.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily an **application** question. Students need to recall the formula and apply it using the given numbers.
    *   There's no complex reasoning required, unlike the 5% (theme) or 15% (differentiation) items.
    *   It's less direct recall than the 50% or 66% items, as it involves a calculation step, not just stating a fact.

*   **Difficulty compared to typical textbook exercises:**
    *   This is a quintessential "type 1" problem for area of a triangle. It's usually among the first few examples or practice problems after introducing the formula. It's considered very basic. Textbooks would immediately follow with problems where students have to derive base/height from context, or work backward to find base/height given the area, which are more challenging.

**Synthesizing the analysis:**

*   **Positive factors (making it easier):**
    *   Low language demands; very standard mathematical phrasing.
    *   Direct application of a single, well-known formula.
    *   Simple arithmetic (multiplication, division by 2).
    *   Highly standard textbook problem type.
    *   Max score is 1, so partial credit isn't a factor, just correctness of the formula/result.
*   **Negative factors (making it harder):**
    *   Reliance on remembering *the* specific formula, which might be an issue for some.
    *   Even simple arithmetic can introduce errors for a proportion of students.
    *   Overall low average pass rate (29%) suggests many items are difficult.

Comparing this to the anchors, the current question is significantly easier than the 5%, 15%, and 30% items in terms of cognitive load and English language requirements. It's more similar to the 50% and 66% items in that it relies on recall of specific information (a formula vs. historical facts or constitutional rights) and simple application. However, mathematics formulas tend to be less prone to subtle misinterpretations or
