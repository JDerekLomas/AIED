Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Understanding of place value (hundreds, thousands).
    *   Concept of ascending order (smallest to largest).
    *   Ability to compare multi-digit numbers.
    *   Basic numeracy skills.
    *   This content (ordering multi-digit numbers) is typically introduced and reinforced in Class 3-5 in the Indian curriculum, making it fundamental prior knowledge for Class 6.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   The term "Arrange in ascending order" is the primary language hurdle. While "ascending order" is a mathematical term, it might be translated or commonly understood as "smallest to largest" in a classroom context.
    *   The numbers themselves are presented numerically, so no English number-word recognition is needed.
    *   The prompt is short and direct.
    *   Compared to items like "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources" or "Write a theme or central idea," the language demand is significantly lower. Even "My favorite season" (30%) requires much more generative language use.

3.  **Type of Task (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   This is primarily an **application** task, requiring students to apply their understanding of number comparison and ascending order.
    *   It involves straightforward numerical comparison, not complex reasoning or open-ended generation of ideas. It's more procedural.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This type of question is a very common, foundational exercise found in almost all Class 3-5 mathematics textbooks in India. By Class 6, students are expected to be proficient at this.
    *   The numbers are moderately challenging (4 digits mixed with 3 digits, requiring attention to number of digits first, then place value comparison). There aren't an excessive number of values to arrange.
    *   The specific rubric asks only for "correctly identifying the smallest number (736) and placing it first," which makes the scoring requirement easier than needing the entire sequence correct. Many students who understand the concept but make a minor error elsewhere could still get partial credit for the first number.

**Comparison with Anchors:**

*   **"Theme of poem" (5%):** Very high language demand, abstract reasoning, generative writing. Much harder.
*   **"Archaeological vs. literary sources" (15%):** High language demand, recall of specific social science definitions, analytical comparison. Much harder.
*   **"My favorite season" (30%):** High language demand, creative writing, generative ideas. Harder.
*   **"Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%):** Pure recall from a specific text, but the text might have been fresh in their minds, and it's less language-intensive than generating a paragraph. This math question is likely *easier* than recalling specific lines from a story, as number ordering is a fundamental, practiced skill.
*   **"Two Fundamental Rights" (66%):** Recall of specific factual information. If these are emphasized in civics, it's a straight memorization task. This math question is also highly practiced, and the *rubric for just the first number* is a significant factor. Students often get *some part* right even if they mess up the entire sequence.

**Overall Assessment:**

This question tests a very basic and frequently practiced mathematical skill (number ordering). The language demands are minimal. The numbers are standard for Class 6, and the partial credit rubric (0.5 for just the first number correctly placed) significantly boosts the potential pass rate compared to needing the entire sequence perfect. Students are much more likely to identify the smallest number correctly even if they struggle with the rest of the ascending order. Given the average pass rate is 29%, a question tapping into a core, widely practiced math skill with minimal language and partial credit should be considerably higher.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
