Here's an analysis of the question and my estimated proportion of correct answers:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Decomposition/Composting:** This is the core concept. Students need to understand that organic matter breaks down. This is typically covered in Class 7-8 science, often in chapters about waste management or soil.
    *   **Microorganisms/Bacteria:** While not explicitly asked for, understanding *why* things decompose often involves this prior knowledge.
    *   **Nutrients/Fertilizers:** To understand "beneficial for soil health," students need to connect decomposed organic matter to enriched soil.
    *   **Simple Observation:** The question also tests basic observational skills.

2.  **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Gardener," "waste," "pit," "change," "beneficial," "soil health," "evaluate," "reasons." Most of these are fairly common English words for science contexts, but "evaluate" might be tricky. "Waste" and "pit" should be accessible.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The question has multiple parts: a descriptive setup, two direct questions ("Does gardener notice any change after some days?" and "Give reasons"), and a request for evaluation ("evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health"). This multi-faceted nature adds complexity for comprehension.
    *   **Concision vs. Detail:** The max score is 0.5, implying a relatively concise answer is sufficient. However, getting all parts right (change, reasons, benefit) requires careful reading and structuring the answer, which is a challenge for students with limited English.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Students need to recall the concept of decomposition and its benefits.
    *   **Application:** Applying the knowledge of decomposition to a real-world scenario (a gardener's pit).
    *   **Reasoning/Evaluation:** Students must reason *why* the change happens (decomposition) and *evaluate* its benefit (soil health). This goes beyond simple recall. The "reasons and evaluate" part demands a slightly higher cognitive load than just a yes/no answer.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Setup:** The scenario-based setup ("A gardener has collected waste...") is quite typical of application-based science questions.
    *   **Multi-part Question:** Many textbook questions in Indian syllabi also feature multiple sub-questions or demand both explanation and evaluation.
    *   **Conceptual Depth:** The core concept of decomposition and its benefit to soil is fundamental and usually well-covered. The nuance is in articulating *why* it's beneficial in simple English.
    *   **Open-ended Nature:** "Give reasons and evaluate..." is more open-ended than a fill-in-the-blank or multiple-choice question, demanding a more constructed response, which inherently makes it harder. Students who struggle with English expression might have the scientific knowledge but fail to articulate it clearly enough to score.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Poem Theme):** Requires subjective interpretation and strong English comprehension/expression. Our question is less subjective.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Archaeological vs. Literary Sources):** Requires differentiating two concepts and providing examples, often involving more specific vocabulary and structured comparison. Our question's concepts are more everyday.
*   **Pass Rate 30% ("My favorite season"):** A creative writing task requiring imagination and descriptive language. While English proficiency is key, the subject matter is simple. Our question demands specific scientific understanding *and* explanation. The format (short paragraph) allowed for lower quality answers to still score (e.g., just lists). Our question is more direct about scientific content.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions king wanted to answer):** Direct recall from a story. This is relatively straightforward if the story was read and understood. Our question is *not* direct recall of a text.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Direct recall of a fact. High success rate as it's a core concept. Our question requires reasoning beyond simple recall.

**Key Observations and Final Thoughts:**

*   The core scientific concept (decomposition, composting, benefit to soil) is likely taught.
*   The "reasoning" and "evaluating" aspects push it beyond simple recall.
*   The language, while not excessively academic, requires students to express scientific ideas coherently. The "does gardener notice any change?" might lead to a simple "yes," but scoring likely requires linking that "yes" to "decomposition" or "turning into manure."
*   Given the average exam pass rate of
