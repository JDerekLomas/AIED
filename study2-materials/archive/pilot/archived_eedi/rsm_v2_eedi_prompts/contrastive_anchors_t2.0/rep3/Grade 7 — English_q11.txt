Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion of correct answers:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students need to know what an adjective is and, more specifically, what an "adjective phrase" is. This is a fundamental concept in grammar, usually introduced by Class 7. However, the nuance of distinguishing an "adjective phrase" from a single "adjective" is crucial. The rubric says "The student correctly identifies 'tiny' as an adjective," implying that just identifying "tiny" is sufficient. If they also had to identify it as a "phrase" (which "tiny" on its own is not, it's an adjective *word*), it would be significantly harder. Assuming the rubric is what matters here, just identifying "tiny" is the target.
    *   **Context:** The sentence itself is simple and easy to understand. No complex vocabulary or concepts outside of grammar.
    *   **Comparison:** This is similar to typical grammar exercises found in Class 7 English textbooks, often under chapters like "Parts of Speech" or "Adjectives and Adverbs." It's recall of a grammatical definition/function.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Instruction:** "Identify the adjective phrase" uses direct and common grammatical terminology. While "adjective phrase" might be a mouthful, "adjective" itself is widely taught.
    *   **Sentence:** "A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony." This sentence is very straightforward. "Tiny," "bird," "built," "nest," "balcony" are all high-frequency words that Class 7 students would likely know. There are no idioms, complex sentence structures, or abstract concepts.
    *   **Challenge:** The main challenge is not understanding the *sentence* but understanding the *grammatical term* "adjective phrase" and applying it correctly. If a student only knows "adjective" and not "adjective phrase," they might identify "tiny" but fail to link it to the "phrase" instruction. However, given the rubric focuses on identifying "tiny," this mitigates the "phrase" aspect of the instruction.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of learned grammatical definitions (recall) to a new, simple sentence. There's no higher-order reasoning required.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very standard, mid-level difficulty grammar question for Class 7. It's not as basic as identifying a noun, but it's not as complex as identifying different types of clauses or active/passive voice, which often come later or require more nuanced understanding.
    *   The crucial ambiguity lies in "adjective phrase." A single adjective like "tiny" is technically *not* an adjective phrase (which usually consists of an adjective modifying a noun/pronoun, and possibly followed by a modifier or complement, e.g., "a very tiny bird," "the bird tiny *enough to fit*"). If the strict grammatical definition of "adjective phrase" were enforced, very few students would get it right. However, the rubric explicitly states identifying "tiny" as an adjective is sufficient. This significantly lowers the bar for success.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** This requires comprehension, abstraction, synthesis, and expressing a complex idea. Much harder than the current question.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate sources):** Requires knowing two distinct categories, defining them, and giving examples. Requires more detailed knowledge and structuring an answer. Harder.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (My favorite season):** Requires creative writing, sentence construction, organization, and sustaining a paragraph. This is about written expression and ideation, often challenging for students with limited writing practice in English. Our target question is simpler.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (King's three questions):** This is a specific recall question from a well-known story ("The Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy). It requires reading comprehension and memorization of story details. Our target question requires recalling a grammar rule. It's likely similar or slightly easier because the required answer ("tiny") is a single word, rather than recalling specific clauses/phrases.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Fundamental Rights):** This is a direct recall question of specific factual knowledge (Social Science). Many students likely learn these rights by rote. While similar in being direct recall, grammar can sometimes be perceived as more abstract than a list of rights.

**Considering the Nuance of "Adjective Phrase" vs. "Adjective" for the Rubric:**

If the question truly meant *adjective phrase*
