Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis

**Question:** What are the main occupations of people in the rural areas of Rajasthan? Describe any one in brief.
**Rubric:** Names at least two main occupations correctly (e.g., Agriculture/farming, Animal Husbandry/pastoralism, handicrafts). Max score: 1

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Compared to 5% item (Theme of poem):** Much easier. The poem theme requires abstract interpretation and understanding of figurative language, which is very high English demand and reasoning. The Rajasthan question is factual recall.
*   **Compared to 15% item (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** Easier. Differentiating two concepts and providing examples requires a clear understanding of definitions and some organizational skills in writing. The Rajasthan question is more direct recall, though it has a two-part instruction.
*   **Compared to 30% item (My favorite season):** Similar, potentially slightly harder if students struggle with recall. "Favorite season" is a highly personal and low-stakes creative writing task, though it asks for multiple details. The Rajasthan question requires specific factual recall from a curriculum.
*   **Compared to 50% item (King's three questions):** Similar in recall demand, but the Rajasthan question asks for *two* distinct answers and a *brief description* of one, making it slightly more complex than just listing three items. The king's questions are direct recall from a story.
*   **Compared to 66% item (Two Fundamental Rights):** Slightly harder. The Fundamental Rights question is direct recall of two specific items. The Rajasthan question asks for two *and* a brief description of one. The specific nature of "occupations in rural Rajasthan" might also be less uniformly memorized than Fundamental Rights.

**Difficulty Analysis for "Main occupations in rural Rajasthan":**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Social Studies Curriculum:** Students are expected to have studied different types of occupations, particularly in the context of Indian geography and rural life. Rajasthan is a significant state in India, and its primary economic activities (agriculture, animal husbandry due to arid conditions, handicrafts reflecting culture) are common knowledge in the context of the curriculum.
    *   **General Knowledge:** Basic understanding of what "occupations" means and what typical jobs exist in villages.
*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Key Terms:** "Occupations," "rural areas," "Rajasthan." These are likely to be familiar terms within their Social Studies context, even if their general English vocabulary is weak.
    *   **Instruction:** "What are... Describe any one in brief." This is a straightforward instruction format. "Describe in brief" might be the most challenging part, requiring a short, coherent sentence or two.
    *   **Content Language:** The answer itself (e.g., agriculture, animal husbandry) uses common nouns. Even if students spell incorrectly, they might convey the meaning.
*   **Cognitive Task:**
    *   **Recall:** Predominantly recall. Students need to remember what occupations are common in Rajasthan's rural areas.
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** Minimal. Describing one in brief requires basic explanation, not complex reasoning.
*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very common type of question found in Social Science textbooks and exams, usually for identifying characteristics of a region or lifestyle. It's not a higher-order thinking question but a foundational knowledge check.
    *   The "describe in brief" part is typical of short-answer questions.

**Specific Considerations for Class 7 Hindi-Medium Students from EWS:**

*   **Curriculum Alignment:** This content is very likely covered in their Social Studies curriculum (Geography/Civics section on livelihoods).
*   **Bilingual Advantage:** While the question is in English, the concepts are likely taught in Hindi. Students might be able to *think* of the answers in Hindi and then try to translate them, even if imperfectly (e.g., "Kheti" → Agriculture, "Pashu palan" → Animal husbandry). Partial English keywords or transliterations would likely be scored correct if meaning is clear.
*   **Description Difficulty:** The "describe any one in brief" is where some students might struggle. They might list two occupations but not manage a coherent description, or their description might be very fragmented due to limited English. However, even a few keywords ("farming for food," "animals for milk") could count for a "brief" description.
*   **Ubiquity of the Topic:** Rural occupations in a major Indian state like Rajasthan are fundamental for Social Studies. This is not obscure information.

## Conclusion and Estimate

This question requires straightforward factual recall of a common topic
