## Contrastive Analysis of "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

Let's break down this question's difficulty for Class 8 Indian government school students.

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Moderate prior knowledge:** Students are expected to have been taught about the Harappan Civilization in their Social Science curriculum, likely in Class 6 or 7. Key features like urban planning (grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town) are fundamental aspects covered. This isn't obscure information; it's typically central to the unit on ancient India.
*   **Contrast with anchors:**
    *   **"Theme of poem" (5%):** Requires sophisticated inferential skills, abstract thinking, and articulating a nuanced idea from text. Much harder.
    *   **"Differentiate archaeological/literary sources" (15%):** Requires conceptual understanding, ability to compare and contrast, and providing distinct examples. Slightly harder, as it demands differentiating two related concepts.
    *   **"My favorite season" (30%):** Personal opinion, descriptive writing. No prior content knowledge. Relies purely on language and creativity. This is easier on content but might be harder on English fluency for writing 6-8 lines.
    *   **"King's three questions" (50%):** Direct recall from a story. If the story was covered, it's fairly easy recall. Comparable in knowledge demand, but here it's about facts.
    *   **"Two Fundamental Rights" (66%):** Direct recall of civics content, highly emphasized, typically memorized. Slightly easier content recall, as these are often rote-learned.

**2. Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**

*   **Key terms:** "Harappan Civilization," "urban planning," "key feature." These are specific historical and academic terms. While "urban planning" might be slightly less common than "rights," students would have encountered these in their Social Science textbooks.
*   **Task verb:** "Describe." This requires more than just listing. It expects a brief explanation of *what* the feature is. However, the rubric accepts a single descriptive sentence, so the demand for elaborate description is low.
*   **Simplicity of response:** "one key feature." This limits the response needed. A single correct phrase or sentence is enough.
*   **Contrast with anchors:**
    *   **"Theme of poem" (5%):** Very high language demand for abstract expression.
    *   **"Differentiate..." (15%):** Moderate language demand for articulating distinctions.
    *   **"Paragraph on favorite season" (30%):** High language demand for sustained descriptive writing (6-8 lines). This Harappan question is *much* easier in terms of output length and complexity.
    *   **"King's three questions" (50%):** Moderate language demand for direct recall, likely involving phrasing similar to the original text.
    *   **"Two Fundamental Rights" (66%):** Lower language demand as it's typically listing short, known phrases.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

*   **Primarily Recall:** It's a direct recall question of specific factual information covered in the syllabus. Students are expected to have learned about the distinct features of Harappan cities.
*   **Low-level description:** While "describe" implies a bit more than just "name," for a single feature, it's still largely a recall-and-state task. There's no complex application or reasoning required.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   This is a very common type of question found in end-of-chapter exercises or quick review sections for the Harappan Civilization unit. It tests foundational knowledge. It's often phrased as "List any three features..." or "What were the main characteristics of Harappan cities?" Requiring just *one* makes it relatively straightforward.

**Overall Assessment:**

This question targets core knowledge from a frequently taught topic. The language demand is moderate but manageable for conveying a single, specific fact. The task is primarily recall-based and typical of entry-level assessment for historical facts. It avoids abstract reasoning or extensive writing.

Comparing it to the anchors:

*   It's definitely easier than "theme of poem" (5%) and "differentiate sources" (15%) due to less abstraction, less need for comparison, and lower language complexity.
*   It's much easier than writing a "paragraph on favorite season" (30%) due to significantly reduced writing demands.
*   It's comparable to or slightly easier than "King's three questions" (50%) depending on how recently
