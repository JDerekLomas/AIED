## Analysis of "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"

Let's break down the difficulty of this question for a Class 8 Indian government school student, keeping in mind their background and the provided calibration anchors.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Specific Historical Event:** Students need to know about the Battle of Plassey (1757). This is a fundamental event in Indian history, typically covered in Class 8 Social Science textbooks.
*   **Key Players:** While not explicitly required for the rubric, a general understanding of the British East India Company and the Nawab of Bengal (or at least the concept of a "nawab") would be helpful context.
*   **Concept of "Expansion of Power":** They need to understand what it means for a colonial power to expand its influence.

**Language Demands:**

*   **Keywords:** "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "contribute," "expansion," "British power," "India." These are relatively straightforward historical terms and common vocabulary. "Contribute" might be slightly challenging if students struggle with synonyms for "led to" or "resulted in," but it's generally within an achievable range.
*   **Sentence Structure:** The question is a direct "how did X contribute to Y" structure. This is a common and relatively easy-to-understand question format.
*   **English Proficiency:** While students have limited English proficiency, the concepts are social science terms they would have encountered in their textbooks, likely translated into Hindi or taught bilingually. The answer can be short and to the point, minimizing the need for complex sentence construction.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   **Recall/Understanding:** Primarily recall of historical facts and understanding of their direct consequence. It's not a complex reasoning question that requires multiple steps of inference or application of a broad principle. Students are expected to have learned about the direct impact of Plassey on British power.
*   **Contrast with "Theme of poem":** The poem question requires inferential reasoning and expressing abstract ideas, which is harder. Plassey is more factual.
*   **Contrast with "Differentiate sources":** That requires understanding two distinct concepts and providing examples, also requiring a higher level of comprehension and distinction than simply stating an outcome.

**Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   This question is highly typical of an end-of-chapter or mid-topic assessment question in a Class 8 history textbook dealing with the arrival and consolidation of British power. It's a foundational event.
*   It's a "why was this important?" type of question, which students are frequently asked to answer.
*   The required answer ("establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal") is a direct, expected consequence often explicitly stated in textbooks.

**Contrastive Analysis with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **vs. Item (pass rate 5%): "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'"** This is much harder. It requires deep comprehension, inferential reasoning, and articulating an abstract theme in English. Our question is factual recall.
*   **vs. Item (pass rate 15%): "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..."** This requires defining and distinguishing two concepts, then giving examples. It's a two-part answer requiring precise understanding. Our question asks for a direct cause-and-effect relationship, which is conceptually simpler than differentiation.
*   **vs. Item (pass rate 30%): "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'"** This allows for personal expression and less precise factual recall, making it easier for students to score, even with simple sentences. However, the rubric implies detail and a structured paragraph, which some students struggle with. Our question is shorter, more specific, and requires a single historical fact, but it *must* be the correct fact. The bar for a 1/1 score on Plassey is quite low if they get the key consequence.
*   **vs. Item (pass rate 50%): "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"** This is very similar in difficulty in terms of direct factual recall from a story or passage. If they read the story, they would know this. The Plassey question similarly relies on students having studied that specific historical event. The key difference might be that the "king's questions" often appear earlier in a narrative, making them easier to recall, whereas the Plassey question is about the *consequence* rather than just participants or timing. However, the consequence of Plassey is arguably as central.
*   **vs. Item (pass rate 66%): "Name any two Fundamental Rights..."** This is easier. Fundamental Rights are
