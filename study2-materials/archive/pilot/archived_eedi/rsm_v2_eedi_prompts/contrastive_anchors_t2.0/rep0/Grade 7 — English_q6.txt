Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior knowledge assumed?**
    *   No specific factual content knowledge is assumed (like history dates or science concepts).
    *   It assumes an understanding of the term "writing style" and the ability to articulate a descriptor for it. This requires some basic literary analysis skills.
    *   It assumes students have read or are familiar with some of the poet's (likely Rabindranath Tagore, given "The Last Bargain" anchor) work, or can infer style from general knowledge of poetry. If the exam includes the poem "The Last Bargain," they would need to have understood the poem's structure and language to deduce its style.

2.  **Language demands?**
    *   The question itself is very short and uses relatively simple English: "Describes the poet’s writing style."
    *   The rubric expects a single word or short phrase. This reduces the burden of constructing complex English sentences, which is a major challenge for these students (evident in the messy answers for the 5% item).
    *   However, "writing style" and its potential descriptors (simple, descriptive, informal, direct, lyrical, profound, etc.) might be more advanced vocabulary for students with limited English. They might understand "write" but not necessarily "writing style" as a distinct literary concept. They might struggle to generate appropriate *English* words to describe it even if they grasp the concept.
    *   Compared to the 5% item ("Write a theme or central idea..."), which requires abstract understanding and a more complex sentence structure, this question's *output* demand is lower (one word). However, the *input* understanding of "style" could be equally or more challenging conceptually.
    *   Compared to the 50% item ("What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"), which involves direct recall of factual details from a story, this question requires interpretation and synthesis.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application/reasoning**. It requires students to have read a poem (or poems by the poet), understand its characteristics, and then apply a suitable descriptive term for those characteristics. It's not a direct recall task.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   Class 7 English textbooks in India might introduce concepts like poetry appreciation and identifying literary devices, but explicitly analyzing and naming a "writing style" with a single descriptor might be a slightly more advanced exercise than simple comprehension questions.
    *   Many textbook exercises focus on literal comprehension, vocabulary, and grammar. This moves into basic literary criticism, which can be harder.
    *   The example responses for the anchors show varying levels of English proficiency. The 5% item showed many attempts at English prose but poor success in conveying meaning. The 30% item (My Favorite Season) shows basic sentence construction is possible for some, but not sophisticated English.

**Synthesis and Estimate:**

*   **Difficulty points:** The abstract nature of "writing style," the need to choose an appropriate English descriptor, and the non-recall nature make it harder than direct information retrieval. Students may understand a story but not be able to articulate its *style*. The concept itself might not be deeply ingrained in their curriculum for formal assessment.
*   **Ease points:** The short answer format (one word) reduces writing burden significantly. If students understand the question and have *any* appropriate descriptor, they can score.
*   **Calibration comparison:**
    *   It's harder than "My favorite season" (30%) because that is a personal, high-access topic, and doesn't require conceptual abstraction or specific English vocabulary for a literary concept.
    *   It's likely harder than "Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" (15%), which involves defining terms that are explicitly taught in Social Science and allows for examples rather than abstract descriptions. While "literary sources" relate, "writing style" is distinct.
    *   It's probably *easier* than "Write a theme or central idea of the poem" (5%). That required a multi-word, coherent statement of an abstract concept, often involving identifying a moral or deeper meaning, which is highly complex for limited English speakers. This question asks for *one word*.

Given the average pass rate (29%), this item requires a moderate level of abstract thinking and vocabulary. Many students might struggle with the concept of "writing style" or the English words to describe it. However, the one-word answer requirement provides a slight bump. I believe it sits somewhere above the 15% mark but significantly below the 30% mark. It's close to the conceptual difficulty of differentiating sources but demands more interpretive insight rather than learned definitions.
