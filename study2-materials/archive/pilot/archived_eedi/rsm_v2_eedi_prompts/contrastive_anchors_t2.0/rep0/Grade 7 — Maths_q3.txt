Contrastive analysis:

1.  **Prior knowledge assumed:**
    *   Basic understanding of geometry concepts: triangle, base, height, area.
    *   Knowledge of the formula for the area of a triangle (`1/2 × base × height`). This is typically taught in Class 6 or 7.
    *   Basic arithmetic: multiplication and division by 2.

2.  **Language demands for students with limited English:**
    *   The language used is very direct and minimal: "Find the area of a triangle whose base is X cm and height is Y cm."
    *   Keywords like "area," "triangle," "base," and "height" are fundamental mathematical terms usually taught and understood in this context. They are less abstract than terms in the 5% item ("theme," "central idea") or even the 15% item ("differentiate," "archaeological," "literary").
    *   The structure is a simple instruction followed by factual parameters. This is less complex than the multi-part instruction of the 30% item ("Write a short paragraph... Talk about what you like to do, what you eat or wear...").

3.  **Recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily an **application** question, requiring students to recall the formula and then apply it to given numerical values.
    *   It's not pure recall like "State the formula for the area of a triangle."
    *   It requires minimal reasoning beyond direct application. It does not involve multi-step problem-solving or complex scenario analysis.

4.  **Difficulty compared to typical textbook exercises:**
    *   This question is a **standard, straightforward textbook exercise** for the topic of "area of a triangle." It's one of the simplest applications of the formula.
    *   There are no hidden traps, conversions, or complex shapes involved. The values (8 and 6) lead to easy calculations.
    *   It is significantly simpler than the 5% item (interpretive English literature), the 15% item (definitional differentiation in history), and the 30% item (open-ended creative writing in English).
    *   It is more structured and less ambiguous than the 50% item, where recalling three specific questions from a narrative can be tricky.
    *   It requires applying a specific mathematical rule, similar in directness to the 66% item (recalling fundamental rights), but the mathematical formula is generally less open to "half-correct" answers and often has clearer recall and application.

**Calibration Anchors Comparison:**

*   **Compared to 5% (Literature Theme):** Far, far easier. This is objective math, not subjective literary analysis. Language demands are minimal.
*   **Compared to 15% (Historical Sources):** Easier. Requires recalling and applying one specific math formula rather than differentiating two abstract historical source types with examples.
*   **Compared to 30% ("My favorite season"):** Easier. This is a closed-ended math problem with a single correct answer and straightforward computation, contrasting with open-ended creative writing requiring extended English production.
*   **Compared to 50% (King's questions):** Similar, but likely slightly easier or at least as easy. The king's questions require specific recall from a story. This math question requires recall of a formula and simple application. Math formulas are often practiced more rote than specific story details.
*   **Compared to 66% (Fundamental Rights):** Very comparable in difficulty. Both require recalling specific learned information (a formula or rights) and providing a correct answer. The math question involves a tiny calculation, but the "correct formula + correct numbers = correct answer" structure is very clear. Many students will remember the formula and perform the simple calculation correctly.

Considering the simplicity of the concept, the straightforward language, and its direct application as a fundamental skill taught at this level, a significant proportion of students should be able to answer this. While English proficiency is limited, the math terms are fundamental and usually covered bilingually or understood in context. The calculation is very simple (1/2 * 8 * 6 = 24). It's a foundational skill for this grade.

Given the average pass rate of 29% across items and the strong comparison to the 50% and 66% items in terms of direct recall/application, and its objective nature (easier than open-ended English or abstract history), it should be comfortably above the average.
