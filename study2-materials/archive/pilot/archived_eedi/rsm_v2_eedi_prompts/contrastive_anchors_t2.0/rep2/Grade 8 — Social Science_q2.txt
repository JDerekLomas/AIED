## Contrastive Analysis: Harappan Civilization's Urban Planning

Let's break down the question "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning" compared to the calibration anchors and general context:

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Difficulty:** Moderate to High. This requires specific factual recall from a Social Science (History) curriculum. Students would have learned about the Indus Valley Civilization (often referred to as Harappan Civilization) typically in Class 6 or 7, and would revisit it in Class 8.
*   **Comparison to anchors:**
    *   **"Theme of poem" (5%):** Requires interpretation and abstraction, which is very high-level. This Harappan question is *factual recall*.
    *   **"Archaeological vs. Literary" (15%):** Requires distinguishing between concepts and giving examples, also factual but slightly more analytical. The Harappan question is simpler – just recall *one* feature.
    *   **"My favorite season" (30%):** Personal opinion, easy. Not comparable.
    *   **"King's three questions" (50%):** Direct recall from a story. This is the closest in *type* (factual recall) but the source material is likely a more recent English language text.
    *   **"Two Fundamental Rights" (66%):** Direct recall from civics, high frequency topic, usually drilled heavily. Harappan urban planning is also a key feature of its topic, but possibly less memorized than fundamental rights.

**2. Language Demands:**
*   **Difficulty:** Moderate.
    *   "Describe" is a common command word.
    *   "Key feature" and "urban planning" are academic terms, but generally covered in textbooks when discussing the Harappan Civilization.
    *   The language isn't overly complex, but translating or comprehending these specific terms (if taught in Hindi) and then formulating a concise English response is still a hurdle for students with limited English proficiency.
*   **Comparison to anchors:**
    *   All anchors require some level of English output. The Harappan question allows for short, simple answers (e.g., "grid system," "drainage").
    *   The 5% "theme" question requires complex sentence formation.
    *   The 15% "differentiate" requires structured comparison.
    *   The 30% "paragraph" requires sustained writing.
    *   The 50% and 66% questions can be answered with very short phrases or lists. The Harappan question sits comfortably here in terms of required English complexity – a simple phrase or short sentence.

**3. Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
*   **Difficulty:** Pure Recall. Students just need to remember *one* of the distinct characteristics of Harappan cities. There's no application or complex reasoning involved. This makes it intrinsically easier than interpretive or analytical tasks.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   **Difficulty:** Standard. "Describe features of Harappan cities" is a very common type of question found at the end of chapters on the Indus Valley Civilization. It's usually one of the first few things students learn about it. Textbooks and teachers typically emphasize the advanced urban planning (grid layout, drainage) as defining features.

**Overall Assessment Relative to Anchors:**

*   **Higher than 5% and 15%:** These involve deeper comprehension, analysis, or structured differentiation, which are higher-order thinking skills or require more complex language output.
*   **Lower than 30%:** The "My favorite season" requires sustained personal writing. While personal, the writing demand makes it harder.
*   **Comparable to 50% and 66% in terms of "recall" type:** Both "King's questions" and "Fundamental Rights" are recall-based.
    *   The **50% "King's questions"** refers to a *specific short story* which might be covered quickly or less often than core historical content. The recall is exact, but the source less universally memorized than social science facts.
    *   The **66% "Fundamental Rights"** are *highly emphasized* in civics. It's rote learned by many due to its direct relevance and often repetitive teaching. Harappan urban planning is important, but possibly not drilled with the same intensity as fundamental rights.

The content (Harappan Civilization) is foundational for Social Science and *one key feature* is a simple recall. While students may struggle with English, many would be able to recall at least one bullet point feature like "grid system" or "drainage system" and write it down, even with some spelling errors (rubric often forgiving for key concept). Given its foundational status,
