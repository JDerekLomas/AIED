Here's a breakdown of the analysis for the question "Define fable."

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **"Fable" as a concept:** Students are expected to have encountered fables (like those of Aesop) in their curriculum or general knowledge, perhaps in Hindi translations or simplified forms. The concept of a story with animal characters and a moral is common.
    *   **Vocabulary:** The ability to understand the word "define."

2.  **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **Receptive:** Understanding the single word "define." This is relatively straightforward compared to questions with longer sentences or more complex grammar.
    *   **Productive:** Producing a definition in English. This is the biggest hurdle.
        *   They need to retrieve the key components: "short story," "animals as characters," "moral lesson."
        *   They then need to translate these concepts into coherent English sentences.
        *   Many students might know the concept but struggle to articulate it concisely in English due to limited vocabulary and sentence construction skills.
        *   A simple, fragmented definition (e.g., "Story with animals. Teach lesson.") might still score 1 based on the rubric, but constructing a flowing sentence is harder.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** This is primarily a recall question. Students are expected to have learned the definition of a fable as a distinct literary term. There's no application of the definition to a new scenario or higher-order reasoning required.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Textbook definitions:** Definitions of literary terms are common in Class 8 English or literature textbooks. Students would likely have been taught this term.
    *   **Simple sentence structure:** Compared to composing paragraphs ("My favorite season") or differentiating between two concepts ("Archaeological vs. Literary sources"), defining a single term with a few key points is structurally simpler, provided the student knows the definition and has basic English for expressing it.
    *   **Familiarity of the concept:** Fables (like the Fox and the Grapes, the Tortoise and the Hare) are widely known even across language barriers due to their universal themes and presence in children's literature. This makes the *concept* itself less abstract than, say, "Fundamental Rights" (though the English names of rights can be challenging) or specific historical details.

**Comparison with Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'"** This requires interpretation, synthesis, and expressing an abstract idea, which is very challenging in limited English. "Define fable" is far simpler as it asks for a concrete definition.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..."** This requires understanding two abstract concepts, comparing them, and providing examples, demanding more complex English and higher-order thinking than simply defining one term.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'"** This requires sustained writing, coherence, and descriptive language. While many struggle with this (as shown by "Winter Sweater Baju Hot water Tea"), the *conceptual* demand for "Define fable" is lower. Students may struggle with the English, but the *idea* is simpler. The length requirement of 6-8 lines makes it a harder English task.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"** This is recall of specific textual details. If a student remembers the story, they can often list the answers even in fragmented English. "Define fable" is similar in its recall nature but requires *constructing* the definition rather than simply listing specific details *from* a text. It's about remembering a learned *term*, not details of a read text.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India."** This is straight recall of proper nouns/phrases. Students are often drilled on these terms. If they recall "Right to equality" or "Right to freedom," they score. This is easier than *defining* a concept because it doesn't require composing a sentence structure, just recalling a learned phrase. However, the conceptual understanding might be lower here than for "fable," as many might just memorize the phrases.

**Factors for Estimate:**

*   **Ubiquitous concept:** Fables are widely known stories globally.
*   **Direct recall:** Not much interpretation or reasoning needed, just recall of a learned definition.
*   **Simple sentence structure:** The ideal definition is not overly complex
