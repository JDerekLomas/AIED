Let's break down the "My Favourite Hobby" question to estimate its pass rate for Class 7 students in Indian government schools.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   Assumes students have a "favourite hobby" and can articulate it. This is generally accessible as most children have activities they enjoy.
    *   Requires basic understanding of the concept of "hobby."
    *   No specific factual knowledge beyond personal experience is required, making it universally accessible from a content perspective.
*   **Language Demands (Students with limited English):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Favourite," "hobby," "mention," "enjoy." These are relatively common and likely taught in early English lessons, or easily inferable.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences)." This requires students to construct multiple coherent sentences.
    *   **Grammar:** Correct usage of simple past/present tense, prepositions, and basic sentence formation. Errors are expected but may not prevent a "1" score if the core information is present.
    *   **Topic-Specific Lexicon:** The vocabulary will depend on the chosen hobby (e.g., "reading," "playing cricket," "drawing"). Students may struggle with specific English terms for their chosen hobby if it's less common, but the overall framing allows for simple language.
*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **recall** of personal information (what is my hobby, when do I do it, why do I like it) and **application** of basic English writing skills to structure those recalled details into a paragraph.
    *   It requires minimal abstract reasoning or complex application of rules.
*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   This type of descriptive writing about a personal topic ("My Family," "My School," "My Pet," "My Favourite Festival") is a very common and fundamental exercise in English language textbooks at this level.
    *   The prompt provides clear guiding points ("what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it"), which is helpful scaffolding.
    *   The "4-5 sentences" requirement is manageable.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Compared to 5% (Theme of "The Last Bargain"):** Significantly easier. The poem analysis requires deep comprehension, inferential reasoning, and the ability to articulate abstract themes. "My Hobby" is personal and concrete.
*   **Compared to 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Much easier. That item requires domain-specific social science knowledge, understanding of abstract historical concepts, and comparative analytical skills. "My Hobby" is purely personal and descriptive.
*   **Compared to 30% ("My favorite season," 6-8 lines):** *Very similar*. This anchor is the most directly comparable. The tasks are almost identical: personal descriptive paragraph writing, guided by specific points. The main difference is "season" vs. "hobby" and 6-8 lines vs. 4-5 lines. The "hobby" prompt is slightly shorter, making it potentially marginally easier to meet the length requirement. The guidance in the "hobby" question is perhaps a touch clearer ("what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it" vs. "what you like to do, what you eat or wear, and w").
*   **Compared to 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Easier. While that is recall from a story, it requires precise recall of specific plot points. "My Hobby" is entirely self-generated and flexible in content.
*   **Compared to 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Slightly harder. Naming fundamental rights is a factual recall task. While it requires specific knowledge, the English demand is minimal (just listing names). "My Hobby" requires actual sentence construction and paragraph coherence, even if the content is personal.

**Synthesizing the Analysis:**

The "My Favourite Hobby" question aligns most closely with the "My Favorite Season" item, which had a 30% pass rate. However, there are nuances:

*   **Slightly shorter length requirement (4-5 sentences vs. 6-8 lines) makes it a little less demanding.** Students might struggle less with fatigue or maintaining coherence over fewer sentences.
*   **Clearer guidance:** The structure of "what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it" is very direct and makes it easy to checklist for students.
*   **"Hobby" vs. "Season":** Both are personal topics. Students are likely to have strong feelings and experiences with both.

Given the similarities to the 30% item but with slight advantages in length and clarity
