Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimate:

## Contrastive Analysis: "book/reading/a/is/he"

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Basic English Sentence Structure:** Students need to understand the fundamental Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order common in English. This is usually taught relatively early.
*   **Vocabulary:** All words (`book`, `reading`, `a`, `is`, `he`) are very basic and likely familiar to Class 6 students, even with limited English exposure. "He," "is," "a," "book" are foundational. "Reading" is a common verb.
*   **Punctuation/Capitalization (implicit):** While not explicitly asked for, implicitly students need to know to start with a capital letter (He) and end with a period (though a direct score for punctuation isn't given, getting the order correct often means demonstrating this implicit understanding).

**Language Demands:**
*   **Lexical Complexity:** Very low. All words are high-frequency and commonly encountered.
*   **Syntactic Complexity:** Low. It's a simple declarative sentence in a common present continuous tense structure. There are no subordinate clauses, complex tenses, or unusual inversions.
*   **Discourse Cohesion:** Not applicable. It's a single sentence construction task.
*   **Input Type:** Words provided are singular, clearly separated, and require only rearrangement, not generation of new words. This is less demanding than having to generate words from a context.

**Cognitive Demand (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
*   **Application:** This is primarily an application task. Students need to apply their knowledge of English grammar rules (specifically SVO order and basic verb conjugation/tense) to rearrange the given words. It's not pure recall (they aren't remembering a specific sentence) nor complex reasoning (it doesn't involve problem-solving beyond grammatical rules).

**Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   This type of "rearrange the words" exercise is a *very common* and fundamental activity in early English language learning textbooks, especially in Grade 6. It's a foundational skill for building grammatically correct sentences. Many exercises would start simpler (e.g., "apple/an/is/it"), and this one is a slight step up but still very basic.
*   The vocabulary and sentence structure are entirely aligned with beginner/intermediate English lessons at this level.

**Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"Theme of The Last Bargain" (5%):** Much, much harder. Requires deep comprehension of a poem, abstract reasoning, and advanced vocabulary to articulate a theme. Students struggle even with basic comprehension, let alone abstraction.
*   **"Differentiate archaeological/literary sources" (15%):** Significantly harder. Requires recall of specific history concepts, analytical comparison, and a multi-part answer, potentially in a formal tone. Again, advanced recall and structured response.
*   **"My favorite season" paragraph (30%):** Harder. While creative, it requires generating coherent sentences, developing ideas, expanding on prompts, and maintaining focus over 6-8 lines. Grammatical errors are highly likely, and the writing burden is substantial.
*   **"Three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%):** Similar to slightly easier. This requires specific recall from a story. If the story was well-understood and recently taught, students might get it. The prompt is direct. The difference is that 'He is reading a book' doesn't require memory of a specific text, but a universal grammar rule.
*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66%):** Very similar in difficulty. This is direct recall of civics knowledge. If taught well and reinforced, students can simply list. Like "He is reading a book," it has a very clear, objective correct answer. Both are fundamental pieces of knowledge. The sentence rearrangement might be *slightly* harder for students who struggle with *any* English syntax beyond single words, but for most who have some exposure, the SVO order is one of the first things they'd grasp.

**Synthesizing the Difficulty:**

The question is **very basic** for a Class 6 English curriculum, even for students with limited English.
*   **Simple Vocabulary:** All words are common.
*   **Fundamental Grammar:** SVO order is foundational.
*   **Common Exercise Type:** "Rearrange words" is a staple.
*   **Low Cognitive Load:** It's application of a basic rule, not abstract thought or extensive writing.
*   **Direct Objective Answer:** No ambiguity.

The main barrier would be a complete lack of understanding of basic English sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object). However, Class 6 students
