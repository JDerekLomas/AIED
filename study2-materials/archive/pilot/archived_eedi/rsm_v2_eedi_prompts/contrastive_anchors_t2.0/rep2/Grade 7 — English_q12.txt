Here's an analysis of the question and my estimated proportion correct:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   This question assumes students have been explicitly taught active and passive voice. This is a grammatical concept typically covered in English grammar lessons.
    *   It requires knowledge of verb tenses, specifically recognizing "blew" as simple past tense, and understanding how to form the past participle ("blown").
    *   Students also need to understand subject-object inversion in this context.
    *   Many Class 7 students in Indian government schools, especially in Hindi-medium settings, might have limited or no formal instruction in these specific grammatical transformations in English. They might be familiar with the concepts in their native language but not the English equivalents or terminology.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   The source sentence "The wind blew the leaves away" is relatively straightforward and uses common vocabulary. "Blew" and "leaves" are probably recognizable.
    *   The instructions "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice" use specific grammatical terminology. This terminology itself could be a barrier. If students don't understand "Active Voice" or "Passive Voice," they won't even know what the question is asking them to do, regardless of their grasp of the sentence's meaning.
    *   Constructing the passive voice sentence requires more than just understanding words; it demands manipulation of sentence structure, correct auxiliary verb usage ("were"), and knowing the past participle form ("blown").

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of a grammatical rule. Students need to recall the rules for converting active to passive voice and then apply those rules to a given sentence.
    *   It also has a significant **recall** component for the past participle form of irregular verbs like "blow-blew-blown."

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   If active/passive voice is taught, this specific transformation (simple past tense) would be a standard, mid-level exercise. It's not the most complex (e.g., perfect tenses, modal verbs) but it's not the simplest (e.g., present simple).
    *   However, considering the limited English proficiency and potentially limited specific grammar instruction, this question's difficulty rises considerably. Many students might struggle just with the instruction part, let alone the transformation itself.
    *   Compared to "My favorite season" (30%), this is much more academic and rule-based. Compared to "Three questions the king wanted" (50%), which requires specific recall from a story, this requires an understanding and application of a complex linguistic rule. Compared to "Fundamental Rights" (66%), which is recall of civics knowledge, this is English grammar. It's probably closest in *type* to differentiating archaeological/literary sources (15%) in that it requires knowing and applying definitions/rules, but the grammar rules here are likely less familiar or less frequently drilled for this student population.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain."** This is very high-level comprehension and abstract thinking, even for native speakers, which explains the low score. Our question is less abstract.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources.** This requires knowing specific academic definitions and examples. This is somewhat comparable in terms of applying specific knowledge, but grammatical transformation might feel more foreign than historical sources.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Paragraph on "My favorite season."** This is creative writing, allowing for basic sentence construction even with errors. It's much less constrained by strict grammatical rules, hence a higher pass rate, even for poor quality responses. Our question is entirely rule-based.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is direct recall from a story. If the student remembers the story, it's easy. No complex application.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights.** This is direct recall of specific civic knowledge. Again, if they know it, it's easy.

**Reasoning for Estimate:**

The crucial hurdle is likely the **technical vocabulary** of "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice," combined with the necessary grammatical rules and knowledge of irregular verb forms (blown). Even if students understand the source sentence, many may not understand *what* they are being asked to do. Those who do understand the terminology will then need to correctly apply a sequence of grammatical transformations (object becomes subject, add auxiliary verb, use past participle, add "by" + original subject). This is a multi-step process
