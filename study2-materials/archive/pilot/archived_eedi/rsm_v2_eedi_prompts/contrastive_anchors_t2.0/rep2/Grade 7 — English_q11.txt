Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and an estimated pass rate:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior knowledge assumed:**
    *   Basic understanding of parts of speech, specifically what an adjective is.
    *   The concept of a "phrase" as a group of words, though the question's specific target is simpler than a typical adjective phrase.
    *   Familiarity with the grammatical terminology "adjective phrase" in English. This is a significant hurdle. Many students, even if they can identify an adjective, might struggle with the specific term "adjective phrase," especially when it's just a single adjective.
*   **Language demands on students with limited English:**
    *   The sentence itself ("A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony") is relatively simple and contains common words.
    *   The *instructional language* ("Identify the adjective phrase...") is the biggest challenge. "Identify," "adjective," and "phrase" are specific grammatical terms. "Phrase" is particularly tricky here, as the target is a single word (an adjective), which often wouldn't be thought of as a *phrase* in common parlance. The rubric clarifies that identifying "tiny" is sufficient, but the term "adjective phrase" is a distractor and might lead students to look for something more complex.
*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   It's primarily **application** of grammatical knowledge. Students need to apply their understanding of adjectives to a given sentence. However, the nuance around "adjective phrase" where only one word is the correct answer makes it tricky. If they are taught that a phrase is *multiple words*, they might get confused.
*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   Identifying adjectives is a common Class 7 exercise. Identifying an "adjective *phrase*" where the phrase is just a single word is less common or is often explained in more depth that single adjectives can function as adjective phrases. Textbook exercises for identifying *adjectives* (e.g., "Underline the adjectives") would likely be easier. Exercises on *phrases* would typically involve longer groups of words (e.g., "the blue car," "the cat sleeping on the mat"). The combination here makes it harder.

**Detailed Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Compared to 5% item (Theme of poem):** That's very open-ended, requires deep comprehension and expressive writing in English. This question is more structured and recall/application-based, making it significantly easier.
*   **Compared to 15% item (Differentiate sources):** This requires specific historical knowledge and the ability to formulate a clear definition and example for two distinct concepts. The English needed to explain is more complex. The target question is purely grammar.
*   **Compared to 30% item (My favorite season):** This is a creative writing task requiring sustained English production, organization, and a degree of personal expression. While not grammatically complex, the sheer volume and coherent thought make it harder than a single grammatical identification. Our target question requires minimal output and specific knowledge.
*   **Compared to 50% item (King's three questions):** This requires recall of a specific story detail. If students know the story, it's straightforward. If not, it's impossible. Many may not have read that specific story in English. Our target question is based on general grammatical rules, which *should* have been taught, and uses a simple, relatable sentence.
*   **Compared to 66% item (Two Fundamental Rights):** This requires specific civic knowledge. If they know the rights, it's an easy recall. Similar to the king's questions, it depends on whether they've explicitly memorized them. This is often taught by rote in Hindi or the local language, so recalling specific English terms like "Right to Equality" might be a hurdle, but the concept itself is generally known. Our target question's grammatical term "adjective phrase" is likely a higher hurdle for these students than recalling fundamental rights, especially if "adjective phrase" has only been introduced fleetingly.

**Refinement based on "Adjective Phrase" vs. "Adjective" confusion:**

The rubric specifically says "The student correctly identifies 'tiny' as an adjective." This simplifies things considerably, meaning the student doesn't need to actually understand what an "adjective phrase" is, only what an "adjective" is. This is a critical point that makes it easier than if they genuinely needed to identify a phrase. Many Class 7 students would have been taught adjectives.

The hurdle is primarily:
1.  Recognizing the term "adjective" (in English).
2.  Being able to find the adjective in a simple sentence
