Here's a breakdown of the question "Who lived inside the book?" compared to the calibration anchors:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students need to have read the specific story this question refers to. This is the single biggest factor here. If they haven't read the story, they cannot answer it correctly, regardless of English proficiency. We are assuming it's a passage from *this exam*, and not an arbitrary, out-of-context question. For the sake of this estimation, let's assume the relevant text *was provided as part of the exam*. If the text was *not* provided and they were expected to recall a story they might have read earlier, the pass rate would plummet.
    *   **Complexity:** Assuming the text was provided, the question is a very direct recall of a specific detail from the text.
*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Simplicity:** The question "Who lived inside the book?" uses very simple, high-frequency English words: "Who," "lived," "inside," "the," "book." These are likely well within the vocabulary of Class 6 students, even those with limited English.
    *   **Structure:** The sentence structure is a basic interrogative.
    *   **Keywords:** "Who," "lived," "inside," "book" are all explicit keywords that directly relate to finding the answer in a preceding passage.
*   **Cognitive Demand (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   This is a pure **recall** question. Students simply need to locate the answer in the provided text. There's no application of concepts or complex reasoning required.
*   **Difficulty compared to typical textbook exercises:**
    *   This type of direct "Who," "What," "Where" question after a reading passage is a very common and usually among the *easiest* comprehension questions in a Class 6 English textbook. It's often the first type of question taught to assess basic understanding.
*   **Rubric/Response expected:**
    *   The expected answer "a magical fairy" or just "fairy" is very short and directly extractable from text. It doesn't require complex sentence formation, which is a significant advantage for students with limited English writing skills. They just need to identify the key noun phrase.

**Comparison to Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme/Central Idea):** This question is *much easier*. Identifying a theme requires higher-order thinking, inference, and the ability to summarize, often requiring more nuanced language production. "Who lived inside the book?" is a factual recall.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** This question requires understanding definitions, categorization, and providing examples, often from social studies/history knowledge, not just a reading passage. The language required to differentiate and explain is more complex than simply stating "a fairy."
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Short paragraph "My favorite season"):** This is an open-ended writing task requiring original thought, paragraph structure, and sustained English production. Even though topics like "My favorite season" are common, the requirement of 6-8 lines and varied content makes it much harder than recalling a single phrase. Many students may struggle to generate that much correct English.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer?):** This is the closest comparison. It's a direct recall question, asking for multiple specific details from a story. The main difference is the *quantity* of recall (three distinct items vs. one). Our target question only asks for *one* specific entity. This suggests the target question should have a *higher* pass rate than 50%.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Name two Fundamental Rights):** This is direct factual recall from civics/GK knowledge, which often has clear, memorized answers. It's similar in cognitive demand (recall) to our question, but it requires *two* items of recall, not one. Students often memorize these points for their Social Science exams.

**Refinement based on "Story Context" and "Economically Weaker Section" (EWS) Considerations:**

*   **Crucial Assumption:** The entire estimate hinges on the assumption that the story from which "Who lived inside the book?" is drawn was *present* in the exam. If it's general knowledge about a specific fairy tale that students might not all have read, the rate would be lower. We proceed assuming the text was provided.
*   **Limited English Proficiency:** The simplicity of the question's language and the one-word/short phrase answer format are huge advantages for EWS students with limited English. They don't need to construct complex sentences. They just need to
