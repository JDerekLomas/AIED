I will break down the analysis of the "Battle of Plassey" question.

**Analysis of the "Battle of Plassey" Question:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Historical Event:** Students need to know about the Battle of Plassey (1757) itself – who fought, roughly when, and its immediate outcome (British victory).
    *   **Concept of "Contribution to Expansion":** They need to understand what "expansion of British power" means in a historical context (territorial control, political influence, economic dominance).
    *   **Key Figures/Terms (Implicit):** Knowledge of figures like Robert Clive, Mir Jafar, Siraj-ud-Daulah, or concepts like "puppet nawab" or "control over Bengal" would be very helpful to answer adequately, though not explicitly required.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Keywords:** "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "contribute," "expansion," "British power," "India." These are moderately complex historical and academic terms.
    *   **Question Structure:** "How did X contribute to Y?" This requires explaining a causal link, which is a higher-order thinking skill than simple recall. Students need to formulate a sentence or two explaining this relationship.
    *   **Abstract Concepts:** "Expansion of power" and "political dominance" are more abstract than concrete facts.
    *   **Comparison to anchors:**
        *   "Theme of poem" (5%) also requires abstract understanding and explanation.
        *   "Differentiate between sources" (15%) requires understanding and explaining distinctions.
        *   "My favorite season" (30%) is much simpler in language and personal, not abstract.
        *   "King's three questions" (50%) is direct recall from a story.
        *   "Fundamental Rights" (66%) is direct recall of facts, likely from rote memorization.
    *   The language demands are closer to the 5-15% items, requiring more than just simple keyword recognition.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **reasoning/application** based on recall. Students need to *recall* the Battle of Plassey and its immediate aftermath, but then *reason* about how that specific outcome (victory) *contributed* to a broader trend (British expansion). It's not just "What was the Battle of Plassey?" (recall) but "How did it lead to X?" (causal reasoning).

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Textbooks at this level often *describe* the Battle of Plassey and then, in subsequent paragraphs or sections, *explain* its significance for British expansion.
    *   Direct questions requiring students to articulate this "how" independently, especially in a formal, structured way, might be considered slightly more challenging than a simple recall question like "Who fought in the Battle of Plassey?" or "When was the Battle of Plassey?"
    *   It's a common interpretive question for this historical period. Many Social Science chapters in Class 8 for Indian boards heavily focus on the rise of British power, and Plassey is a cornerstone event. However, formulating the *explanation* can be difficult.

**Contrastive Analysis Summary:**

*   **Compared to "Theme of poem" (5%):** "Battle of Plassey" might be slightly easier as it's more factual/historical and less subjective or interpretive than a literary theme. However, both require understanding abstract concepts and articulating them. Language complexity is similar for the explanation part.
*   **Compared to "Differentiate sources" (15%):** "Battle of Plassey" is probably in a similar range. Differentiating sources requires understanding definitions and giving examples, a dual task. Explaining the *contribution* of Plassey also requires linking an event to a consequence. Both require analytical thought.
*   **Compared to "My favorite season" (30%):** Much harder. The Plassey question requires historical knowledge, abstract reasoning, and formal explanation, whereas the "season" question is personal, less demanding linguistically, and mostly descriptive.
*   **Compared to "King's three questions" (50%):** Much harder. "King's three questions" is direct recall of specific plot points from a story. Plassey requires explaining a cause-and-effect historical relationship.
*   **Compared to "Fundamental Rights" (66%):** Much harder. "Fundamental Rights" is simple recall of memorized facts, which is often very high for Class 8 civics if taught through rote learning.

The core challenge for students will be:
1.  **Recalling the key outcome:**
