Here's a breakdown of the analysis for the question "Describes the poet's writing style" to estimate the proportion of Class 7 Indian government school students who would answer it correctly:

## Contrastive Analysis of "Describe the poet's writing style."

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Literary Terminology (Basic):** Students need to understand what "writing style" means in a literary context. While they might intuitively grasp "how someone writes," explicitly linking it to concepts like simplicity, descriptive language, etc., might not be fully developed at this level.
*   **Poem Comprehension:** They need to have read and understood "The Last Bargain" (or whichever poem this question pertains to, given it's often linked to the prior question about theme). Without comprehension, they cannot assess style.
*   **Vocabulary to Describe Style:** Students need a relevant English vocabulary to express stylistic attributes (e.g., "simple," "direct," "formal," "descriptive," "evocative"). This is a significant hurdle.

**Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
*   **Understanding the prompt:** "Describe" is a common verb, but "writing style" might be abstract. Even if they understand the individual words, the concept together might be challenging.
*   **Generating an appropriate answer:** This requires not just comprehension but also the ability to recall and select an appropriate descriptive English word. For many students with limited English, generating nuanced vocabulary for abstract concepts is very difficult. They might understand the style but lack the English word to describe it.
*   **Subjectivity:** "Style" can be subjective. While some common adjectives exist, a student might have a vague idea but struggle to articulate it concisely.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
*   **Application/Analysis:** This question primarily requires **application and analysis**. Students must:
    1.  Read the poem.
    2.  Understand its content and form.
    3.  Analyze how the poet presents ideas (is it straightforward? complex? flowery?).
    4.  *Apply* an appropriate descriptor from their limited vocabulary to articulate this observation.
*   It's not pure recall (like Fundamental Rights) or simple information retrieval.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   **Higher-Order Thinking:** Many textbook exercises at this level focus on direct comprehension (e.g., "What did the king ask?"). This question requires a level of analysis and critical thinking about *how* something is written, not just *what* is written. This is often more challenging than typical comprehension questions.
*   **Abstract Nature:** Describing "style" is more abstract than "describe your favorite season" or "differentiate between two sources."
*   **Open-ended but constrained:** While multiple answers can be correct, they must be relevant, which limits the ease of a simple, gut-feeling answer.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea...**
    *   This question is *extremely* similar in cognitive demand. Both require analysis of the poem's deeper meaning/form and articulation of an abstract concept in English. The 5% rate for "theme" suggests extreme difficulty for abstract analysis and English expression. "Style" is arguably on par, or perhaps slightly less difficult than theme *if* the style is very straightforward (e.g., simple language, direct). However, if the style is more subtle, it becomes just as hard. The bar for "1" score on the 5% anchor seems quite high.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources...**
    *   This involves recall of learned definitions and a comparative analysis. It's concrete facts, though applied. "Style" is less concrete.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph on "My favorite season."**
    *   This is highly personal, allows for simple vocabulary, and is narrative. Far easier as it draws on personal experience and less abstract language.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?**
    *   This is pure recall/direct extraction from the text. Much easier.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights...**
    *   Direct recall of memorized facts. Far easier.

**Specific Considerations for "Describes the poet's writing style":**
*   The rubric accepts simple, relevant words (e.g., simple, descriptive, informal, direct). This broadness *could* make it easier if the style is very obvious.
*   However, the hurdle remains *identifying* that style and then *knowing an English word*
