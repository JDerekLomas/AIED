Let's break down the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" and analyze its likely pass rate for Class 6 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students need to have read and understood *the specific poem* referenced (which isn't provided here, but is crucial for answering the question). Let's assume for this analysis that they *have* read the poem and it's something from their syllabus.
    *   **Low Difficulty:** It doesn't require deep factual recall from history, science, or abstract concepts like "theme." It relies on personal preference after exposure to the text.
    *   **Contrast to Anchors:**
        *   "Write a theme or central idea" (5%): Requires abstract understanding and articulation of complex ideas. This question is much simpler.
        *   "Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" (15%): Requires specific factual knowledge, definitional understanding, and comparative analysis. This question is less demanding.
        *   "Three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%): Pure recall of specific factual details from a story. This question requires more interpretation/personal response.
        *   "Name two Fundamental Rights" (66%): Pure factual recall. This question goes beyond simple recall.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Key Phrases:** "Which line," "do you like the most," "and why."
    *   **Simple Sentence Structure:** The question itself is grammatically straightforward.
    *   **Requires Personal Expression:** The "and why" part demands original thought and articulation in English. This is where many students will struggle. They might be able to identify a line (copying it), but explaining *why* they like it requires forming their own sentences to express a subjective opinion. This moves beyond rote memorization or simple word recognition.
    *   **Vocabulary:** The vocabulary needed for explanation might be a barrier. Simple adjectives like "good," "nice," "powerful" might be accessible, but more nuanced reasons might be difficult to articulate.
    *   **Contrast to Anchors:**
        *   "Theme of poem" (5%): Very high language demand for abstract explanation.
        *   "Differentiate" (15%): Moderate language demand for clear comparative sentences.
        *   "Paragraph on My favorite season" (30%): Similar language demand for personal expression, but with a clear prompt about what to include (what they do, eat, wear). Our target question is more open-ended in the "why" part.
        *   "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%): Minimal language demand – essentially copying or paraphrasing from memory.
        *   "Two Fundamental Rights" (66%): Very low language demand – simple recall of terms.

*   **Type of Task (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   **Recall:** Students need to recall/identify a line from the poem. This is relatively easy if they've read the poem.
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** The "why" component requires subjective reasoning and personal expression. This is the more challenging part. It's not a single "right" answer.
    *   **Contrast:** This mixes a simple recall (identifying a line) with a more complex reasoning/expressive task (explaining preference), unlike the purely recall items (50%, 66%) or the purely analytical/definitional items (5%, 15%).

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Class 6 English textbooks often have "answer the following questions" that are factual recall.
    *   They might have "express your views" or "write a few lines about..." but these are often scaffolded (like the "My favorite season" prompt, which gave specific aspects to talk about).
    *   Answering "why you like something" is common in oral discussions but can be challenging in written form for these students, especially when specific guidance for the explanation is absent. The lack of specific prompts for the "why" part makes it harder than "My favorite season."

**Calibration Anchor Comparisons for this Specific Question:**

*   **Harder than:**
    *   "Three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%): This is pure recall. Our question adds an interpretive "why."
    *   "Two Fundamental Rights" (66%): This is simple factual recall. Our question is more complex.
*   **Easier than:**
    *   "Write a theme or central idea" (5%): Far too abstract.
    *   "Differentiate between sources" (15%): Requires specific technical
