This question is assessing basic knowledge of decomposition and its benefits, topics typically covered in environmental science or biology chapters for Class 8.

Here's a breakdown of the question's demands compared to the anchors:

*   **Prior knowledge:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students should have a basic understanding of decomposition (how organic matter breaks down), the role of microorganisms (though not explicitly asked for), and the concept of compost/manure as beneficial for soil. These are standard topics in science for Class 8 in India.
    *   **Compared to Anchors:**
        *   "Theme of a poem" (5%): Requires abstract thinking and interpretation of a literary work. Higher cognitive demand.
        *   "Differentiate archaeological/literary sources" (15%): Requires understanding two distinct concepts and providing examples. Recall and analytical comparison.
        *   "My favorite season" (30%): A personal descriptive essay. Relies on personal experience and basic writing skills. Less specific factual knowledge required.
        *   "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%): Pure recall of specific details from a story. Lower cognitive demand than explanation.
        *   "Two Fundamental Rights" (66%): Pure recall of specific factual information. Very low cognitive demand.

*   **Language demands:**
    *   **Question:** "A gardener has collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit. Does gardener notice any change after some days? Give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health."
        *   The language is relatively straightforward. "Waste of plants, vegetables and fruits," "pit," "change," "reasons," "beneficial," "soil health" are common words. "Evaluate" might be slightly challenging for some, but in this context, it just means stating if it's good or bad and why.
    *   **Compared to Anchors:**
        *   Poem theme: High interpretative language demand.
        *   Archaeological/Literary: Requires specific vocabulary for defining and differentiating.
        *   Favorite season: Moderate descriptive language, but no specialized vocabulary.
        *   King's questions: Very low language demand (recalling specific phrases).
        *   Fundamental Rights: Low language demand (recalling specific terms).
    *   **Overall:** The language for this question is more accessible than the poem, slightly more demanding than pure recall, and comparable to describing a process or event.

*   **Type of cognitive demand (Recall, application, reasoning):**
    *   **Question:** This question is a mix:
        *   **Recall:** Students need to recall the concept of decomposition and composting.
        *   **Application/Reasoning:** They need to apply this knowledge to the scenario (a gardener's pit) and reason why changes occur and why it's beneficial. It's not just "what is composting?"; it asks *what happens* and *why it's good*.
    *   **Compared to Anchors:**
        *   Poem: High reasoning/interpretation.
        *   Archaeological/Literary: Recall and analytical reasoning (differentiation).
        *   Favorite season: Application of descriptive writing.
        *   King's questions: Pure recall.
        *   Fundamental Rights: Pure recall.
    *   **Overall:** This question requires more than just rote recall but doesn't venture into complex problem-solving. It's applying learned concepts to a practical, real-world scenario. The "why" and "evaluate" parts push it beyond simple recall.

*   **Difficulty compared to typical textbook exercises:**
    *   **Question:** This is a fairly standard type of "explain and reason" question found at the end of chapters on environmental topics like waste management, soil, or microorganisms. It's more complex than a "define" or "list" question but less complex than an experimental design or in-depth analytical task.
    *   **Impact of rubric:** The rubric only requires suggesting the gardener will notice *significant changes* for 0.5 points. This is a very low bar. They don't even need to say *what* the changes are or *why* they are beneficial, only that changes will be noticed. This drastically lowers the effective difficulty compared to fully answering the question.

**Contrastive Analysis for the given Rubric (only noticing significant changes for 0.5 points):**

The question *as stated* asks for "reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial." However, the given rubric for "Max score: 0.5" is extremely minimal: "The user suggests that the gardener will notice significant changes." This changes everything.

*   **Ease with minimal rubric:** Simply stating "yes, changes will be noticed" or "the waste will decompose" or "it
