Let's break down the "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" question using the provided calibration anchors and context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Low to Medium:** Students are expected to have some basic geographical knowledge of India, specifically about major physical features. This is a common topic in Class 6 Social Science (Geography) textbooks in India. They likely encounter maps of India with mountain ranges labeled.
    *   *Compared to calibration:*
        *   "Theme of poem" (5%): Assumes complex literary analysis and abstraction, which is very high. Our question is simpler recall.
        *   "Archaeological vs. Literary sources" (15%): Assumes understanding of historical source types, conceptual differentiation, and examples. This is higher-order thinking than simply naming. Our question is simpler recall.
        *   "Favorite season paragraph" (30%): Assumes personal expression, sentence construction, and fulfilling specific prompts. Requires more complex English writing. Our question is a simple list.
        *   "Three questions the king wanted" (50%): Assumes recall of specific plot points from a story. This is straightforward recall. Our question is also straightforward recall but from geography knowledge.
        *   "Two Fundamental Rights" (66%): Assumes recall of specific civic information. Very straightforward recall. Our question is similar.

2.  **Language Demands (limited English proficiency):**
    *   **Very Low:** The question uses simple, direct language: "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."
    *   The expected answer is a simple list of names (e.g., "Himalayas," "Aravalli"). Students do *not* need to form full sentences or complex explanations.
    *   The key terms "mountain ranges" are fundamental geographical vocabulary that should be familiar, likely also from Hindi textbooks and discussions.
    *   *Compared to calibration:*
        *   "Theme of poem": Extremely high language demand (abstract English, complex sentence structure for explanation).
        *   "Archaeological vs. Literary": Moderate language demand (defining, differentiating, providing examples in English).
        *   "Favorite season paragraph": Moderate language demand (paragraph construction, descriptive English).
        *   "Three questions the king wanted": Low to moderate, depending on how they choose to answer. Could be a list, or short sentences.
        *   "Two Fundamental Rights": Very low, similar to our question – just listing names.

3.  **Type of Task (recall, application, reasoning):**
    *   **Pure Recall:** This is a direct recall question from basic geographical facts taught in Social Science.
    *   *Compared to calibration:*
        *   "Theme of poem": Reasoning/Application/Analysis.
        *   "Archaeological vs. Literary": Application/Differentiation.
        *   "Favorite season paragraph": Application (writing).
        *   "Three questions the king wanted": Recall.
        *   "Two Fundamental Rights": Recall.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Easy/Standard:** Naming major geographical features is a very common type of question found at the end of geography chapters, in quizzes, or as map-work exercises in Class 6. It's a foundational piece of knowledge. Students might be used to pointing them out on a map or listing them. The rubric allows for only one correct name to get partial credit, which lowers the bar significantly.
    *   *The "My Favorite Season" (30%) item allows for short, fragmented answers (e.g., "Winter Sweater Baju"). Our question's rubric allows 0.5 for just *one* correct name, making it exceptionally lenient.*
    *   *The "Two Fundamental Rights" (66%) requires two specific items. Our question *also* asks for two but gives half credit for one, making it slightly easier to get at least some credit.*

**Likely Factors Influencing Performance:**

*   **Coverage:** Mountain ranges of India are definitely covered.
*   **Memorization:** Students will likely have memorized or at least recognized a few key ones (Himalayas being almost universal).
*   **English hurdle:** Minimal. Simply recognizing and transliterating/writing a name is all that's required. Many names are distinct.
*   **Rubric generosity:** Scoring 0.5 for *just one* correct name significantly boosts the potential pass rate. Himalayas alone is a very high probability.

**Estimation Strategy:**

This question feels very similar to "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66% pass rate) in terms of recall and low language demand. The fact that only *one* correct name is needed for a 0.
