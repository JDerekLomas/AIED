Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Arithmetic:** Basic addition and multiplication.
    *   **Time Calculation:** Ability to calculate the duration between two given times (10 am to 4 pm). This involves understanding a 12-hour clock cycle or simply counting hours.
    *   **Contextual Understanding:** Knowing what "temperature increases by X per hour" means in a practical sense.

2.  **Language Demands (English):**
    *   "At 10 am in the morning..." - Fairly common time expression.
    *   "...temperature of Jodhpur was 30^0 C." - Basic numerical information, `^0 C` is a standard unit symbol.
    *   "If the temperature increases by 2^0 C per hour..." - "Increases by X per hour" is a critical phrase. Students need to understand 'increases' (addition) and 'per hour' (rate, implying multiplication over multiple hours).
    *   "...what will be the temperature... at 4:00 in the evening?" - Again, standard time expression and inquiry about future state.
    *   The overall sentence structure is straightforward subject-verb-object with clear conditions.
    *   **Comparison to anchors:**
        *   Less demanding than "Write a theme..." (5%) which requires abstract thought and specific vocabulary.
        *   Slightly less demanding than "Differentiate between archaeological sources..." (15%) which involves two abstract concepts and comparative language.
        *   More direct than "Write a short paragraph..." (30%) which has length and content requirements.
        *   Similar level of directness to "What were the three questions..." (50%), where the main challenge is recalling specific details from a text. This question is recall-based for facts/definitions in a text, but requires application of math.
        *   Comparable to "Name any two Fundamental Rights..." (66%) in terms of direct factual recall/application if they understand the problem setup. However, the time calculation here adds a step that "Fundamental Rights" doesn't have.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   **Application:** This is a clear application problem. Students need to apply:
        *   Time calculation skills (duration between 10 am and 4 pm).
        *   Arithmetic skills (multiplication for the total increase, then addition for the final temperature).
    *   **Reasoning:** Minimal high-level reasoning is required beyond understanding the problem's components and sequencing the operations.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises (Class 6 Math):**
    *   This is a very common type of word problem found in Class 5/6 math textbooks globally, often under topics like "Time," "Temperature," or "Basic Operations."
    *   The numbers are simple (2 degrees/hour, 30 initial).
    *   The main "trick" or point of error would be correctly calculating the elapsed time (10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours). Some might make a mistake and say 5 hours (4-10 = -6 without crossing 12), or struggle with am/pm conversion mentally.
    *   Students from economically weaker sections often have less exposure to such real-world application problems in their daily lives, which could make abstracting "temperature increasing" slightly harder than a pure number problem. However, the concept itself is generally taught.

**Likely Challenges:**

*   **Time Calculation:** The most common error will likely be calculating 10 am to 4 pm. Some might count inclusively or exclusively, or simply miscalculate. 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 is 6 hours. This requires careful counting.
*   **Understanding "per hour":** While 'per hour' is a basic concept, for students with limited English, accurately linking it to multiplication for multiple hours, then addition for the final temperature, is crucial.
*   **Multi-step problem:** It's not a single-step calculation. It requires: 1) calculating elapsed time, 2) calculating total temperature increase, 3) adding the increase to the initial temperature. This multi-step nature elevates it slightly beyond a basic arithmetic problem.

**Comparison with Anchors in terms of cognitive load and English demand:**

*   The 5% anchor requires sophisticated interpretive and expressive English (writing a theme). This math problem is much simpler in English.
*   The 15% anchor requires conceptual understanding and comparative language. This math problem is concrete application.
*   The 30% anchor requires creative writing and fulfilling specific criteria. This math problem is a closed-ended calculation.
