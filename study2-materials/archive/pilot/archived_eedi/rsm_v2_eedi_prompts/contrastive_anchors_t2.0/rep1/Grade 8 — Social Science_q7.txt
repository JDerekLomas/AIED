Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and an estimate:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Specific Event:** Students need to know about the Battle of Plassey, its date (1757), and the key players (British East India Company, Nawab of Bengal). This is standard Class 8 Social Science/History curriculum.
    *   **Concept of "Expansion of Power":** They need to understand what "expansion of British power" means in a historical context (territorial control, political influence, economic dominance).
    *   **Consequences:** Crucially, they need to know the *immediate aftermath and significance* of Plassey beyond just who won. The idea of Mir Jafar as a puppet ruler or direct control over Bengal is a common consequence taught.

*   **Language Demands (limited English proficiency):**
    *   "Contribute to the expansion": This phrasing is somewhat formal and requires understanding the causal link. "Contribute" might be understood, but "expansion of power" as a historical concept might be a stretch for some.
    *   "British power": Relatively straightforward.
    *   "Political dominance," "control," "puppet nawab": These are the key concepts required for a full answer, and these terms themselves, if not previously introduced and understood in English, could pose a barrier.
    *   The answer requires a *descriptive explanation*, not just a one-word answer. This is a higher linguistic demand than simple recall.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   Primarily **Recall:** Students need to recall the direct consequence of the Battle of Plassey regarding British influence.
    *   Secondarily **Reasoning/Application:** While the fact is recalled, explaining *how* it contributed requires a minor degree of synthesis/causal reasoning. It's not just "What happened at Plassey?" but "What was the *impact* of Plassey on British power?" This nuance makes it slightly harder than a purely factual recall question.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 8 exercises often ask for direct causes, events, and short descriptions of significance. This question falls into that category but asks for a *specific kind of significance* (contribution to expansion of power).
    *   It's not a rote definition, but neither is it a complex analysis or debate. It's a key consequence that is usually highlighted in textbooks as a turning point.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Poem Theme):** Much harder. Requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and expression of a nuanced idea. Plassey is more factual.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Archaeological vs. Literary Sources):** This involves differentiating and providing examples, requiring structured knowledge. Plassey is a single event and its direct outcome. Similar in requiring specific content recall but Plassey is perhaps slightly less complex than differentiation. However, explaining "contribution to expansion of power" is harder than just listing examples.
*   **Pass rate 30% ("My favorite season" - paragraph):** This is highly subjective and depends on expressive writing ability, but the *content* is personal. The Plassey question requires factual recall *and* articulation of a historical impact. The linguistic demand is probably comparable, but Plassey adds a factual recall barrier. The rubric for Plassey (max 1 point for a specific idea) is stricter than the more lenient paragraph grading (Winter sweater... got 3 points).
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is direct recall of specific plot points from a story. It's simpler because it asks "what were X" rather than "how did X contribute to Y." Students who knew the story could directly quote. The Plassey question requires slightly more synthesis.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is a direct recall of key terms, very specific and often memorized. Easier than Plassey as it's simpler recall and doesn't demand explanation of consequence.

**Synthesizing and Estimating:**

The question requires specific historical recall (Battle of Plassey, 1757) and the ability to articulate its *consequence* in terms of British power expansion. The key insight (political dominance over Bengal, puppet rule) is generally a high-priority teaching point in this curriculum.

*   It's harder than simply naming fundamental rights (66%).
*   It's harder than recalling three story questions (50%) due to the need for explanation.
*   It's probably *comparable or slightly easier* than the "favorite season" paragraph in terms of expressing a coherent idea, but with a factual barrier instead of a creative one
