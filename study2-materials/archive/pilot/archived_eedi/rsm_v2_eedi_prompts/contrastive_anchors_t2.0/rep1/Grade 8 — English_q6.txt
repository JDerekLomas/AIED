Let's break down the question "Define fable" for Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Concept of "fable":** This is the core knowledge required. Students would likely have encountered fables (e.g., Aesop's Fables) in their vernacular language classes (Hindi, regional languages) or even in earlier English classes. However, *knowing the definition* as a formal concept might not have been a primary focus, as opposed to simply reading and understanding fables.
    *   **Vocabulary related to stories, morals, animals:** These are common concepts, but framing them in an English definition requires specific vocabulary.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   **Single-word definition:** The prompt is "Define fable," which is straightforward.
    *   **Vocabulary for the definition:** The rubric requires terms like "short story," "typically uses animals as characters," "imparts a moral lesson."
        *   "Short story": Common and relatively easy.
        *   "Animals as characters": Common phrasing, might be "जानवरों के रूप में पात्र" (janwaro ke roop mein patra) in Hindi.
        *   "Imparts a moral lesson": This is where it gets tougher. "Imparts" is a higher-level verb. "Moral lesson" is understandable, but linking it with "imparts" in a fluent sentence could be a challenge for students with limited English. They might know "moral" (नैतिक - naitik) and "lesson" (सबक - sabak) separately, but putting them together grammatically in English can be hard.
    *   **Grammatical construction for a definition:** Forming a coherent English sentence defining the term will be difficult for many. They might provide fragmented answers.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** This is primarily a recall question. Students need to remember a specific definition.
    *   **Implicit application (recognition):** If they don't recall the formal definition, they might try to *describe* what they know about fables based on stories they've read. This could lead to partial credit if they capture key elements.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Class 8 English textbooks often include glossaries or definitions, but direct "Define X" questions requiring a precise, multi-part definition in student assessments can be less common than comprehension questions.
    *   They might encounter questions like "What did you learn from the fable?" or "Who were the characters in this story?", which are easier than abstractly defining the genre.
    *   Defining literary terms like "fable" falls into the category of subject-specific vocabulary. While taught, the expectation of a precise English definition from these students can vary greatly.

**Analysis compared to Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."** This requires higher-order interpretive skills and the ability to articulate an abstract concept. "Define fable" is much more direct recall.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history.** This is also definitional, but requires *comparison* of two terms, and the terms themselves (archaeological, literary sources) are arguably more complex and discipline-specific than "fable." It requires *two* distinct definitions and then an understanding of their difference. "Define fable" is simpler because it's only one term. The *language demand* for describing differences is also higher.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season."** This is an essay-type question allowing for personal expression. Students can use simpler English and general vocabulary. The goal is coherence rather than specific academic vocabulary. Many students could string together simple sentences like "I like winter. I wear sweater. I drink tea." Even with poor English, they might get credit. "Define fable" is more constrained.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is direct recall from a story. It requires understanding and remembering specific plot points. The language of the answer ("the right time to do everything, the right thing to do and the right people to work with") is likely directly from the text, making recall easier. No complex definition is needed. This question is arguably easier than "Define fable" because it's very specific textual recall rather than defining an abstract concept.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India.** This is also recall of specific factual information. While the terms
