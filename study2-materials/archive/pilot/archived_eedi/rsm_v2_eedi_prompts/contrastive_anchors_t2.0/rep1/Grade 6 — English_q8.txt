Here's an analysis of the target question compared to the anchors, followed by the estimated proportion correct:

**Analysis of "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence: book/reading/a/is/he"**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic English vocabulary (book, reading, is, he, a). These are very common words usually encountered in early English language learning.
    *   Basic understanding of sentence structure (subject-verb-object, and the common position of 'is' as a helping verb). This is fundamental to forming simple declarative sentences.

2.  **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **Low Vocabulary Load:** All words are likely known even to students with limited English.
    *   **Syntactic Complexity:** The task requires rearranging, which tests their implicit knowledge of English grammar. While this is the core challenge, the resulting sentence ("He is reading a book.") is a very simple and common English construction (SVO with present continuous).
    *   **Instructions:** "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence." The words "rearrange" and "meaningful sentence" might pose a slight challenge, but the context of the jumbled words itself often makes the task clear. Given their Class 6 level, they should have encountered such instructions before.

3.  **Type of Cognitive Task:**
    *   **Application/Recall:** It's primarily an application of known grammatical rules. It's not rote recall of a specific fact, nor complex reasoning, but rather applying learned patterns of English sentence formation. It's akin to a very basic grammar exercise.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very common type of exercise found in Class 3-5 English textbooks, definitely Class 6 as well, aimed at reinforcing basic sentence structure. It's usually among the easier grammar exercises.
    *   The jumbled words themselves give strong clues. 'He' as a pronoun usually starts a sentence. 'Is' typically follows a subject. 'Reading' is an action verb. 'A book' forms a logical noun phrase.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'"** This requires deep comprehension of a poem, abstract thinking (identifying a theme), and sophisticated English writing to articulate it. *Much harder than the target question.*
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each."** This demands subject-specific knowledge (history terms), analytical comparison, and a relatively clear explanation. *Significantly harder than the target question.*
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'"** This requires extended writing, ideation, organization, and a good grasp of descriptive language and sentence construction over multiple sentences. Even simple sentences will add to the cognitive load here. *Harder than the target question.*
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"** This requires recall of specific details from a story, likely read recently. It's straightforward factual recall. *Comparable difficulty, but potentially slightly harder due to needing to remember *three* specific items rather than applying a general rule to given components.*
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India."** This is factual recall of specific Civics information. It's quite direct. The names can be somewhat complex (e.g., Right to Freedom), but simply listing two correctly is all that's needed. This might be slightly easier than the target question for students who have mugged up these facts, or slightly harder for those who haven't encountered these specific terms frequently. However, for the English aspect, it's just producing two noun phrases.

**Conclusion:**

The target question is a very basic grammar task. The words are common, the sentence structure is fundamental, and it's a common exercise type. Students likely encounter this often in lower primary grades and throughout primary schooling to reinforce basic English structure. Compared to writing themes, differentiating sources, or composing paragraphs, this is significantly easier. It's on par with or easier than simple recall questions from texts/Civics for most students, especially if they have some foundational English. The prompt words themselves, if familiar, simplify the task considerably by removing the need for new vocabulary. The constraint of "making a *meaningful* sentence" pushes towards the single correct SVO structure.

Given that the 50% anchor involves factual recall of three items and the 66% anchor is factual recall of two
