Here's a detailed analysis to estimate the proportion of Class 7 students in Indian government schools who would correctly answer the given question:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Grammatical Concepts:** A fundamental understanding of active and passive voice, subject, object, verb tense, and verb forms (especially past participle). This is a core grammatical concept usually taught around Class 6 or 7.
    *   **Vocabulary:** The vocabulary is very simple: "wind," "blew" (past tense of blow), "leaves," "away." This should not be a barrier.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Understanding the Instruction:** "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice." This instruction itself requires some grammatical terminology. While "active" and "passive" might be directly taught, the concept of "voice" could be abstract for some. However, this is a very standard instruction for this type of question.
    *   **Understanding the Original Sentence:** "The wind blew the leaves away." As noted, the vocabulary is simple and the sentence structure is straightforward subject-verb-object. Students should readily understand the meaning.
    *   **Constructing the Passive Sentence:** This is the most demanding part.
        *   They need to identify the object ("the leaves").
        *   They need to choose the correct auxiliary verb ("were" because "leaves" is plural and the original tense is past simple).
        *   They need to know the past participle of "blow" ("blown"). This is an irregular verb, which adds a layer of difficulty compared to regular verbs (e.g., "watched").
        *   They need to correctly place "by the wind."
        *   The phrasal verb "blew away" might also slightly complicate things, but "blown away" is a natural extension.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of grammatical rules. Students need to recall the rules for transforming active to passive voice and then apply them to a given sentence. It's not rote recall of a definition, nor does it require deep analytical reasoning like literary interpretation.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very **typical textbook exercise** for teaching active/passive voice. The sentence is simple, the verb is common, but it does involve an irregular verb's past participle. Many exercises in Indian English textbooks at this level would feature similar transformations.
    *   Compared to the calibration anchors:
        *   **Easier than 5% (Theme of poem):** That requires abstract thought, synthesis, and creative expression.
        *   **Comparable/Slightly Easier than 15% (Differentiate sources):** That requires recall of two specific definitions and examples. This passive voice question requires application of rules, which is often less daunting than definitions for students who may struggle with exact wording. The past participle of an irregular verb is the main stumbling block here.
        *   **Harder than 30% (Paragraph "My favorite season"):** While that requires sustained writing, "Winter\nSweater\nBaju" got full marks, implying very lenient scoring for basic relevance. This question requires *grammatical correctness* and there's only one right answer for full credit.
        *   **Harder than 50% (Three questions the king wanted):** That's direct recall from a story. If they remember the story, it's easy.
        *   **Harder than 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** That's direct recall of factual information, which is often easier if taught. The given answer for "cultural and educational rights" etc. suggests straightforward memory-based recall.

**Key Challenges for These Students:**

*   **Irregular Verbs:** "Blow" -> "Blew" -> "Blown." The past participle form ("blown") is crucial. Many students might struggle to recall or deduce this, especially with limited exposure to various verb conjugations. Common errors could be "blowed" or simply omitting the correct past participle.
*   **Auxiliary Verb Selection:** Choosing "were" instead of "was" and correctly associating it with the past tense is essential. "The leaves *was* blown" is a common error.
*   **"By the wind":** Some students might miss this component, though it's less critical for the core transformation of subject/object/verb.
*   **Grammatical Terminology:** While taught, the precise terms "active voice" and "passive voice" might still be a barrier for a small segment, leading to confusion about the task itself.

**Refinement of Estimate:**

The question is a standard grammar item, but the
