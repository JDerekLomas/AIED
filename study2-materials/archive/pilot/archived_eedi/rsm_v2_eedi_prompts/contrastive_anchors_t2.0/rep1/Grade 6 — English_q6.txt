Here's a breakdown of the analysis for the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?":

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   Assumes students have read the poem (the context of this exam suggests they would have).
    *   Assumes a basic understanding of what a "line" in a poem is.
    *   No specific factual knowledge *outside* the poem is required.
    *   However, it requires an internal, subjective response ("which line do *you* like"). This can be harder for students accustomed to objective, factual recall questions.

*   **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   "Which line... do you like the most": This is a relatively simple English phrase.
    *   "...and why?": This is the key challenge. Students need to be able to articulate a reason.
    *   Students with limited English may struggle to:
        *   Formulate a grammatically correct sentence or phrase for their chosen line.
        *   Express *why* they like it, even if the reason is simple. They might have a thought but lack the vocabulary or sentence structure to express it.
        *   The rubric allows for a degree of "mentioning why," which is lenient, but still requires some expression.
    *   Compare to "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66%): That requires simple recall and naming. No complex sentence structure needed beyond listing.
    *   Compare to "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15%): That requires higher-order language for comparison and differentiation, and precise terminology. This current question is simpler in its core query.

*   **Cognitive Demand (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   **Recall (the line):** Medium difficulty. They have the poem available (or just read it), so identifying a line is possible, though some may just paraphrase.
    *   **Reasoning (the "why"):** High difficulty, particularly for students with limited language. It's not factual recall. It requires a personal connection and the ability to articulate a subjective opinion. This moves beyond simple identification or definition. It's a low-level application of analytical thought combined with expression.

*   **Difficulty compared to typical textbook exercises:**
    *   Similar "What do you think?" or "Why did X do Y?" questions appear in textbooks, but often they are within the context of discussions or shorter, simpler answers.
    *   For students focused on rote learning and factual answers, this subjective "why" question can be unfamiliar and challenging to answer comprehensively in English. They might be able to say "It sounds good" in Hindi, but articulating it in English is another hurdle.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66%):** Pure recall. This question requires more than recall (opinion + reason). Likely much harder.
*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%):** Recall of specific plot points. Again, more straightforward recall than subjective opinion + reason. Harder than 50%.
*   **"Write a short paragraph...on 'My favorite season.'" (30%):** This is the closest comparison. It's also subjective, requires a reason ("what I like to do/eat/wear"). However, it's a *paragraph* (6-8 lines) on a general, familiar topic. The current question is about a *specific line from a poem*, which might be slightly more abstract, but only requires mentioning the line and *a* reason, not a full paragraph. The leniency of the rubric ("mentions why" rather than "explains fully") makes it a bit easier than a full paragraph.
    *   Students could struggle with expressing "why" about a poetic line even more than "why" they like rain. Poetic meaning can be more abstract than practical benefits of a season.
*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15%):** Requires specific terminology, comparison, and examples. Definitely harder.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem..." (5%):** Requires deep comprehension, abstraction, and synthesis. Much harder.

**Conclusion for "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?":**

The demand for expressing a *reason* ("why") is the biggest hurdle. While the "line from the poem" part is manageable, articulating subjective feelings and reasons in limited English for a specific line of poetry is challenging. The rubric is lenient, allowing for simple "mentioning why." It's less demanding than the "favorite season" paragraph in terms of quantity, but potentially similar in the cognitive lift of explaining preference for a specific
