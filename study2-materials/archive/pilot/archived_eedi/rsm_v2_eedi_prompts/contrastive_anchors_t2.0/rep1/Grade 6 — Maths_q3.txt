Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion correct:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior knowledge assumed:**
    *   Basic number recognition (0-9).
    *   Place value understanding (ones, tens, hundreds, thousands).
    *   Concept of "ascending order" (smallest to largest).
    *   Comparison of multi-digit numbers.
*   **Language demands on students with limited English:**
    *   The term "Arrange in ascending order" is crucial. While "ascending" might be a new word for some, "order" and the implied concept of small to large is fundamental to math. Many math questions at this level often include an example or visual cue, which is not present here. However, "arrange" is a common directive. The specific instruction is quite concise and common in math problems.
*   **Recall, application, or reasoning:**
    *   This is primarily an **application** of place value comparison skills and the understanding of ascending order. It involves comparing four multi-digit numbers.
*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   This is a very **standard and fundamental** Class 6 (and even earlier for 3-digit numbers) mathematics problem. It's a foundational skill often introduced and practiced extensively. Students would likely encounter many such problems in their textbooks and daily classroom activities. The numbers are relatively straightforward (no decimals, negatives, or very large number of digits to make comparison extremely complex).

**Difficulty Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Much easier than the 5% item:** The "Last Bargain" theme question requires deep comprehension, inference, and complex English expression. This math problem is purely computational and factual.
*   **Easier than the 15% item:** Differentiating archaeological and literary sources requires domain-specific knowledge in social science, understanding abstract concepts, and the ability to formulate a clear definition/example in English. The math problem is concrete and uses universal numerical concepts.
*   **Comparable to or slightly easier than the 30% item (favorite season):** While "My favorite season" seems simple, getting 6-8 *meaningful* lines about specific activities, food, and clothing in *written English* can be challenging for students with limited proficiency. Many responses in the anchor show very short, incomplete sentences or lists. The math problem requires no English composition, just identifying and ordering numbers. However, making *one* error in the math problem (missing the first number, for example) could still lead to 0.
*   **More difficult than the 50% item:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" This is a direct recall from a story that students have likely read repeatedly. The answer can be short phrases, and the English is essentially copied from memory. While a common math problem, comparing and ordering four numbers has a higher chance of error than simple recall of three short phrases.
*   **More difficult than the 66% item:** Naming two Fundamental Rights is a direct recall of key social science facts. Again, short phrases in English suffice. This is easier than accurately ordering four multi-digit numbers.

**Analysis of Specific Challenges for this Question:**

1.  **Reading "ascending order":** For some, this term might be tricky. If they don't know it, they might order them randomly or descendingly.
2.  **Place value comparison:**
    *   Spotting "736" as the smallest (3-digit vs. 4-digit numbers) is critical and often a common early mistake point.
    *   Then, comparing 3367, 4799, 5492 correctly. This requires careful left-to-right digit comparison.
3.  **Accuracy:** A single transposition or misidentification can result in zero marks if the smallest isn't placed first.

Given that it's a foundational math skill that's highly practiced, but with potential pitfalls in reading comprehension ("ascending") and careful digit comparison, and the maximum score for a correct first number (which implies correctly identifying the smallest) is 0.5. I expect a good number of students will correctly identify 736 as the smallest. Many may even get the full order correct, but the rubric specifically focuses on the *first* number.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%**

This puts it below the 50% recall question but above the paragraph writing, reflecting its computational nature, directness, and commonality in math curriculum, balanced against the potential English language barrier for "ascending" and the carefulness required. The "smallest number first" part of the rubric helps here, as it's a major step that many will achieve.
