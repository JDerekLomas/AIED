Here's a breakdown of the analysis for the question "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it.":

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Low:** Students are not required to recall specific historical facts, scientific concepts, or literary interpretations. They only need to draw on their personal experience, which is universally available. This is a significant advantage compared to the "Fundamental Rights" (66%) or "Archaeological/Literary Sources" (15%) items.
    *   **Concept of "Hobby":** Most students in Class 7, even from weaker economic backgrounds, would understand the concept of a hobby or something they like to do in their free time, even if they don't use the English word daily.
*   **Language Demands (Students with limited English):**
    *   **Sentence Construction:** The question explicitly asks for 4-5 *sentences* and a *paragraph*. This is a step up from single-word or short phrase answers (like the 50% "Three questions" item) and requires basic grammatical structures (subject-verb agreement, simple tense usage).
    *   **Vocabulary:** Students need basic vocabulary to describe their hobby (e.g., "reading," "playing," "drawing"), when they do it ("after school," "on weekends"), and why they enjoy it ("happy," "relaxing," "fun"). While personal, the required vocabulary is fairly common.
    *   **Fluency:** The 4-5 sentence requirement implies a moderate level of English writing fluency, which might be a barrier for many students, even if they understand the prompt. However, partial credit for some sentences might still lead to a pass in a less stringent scoring. Given the rubric is for a "complete paragraph that clearly mentions," short, simple sentences might be acceptable.
    *   **Prepositional Phrases/Adverbials:** Expressing "when" and "why" requires more than just noun-verb structures, increasing the linguistic load compared to merely naming things.
    *   **Compared to other writing tasks:**
        *   "My favorite season" (30%) is a similar task, and the score samples show simple, almost bullet-point answers can still score high. The hobby question has similar demands but perhaps slightly less obvious visual cues (like "sweater" for winter).
        *   "Theme of 'The Last Bargain'" (5%) is significantly harder due to abstract concept and need for textual analysis/interpretation.
*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   **Recall:** This is primarily personal recall and description, not recall of specific facts from a curriculum. This makes it easier than recalling fundamental rights or historical sources.
    *   **Application:** Students apply their knowledge of English grammar and vocabulary to construct sentences describing their personal experience.
    *   **Reasoning:** Minimal reasoning is required ("why I enjoy it" is a simple cause-and-effect statement).
*   **Difficulty compared to typical textbook exercises:**
    *   "My Favorite Hobby" is a very common essay/paragraph topic introduced early in English language learning. It's a standard exercise for practicing descriptive writing. Therefore, it should feel familiar to most students who have done *any* English writing practice.
    *   The "short paragraph" and "4-5 sentences" provide clear structural guidance, which can aid students who struggle with open-ended writing.

**Overall Assessment:**

*   **Easier than:** The more analytical or knowledge-intensive questions ("Last Bargain theme," "Archaeological/Literary sources," "Three questions the king wanted to answer" – which requires recalling specific details from a story).
*   **Similar to/Slightly Harder than:** "My favorite season" (30%) in terms of sentence count and descriptive nature, but "favorite hobby" might require slightly more abstract thought than describing weather, food, and clothes related to a season. However, both tap into personal experience.
*   **Harder than:** Simple recall of facts if fluency is low ("Fundamental Rights" which had 66% pass, possibly because naming two specific items is easier than crafting sentences). The constraint of 4-5 sentences is a key challenge.

Considering the Class 7 level, economically weaker sections, and limited English proficiency, the requirement for 4-5 complete, coherent sentences in a paragraph with logical flow (hobby, when, why) presents a significant hurdle. Many students might manage 1-2 simple sentences, or a list, but struggle to fulfill the "paragraph" and "4-5 sentences" with all specified components clearly mentioned. The examples for "My favorite season" at 30% pass rate show simple fragmented answers can pass.
