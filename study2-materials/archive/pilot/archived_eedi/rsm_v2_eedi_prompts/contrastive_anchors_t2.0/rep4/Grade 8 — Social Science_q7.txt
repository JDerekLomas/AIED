Here's an analysis of the question's difficulty and an estimate of the proportion of students who would answer it correctly:

## Analysis of Question Difficulty

**Question:** How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?

**Rubric:** For explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab). Max score: 1

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Battle of Plassey:** Students need to know about the Battle of Plassey itself – its occurrence in 1757, that it was a British victory, and the key players (Clive, Siraj-ud-Daulah). This is standard Class 8 Social Science history curriculum in India.
*   **British East India Company:** Students should understand that the British East India Company was operating in India and seeking to expand its influence.
*   **Concepts of Political Dominance/Control:** Understanding what "political dominance" or "control" means in the context of one power over another is crucial.
*   **Puppet Rulers:** The concept of a "puppet nawab" (like Mir Jafar) is a key outcome and requires understanding of political manipulation.

**Language Demands:**
*   **Vocabulary:** "Contribute to," "expansion," "dominance," "control," "political" are moderately challenging. "Puppet nawab" might be new to some, but often explained in textbooks.
*   **Sentence Structure:** The question is a direct "how did X contribute to Y" type, requiring an explanatory answer rather than a simple recall of facts. This requires some synthesis and articulation in English.
*   **Abstract Concepts:** Discussing "expansion of power" and "political dominance" requires handling somewhat abstract historical concepts.

**Cognitive Demand:**
*   **Recall:** Students need to recall facts about the Battle of Plassey and its immediate aftermath.
*   **Reasoning/Application:** This is not purely recall. It requires students to understand the *causal link* between the victory at Plassey and the *subsequent expansion of British power*. It's a "how did it contribute?" question, implying an understanding of consequences and implications, not just the event itself. This pushes it beyond simple recall.
*   **Synthesis:** To articulate the contribution, students need to synthesize information about the battle's outcome and its political implications.

**Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   Textbook exercises often ask for definitions, dates, names, or causes/effects in a more straightforward manner. A question like "What was the significance of the Battle of Plassey?" is similar. "How did it contribute?" is slightly more open-ended and requires a clear logical flow in the answer.
*   Students might easily recall that "Plassey was a British victory" but struggle to articulate *how* that victory specifically led to *political expansion* beyond a general sense of British strength. The "puppet nawab" detail, if remembered, makes the explanation much stronger.

## Contrastive Analysis with Calibration Anchors

*   **"My favorite season" (pass rate 30%):** This requires personal expression and simple descriptive language. The content is familiar and concrete. The difficulty here lies mostly in the writing length and coherent sentences, but the core idea is simple. Plassey requires more specific historical knowledge and conceptual understanding.
*   **"Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources" (pass rate 15%):** This is a definition and comparison task for specific social science terms. It requires recall of definitions and an example. It's conceptually harder than "My favorite season" but the content is direct. The language needed for "differentiate" is precise. Plassey is a more specific historical event requiring knowledge of its *consequences*. The *depth of understanding* required for Plassey, to connect a military victory to political expansion, is similar to, if not slightly harder than, precise differentiation.
*   **"Theme of 'The Last Bargain'" (pass rate 5%):** This is highly interpretive and abstract. Students need to grasp a poetic theme, which is inherently challenging for many, especially across language barriers. The content is difficult and the task requires inferential thinking. Plassey is factual history, less abstract than literary analysis, but still requires linking cause and effect.
*   **"Three questions the king wanted to answer" (pass rate 50%):** This is direct recall from a story. If the student remembers the story, they can recall the list. The difficulty is mainly memory and finding the specific information. The language demand is low. Plassey requires more than simple recall; it demands explaining a *causal chain*. This question is easier than Plassey because it's just about memory of
