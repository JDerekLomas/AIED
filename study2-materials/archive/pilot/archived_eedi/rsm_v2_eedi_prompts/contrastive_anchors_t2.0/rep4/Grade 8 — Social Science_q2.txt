Here's an analysis of the "Harappan Civilization's urban planning" question compared to the anchors, followed by an estimate.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge:** This question requires specific historical knowledge about the Harappan Civilization, which is a standard topic in Indian Class 8 history curricula. Students would have studied this civilization, its cities, and key features.
    *   *Comparison:* This is similar to the "Fundamental Rights" question (66% pass rate) in requiring recall of specific Social Science content taught in class. It's less open-ended than "My favorite season" (30%) or "Theme of the poem" (5%). It's more specific recall than differentiating archaeological/literary sources (15%).

*   **Language Demands:** The question asks students to "Describe one key feature."
    *   *Comparison:* "Describe" is a common verb in exam questions and generally accessible. The core terms "key feature" and "urban planning" should be understood if they've studied the topic. There's no complex sentence structure or abstract vocabulary that would trip up students with limited English as much as the nuanced understanding required for a poem's "theme." The examples of correct answers for other items ("Right of to equality," "archaeological source") show that even fragmented or simplified English can score.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:** This is primarily a **recall** question. Students need to retrieve one specific feature from their memory of the Harappan Civilization lessons. It does require *describing* that feature, which implies slightly more than just naming it (e.g., "grid layout" vs. "grid layout of streets, indicating meticulous planning"). However, the rubric for this type of question typically accepts a concise description.
    *   *Comparison:* Very similar to the "Fundamental Rights" (66%) and "King's three questions" (50%) in being a direct recall of information from a taught topic. It's less demanding than "Differentiate" (15%) or writing a multi-line paragraph (30%).

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:** Textbook exercises for Harappan Civilization commonly ask students to list features of its urban planning, describe its cities, or compare it to other ancient civilizations. Identifying a "key feature" is a very standard type of recall question. Students would likely have practiced answering similar questions in class or homework.

**Estimated Difficulty Comparison with Anchors:**

*   **Easier than "Theme of the poem" (5%):** Requires less inferential reasoning, subjective interpretation, and advanced vocabulary.
*   **Easier than "Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" (15%):** Requires simple recall, not comparison and contrast of definitions/examples.
*   **Potentially comparable to or slightly easier than "My favorite season" (30%):** While "My favorite season" is personal, it requires producing a multi-line paragraph, which is harder for students with low writing fluency, even in simple English. "Harappan urban planning" requires only *one* feature, reducing writing burden.
*   **Potentially harder than "King's three questions" (50%):** The King's questions are often presented in a clear, sequential list within the story. Harappan urban planning features might be listed in a paragraph, requiring more extraction of discrete points. However, this is still a core concept for Harappan civ.
*   **Potentially similar to "Fundamental Rights" (66%):** Both are direct recall of standard social science facts. "Fundamental Rights" are perhaps a bit more ingrained due to their importance in civics. However, Harappan civilization's urban planning is usually highlighted as a distinguishing feature, making it a prominent point of recall.

Given that students are likely to have studied Harappan Civilization in detail and its urban planning is a highlighted topic, recalling **one** key feature should be accessible for a significant portion. The lower bound of 50% for "King's three questions" seems reasonable, and it could be higher, closer to "Fundamental Rights." The difficulty of writing a multi-line paragraph in English is circumvented by requiring just one described feature.

**Final Estimate Rationale:**
The question directly tests recall of a central and usually emphasized aspect of Harappan Civilization in Class 8 history. "Urban planning" is a concept taught alongside examples like drainage systems or grid layouts. Students typically learn about this as a distinguishing feature. While English proficiency is a barrier, recalling one concise piece of information is much easier than expressing complex thoughts or extended writing. The pass rate of 50% for recalling *three* specific questions from a story (which requires more precise memory recall of detail) and 66% for *two* fundamental rights (which are very direct memory recall) suggests that recalling one key
