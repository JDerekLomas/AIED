Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic understanding of geometric shapes, specifically a triangle.
    *   Concept of "area."
    *   Knowledge of the formula for the area of a triangle: `Area = 1/2 × base × height`. This is typically introduced in Class 6 or 7.
    *   Basic multiplication of whole numbers and fractions.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   The question uses standard mathematical English vocabulary: "find," "area," "triangle," "base," "height," "cm."
    *   The sentence structure is simple and direct.
    *   Compared to "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate) or "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15% pass rate), the language here is significantly less demanding. It doesn't require inferencing, abstract thinking, or extensive writing. Even the 30% pass rate item ("Write a short paragraph on 'My favorite season'") requires more expressive language.
    *   The 50% item ("What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?") and 66% item ("Name any two Fundamental Rights...") also involve direct recall but are less technical in terms of mathematical vocabulary and procedure. The mathematics question is perhaps even simpler in terms of semantic load than these history/civics questions.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of a memorized formula. Students need to recall the formula and then apply it to given numerical values.
    *   It requires minimal "reasoning" beyond understanding that the given numbers correspond to 'base' and 'height' in the formula.
    *   This is not a complex multi-step problem or a conceptual understanding question.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very **standard, fundamental, and introductory** type of problem for finding the area of a triangle once the formula has been taught. It often appears as one of the first few exercises after introducing the formula.
    *   There are no tricks, extra information, or missing information. The numbers are simple, allowing for easy mental calculation or a straightforward pen-and-paper calculation.
    *   Compared to items like "Write a theme..." (very abstract) or "Differentiate..." (conceptual understanding and comparison), this math problem is very concrete and procedural. The 50% item (recall specific facts from a story) is perhaps closest in its directness but this math problem involves a clear, singular procedure.

**Calibration against Anchors:**

*   **5% Pass Rate:** "Write a theme or central idea..." - Requires abstract thought, literary interpretation, and strong English writing skills. Much harder.
*   **15% Pass Rate:** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." - Requires conceptual understanding of two categories and their differences, plus examples, and English explanation. More complex and higher language demand than the area problem.
*   **30% Pass Rate:** "Write a short paragraph..." - Requires basic English paragraph writing skills, idea generation, and description. This is still a language-heavy task, even if simple. The math problem is purely computational and factual recall.
*   **50% Pass Rate:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" - Pure factual recall from a story. This is relatively straightforward if the student has read and remembered the story. The math problem is also recall of a formula and application. The key difference is that a math formula is less susceptible to memory lapse than specific narrative details for a typical Class 7 student.
*   **66% Pass Rate:** "Name any two Fundamental Rights..." - Pure factual recall of constitutional facts. This is highly direct and a core civics topic. Many students would be explicitly taught and asked to memorize these. The area of a triangle formula is similarly fundamental in mathematics.

**Conclusion:**

The question about the area of a triangle is highly procedural, has very low language demands, and involves the application of a fundamental, commonly taught formula. It is far simpler than the 5%, 15%, and 30% items in terms of language, abstraction, and multi-faceted knowledge. It is comparable in directness to the 50% and 66% recall items. The calculation (`1/2 * 8 * 6 = 24`) is simple. Given that it's a core concept, many students, even with limited English, would likely recognize the numbers, the shape, and apply the formula if they have learned it in their native language (the numbers and operations are universal).

While the overall exam pass rate is 29%, this particular item falls on the much easier end of the spectrum for a math question at this level
