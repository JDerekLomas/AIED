Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimate:

## Contrastive Analysis: "Describe the poet's writing style."

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Literary Terms (Basic):** Students need a rudimentary understanding of what "writing style" means in a literary context. They don't need to know complex literary devices, but they should grasp that it refers to *how* the author writes. This might be covered in a very basic way in literature classes, but for EWS Hindi-medium students, this concept might be abstract.
*   **Reading Comprehension:** Students need to have read the poem (presumably "The Last Bargain" based on the 5% anchor item) and understood its content to form an opinion on the style. The average pass rate suggests understanding of the poem itself might be low.

**Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**

*   **Vocabulary:**
    *   "Describe": This is a common directive, but less frequent than "name" or "list."
    *   "Poet's": Possessive, fairly standard.
    *   "Writing style": This is the key phrase. While "writing" is known, "style" in this context might be less familiar or could be confused with other meanings (e.g., fashion style).
    *   **Response Vocabulary:** The rubric asks for a "suitable and relevant word." This requires students to *produce* an appropriate English adjective (e.g., "simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct"). This is a significant hurdle. They might understand the style but lack the English vocabulary to articulate it concisely. For example, they might think, "The poet writes in an easy-to-understand way," but not be able to produce "simple."
*   **Grammar/Syntax:** The question structure is straightforward. The main challenge is generating the response.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**

*   This is primarily **Application and Reasoning**.
    *   **Application:** Apply their understanding of the poem to categorize its writing style.
    *   **Reasoning:** Analyze the text and infer characteristics of the author's writing approach. It's not recall, as the answer isn't directly stated in the poem.

**Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Difficulty Level:** This question is likely more challenging than typical "recall facts" questions found in Class 7 English textbooks, especially those focusing on grammar or direct comprehension checks.
*   **Abstract Nature:** Literary analysis, even at a basic level, tends to be more abstract than answering questions about plot, characters, or definitions. Textbook exercises often stick to more concrete tasks.
*   **Production Requirement:** Unlike multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blanks, students must generate the answer freely, requiring both understanding and the ability to articulate that understanding in English.

## Calibrating Against Anchors:

*   **5% Anchor (Theme of "The Last Bargain"):** This item requires deeper interpretive reasoning and a more complex textual understanding than "writing style." Even if students grasped the theme, articulating it well in English for a full score is hard. A single word for style seems *potentially* easier than a full thematic sentence.
*   **15% Anchor (Archaeological vs. Literary Sources):** This is a differentiation task, requiring definitional knowledge and examples. It's about recalling factual distinctions, albeit requiring two distinct ideas and examples. "Writing style" requires subjective analysis, but the expected output is much shorter. The conceptual difficulty might be similar if "writing style" is poorly understood.
*   **30% Anchor ("My Favorite Season"):** This is a creative writing task requiring 6-8 lines, open-ended, and relatable. The higher pass rate is likely due to its personal nature and lower bar for scoring (as seen in the "Winter, Sweater, Baju" example getting 3 points, likely full points for meeting line count and topic). This contrasts with "writing style," which requires a more precise and analytical English word.
*   **50% Anchor (King's Three Questions):** This is pure recall from a specific story. If they read the story, the answers are explicit. This suggests many students *can* read and extract explicit information. "Writing style" is inferential.
*   **66% Anchor (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is factual recall, potentially memorized, and has a very high pass rate. It demonstrates students can recall specific terms if explicitly taught.

## Synthesis and Estimate:

The core difficulty lies in:
1.  **Conceptual Understanding:** Do they grasp what "writing style" means?
2.  **Vocabulary:** Can they find an appropriate English adjective to describe it?

Given that understanding a "theme" for the same poem only garnered
