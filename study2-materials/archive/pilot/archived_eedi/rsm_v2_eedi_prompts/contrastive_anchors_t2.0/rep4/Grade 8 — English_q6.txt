Let's break down the question "Define fable" to estimate the pass rate.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior knowledge assumed?**
    *   **Low:** Students at Class 8 would likely have encountered fables (Panchatantra, Aesop's Fables) in their local languages, or even simple translated versions, as part of their curriculum or cultural exposure. The *concept* of a fable is likely familiar, even if the English *term* isn't.
    *   **High (specific term):** The specific English word "fable" might not be commonly used or explicitly defined in their standard English textbooks, especially if the curriculum emphasizes basic functional English over literary terms.
*   **Language demands?**
    *   **Vocabulary:** The key word "fable" itself is the central vocabulary challenge. Students need to recognize and recall its meaning.
    *   **Sentence Construction:** Providing a definition requires forming a coherent sentence or two. The rubric demands a specific set of features ("short story," "animals as characters," "moral lesson"). This isn't just a single word answer.
    *   **Abstract Concept:** Defining a literary genre is more abstract than recalling facts (like Fundamental Rights) or describing a personal preference ("My favorite season").
*   **Recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** This is primarily a recall question. Students need to recall the definition associated with the term "fable." There's no application or complex reasoning required.
*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   Typical Class 8 English textbooks in these settings often focus on comprehension passages, grammar exercises, and simple writing tasks (e.g., "write a letter"). Direct definition of literary terms is less common or detailed compared to higher grades.
    *   It's likely *harder* than simple recall of facts (like the king's questions if the story was just read) but *easier* than open-ended analysis (like finding the theme of a poem) or comparative analysis (archaeological vs. literary sources).

**Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"Write a theme... of 'The Last Bargain.'" (5%):** This requires analytical thinking, understanding nuances, and expressing an abstract idea clearly. "Define fable" is much simpler, as it's a direct recall.
*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15%):** This involves two distinct concepts, comparison, and examples. It's more complex than defining a single term.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My favorite season.'" (30%):** While this is open-ended, it relies on personal experience and basic descriptive English. Many students, even with limited English, can string together some related words, as seen in the examples. Defining "fable" requires precise vocabulary. The "Winter / Sweater" example shows that even disconnected words get partial credit for describing a favorite season. "Fable" has no such leniency for random words.
*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%):** This is direct factual recall from a text that would have just been read. If the story was just taught, many would recall these specific items.
*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights..." (66%):** This is factual recall of commonly taught civic information. Even rote memorization can yield correct answers. It's often reinforced.

**Overall Assessment:**

"Define fable" sits in an interesting spot. The concept of a fable is likely known, but the English *term* might be unfamiliar for precise definition. Students will struggle more with the *exact* English phrasing required by the rubric (animals, moral, short story) than with the general idea.

Many students might vaguely understand it but fail to hit all points of the definition (e.g., they might mention "story with animals" but miss "moral"). Others might simply not know the English word.

Given the limited English proficiency and the nature of the rubric demanding specific components:
*   It's harder than simply recalling factual details (like the king's questions or fundamental rights).
*   It's easier than open-ended analysis or comparative differentiation.
*   The fact that it requires specific vocabulary and structural elements for a definition (rather than just listing random words like the "favorite season" example, which received credit) makes it challenging.

It will likely perform somewhere below "My favorite season" (30%) but above the analytical tasks. The precision needed for the definition makes it harder than simple factual recall.

I'd place it closer to the lower-mid range. The difficulty comes from having to articulate a known concept using the *correct specific English vocabulary* for the definition itself
