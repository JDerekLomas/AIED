Here's a breakdown of the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" and my estimate of the pass rate:

## Contrastive Analysis:

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Difficulty:** Low to Medium.
*   **Class 6 Context:** Students in Class 6 in India would have typically covered basic geography, including major physical features of India, likely starting from Class 3-4 and reiterated in Class 5. Maps identifying major mountain ranges like the Himalayas, Aravallis, Vindhyas, and Ghats would be standard in their Social Science textbooks. This is core foundational geography.
*   **Specificity:** It doesn't ask for details about the ranges (e.g., highest peak, direction, types of rocks), just their names.

**2. Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
*   **Difficulty:** Low.
*   **Key terms:** "Name," "two," "major," "mountain ranges," "located," "India." All are common, simple words.
*   "Mountain ranges" might be translated directly from Hindi as "पर्वत श्रंखला" (parvat shrinkhala) or just "पर्वत" (parvat), which is well within their vocabulary.
*   The output required is just names, minimizing the need for complex sentence construction or advanced grammar. Misspellings are likely, but the rubric allows for identification, not perfect spelling.

**3. Type of Cognitive Task:**
*   **Difficulty:** Low (Recall).
*   This is a direct recall question. Students simply need to remember and list names they've seen multiple times on maps and in textbooks. There's no application, analysis, or complex reasoning involved.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   **Difficulty:** Low.
*   This is a very common type of question found in end-of-chapter exercises or quick checks. "List the major rivers/mountains/cities of India" is standard. It's often accompanied by map work.

## Comparison to Calibration Anchors:

*   **Compared to 5% (Theme of a poem):** Far, far easier. That question requires interpretive skill, abstract thought, and strong English comprehension to articulate a theme. "Mountain ranges" is concrete recall.
*   **Compared to 15% (Archaeological vs. Literary Sources):** Easier. That requires defining and differentiating two abstract concepts, which is more complex than simple recall of geographical names. Students also need to provide examples, adding another layer.
*   **Compared to 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Significantly easier. Writing a short paragraph requires sentence construction, organization, and descriptive vocabulary, which is a major barrier for students with limited English, even if the content is relatable. "Mountain ranges" just requires two words.
*   **Compared to 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Likely similar or slightly easier. This 50% item is also direct recall from a story they would have read. The "King's questions" is often explicitly listed. Students might just write parts of the sentences, similar to how they'd list mountain names. The main difference is that geography is visually reinforced by maps, perhaps more so than discrete facts from a story for every student.
*   **Compared to 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This question is probably *very* close in difficulty, perhaps a tiny bit harder, but largely similar in nature. Both require specific recall of a list (rights vs. mountains). "Fundamental Rights" are significant civic lessons. "Right to equality" and "Right to freedom" are common and often memorized. Similarly, major mountain ranges are prominently taught. However, misspellings of complex names like "Aravalli" or "Himalayas" are more probable than misspellings of "freedom" or "equality." Still, the expectation is identification.

## Estimated Proportion Correct:

Considering the following:
*   It's direct recall of fundamental geography.
*   Language demands are minimal.
*   Visually reinforced by maps.
*   This is a core curriculum item.
*   Rubric is lenient (just needs to *name* one correct range, which earns max score of 0.5 - the rubric states "Names one correct mountain range" which then confusingly says Max score 0.5 - assuming "names two" gets 1, or just one is sufficient to pass and "0.5" is an internal grading weight for the entire item). Let's assume the question requires "any two" so giving two would be full credit, one partial. The anchor points imply scoring where getting *some* part right yields a point. So naming just one might get 0.5, two would be full credit. Even if they
