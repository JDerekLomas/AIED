This is an interesting question to estimate due to the interplay of grammatical knowledge and limited English proficiency.

Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Basic English vocabulary:** Students need to understand the words "tiny," "bird," "built," "nest," "balcony," and "our." This seems reasonable for a Class 7 student.
*   **Concept of an adjective:** Students need to know what an adjective is and its function (describing a noun). This is fundamental grammar usually introduced in earlier grades.
*   **Concept of a phrase:** This is the trickier part. While "adjective phrase" is a specific grammatical term, the rubric only requires identifying "tiny" as an adjective. This implies that if they correctly identify the *word* "tiny" because they understand it describes the bird, they get full credit. They don't necessarily need to explicitly state it's a "phrase," nor do they need to be able to distinguish between a single-word adjective and an adjective phrase (which in this specific sentence, *is* just a single word acting as the phrase).

**2. Language Demands for Limited English Proficiency:**
*   **Sentence structure:** The sentence is straightforward, active voice, and uses common vocabulary. No complex clauses or unusual phrasing.
*   **Instruction comprehension:** "Identify the adjective phrase" is a direct and standard instruction for a grammar question. The term "adjective phrase" itself is technical but presented clearly.

**3. Type of Cognitive Task:**
*   **Application/Recall:** It requires recalling the definition of an adjective and applying it to a given sentence. It's not rote memorization of facts but the application of a learned grammatical rule. It's more complex than simple recall but less demanding than deep reasoning or creative application.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   This is a very common type of grammar exercise. Textbooks would routinely have questions asking to identify adjectives, verbs, nouns, etc., in simple sentences. The use of "adjective phrase" might seem more advanced, but as per the rubric, identifying the adjective itself is sufficient.

**Contrastive Analysis Against Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): "Write a theme or central idea..."** This is very open-ended, requires deep comprehension, inference, synthesis, and articulate expression in English. Far harder.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..."** This requires recalling specific historical content, comparing two distinct concepts, and providing examples, often with more complex vocabulary. This is a conceptual understanding question in a specific domain. Much harder.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'"** This requires sustained writing, creativity, organization of thoughts, and expressing personal opinions. While seemingly simple, executing it to score points involves more English writing proficiency than the current question. Likely harder due to the output requirement.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"** This is pure recall of a specific detail from a text. If they remembered the story, they could answer. If they didn't, they couldn't. This relies solely on memory of content.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): "Name any two Fundamental Rights..."** This is direct recall of civics knowledge. If they knew them, they could list them. The prompt is very clear, and the answer is specific. This is often taught by rote.

**Factors for Our Question:**

*   **Ease:**
    *   Simple sentence structure.
    *   Common vocabulary.
    *   The adjective "tiny" is clearly positioned before the noun it modifies.
    *   Rubric leniency: identifying "tiny" is enough, even if they don't grasp the "phrase" nuance perfectly. This means they only need to identify an adjective, not necessarily differentiate a phrase from a word.
    *   Grammar of this level is foundational and repeatedly covered.
*   **Difficulty:**
    *   "Adjective phrase" is a specific grammatical term. While the rubric simplifies it, a student *could* get confused if they're looking for something longer than a single word, as a "phrase" often implies.
    *   Limited English proficiency could mean that even simple grammatical terms might not be fully assimilated. If they don't know what "adjective" means, they're lost.

Comparing to the anchors, "Identify the adjective phrase" feels like it sits above the 50% (recall of specific text details) but potentially below the 66% (recall of common civics facts taught by rote). It
