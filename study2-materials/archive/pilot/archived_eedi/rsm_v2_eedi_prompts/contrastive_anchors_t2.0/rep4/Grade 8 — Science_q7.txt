Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion correct:

## Analysis of the Question:

**Question:** A gardener has collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit. Does gardener notice any change after some days? Give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health.

**What prior knowledge is assumed?**
*   **Compost/Decomposition:** The core concept is decomposition or composting. Students need to understand that organic matter breaks down. This is typically covered in Class 7/8 Science, often under topics like "Soil," "Microorganisms," or "Waste Management."
*   **Microorganisms:** An implicit understanding that living organisms (bacteria, fungi) cause the breakdown, even if not explicitly named, is helpful.
*   **Soil Health/Fertility:** Knowledge that decomposed organic matter enriches the soil and makes it fertile.
*   **Environmental Awareness:** Basic understanding of waste segregation and resource utilization.

**What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
*   **"Collected waste," "pit," "notice any change," "reasons," "evaluate," "beneficial for soil health"**: These are relatively straightforward terms, likely encountered in general English lessons or science textbooks. "Decomposition" itself might be a slightly harder word, but the concept can be described without it.
*   The question structure is direct, asking for observation, reasons, and evaluation.
*   The length and complexity are manageable.

**Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
*   **Recall:** Recalling the process of decomposition and the benefits of organic matter for soil.
*   **Application/Reasoning:** Applying this knowledge to a specific scenario (gardener's pit) and reasoning why changes occur and how they benefit the soil. The "give reasons and evaluate" aspects lean into application and reasoning.

**How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
*   This is a very common type of question in Indian science curricula for Class 7/8. It directly relates to environmental science, waste management, and agriculture, all of which are emphasized.
*   It often appears as a "think and answer" or a short-answer question in chapters on soil, microorganisms, or natural resources.
*   The specific context (gardener collecting waste) is relatable and concrete.

## Contrastive Analysis with Calibration Anchors:

*   **Compared to 5% item (Theme of "The Last Bargain"):** That item requires abstract literary analysis, nuanced comprehension, and precise articulation of a theme from a specific poem. Many students struggle with identifying themes, especially in English. The current science question is much more concrete and fact-based.
*   **Compared to 15% item (Archaeological vs. Literary Sources):** This item requires precise definitions and distinct examples for two specific historical terms. While common in history, recalling precise definitions and differentiating clearly can be challenging. Our science question, while requiring multiple parts, focuses on a single, broadly understood process.
*   **Compared to 30% item (My favorite season):** This item is creative writing. While the content is personal, the demand is for coherent paragraph writing with descriptive elements. Many students can do *some* writing, but hitting "6-8 lines" with good flow might be difficult for many. The science question demands factual recall and explanation, not creative flair.
*   **Compared to 50% item (King's three questions):** This is pure recall of specific plot details from a story. If the story was covered recently, many could recall. If not, it's very hard. The science question, while involving recall, taps into a general scientific concept that students are *expected* to understand from broader curriculum coverage, not just a single story.
*   **Compared to 66% item (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is direct recall of well-taught civic knowledge. Students in India are explicitly taught Fundamental Rights. While some might get the spelling wrong or confuse specific rights, the concept is very salient. The current science question is slightly more analytical (reasoning and evaluation) than this direct recall, but the underlying scientific concept of decomposition is also very commonly taught.

**Conclusion based on analysis:**

The question assesses a fundamental concept (decomposition/composting) that is taught across multiple chapters (soil, microorganisms, waste management). The language is accessible. While it asks for reasons and evaluation, these are logical extensions of understanding the decomposition process and its environmental benefits, which are typically emphasized. It's less abstract than literary analysis and less reliant on specific term memorization than the history item. It requires more scientific reasoning than merely recalling plot points from a story but is on par with, or slightly harder than, recalling fundamental rights because it asks for more than just naming.

Many students will know that the waste breaks down and that it'
