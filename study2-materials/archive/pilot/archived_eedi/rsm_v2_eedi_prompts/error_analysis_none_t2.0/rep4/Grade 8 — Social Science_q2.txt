Let's break down the potential student responses and estimate the pass rate.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

*   **Social Science Misconceptions:**
    *   **Lack of Specific Knowledge/Confusion:** The most common issue will be a general lack of precise information about the Harappan civilization. They might remember *something* about it (e.g., it's ancient, it's in India), but struggle with specific details.
    *   **Rote Learning Issues:** Students might have memorized "Harappan Civilization" but not truly understood or retained the specific features, especially for open-ended questions that require recall and description. They might be able to pick it out in an MCQ, but not describe it.
    *   **Focus on General Features of *Any* Civilization:** They might confuse "urban planning" with general features of advanced societies (e.g., "they built houses," "they had a king/ruler," "they farmed"). They might think of "planning" as simply building structures, not *systematic* planning.
    *   **Anachronism/Modernizing:** Students might project modern ideas of cities onto the Harappan civilization, leading to vague descriptions that aren't specific to Harappa (e.g., "they had roads," "they built strong buildings").
    *   **Difficulty Differentiating Features:** They might mix up features with other ancient civilizations studied or list general features that aren't *key* or *unique* to Harappan urban planning (e.g., "they used clay," "they had pottery").

*   **Language Misunderstandings (English limitations):**
    *   **"Describe":** While a common verb, some might interpret it as just listing words rather than explaining.
    *   **"Key Feature":** Could be misinterpreted as "any feature" rather than an important, distinctive one related to the core concept.
    *   **"Urban Planning":** This is the most crucial term. Students might understand "urban" (city) but "planning" might be too abstract or they might not connect it to systematic layout, drainage, etc. They might think "planning" simply means *building*. They might simplify it to "city features."
    *   **Specific Vocabulary (Rubric):** Terms like "grid layout," "advanced drainage system," "citadel," "lower town," "baked bricks" require specific recall and understanding. They might know "eent" (brick) but not specifically "baked bricks" as a key feature of planning/construction quality.

*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **Most will attempt:** Given it's a "describe one key feature" question, most will try to write *something* down, even if vague or incorrect, rather than leaving it blank. There's usually an incentive to write something down for potential partial credit (though this rubric is binary).
    *   **Attempts that fail:** These will be the most numerous. Students will write answers that are too general, irrelevant, or confuse specific Harappan features with other aspects or other civilizations.

*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   **Too General/Vague:** "They had good cities." "They built houses." "They were developed." "They were clean." (Cleanliness hints at drainage but is too vague to get a point).
    *   **Irrelevant to Urban Planning:** "They traded." "They had good farming." "They worshipped X god/goddess." "They wore cotton."
    *   **Partially Correct but Not Specific/Key enough for a full point (close misses):** "They used bricks." (Doesn't specify "baked" or link to systematic use). "They had roads." (Doesn't specify "grid layout"). "They had a strong king." (Relates to organization but not *urban planning* directly). "They lived in cities." (True, but not a *key feature of the planning*).
    *   **Confusion with other Civilizations/General Knowledge:** (Less common but possible) mentioning Egyptian pyramids or Mesopotamian ziggurats if they are jumbled in their mind.
    *   **Simple Repetition of Question or Unintelligible:** "Harappan urban planning was good." or grammatically jumbled sentences.

**Estimating Pass Rate:**

Considering an average pass rate of 29% for the whole paper, and knowing Social Science questions, especially descriptive ones requiring specific recall, can be challenging:

*   Many students will lack the precise English vocabulary to describe features like "grid layout" or "advanced drainage system" even if they have a vague concept.
*   The reliance on rote learning often means they can identify from options but struggle with open recall.
*   "Urban planning" itself is a somewhat academic term, and the specifics are
