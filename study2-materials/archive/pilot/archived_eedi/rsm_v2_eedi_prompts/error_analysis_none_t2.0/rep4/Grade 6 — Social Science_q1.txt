Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science/Geography:**

*   **Confusion between Mountains and Hills/Plateaus:** Many students, especially at this age, might not clearly distinguish between a towering mountain range and a significant hill or plateau region. They might list, for example, the Chota Nagpur Plateau or even a large city with high elevation as a "mountain range."
*   **Lack of Specific Nomenclature:** They might know about "high places" but lack the specific geographical names. They might describe them ("the mountains in the North") rather than name them.
*   **Focus on Individual Peaks:** Some might name individual peaks (e.g., "Mount Everest," "Kanchenjunga") rather than the overarching range. While technically Everest is in the Himalayas, the question asks for a "range." The rubric accepts *ranges*, so naming Everest isn't technically a *range*. However, a sympathetic marker might still give some credit if it implies knowledge of the Himalayas. *Correction: The rubric is for *ranges*. Naming Everest is incorrect under the strict rubric.*
*   **Limited Awareness Beyond Local Geography:** Students might primarily know about geographical features in their own state or immediate region, if even that. Knowledge of all-India geography, especially major ranges beyond the most famous, might be limited.
*   **Cultural/Mythological Associations:** In India, mountains often have strong mythological and cultural significance. Some students might recall names from stories (e.g., "Kailash Parbat" - while part of a range, it's a specific peak) rather than strict geographical nomenclature taught in school.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Major":** Students might misunderstand what "major" signifies. They might think of "important" mountains for their local area rather than nationally significant ones.
*   **"Mountain Ranges":** The term "mountain range" might be a bit formal for some. They might understand "पहाड़" (pahad - mountain) but not necessarily the concept of a *range* as a series of connected mountains. This could lead to naming a single prominent mountain.
*   **English Terminology vs. Vernacular:** While the question is in English, their instruction might be in Hindi or regional languages. They might know the Hindi names but struggle to recall/spell the English equivalents, or vice-versa. Spelling mistakes could be rampant. For example, "Himalaya" vs. "Himalayas," "Aravalli" vs. "Aravali."
*   **Difficulty with Retrieval:** Even if they know the information, expressing it concisely and correctly in English could be a hurdle.

**3. Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**

*   **Low-Stakes Question:** It's a factual recall question. Students who have *some* knowledge, even vague, are likely to attempt it rather than leave it blank. It's not a complex problem-solving question that would intimidate them.
*   **Fear of Wrong Answer:** While less likely to deter an attempt here, a fear of being completely wrong might lead some to omit if they truly have no idea.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **Vague/General:** "High mountains," "North mountains," "big mountains."
*   **Individual Peaks:** "Mount Everest," "Kanchenjunga," "Nanda Devi." (These are mountains, but not *ranges* in the strict sense requested.)
*   **Nearby Hills/Plateaus:** Naming significant local hills or plateaus, thinking they qualify as "major mountain ranges." Examples could vary by region of the student, e.g., "Chota Nagpur Plateau," "Deccan Plateau," "Eastern Hills" (rather than Ghats).
*   **Misspelled Names:** "Himalas," "Arawali," "Bindhya."
*   **Religious/Mythological Names:** "Kailash."
*   **Cities with high elevation:** Less likely, but possible for extremely confused students.
*   **One correct, one incorrect:** E.g., "Himalayas" (correct) and "Chota Nagpur" (incorrect). This would still earn 0.5 points under the given rubric if one is correct.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%) for other questions:** This implies a general low performance. For a question where recall of specific geographical terms in English is needed, even if the concept isn't entirely alien, the accuracy is likely to be hampered.

**Rubric Application:** "Names one correct mountain range... Max score: 0.5" This means if they name even *one* of the listed options correctly, they get full points for *this specific sub-part of a question*. They don't need two for full
