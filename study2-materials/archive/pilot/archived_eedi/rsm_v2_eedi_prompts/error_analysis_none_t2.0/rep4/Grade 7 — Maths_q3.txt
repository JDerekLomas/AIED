Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

**1. Misconceptions about Mathematics:**

*   **Formula Recall/Understanding:** This is the most significant hurdle. Many students might:
    *   Confuse the area formula for a triangle with that of a rectangle/square (base x height).
    *   Forget the "1/2" part of the formula.
    *   Recall the formula incorrectly (e.g., base + height).
    *   Not know any formula at all for the area of a triangle.
*   **Basic Arithmetic Errors:** Even if they know the formula, there's a chance for simple multiplication or division errors (e.g., $1/2 \times 8 \times 6 = 4 \times 6 = 24$. Some might do $8 \times 6 / 2$ and make a mistake in division, or even $1/2 \times 48 = 48/2 = 24$ could still lead to calculation errors for weaker students).
*   **Units:** While not strictly penalised in a single mark rubric for "states or uses formula," some might be confused by units, though less likely to affect the *formula itself*.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Find the area":** This phrase should be fairly standard and understood, especially within a math context.
*   **"Triangle":** Most students will recognise this geometric shape.
*   **"Base" and "height":** These are technical terms. While generally understood in math class, a very weak student or one who hasn't revised geometry might not immediately associate them with the formula for a triangle. However, given they are numerical inputs, they'll likely treat them as the numbers to be used.
*   **"cm":** The unit will be understood as length.

**3. Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**

*   **Attempt:** Most students, especially given the simple numerical inputs, will *attempt* this question. It doesn't require complex understanding beyond formula application. Even if they don't know the exact formula, they might try to combine the numbers in some way ($8+6$, $8 \times 6$).
*   **Not Attempt:** Only extremely weak students who have no concept of area or geometry at all, or those who are completely overwhelmed, would leave it blank. Given the question is quite direct, "not attempt" will likely be low.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer Look Like:**

Based on the likely misconceptions:

*   **$48$ ($8 \times 6$):** This would be *by far* the most common wrong answer. It arises from correctly identifying the relevant numbers and operation (multiplication) but forgetting the "1/2" for a triangle (i.e., treating it like a rectangle/parallelogram).
*   **$14$ ($8 + 6$):** This represents a complete lack of understanding of area as multiplication and mistaking it for perimeter or just summing the numbers.
*   **Random incorrect multiplication/addition:** e.g., $8/6$ or other arbitrary operations. These would be less common than $48$.
*   **Missing units:** Often students omit the units ($cm^2$), but this typically wouldn't result in 0 marks if the formula use is correct, as the rubric specifically says "states or uses correct formula."

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**

Given the context:
*   Mostly economically weaker sections, implying varied prior learning and access to resources.
*   Limited English, but "area," "base," "height," and "triangle" are core math terms, likely taught in context.
*   Average pass rate for the general exam is 29%, but this question is a *very fundamental* geometry formula.

This question tests basic recall and application. The "1/2" factor is the killer for many. Students might correctly multiply 8 and 6 but forget or not know to divide by 2.

Considering:
*   A significant chunk will likely default to `base × height` ($48$).
*   Another segment might guess or make fundamental errors like `base + height`.
*   A segment will genuinely know and apply the formula.

I would estimate that more students will attempt and make a partial error (forgetting 1/2) than completely omit. This is a foundational concept taught from Class 5/6 onwards, so some exposure is guaranteed.

Therefore, compared to the general exam pass rate, this specific, foundational question might have a *slightly higher* success rate, as it's less ambiguous than some complex problem-solving questions. However, the trap of `$48$` is very strong.
