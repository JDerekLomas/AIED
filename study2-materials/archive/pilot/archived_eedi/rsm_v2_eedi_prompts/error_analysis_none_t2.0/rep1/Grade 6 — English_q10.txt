Let's break down the likely errors for Class 6 students in Indian government schools tackling "There are (some/any) apples in the basket."

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Limited Exposure to *any* in Affirmative Sentences:**
    *   **Misconception:** Many students at this level, if they've learned the distinction at all, might primarily associate *any* with negative sentences ("There aren't any apples") or questions ("Are there any apples?"). The use of *some* in affirmative sentences would be more common in their limited exposure.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** They might not fully grasp that *any* in an affirmative sentence generally implies "it doesn't matter which" or "no specific one," which is a more advanced concept than just positive/negative usage.
    *   **Result:** They might be confused by seeing *any* in a non-negative context, or simply gravitate towards *some* because it 'feels' more familiar for a simple positive statement.

2.  **Over-generalization/Pattern Matching (leading to *any*):**
    *   **Misconception:** Some students might vaguely recall *some* and *any* being discussed together. In a forced choice, if they're unsure, they might pick *any* because it's "the other option" or because they've seen sentences structured with "are there any..." or "I don't have any..."
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** They might confuse this rule with other similar-sounding words or rules, leading to incorrect application.
    *   **Result:** A common error might be selecting *any* if they perceive it as the 'trickier' or 'more academic' word without understanding the context.

3.  **Lack of Understanding the Nuance of Quantifiers:**
    *   **Misconception:** For many, the words *some* and *any* might simply function as vague "plural indicators" rather than specific quantifiers with contextual rules.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** They might struggle to articulate *why* one word is correct over the other, beyond "it sounds right." If both *some* and *any* indicate more than one, they might see them as interchangeable in this simple affirmative sentence.
    *   **Result:** This can lead to random guessing or sticking with whichever word they vaguely recognize more for "many."

4.  **Influence of Native Language Structures:**
    *   **Misconception:** While not directly applicable to *some/any* distinction (as Hindi/other languages don't have direct equivalents in the same rule set), the underlying thought process for quantities might subtly influence their choice. If their native language is less strict about such distinctions in affirmative statements, it might reduce their sensitivity to the English rule.
    *   **Result:** Might lead to random selection or oversimplification.

5.  **Not Attempting at All / Random Guessing:**
    *   **Would students attempt or not attempt?** Almost all students would attempt this question. It's a short fill-in-the-blank with clear options, not a complex sentence to write or translate. Even if unsure, they'd pick one.
    *   **Why would they guess?** If they truly have no understanding of the rule, they would pick one of the two options. Since there are only two, a 50/50 guess would naturally occur for a subset.

**Most Common Wrong Answer:**

The most common wrong answer would likely be **"any"**.
Reasons:
*   It's the alternative, so any student who doesn't know the rule, or guesses incorrectly, will pick it.
*   For those with *some* partial knowledge, they might over-apply the negative/interrogative rule of *any*, or see *any* and *some* as a paired concept where one of them is "the other choice."
*   It has an English word feel, so it doesn't stand out as 'obviously wrong' without knowing the specific rule.

**Estimated Pass Rate (XX%):**

Considering the average pass rate for Class 6 students on English grammar is 29%, and the specific nature of this question:

*   **Positive Factors:**
    *   It's a very common grammatical point taught early on.
    *   The sentence is simple, unambiguous, and uses basic vocabulary ("apples," "basket").
    *   Only two choices, increasing the chance of a correct guess for those who don't know.

*   **Negative Factors:**
    *   The nuance between *some* and *any* is tricky and often poorly internalized by weaker students.
    *   Limited exposure means many might not have sufficiently practiced this rule
