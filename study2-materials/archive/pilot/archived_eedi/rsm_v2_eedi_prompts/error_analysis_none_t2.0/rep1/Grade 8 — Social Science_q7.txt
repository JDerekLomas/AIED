Let's break down the potential student responses and estimate the pass rate.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **General Historical Misunderstanding/Lack of Specific Knowledge:**
    *   Many students might know "Battle of Plassey = British victory" but struggle to articulate the *consequences* for British power beyond a vague sense of winning.
    *   They might mix up events or consequences with other battles (Buxar, etc.) or broader British imperial expansion.
    *   Difficulty connecting a *single battle* to the *larger concept* of "expansion of British power." They might see it as just one fight, not a pivotal moment.

2.  **Focus on Military Aspects over Political/Economic:**
    *   Students often prioritize direct military outcomes. They might say "British defeated the Nawab" or "British showed their strength."
    *   The crucial element of *political control* (puppet Nawab, revenue collection) might be missed because it's a more abstract consequence than simple victory.

3.  **Language Misunderstandings (Limited English):**
    *   **"Contribute to":** This phrasing might be tricky. Students might understand "how it helped" but struggle to phrase a sophisticated explanation of contribution.
    *   **"Expansion of British power":** They might understand "British power grew" but articulating *how* that power expanded (political, economic, territorial) is harder.
    *   **Vocabulary:** Words like "dominance," "control," "puppet nawab," "revenue," "administration" might be unfamiliar or hard to recall in English. They might know the Hindi/local language equivalent but struggle to translate on the fly.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Forming complex sentences to explain cause and effect can be challenging for students with limited English proficiency.

4.  **Misconceptions about Social Science History:**
    *   **Rote learning:** Students might have memorized "Mir Jafar puppet Nawab" but fail to explain *why* that contributed to British power. They might just state the fact without connecting it to the question asked.
    *   **Lack of critical thinking:** Not explicitly taught to analyze *causality* ("how did X contribute to Y?") but rather to recall facts.

5.  **Attempt Rate and Common Wrong Answers:**

    *   **Attempt but Fail (Most Common):** Most students will likely attempt the question because "Battle of Plassey" is a well-known topic.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer 1 (Vague Victory):** "The British won the Battle of Plassey against Siraj-ud-Daulah." (Fails to link to *expansion of power* in a meaningful way).
    *   **Common Wrong Answer 2 (Incorrect or Partial Consequence):** "The British became stronger." or "They got wealth from Bengal." (Too general or not directly linked to *political* dominance for the max score).
    *   **Common Wrong Answer 3 (Rote Fact without Explanation):** "Mir Jafar became the puppet Nawab." (If they don't explain *why* this expanded British power, they might get partial or zero depending on strictness).
    *   **Common Wrong Answer 4 (Language barrier issue):** They might write some relevant keywords but struggle to form a coherent English sentence that captures the essence of the answer.

    *   **Not Attempting:** Fewer students might not attempt this specific question, as it's a core historical event. Non-attempts would more likely come from complete lack of knowledge about the topic, not just the specifics of its consequences.

**Rubric Analysis:** "For explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)."

The key is "political dominance/control" AND "over Bengal." Merely stating "Mir Jafar was puppet" isn't enough; it needs to be explicitly linked to the *expansion of British power* through *political control*.

**Re-evaluating Average Pass Rate (29%):** This 29% average pass rate for *all* questions indicates a significant struggle across the board. For a specific historical question requiring analysis, this pass rate might even be a bit high.

**Considering the Students (Class 8, EWS, Limited English):**
*   **English as a barrier:** This is probably the biggest hurdle. Even if they know the facts, articulating them precisely in English is hard.
*   **Focus on memorization:** They are more likely to regurgitate facts rather than explain cause and effect.
*   **Understanding "political dominance":** This is a sophisticated concept.

**Breakdown of Likely Responses:**

*   **No Attempt/Completely Wrong/Irrelevant:** 15-
