Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Errors:**

1.  **"Do you think the king's questions are important in real life?"**
    *   **Misconception about English/Grammar:** "Do you think..." requires a "Yes/No" or "I think..." type of opening. Many students, especially struggling ones, might omit this or struggle to construct a proper affirmative/negative response.
    *   **Understanding "king's questions":** While the preceding passage would have introduced the king and his questions, weaker students might forget or not fully connect this phrase to the specific questions the king was asking. They might understand "questions" generally but miss the specific context.
    *   **Understanding "important":** This is a fairly common word, but students from very limited backgrounds might struggle to grasp its nuance, or confuse it with "difficult," "good," "big," etc.
    *   **Understanding "in real life":** This is a critical phrase. Students might interpret "real life" very narrowly (e.g., "my life at home") rather than as "relevant to actual living/human experience." They might just focus on "life."

2.  **"Give one reason."**
    *   **Failure to provide a reason:** Many will state "Yes" (or equivalent) but completely omit the reason part.
    *   **Providing an invalid/unconnected reason:** Even if they attempt a reason, it might be nonsensical, based on a different part of the story, or entirely off-topic.
    *   **Incomplete sentences/fragments:** Many answers will be fragmented phrases rather than full sentences for the reason.
    *   **Struggling with vocabulary to express a reason:** Students might grasp *why* it's important but lack the English vocabulary to articulate it (e.g., they might understand "it's good to know the right time" but write "King wants time").

**Rubric Context:**
"The king wanted to answer (based on the reading passage) the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with. Any valid reason."

*   This rubric *requires* connecting to the specific questions. Weaker students will struggle to articulate this, even if they have a vague sense of it.

**Student Approaches and Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **Not attempt at all (low percentage):** While some might leave it blank, most students in government schools, even weaker ones, will *attempt something* for a short answer question if they recognize keywords. The phrase "king's questions" might be enough to prompt an attempt.
*   **Attempt but fail (very high percentage):** This will be the dominant scenario.

**Most Common Wrong Answers (based on experience):**

*   "Yes." (No reason)
*   "King questions important." (Grammar issues, no clear reason)
*   "Yes. King wants answer." (Doesn't explain *why* it's important *in real life*)
*   "Yes. King wants right time." (Identifies one of the king's concerns but doesn't explicitly link it to "importance in real life" or give a reason for *its* importance)
*   "Yes. Good question." (Generic, not specific enough)
*   "Yes. Because King is wise." (Focuses on the King, not the questions' importance in general life)
*   Answers that might mention "doing work" or "doing good things" but lack clarity or direct connection to the idea of the *questions* being important.

**Likely Roadblocks:**

*   **Abstract nature of "importance in real life":** This is less about recalling a fact from the story and more about critical thinking/synthesis.
*   **Vocabulary for reasons:** Expressing causality and consequence ("because it helps," "so that one can," "in order to succeed") is difficult.
*   **Synthesizing information:** Connecting "king's questions" to the *value* of knowing the right time/people/actions requires more than basic recall.

**Revised Estimated Pass Rate (considering 29% average):**

The prompt is open-ended and requires a conceptual understanding and ability to articulate it. Many students might struggle to go beyond simply recalling "what the king wanted to know" to "why those things are *important in real life*." The vocabulary barrier to explain the "why" is also significant.

If the average pass rate is 29% for such students, this question is harder than average due to its abstract nature and the need for reasoning rather than just recall.

I'd expect a *significant drop* for this type of question compared to recall-based ones. A small
