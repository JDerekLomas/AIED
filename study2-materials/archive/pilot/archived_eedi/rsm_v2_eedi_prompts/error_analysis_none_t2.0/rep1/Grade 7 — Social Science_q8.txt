Let's break down the likely errors for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English, attempting this question.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Misconceptions about Social Science:**
    *   **Specificity vs. General Knowledge:** Students might struggle to differentiate between *general* rural occupations across India and the *specific* main occupations of Rajasthan. They might list things like "shopkeeping," "labour," or "driver" which are present but not necessarily *main* or defining as agriculture/animal husbandry.
    *   **Focus on the "new" or "modern":** There's a common tendency to gravitate towards what's perceived as more "modern" or "aspirational," even if it's not the primary economic driver for the majority. So, they might list factory work, construction (which is related to labour, but less defining than farming), etc.
    *   **Lack of distinction between "rural" and "urban":** While the question specifies "rural," some students might mix in occupations more prevalent in semi-urban or even small urban settings because their exposure might blur these lines.
    *   **Reliance on personal experience/immediate surroundings:** If a student's family has moved away from traditional agriculture or lives near a small town, their understanding of "rural" might be coloured by what they see, even if it's not representative of *main* occupations across a large state like Rajasthan.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Main occupations":** While generally understood, some students might interpret "main" as "any common job," not necessarily the *dominant economic activities*.
    *   **"Rural areas of Rajasthan":** "Rural areas" might be understood simply as "villages" (which is correct), but the *specific* location "Rajasthan" might be overlooked, leading to generic answers. "Rajasthan" might not trigger specific economic imagery for students if their general knowledge about the state is weak beyond its historical/cultural aspects (forts, desert).
    *   **"Describe any one in brief":** The "describe" part might be completely ignored if they just try to list. If they do attempt, their description might be very simplistic ("Farmers grow crops").
    *   **Vocabulary:** Words like "agriculture," "pastoralism," "handicrafts" might be known in Hindi but less easily translated into correct English if their written English vocabulary is limited. They might use simpler terms like "farming" and "rearing animals," which would still be acceptable. "Animal Husbandry" might be known as "Pashu Palan" in Hindi and harder to articulate in English correctly.

3.  **Attempt Rate and Nature of Errors:**
    *   **High Attempt Rate:** This is a direct social science question related to a fundamental aspect of geography/civics. Students are likely to attempt it because it's not conceptually too abstract. They will have *some* idea of what people do in villages.
    *   **Failure in Specificity:** Most failures will stem from a lack of *specificity* for Rajasthan and identifying the *main* occupations. They might list generic occupations rather than the core economic pillars.
    *   **Partial Answers:** Many might correctly name "farming" or "agriculture" but struggle to name a second main one (like animal husbandry or handicrafts), or struggle to describe one even briefly.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   **Generic list:** "Farmers, labourers, shopkeepers." (While laborers are common, it's not one of the *main* economic *sectors* in the same way agriculture or animal husbandry are.)
    *   **Partial correct + generic:** "Agriculture. People also do daily wage work." (Scores partially for agriculture, but fails the second main and specific requirement.)
    *   **List of single jobs:** "Farmers." (Only one listed, or too specific jobs not representing the *main* economic activities.)
    *   **Incomplete/Very Brief Description:** Naming agriculture but saying "They grow crops." and stopping there without any detail or naming a second occupation.

**Rubric Consideration:**
"Names at least two main occupations correctly (e.g., Agriculture/farming, Animal Husbandry/pastoralism, handicrafts)." The *example* occupations are key. They are broad sectors.
The rubric has *Max score: 1*. This implies no partial marks if only one occupation is named. The "describe any one in brief" part seems implied within the 1 mark, suggesting that failure to describe will also lose the mark even if two are named.

**Refined Estimation (Pass Rate):**

*   **Students who get "Agriculture/Farming":** Very high (80-90%). This is universal.
*   **Students who also
