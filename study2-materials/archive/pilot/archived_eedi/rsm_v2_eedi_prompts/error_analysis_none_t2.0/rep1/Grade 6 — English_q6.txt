Let's break down the likely student responses to "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"

**Understanding the Target Audience and Context:**

*   **Class 6 Indian Government School students:** Age roughly 11-12.
*   **Economically weaker sections:** Often implies limited exposure to English outside of school, potential home environment where English isn't spoken.
*   **Limited English:** Core vocabulary and simple sentence structures are likely known. Complex grammar, abstract concepts, and expressive language will be challenging.
*   **Average pass rate (29%):** This is crucial. It suggests a high failure rate even on simpler tasks, so we can expect significant struggle here.
*   **Exam Environment:** Pressure, desire to answer *something*, copying from neighbors (if applicable and allowed to a degree).

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

1.  **Not Understanding "Which line from the poem...":**
    *   **Misconception:** The student might not grasp that "line" refers to a specific textual segment. They might think "Which poem?" or "Which part of the poem?".
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** "Which line" itself is a core English phrase, but combining it with "from the poem" might make it long for them to process. They might interpret "line" as 'topic' or 'theme'.
    *   **Attempt:** Most will attempt something, but it might be completely off-topic or a single word.
    *   **Most Common Wrong Answer:** Simply writing the name of the poem, or just "poem," or a general statement like "The poem is good."

2.  **Not Understanding "do you like the most":**
    *   **Misconception:** "Like" is a common word, but "like the most" implies a comparative and subjective choice. Students might simply parrot a phrase from the poem or write a simple statement that it's "good." The *personal* aspect of "you like" might be missed, especially if they are used to factual recall.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** The superlative "most" adds complexity.
    *   **Attempt:** They will try to express approval.
    *   **Most Common Wrong Answer:** "I like poem." or "The poem is good." or "I like this poem." (without a specific line).

3.  **Not Understanding "and why?":**
    *   **Misconception:** This is likely the biggest hurdle. Explaining *why* requires analytical thinking, expressing an opinion, and using connectors (because, so, it tells me...). This is a higher-order thinking skill in a language they are not proficient in. They are much more comfortable with recall tasks.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** "Why" requires cause-and-effect reasoning expressed in English, which is hard. Even simple causal language ("because it is nice") can be a challenge.
    *   **Attempt:** Many will likely ignore "why" or give a very generic, single-word answer.
    *   **Most Common Wrong Answer:** A simple phrase like "good," "nice," "I like." or ignoring it completely after writing a line.

4.  **Difficulty Recalling a Specific Line and Copying It Correctly:**
    *   Even if they understand the question, precisely recalling and transcribing a full line from the poem can be a challenge. They might mix words, miss words, or copy only a partial line.
    *   **Most Common Wrong Answer:** A garbled or partially correct line, or a few words from a line without the context.

5.  **Not Attempting/Blank:**
    *   Some students might genuinely be lost and prefer to leave it blank rather than risk getting it completely wrong. However, the culture in exams often pushes for *some* answer.

**Common Wrong Answer Scenarios (combining errors):**

*   "The poem is good." (Fails to mention a line or why)
*   "I like poem." (Fails to mention a line or why)
*   "Poem." (Too generic)
*   "I like this poem very much." (Still no line, no specific why)
*   [Writes a phrase from the poem, e.g., "The cat sat on the mat."] (Fails the "why" part, might miss "most liked")
*   "The cat sat on the mat because good." (Attempts 'why' but fails miserably in articulation)
*   [Copies the *entire* poem, hoping to get it right by sheer volume.] (Not what's asked)

**Analysis of the Rubric (Max Score: 1.5):**
*   **"Denotes a line from the poem":
