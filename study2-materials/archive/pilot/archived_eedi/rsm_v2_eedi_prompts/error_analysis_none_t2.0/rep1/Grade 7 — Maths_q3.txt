Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

**1. Misconceptions about Mathematics:**

*   **Forgetting or Incorrect Formula:** This is the most significant mathematical hurdle.
    *   **Common error:** Using the formula for a rectangle/square (base × height). This is the most direct incorrect formula for a shape.
    *   **Common error:** Forgetting the "1/2" part. This is incredibly common. They know it's *related* to base and height but miss the factor of half.
    *   **Less common, but possible:** Using other unrelated formulas (perimeter, volume - unlikely for this question's phrasing, but not impossible if panic sets in).
*   **Difficulty with "1/2":** Even if they recall `1/2 * b * h`, multiplying by 1/2 (or dividing by 2) can be an arithmetic error point for some.
    *   They might do `(8 * 6) / 2`, but then make an error in the division (e.g., divide only one number, or make a mental math error with 48/2).
    *   They might interpret `1/2 * b * h` as `1` divided by `2` then times `b` then times `h`, but make an error in the order or actual division.
*   **Confusing "base" and "height" with other triangle properties:** Unlikely given the direct phrasing, but some might wonder if they should be finding sides, or if '6' and '8' are meant to be two different types of 'sides' and try Pythagoras (if they know it, which is likely later for Class 7 but some advanced students might jump to it mistakenly).
*   **Units:** While not directly affecting the formula's correctness for "score 1", they might get confused about how units combine (`cm^2` vs `cm`). This *might* signal a fundamental misunderstanding, but the rubric focuses solely on the formula.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Area":** While common in mathematics, students with limited English might struggle if "area" is not fully understood in a mathematical context (i.e., the space inside). They might know "area" as a region but not its calculation.
*   **"Triangle":** Unlikely to be misunderstood visually, but the word itself might be less familiar than the shape.
*   **"Base" and "Height":** These terms are generally clear from diagrams in textbooks, but if taught purely verbally in English to ESL students, they might be ambiguous without context. However, these are standard mathematical terms often introduced early.
*   **"Whose base is..." and "height is...":** The sentence structure is straightforward.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **Most will attempt:** Given it's a direct calculation for a common shape, most students will attempt something, even if it's incorrect.
*   **No attempt likely if:**
    *   They absolutely do not recognize the terms "area," "triangle," or the relationship of "base" and "height" to an area calculation.
    *   They have zero recall of any geometric formula.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **48 cm² (or just 48):** This comes from `base × height` (the rectangle formula). This is the most dominant wrong answer because it's simpler and part of the correct formula, just missing the `1/2`.
*   **24 (or 24 cm²):** This is the correct answer.
*   **14 (or 14 cm):** This comes from `base + height` (or even perimeter if they add 8+6, then incorrectly double it - unlikely). This shows a complete lack of understanding of area.
*   **Variations of 48 (e.g., 2 errors in arithmetic after 8*6, leading to something close to 48 but wrong, or an error in 48/2).**

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**

Considering the average pass rate for Class 7 students in Indian government schools from EWS sections is about 29% for general math problems:

*   **Forgetting "1/2":** This will be a *huge* factor. Many will correctly multiply base by height but miss the division by 2. This suggests a large group getting 48.
*   **Forgetting formula entirely:** A smaller group.
*   **Arithmetic errors:** Some will recall the formula but make an error with 48/2.
*   **Language barrier:** Minor, but can contribute.
