Let's break down the potential student responses and estimate the pass rate.

**Likely Errors and Considerations:**

1.  **Misconceptions about Social Science:**
    *   **Focus on memorized facts, not analysis:** Many students are taught to memorize names, dates, and lists of features. They might list *something* about Harappan civilization (e.g., they grew wheat, they traded with Mesopotamia) rather than focusing on "urban planning."
    *   **Lack of understanding of "features":** They might struggle to differentiate between a "feature" (an intrinsic characteristic) and a mere "fact" about the civilization.
    *   **Confusing with other ancient civilizations:** There's a chance they might recall facts about Egyptian or Mesopotamian civilizations if they have been taught these in proximity, and mix them up.
    *   **Limited conceptual understanding of "urban planning":** The term "urban planning" itself might be abstract. They might associate it more with modern cities rather than ancient ones, or not fully grasp what it entails beyond just "buildings."

2.  **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Describe one key feature":**
        *   "Describe" can sometimes be interpreted as "list" for lower proficiency students.
        *   "Key feature" might be hard to identify for those who struggle with inferential reasoning or have only surface-level knowledge. They might pick any feature they remember, not necessarily a *key* one related to *urban planning*.
    *   **"Harappan Civilization":** While this term is specific, misspellings or confusion with other ancient Indian empires (like Mauryan or Gupta) are possible, especially if their understanding of time periods is weak.
    *   **"Urban Planning":** This is the trickiest part.
        *   "Urban" relates to cities.
        *   "Planning" implies systematic design, foresight, and organization.
        Students might not grasp the full implications of "planning." They might simply think "what was in Harappan cities?" and miss the *planned* aspect.
        *   Phrases like "grid system," "drainage system," "citadel" involve specific vocabulary that might be beyond their everyday English. Even if they know the Hindi equivalents, translating them accurately on paper could be a hurdle.

3.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **Attempt but fail:** This is highly probable. Given it's a "describe" question, and Harappan civilization is a prominent topic in Indian history curricula, most students would attempt something. However, the quality and relevance of their attempts would vary widely.
    *   **No attempt at all:** Less likely for this specific question, as it's foundational history. Only those completely unaware or overwhelmed might leave it blank.

4.  **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   **Focus on unrelated aspects:**
        *   "They grew wheat and barley."
        *   "They worshipped Pashupati Mahadev."
        *   "They had great baths." (Closer, but "great bath" isn't a *feature of urban planning* but rather a specific building. While *use of advanced public structures* hints at planning, the Great Bath alone might not fully satisfy the prompt for a weaker student).
        *   "They traded with Mesopotamia."
    *   **Vague descriptions:**
        *   "Their cities were good."
        *   "They had many houses."
    *   **Partial or underdeveloped correct answer:**
        *   "They had a drainage system." (This would get marks, as it's a key feature. The prompt just asks for "one key feature.")
        *   "Their streets were straight." (Close to grid layout, but less precise.)
        *   "They had good construction." (Vague, but leans towards baked bricks).
    *   **Incorrect vocabulary:** Attempting to describe the drainage system but using inaccurate or unintelligible English.

**Rubric Analysis:** The rubric is quite lenient, accepting "grid layout," "advanced drainage system," "use of baked bricks," or "division of the city." This means even a single, well-chosen phrase will pass.

**Estimating Pass Rate:**

Considering the factors:

*   **Average pass rate of 29% for the *entire* paper:** This suggests overall academic challenges, language barriers, and limited conceptual understanding.
*   **Targeting "economically weaker sections with limited English":** Reinforces the language and conceptual hurdles.
*   **The question's topic is core:** Harappan civilization is a high-recall topic, increasing the likelihood of *some* knowledge.
*   **The rubric is generous:** Only *one* feature, and several options are acceptable. This mitigates the risk of failing due to
