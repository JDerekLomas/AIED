Let's break down the potential student responses and estimate the pass rate.

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

1.  **Misconceptions about Social Science:**
    *   **Lack of Causal Link Understanding:** Students might know *about* the Battle of Plassey and *about* British expansion, but struggle to articulate the *causal connection*. They might just list facts rather than explain *how* one led to the other.
    *   **Focus on Military Aspect Only:** Many history lessons emphasize the battle itself (who fought, who won), but might not delve deep into the *political aftermath* and its implications for power dynamics. They might say "British won the battle" without linking it to "control over Bengal."
    *   **Oversimplification/Vagueness:** They might say "British power increased" or "British became powerful" without specifying *how* or *where*. The rubric specifically asks for the *mechanism* (political dominance/control over Bengal) and the *evidence* (puppet nawab).
    *   **Confusing with other battles/events:** With limited historical context and numerous events leading to British expansion, some might conflate Plassey's significance with other treaties, annexations, or earlier trading company activities.
    *   **Rote learning vs. understanding:** If they've simply memorized a textbook sentence without truly understanding the concepts of political dominance or puppet rule, they might misremember or misuse the key terms.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings (English as L2):**
    *   **"Contribute to the expansion of":** This phrasing might be tricky. Students might understand "expansion" but struggle with "contribute to," making it difficult to articulate the causal link required. They might just state outcomes rather than the *process*.
    *   **Specific vocabulary:** Words like "dominance," "puppet nawab," "political," "establishment," "control" might be understood in a general sense, but the precise nuance required by the rubric could be lost. "Puppet" is an abstract concept when applied to a person, especially in a historical context.
    *   **Sentence construction:** Even if they know the core facts, articulating a coherent, grammatically correct sentence explaining a complex historical relationship in English might be challenging.

3.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **Most students will attempt.** This is a direct factual question related to a significant event. They likely know *something* about the Battle of Plassey.
    *   **Failure to articulate the *contribution* is the main issue.** They might write "British won the battle. British power increased." This isn't enough to score a point according to the rubric.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   **"The British won the Battle of Plassey."** (Factual, but lacks explanation of *contribution* to power expansion).
    *   **"British got stronger after Plassey."** (Too vague, lacks specificity of political control or Bengal).
    *   **"British started ruling India."** (Too broad, not specific to Bengal or the immediate aftermath of Plassey, and an oversimplification of their initial foothold).
    *   **"They got money/revenue."** (Partially correct regarding economic aspect, but doesn't hit "political dominance/control" directly enough, though it's an indirect consequence).
    *   **Incorrect names or dates:** Some might get the name right but muddle the date, or get Mir Jafar wrong.

**Applying to the Rubric:**

The rubric is quite specific: "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)."

*   **Political dominance/control over Bengal:** This is the core.
*   **Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab:** This is the concrete example illustrating that control.

Simply stating "British won" or "British got powerful" will *not* meet this rubric. They need to show understanding of the *transfer of political authority* specifically in *Bengal*.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**

Considering the factors:

*   **Economically weaker sections, limited English:** Increases the difficulty of articulating complex ideas precisely in English.
*   **Average pass rate (across all subjects/questions): 29%:** This is a benchmark for overall performance, but this specific question might be harder due to its conceptual nature.
*   **Complexity of causal link:** Articulating "how" something contributed is harder than "what" happened.
*   **Specific rubric:** Requires more than just knowing facts; it requires explaining *implications* and using precise historical terms/concepts.

While many will know *of* Plassey, linking it clearly and concisely to *political dominance over Bengal through a puppet ruler
