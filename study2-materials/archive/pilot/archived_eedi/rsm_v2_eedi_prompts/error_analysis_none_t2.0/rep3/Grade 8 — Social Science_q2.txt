Let's break down the potential student responses and estimate the pass rate.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **General Lack of Knowledge/Recall (Most Significant Factor):**
    *   Many students, especially with a 29% average pass rate, simply won't have sufficiently studied or retained specific facts about Harappan urban planning. Their understanding might be very superficial ("old city," "ancient").
    *   Social science teaching in many government schools can be rote learning focused, where concepts aren't deeply understood, and specific details fade quickly if not frequently revised.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings (Moderate Impact):**
    *   "Describe" is generally understood, but "key feature" might be tricky. Students might list something very generic rather than a distinguishing characteristic.
    *   "Urban planning" itself might be somewhat complex. While "city planning" is similar, the formal term "urban" might feel academic.
    *   "Harappan Civilization" is the crucial keyword. If they don't recognize this term (perhaps learned it as "Indus Valley Civilization" and haven't connected the two, or simply don't remember the name), they will struggle immensely.
    *   Limited English proficiency means even if they have some knowledge, articulating it clearly and correctly in English might be a hurdle. They might have a Hindi or regional language equivalent thought, but struggle to translate it accurately.

3.  **Misconceptions about Social Science/History (Less Common but Possible):**
    *   **Focus on Culture vs. Infrastructure:** They might recall something about Harappan pottery, seals, or deities rather than the physical layout of the city, not distinguishing between cultural aspects and structural/planning aspects.
    *   **Over-generalization:** They might just say "they had good cities" without specifying *how* or *what* made them good.
    *   **Confusion with Other Civilizations:** Very weak students might vaguely recall other ancient civilizations (e.g., Vedic period) and mix up features.

4.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   Many students would **attempt** the question because it's a straightforward "describe" task. There's no complex problem-solving or essay-writing required, just recall. They might write something, even if incorrect.
    *   Only those who truly draw a complete blank on "Harappan Civilization" or "urban planning" would likely leave it entirely blank.

**Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   "They had a big city." (Too generic, no key feature)
*   "They made pots and seals." (Confusing with cultural features)
*   "They worshipped many gods." (Confusion with religious aspects)
*   "They were farmers." (General feature of most ancient civilizations, not specific to urban planning)
*   "Their cities were good/nice." (Evaluative, but lacks specific description)
*   "They lived near rivers." (Feature of location, not planning)
*   "Indus Valley." (Name, not a feature)
*   Broken English attempts at features they might vaguely remember, e.g., "road straight," "water good flow." These might get partial credit if discernible, but given the rubric, "Correctly describes one key feature" is strict.

**Focus on Passing Criteria:**

The rubric is fairly forgiving if *one* specific feature is mentioned correctly.

*   "well-planned grid layout of streets"
*   "advanced drainage system"
*   "use of baked bricks"
*   "division of the city into a citadel and a lower town"

These are distinct, concrete points.

**Estimate for Pass Rate:**

Considering the factors:

*   **Baseline Pass Rate (29%):** Many in this group are at risk of not knowing specific historical details.
*   **English Language Barrier:** This is a significant filter. Even if they know the Hindi equivalent, expressing it accurately in English is hard.
*   **Specific Recall Needed:** This isn't a general knowledge question; it requires precise recall of historical details.
*   **Likelihood of Partial Recall:** Some might vaguely remember "drainage" or "bricks" but struggle to phrase it precisely.
*   **Generality of "Key Feature":** Allows for any one of several distinct points.

I think the proportion that can recall and articulate *one* of these distinct features accurately in English will be quite low, even among those who might pass the overall exam. The common wrong answers show a lack of specific knowledge more than language issues (though language compounds it).

Let's imagine:
*   A small percentage will have strong knowledge and good English.
*   Another small percentage might know the fact but struggle with the English to convey it precisely.
*   A
