Let's break down the likely errors for Class 6 students in Indian government schools from economically weaker sections, with limited English.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **"Some" vs. "Any" Misconception:**
    *   **The Core Difficulty:** This is the most common and fundamental challenge for non-native English speakers. The rule of "some" in affirmative sentences and "any" in negative/interrogative sentences is tricky. Many learners initially overuse "any" or simply don't have a clear grasp of the distinction.
    *   **Cognitive Load:** Even if a teacher has explained it, rote memorization without deep understanding or sufficient practice means the rule often gets confused under test conditions. They might remember *there is a difference* but not *what the difference is*.
    *   **Lack of Exposure:** Limited exposure to English outside of the classroom means less intuitive understanding of these nuanced usages.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Apples in the basket":** This part is likely understandable. "Apples" and "basket" are common enough nouns that they might have learned.
    *   **"Choose the correct word":** The instruction itself is simple and likely understood.
    *   **"There are":** This phrase is also very common and probably understood as indicating existence.
    *   **Focus on the blank:** Students will correctly identify that the choice is between "some" and "any." The challenge isn't understanding the rest of the sentence, but correctly applying the rule for the target words.

3.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **Attempt:** Most students will *attempt* this question. It's a multiple-choice/fill-in-the-blank format, which encourages an answer. There are only two options, reducing the barrier to entry compared to an open-ended question. They won't leave it blank because it seems like there *should* be an answer.
    *   **Guessing:** Given the limited English, a significant portion will be guessing rather than applying a learned rule confidently. A 50/50 guess is possible if they truly have no idea.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   **"Any":** The most common wrong answer would be **"any"**.
        *   Why? Learners often over-generalize "any" for all contexts of 'some quantity'. They might have encountered "any" in negative or question forms and not fully internalised its restriction, or simply default to it if they don't know the "some" rule.
        *   It might also feel like a more "versatile" word if they have a vague understanding that "some" is for specifics. Since the quantity isn't specific ("some" can be vague too), "any" might seem to fit.
        *   Another reason is confusion: "Is there any bread?" / "Do you have any brothers?" sound correct, and this might lead to the idea that "any" works for *presence* generally.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29% for general English questions):**

This specific question isolates a common grammatical rule that is frequently problematic. If the overall pass rate for English is 29%, it means a lot of students struggle with fundamental concepts.

*   If they understand sentence structure and basic vocabulary, they will correctly identify the task.
*   The confusion is squarely on the 'some/any' distinction.

**Revised thought process for estimation:**

*   A certain percentage will know the rule, either through good teaching, rote learning, or occasional exposure. Let's say this is perhaps 20% who genuinely *know*.
*   A significant portion will *guess*. Since it's 50/50, half of the guessers might get it right.
*   However, "any" is a *distractor* because it feels plausible for those who haven't fully grasped the rule. The appeal of "any" as a common error will reduce the number of correct guesses for "some." It's not a truly random 50/50 guess for the unaware; there's a strong lean towards "any."

Let's imagine:
*   **Knows the rule:** 20%
*   **Guessed "some" (lucky or intuitive):** 10% (this is lower than 50% of the rest due to the strong distractor of "any")
*   **Guessed "any" (common error):** 60%
*   **Didn't attempt (unlikely):** 0%

**Refined Estimation based on error analysis:**

The "some/any" rule is usually taught explicitly and then drilled. However, *retention
