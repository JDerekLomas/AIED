Let's break down the potential errors for Class 7 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections with limited English attempting to transform "The wind blew the leaves away" into passive voice.

**Understanding the Context:**

*   **Limited English:** This is the biggest hurdle. Grammar terms like "active voice" and "passive voice" are highly abstract and require a strong foundational understanding of sentence structure and verb forms.
*   **Economically Weaker Sections:** May have less exposure to English outside of school, potentially less access to additional learning materials or support.
*   **"Average pass rate is about 29%":** This is a critical baseline. It tells us that most students struggle significantly with general English comprehension and grammar. This particular question is more complex than a simple vocabulary or fill-in-the-blank.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Complete Lack of Understanding of "Active Voice" / "Passive Voice":**
    *   Many students simply won't know what these terms mean, despite them being taught. The terms themselves are technical.
    *   They might think it means rephrasing the sentence, but without understanding the grammatical rules.

2.  **Difficulty Identifying Subject/Object/Verb:**
    *   Even if they *know* the rules in theory, they might struggle to accurately identify "the wind" (subject), "blew" (verb), and "the leaves" (object).
    *   Confusion between subject and object is a foundational barrier.

3.  **Past Tense vs. Present Tense / "was/were" vs. "is/are":**
    *   The original sentence is "blew" (past simple). Passive voice requires "was/were" + past participle.
    *   A very common error would be using "are" instead of "were," or "is" if they mistakenly identify "the leaves" as singular.
    *   They might use a present participle (blowing) instead of past participle (blown).

4.  **Incorrect Past Participle of "blow":**
    *   "Blew" (past simple) is often confused with "blown" (past participle). Many irregular verbs are challenging.
    *   Common mistakes: "blowed," "blowing," or simply repeating "blew."

5.  **Placement of "by the wind":**
    *   Even if they get the initial structure correct ("The leaves were blown away..."), adding "by the wind" at the end is often forgotten or incorrectly placed. They might put it at the beginning, or insert it awkwardly.

6.  **Omission/Simplification:**
    *   Students might just write "The leaves blew away." (Missing 'were blown').
    *   Or, "Leaves were away." (Too much simplification).

7.  **Changing Meaning or Core Components:**
    *   They might completely rephrase the sentence into something unrelated, like "Wind takes leaves."
    *   They might change "the leaves" to "leaves" (minor error) or "wind" to "a wind" (minor error).

**Would Students Attempt or Fail/Not Attempt?**

*   **Attempt but fail:** Highly likely. The question asks for a *change*, so most will try to produce *some* English sentence.
*   **Not attempt at all:** Some students who are completely overwhelmed or have no idea what "active/passive voice" means might leave it blank, but many will scribble something down in the hope of getting a partial mark. The "29% pass rate" suggests a high proportion of attempts resulting in failure.

**Most Common Wrong Answer:**

Based on the above, here are the likely front-runners for the most common wrong answers:

1.  **"The leaves are blown away by the wind."** (Incorrect tense - "are" instead of "were" is a very common mistake with past tense passive).
2.  **"The leaves were blew away by the wind."** (Incorrect past participle of "blow").
3.  **"The leaves blew away."** (Omission of "were blown" and "by the wind," making it look like the leaves are doing the blowing).
4.  **"Leaves were blown away."** (Minor omission of "the").
5.  **"The leaves was blown away by the wind."** (Treating "leaves" as singular).

Considering the challenges, "The leaves are blown away by the wind" is probably the most sophisticated wrong answer that still demonstrates some understanding of the general structure. "The leaves were blew away by the wind" shows knowledge of "were" but not irregular verbs. "The leaves blew away" indicates extreme simplification.
