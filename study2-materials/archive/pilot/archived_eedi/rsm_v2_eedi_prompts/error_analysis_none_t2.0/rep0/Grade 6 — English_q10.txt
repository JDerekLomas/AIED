Let's break down the likely errors for Class 6 students in Indian government schools tackling "There are (some/any) apples in the basket."

**Understanding the Student Context:**

*   **Limited English:** This is key. Grammar nuances like 'some' vs. 'any' are often challenging even for higher-level learners.
*   **Economically Weaker Sections:** Might imply less exposure to diverse English inputs outside school (e.g., books, digital media).
*   **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is a very low baseline, suggesting significant academic struggles overall. Even seemingly simple questions might trip them up.
*   **Question Type:** Multiple choice, but still requires understanding.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **"Some" vs. "Any" for Quantity (The Core Error):**
    *   Students might not fully grasp that 'any' is primarily for negative sentences and questions, while 'some' is for affirmative sentences (and some questions).
    *   They might view both as general terms for "a few/some quantity" without distinguishing context.
    *   They may have only encountered 'any' in a very specific context (e.g., "Do you have *any* books?").

2.  **Rote Learning / Lack of Application:**
    *   They might have been *taught* the rule, but haven't internalized it enough to apply it consistently, especially under test pressure.
    *   They might randomly guess if unsure, or choose the word that "sounds better" to them, which could be either.

3.  **Confusion with Other Uses of "Any":**
    *   Less likely at this basic level, but if they've seen 'any' used in "at all" sense (e.g., "I can't see *any* difference at all"), it might add to general confusion about its function.

4.  **"Sounds Right" Instinct:**
    *   For some students, especially if they've heard English spoken even sporadically, 'some' might sound more natural in a positive statement about existing items. This is a good sign if they get it right.
    *   However, for others, *both* might sound acceptable, leading to a coin-flip choice.

5.  **Not Attempting vs. Attempting and Failing:**
    *   Given it's a multiple-choice question with only two options, most students would **attempt** it. There's a 50/50 chance of getting it right even with a random guess.
    *   The problem isn't usually *not attempting* such a straightforward fill-in-the-blank at this level, but *failing* to apply the correct rule.

6.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   The most common wrong answer would unequivocally be **'any'**. This is the other option, and students who don't know the rule are equally likely to pick it.
    *   The sentence would become: "There are **any** apples in the basket." This isn't grammatically correct in an affirmative sentence, but to a student unfamiliar with the distinction, it might seem like just another way to say there's a quantity of apples.

**Estimated Proportion Correct (Pre-analysis thought: If random guess, 50%. But it's not random.)**

Considering the average pass rate is 29% for general questions, this specific question is still likely to be on the *easier side* of grammar, but the nuance of 'some' vs. 'any' is surprisingly difficult for beginners.

*   **Guessing factor:** Roughly 50% might get it right by sheer chance if they had *no idea*.
*   **Students who genuinely know the rule:** A smaller percentage. Let's say maybe 20-30% of the class.
*   **Students who make the specific 'any' error:** The majority of those who get it wrong will likely pick 'any'.
*   **Students who get it right by "sound":** Some might intuitively feel 'some' is better.

However, given the very low general pass rate of 29% and the fact that *some/any* is a fundamental but often tricky concept for English Language Learners, many will struggle. The low general pass rate implies that a significant portion struggles with basic comprehension and rules.

If the overall pass rate is 29%, a question focused on a specific grammatical distinction, even a relatively simple one, is unlikely to be much higher than that *without random chance*.

Let's estimate how many might get it right:
*   **Truly understanding the rule:** ~15-20%
*   **Correct guess/instinct:**
