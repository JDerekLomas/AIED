Let's break down the potential errors and arrive at an estimated pass rate.

**Understanding the Target Audience:**

*   **Class 6 Indian Government School Students:** Typically 11-12 years old.
*   **Economically Weaker Sections:** Less exposure to English outside school.
*   **Limited English:** Fundamental grasp, but complex grammar or abstract concepts might be challenging.
*   **Average Pass Rate 29% (general):** This gives a benchmark for their overall performance on English questions.

**Analysis of Errors:**

1.  **Fundamental Lack of Sentence Structure Knowledge (Subject-Verb-Object):**
    *   Many students, especially at this level and background, might not explicitly understand SVO. They're more likely to "feel" what sounds right or try to mimic patterns they've heard.
    *   **Misconception:** English sentence order is more flexible, like some Indian languages where word order can vary for emphasis (though it's still often SVO).
    *   **Result:** This is the most critical hurdle. If they don't know "who does what," they'll struggle.

2.  **Verb 'is' as a Stumbling Block:**
    *   Students might struggle with auxiliary verbs or confuse 'is' with the main action. They know 'reading' is an action. Where does 'is' fit?
    *   **Misconception:** They might try to put 'is' at the end, thinking it's a concluding word, or after 'reading'.

3.  **Confusion between Noun/Pronoun and Action (Subject-Verb):**
    *   They know 'he' is a person and 'reading' is an action. But how do you link them? The 'is' is crucial.
    *   **Misconception:** Directly putting 'he reading a book' (omitting 'is'), or trying 'reading he a book'.

4.  **"Book" vs. "a book":**
    *   While they understand "book," some might place "a" incorrectly if they don't grasp the article's function with a noun. However, "a book" is a common chunk, so this is less likely to be a major error than sentence structure.

5.  **Lack of Punctuation (implied):**
    *   While not explicitly asked to add punctuation, a student who doesn't understand the sentence structure might also forget that a sentence *starts* with a capital and *ends* with a full stop. If asked to *write* the sentence, this would be an error. For "rearrange," the primary focus is word order.

**Would students attempt or not attempt?**

*   **Attempt:** Most students will attempt this. Rearrangement questions often feel less intimidating than fill-in-the-blanks or essay questions because all the words are provided. They will try to put words together based on sound or any memorized patterns.
*   **Fail:** Many will attempt but fail to get the exact correct order.

**Most Common Wrong Answers (and why):**

1.  **"He reading a book." (Omission of 'is')**:
    *   **Why:** Direct translation of subject-action idea, omitting the auxiliary verb. Common error for basic present continuous tense. This feels very natural to a beginner speaker.

2.  **"Reading he is a book." / "Reading a book he is."**:
    *   **Why:** Starting with the action verb, possibly influenced by an attempt to make the sentence sound "active" or focusing on the action first. Some Indian languages might place the verb at the end or allow for more flexible positioning that could lead to this.

3.  **"A book he is reading."**:
    *   **Why:** Emphasizing the object first. This *can* be grammatically correct in certain contexts (topicalization), but it's not the primary SVO structure being taught or expected here, and is often less natural for beginners. They might pick up "a book" as a unit.

4.  **"Is he reading a book?" (Question formation):**
    *   **Why:** Students might recognize the 'is' at the beginning of a question, even if it's not a question sentence. Less likely, but possible for confusion with different sentence types.

5.  **Completely garbled: "Book a is reading he." / "He a reading is book." etc.**
    *   **Why:** Random arrangement due to complete lack of understanding of structure or inability to distinguish S, V, O.

**Estimation of Pass Rate:**

Considering all the factors:

*   **Simplicity of the sentence:** "He is reading a book" is a very basic
