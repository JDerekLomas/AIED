Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Errors:**

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science:**

*   **Rote Memorization of Dates/Facts Without Understanding:** Students might know "Battle of Plassey" and "1757" and "British power," but struggle to connect the "how" (causation). They might list isolated facts instead of explaining the contribution.
*   **Lack of Causal Thinking:** The question asks "how did it contribute." This requires understanding cause and effect. Many students, especially at this level, may struggle to articulate the *process* by which an event led to a broader outcome. They might see Plassey as an isolated event rather than a stepping stone.
*   **Focus on Immediate, Visible Outcomes vs. Broader Implications:** They might focus on the battle itself (who fought whom, who won) but not grasp the political ramifications for the *expansion of power*. For example, they might say "British won," but not explain how winning led to *political dominance/control over Bengal*.
*   **Understanding "Power" (Satta):** While "satta" is a common term, understanding its nuance in a historical context (political, economic, military) might be limited. They might equate power only with military victory, not political manipulation or administrative control.
*   **Confusing Economic Exploitation with Political Control:** While economic exploitation followed, the rubric focuses on the *establishment of political dominance/control*. Students might drift into discussions of trade or revenue without explicitly linking it to political authority.
*   **Generalizing British Influence Too Broadly:** They might say "British became powerful in India" without specifically mentioning the crucial step of control over Bengal. The rubric specifically emphasizes Bengal.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Contribute to" (yogdaan dena/saath dena):** This phrase requires understanding causality. While a direct translation exists, articulating a causal chain can be challenging in both English and vernacular.
*   **"Expansion" (vistar):** This word should be understood, but linking the specific battle to a broader *expansion* of power requires conceptual understanding.
*   **"Power" (shakti/satta):** As mentioned above, the nuanced meaning in a historical context.
*   **Complexity of Sentence Structure:** "How did X contribute to Y?" is a fairly straightforward question, but for a student with limited English, grasping the full implications and forming a coherent answer in English can be daunting.
*   **Technical Vocabulary:** "Dominance," "puppet nawab" might be difficult. While "puppet" has a direct Hindi equivalent ("kathputli"), its historical application might not be immediately understood without specific teaching.
*   **"Government Schools," "Limited English":** This is a critical factor. Many might understand the concept in Hindi/vernacular but struggle to express it accurately in English. They might provide fragmented answers due to vocabulary limitations.

**3. Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**

*   **Most will attempt:** History questions of this type usually invite an attempt, even if it's a weak one. Simply identifying the battle or winner is an attempt. Not attempting at all usually happens with questions they absolutely cannot decipher or have no recall for. Plassey is a very central event.
*   **Failure will be common:** Many attempts will be superficial or tangential due to the reasons above.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer:**

*   **"The British won the Battle of Plassey."** (Fails to explain "how it contributed to expansion of power").
*   **"British got strong in India after Plassey."** (Too vague, lacks specificity about Bengal or political control).
*   **"The Battle of Plassey helped British to trade more."** (Focuses on economic consequence without addressing political dominance).
*   **"Mir Jafar became the Nawab."** (A factual statement, but again, doesn't explain the "contribution to expansion of power" fully without linking him to British control).
*   **Mixture of facts without proper linkage:** e.g., "British won Plassey. It was in 1757. British made India a colony." (Jumping to a much later consequence without explaining the intermediate steps).

**Conclusion for Pass Rate Estimation:**

The rubric is quite specific: "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)." This requires:
1.  Knowing the *outcome* of Plassey (British victory).
2.  Linking it specifically to *Bengal*.
3.  Understanding *political dominance/control*.
4.  Optionally, providing an example like Mir Jafar.

The average pass rate is 29%. This question requires more than just recalling a date
