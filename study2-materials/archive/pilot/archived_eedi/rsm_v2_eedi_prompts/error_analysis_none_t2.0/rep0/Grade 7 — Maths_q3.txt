Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

**1. Misconceptions about Mathematics:**

*   **Forgetting or never knowing the formula:** This is probably the most significant factor. If they don't know the formula `Area = 1/2 × base × height`, they can't solve it. They might recall other area formulas (e.g., rectangle `length × width`) and try to apply them incorrectly.
*   **Forgetting the `1/2`:** Many students remember "base times height" but omit the division by two, confusing it with the area of a parallelogram or rectangle. This is a very common error.
*   **Misinterpreting "base" and "height":** While less likely for simple numbers like 8 and 6, some might get confused if extra, irrelevant side lengths were provided. In this case, it's straightforward.
*   **Difficulty with multiplication:** Basic multiplication (8x6) might be fine, but the subsequent division by 2 might trip some up, especially if they are less confident with arithmetic. However, 48/2 = 24 is relatively straightforward.
*   **Confusing area with perimeter:** Unlikely in this specific question, as the term "area" is used directly.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Area":** While it's a fundamental term in math, for students with limited English, the word "area" itself might be a barrier if their local language doesn't have a direct cognate or if they haven't learned the specific English math vocabulary thoroughly. However, in Class 7, "area" of basic shapes should be quite well-established even in government schools through translated textbooks or common teaching.
*   **"Base" and "height":** Similar to "area," these are common math terms. They might be understood in the context of the diagram of a triangle rather than just the words. Since no diagram is provided, they must rely on their vocabulary.
*   **"Find":** Unlikely to be a major issue, it's a standard instruction.
*   **Overall sentence comprehension:** For very weak English learners, understanding the full sentence could be challenging, leading them to extract just the numbers and guess at an operation.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **Most students would attempt:** The question is short, uses simple numbers, and asks for a fundamental geometric property. Even if they don't know the *correct* formula, many would attempt *something* with the given numbers.
*   **No attempt:** This might happen if they:
    *   Completely don't understand "area" or "triangle."
    *   Feel overwhelmed and shut down.
    *   Don't know *any* formula for area and refuse to guess.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer Look-alikes:**

Given the high probability of remembering "base times height" but forgetting "1/2":

*   **48** (8 × 6) - This is almost certainly the single most common wrong answer.
*   **14** (8 + 6) - Confusing area with perimeter, or simply adding the numbers if unsure. Less likely for "area" question.
*   **Others:** Random numbers, other basic arithmetic operations (8-6=2, 8/6, etc.) but these are less likely for a question specifically asking for "area." Some might give a really large number if they think of surface area of a 3D object.

**Factors for Class 7 in Indian Government Schools (Economically Weaker, Limited English, 29% Pass Rate on Average):**

*   **Limited Exposure:** Many might not have consistent or high-quality teaching, leading to gaps in fundamental knowledge like geometric formulas.
*   **Rote Learning:** Emphasis on rote memorization might mean they know the formula but don't understand it, or can't recall it under pressure. If they haven't explicitly memorized this specific formula, they're stuck.
*   **English as a Barrier:** Even if they know the *concept* in their native language, translating it to the English terms "base," "height," "area" can be an issue.
*   **Pass Rate of 29%:** This is crucial context. If the *average* pass rate is 29%, it implies that *most* students are struggling across subjects. A question requiring formula recall and basic arithmetic for a Class 7 level will be challenging for this cohort.
