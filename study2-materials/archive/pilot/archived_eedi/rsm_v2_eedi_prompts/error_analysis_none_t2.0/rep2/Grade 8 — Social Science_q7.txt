Let's break down the potential student responses and estimate the pass rate.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **General Lack of Specific Knowledge:**
    *   Many students, especially from the described background, might have a very superficial understanding of historical events. They might know "Plassey" and "British" but lack the precise causal link.
    *   Social science education in government schools can often be rote memorization. If they haven't explicitly memorized "Plassey led to political dominance over Bengal," they might struggle to formulate it.
    *   They might recall isolated facts (e.g., "Clive won") but not connect them to the larger impact on British power expansion.

2.  **Misconceptions about Social Science/History:**
    *   **Overemphasis on Military Victory:** Many might focus purely on "the British won the battle" without linking it to the political consequences. They see a battle as an isolated event of "winning" rather than a catalyst for long-term power shifts.
    *   **Focus on Economic Exploitation (but wrong context):** They might vaguely associate British rule with economic exploitation (taxes, trade), but misattribute *how* Plassey facilitated it. For example, "British started taking all our money" but not through the political control gained via Plassey.
    *   **Vague "British became powerful":** This is too general and doesn't explain *how* Plassey contributed. They understand the overall narrative of British ascendance but miss the specific mechanism.
    *   **Confusion with other battles/events:** Indian history is vast. Students might confuse Plassey with Buxar, or the establishment of the East India Company.

3.  **Language Misunderstandings (English as a Second Language):**
    *   **"Contribute to the expansion of British power":**
        *   "Contribute": Could be understood simply as "helped" without requiring the *mechanism*.
        *   "Expansion": Could be interpreted vaguely as just "getting bigger" or "more powerful," again without the how.
        *   "Power": Could be understood as military strength rather than political authority.
    *   Students might struggle to articulate a complex cause-and-effect relationship in English, even if they grasp the concept in their mother tongue. The specific vocabulary required (e.g., "political dominance," "puppet ruler") might be beyond them.

4.  **Attempt Rate and Nature of Failure:**
    *   **High Attempt Rate:** Most students would likely *attempt* the question, as it's a straightforward recall question from history. Not attempting at all would be less common unless they had absolutely no idea.
    *   **Attempts but fail:** This is the most likely scenario. They will write *something*, but it won't hit the rubric point.

5.  **Most Common Wrong Answers:**

    *   **"The British won the Battle of Plassey."** (Fails to link to expansion of power).
    *   **"The British became powerful after Plassey."** (Too vague, doesn't explain *how* Plassey contributed).
    *   **"The British started ruling India."** (Again, too broad, and Plassey didn't establish full rule, but *dominance in Bengal*).
    *   **"They collected taxes from Bengal."** (Connects to exploitation but misses the *political mechanism* by which Plassey enabled it).
    *   **"The Nawab was defeated."** (True, but doesn't connect to *British power expansion* effectively).
    *   **Answers confusing Plassey with economic motives:** "The British wanted spices/wealth/resources from Bengal." (True underlying motive, but not the *direct contribution* of the battle itself).
    *   **Incomplete/Partially correct answers:** "The British started controlling Bengal." (Better, but might still miss the "political dominance" nuance and the puppet ruler aspect).

**Analysis of Average Pass Rate (29%):**

Given an average pass rate of 29% for general knowledge in these subjects, it implies that very specific, well-articulated answers are rare. The current question demands a very precise understanding of a specific historical mechanism.

*   To get 1 mark, the student needs to go beyond "British won" or "British became powerful." They need to articulate the *political consequence* for Bengal.
*   The rubric is specific: "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)." This requires a deeper level of understanding and expression than many students possess.

**Refined Estimation:**
