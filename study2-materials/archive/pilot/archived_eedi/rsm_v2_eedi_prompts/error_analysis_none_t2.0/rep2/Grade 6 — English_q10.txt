Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Class 6 students in Indian government schools, often from economically weaker sections, would likely face several hurdles with this question.

*   **Misconceptions about English / Grammatical Understanding:**
    *   **Lack of Explicit Teaching of "Some/Any" Rules:** It's highly probable that the nuances of "some" for positive statements and "any" for questions/negatives haven't been thoroughly and explicitly taught. If they were, it might have been rote memorization without deep understanding or practice.
    *   **"Any" Associated with General Existence:** Some students might perceive "any" as a word simply meaning "existence of something" and use it interchangeably with "some" if they don't grasp the positive/negative/question distinction.
    *   **Focus on Word-for-Word Translation:** If they try to translate from a local language, the distinction might be lost, as the single local word might cover both "some" and "any" contexts. For instance, in Hindi, "कुछ" (kuch) can often serve for both depending on context. They might simply choose the word they *know* rather than the *correct* one.
    *   **Overgeneralization of "Any" for Uncertainty:** "Any" is often heard in questions (e.g., "Do you have any brothers?"). Without understanding *why* it's used there, they might associate it with *any* situation where they are trying to refer to an indefinite quantity.

*   **Language Misunderstandings / Vocabulary:**
    *   **Understanding "Choose the correct word":** While generally understood, some might interpret it as "choose a word you know," not necessarily the *grammatically* correct one.
    *   **"Apples" and "basket":** These words are likely within their vocabulary.
    *   **"There are":** Basic phrase, usually understood as "there exist."

*   **Attempt or Not Attempt?**
    *   **Attempt:** Most students would likely attempt this. It's a fill-in-the-blank style question with only two clear options. They would feel pressured to choose one, even if guessing. Leaving it blank would be rare for a simple choice question.
    *   **Guessing:** A significant number would be guessing due to a lack of clear understanding. This leads to a 50/50 chance if guessing randomly, but common misconceptions might skew the "wrong" guesses.

*   **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   **"any"**: This would be the overwhelming majority of incorrect answers.
        *   Why? Because "any" isn't explicitly *wrong* in all contexts, making it seem plausible. It often gets paired with "some" in teaching, and if the distinction isn't clear, either could be chosen. The common misconception would be that "any" just means "some amount," without differentiating positive statements. They might have heard sentences like "Are there any apples?" and then mistakenly apply "any" to the positive statement.

**Expected Process for a Student Getting it Wrong:**

1.  Read the sentence: "There are (some/any) apples in the basket."
2.  Understand the general meaning: "There exist X amount of apples in the basket."
3.  Recall having heard both "some" and "any" in sentences involving quantities.
4.  **No clear rule is readily accessible or firmly understood for this specific positive sentence context.**
5.  *Guessing* occurs, often leaning towards "any" due to general familiarity or a misapplied association (e.g., heard "any" often enough, or think it sounds "fine"). They might not detect anything inherently "wrong" with "any" in that slot if they lack the specific grammatical rule.

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

Considering the factors:

*   **Basic English Level (Avg Pass Rate 29% overall):** This suggests a low baseline for complex grammatical rules.
*   **Lack of Explicit "Some/Any" Instruction:** Many won't have received specific, reinforced teaching.
*   **Guessing Factor:** A 50/50 chance for those completely unaware.
*   **Common Misconception:** A bias towards choosing "any" for the wrong reason will drag down the pass rate even further than pure random guessing.
*   **Accessibility of the words "some" and "any":** They are common words, so students won't shy away from picking one.

Let's imagine groups:
1.  **Understand and Apply Rule Correctly:** This group will be small.
2.  **Pure Guessing (Truly 50/50):** Some students might randomly
