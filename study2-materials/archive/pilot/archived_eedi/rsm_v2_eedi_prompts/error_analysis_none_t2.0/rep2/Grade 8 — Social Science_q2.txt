Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science/History:**

*   **Lack of Specific Knowledge:** The most common issue will be simply not having studied or retained the specific details about Harappan urban planning. While Harappan Civilization is a core topic, the specifics of urban planning might not be sufficiently emphasized or memorized by all students.
*   **Generalizing/Vague Answers:** Students might recall "they had cities" or "they were advanced" but struggle to articulate a *key feature* of their *urban planning*. They might talk about their trade, their writing (which isn't planning), or their agriculture (again, not urban planning).
*   **Confusion with Other Civilizations:** Less likely for this specific question given "Harappan," but some students might mix up features with Mesopotamian or Egyptian urban layouts if they have vague ideas.
*   **Difficulty Identifying "Key Feature":** Even if they know a few things, distinguishing *what* constitutes a "key feature of urban planning" might be tricky. They might list something minor or not directly related to planning.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Key feature":** While "key" is a common word, "feature" and "urban planning" together might be a bit abstract for some, especially if they are relying solely on rote memorization in their local language and trying to translate it on the spot. "Planning" could be misunderstood as just "making things" rather than systematic design.
*   **"Describe":** They might struggle to *describe* adequately and just list a word or two without elaboration.
*   **Vocabulary Deficiencies:** Terms like "grid layout," "drainage system," "citadel," "lower town," "baked bricks" might be unfamiliar or understood superficially if their primary language of instruction differs significantly from English. They might know the concept in their mother tongue but struggle to express it precisely in English.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **Attempt but Fail (Most Common):** Most students will attempt this question. It's a direct factual recall question about a major civilization. However, their attempts will likely fall into the categories below:
    *   **Vague/General:** "They had good cities." "They planned well."
    *   **Irrelevant Information:** Discussing their religion, seals, agriculture, or decline.
    *   **Partial but Insufficient:** "They had drains." (without specifying "advanced" or linking to the system). "They used bricks." (without specifying "baked" or linking to planned construction).
    *   **Incorrect Facts:** Attributing features of other civilizations, or just making up details.
*   **Not Attempt (Less Common for this topic):** Students might not attempt if they genuinely have no knowledge whatsoever about Harappan Civilization or if they are completely overwhelmed by the English. However, since it's a major chapter, some attempt is probable.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer:**

*   **"They had good cities." / "They planned their cities."** (Too general, doesn't describe a *feature*).
*   **"They used bricks."** (Missing "baked" and the connection to *planning* or overall quality of construction).
*   **"They had drains."** (Missing "advanced" or the system aspect).
*   **Talking about seals/script/trade/agriculture/religious practices.** (Completely irrelevant to "urban planning").
*   **Writing a single, partially correct word without description:** e.g., "drains" or "bricks."

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**

Considering the factors:

*   **Economically Weaker Sections / Limited English:** This is a huge barrier for precise language and complex concept expression.
*   **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This tells us the overall cohort struggles with content recall and expression across subjects. History is often seen as rote memorization.
*   **Specificity of Question:** It's not just "What was Harappan Civ known for?", but "Describe one *key feature* of its *urban planning*." This requires precision.
*   **Rubric leniency:** "Correctly describes one key feature." A slight vagueness in description *might* still pass if the core concept is there.

Given the language barrier, the difficulty in expressing precise historical details in English, and the general academic struggle indicated by the 29% pass rate, even if students *know* something, articulating it correctly and specifically enough to meet the rubric will be challenging.

I'd expect a good portion to have some vague idea (e.g., drains, bricks, well-planned) but struggle to connect it articulately to "urban planning" or provide
