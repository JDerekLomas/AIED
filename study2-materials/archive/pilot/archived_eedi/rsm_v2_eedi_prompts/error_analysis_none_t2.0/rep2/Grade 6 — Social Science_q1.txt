Let's break down the potential pitfalls for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, primarily from economically weaker sections with limited English, attempting this question.

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science:**

*   **Definition of "Mountain Range":**
    *   They might confuse "mountain range" with a single mountain, a hill, or even a prominent peak they know locally. "Range" (श्रृंखला in Hindi) might not be fully grasped, especially if the English term is new.
    *   They might struggle to distinguish between a *mountain* and a *hill*, especially for ranges like the Aravallis which are heavily eroded and appear as hills in many places.
    *   They might not understand the difference between a natural feature (mountain range) and an administrative boundary or a river.
*   **Scale and Geographic Awareness:**
    *   Their understanding of the map of India and the placement of large geographical features might be limited. They might know the Himalayas exist but struggle to name *another* major one.
    *   Their learning might be very rote, focusing on names without true geographical understanding.
*   **Recall vs. Understanding:** They might have memorized names from a textbook chapter without truly internalizing what they represent. If the exact phrase "mountain ranges" wasn't emphasized, they might recall *names* associated with geography that aren't specifically mountain ranges.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Major":** While a simple word, its implication might be missed. They might name any small local hill or *pahadi* (hill in Hindi) they know, not realizing the question refers to significant geographical features of the country.
*   **"Located in India":** This should be straightforward, but combined with other language issues, it could lead to naming something famous but outside India (e.g., Mount Everest if they only remember it from general knowledge, not specifically *within* India's political boundaries, although parts of the Greater Himalayas are in India).
*   **"Mountain Ranges":** As discussed, "range" is the tricky part. *Pahar* (mountain) is known, but *parvat shrunkhala* (mountain range) might not be.

**3. Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**

*   **Attempt:** Most students will likely attempt it. It asks for names, which they might feel confident recalling from memory, even if imperfectly. There's no complex reasoning required.
*   **Failed Attempt:** The majority of errors will likely stem from failed attempts due to the reasons above. They'll write something, just not the correct thing.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer Look-alikes:**

Given the common mistakes, here are some likely wrong answers:

*   **Rivers:** Ganges, Yamuna, Brahmaputra (very common misconception: confusing major geographical features).
*   **States/Cities:** Delhi, Mumbai, Uttar Pradesh (mistaking categories).
*   **Famous Mountains/Peaks (without understanding "range"):** Mount Everest (even if they know it's not fully in India, it's a very prominent mountain name), Nanda Devi (single peak).
*   **Hills (non-major or local):** Some smaller, regional hills that aren't considered "major mountain ranges" in a national context.
*   **Generic terms:** "Big mountain," "Tall mountain."
*   **Incorrect Spells:** Badly spelled versions of correct names or wrong names.
*   **Only one name given:** If they struggle to recall a second, or if the question is only partially understood.

**Why the "Major Mountain Range" requirement for a low-pass rate?**

The question *only* requires one correct mountain range for 0.5 marks. This significantly lowers the bar for "pass." The difficulty isn't naming *two* major ranges correctly for full marks, but just one.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%):**

If the overall pass rate is 29%, it means most students struggle with various questions across the paper. For *this specific question*, it's arguably one of the "easier" recall questions from a well-taught geography chapter.

*   The **Himalayas** are iconic and almost universally taught/known in India. Even with limited English, "Himalayas" is a recognizable term in Hindi.
*   **Aravallis, Vindhya, Satpura, Western/Eastern Ghats** are also staple textbook examples.

The key for 0.5 marks is identifying *just one*.

**Re-evaluation of Expected Performance for "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India. (Rubric: Names one correct mountain range)"**

Given:

1.  **Himalayas:** High probability of being known and written correctly,
