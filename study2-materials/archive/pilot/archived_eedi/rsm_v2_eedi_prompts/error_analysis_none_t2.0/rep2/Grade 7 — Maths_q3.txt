Let's break down the potential errors for Class 7 Indian government school students.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Formula Confusion (Mathematics - Most Common):**
    *   **Area of Rectangle/Square:** The most significant source of error will be confusing the area of a triangle with that of a rectangle/square. Many students will simply multiply `base × height` and give `48` cm² as the answer. This is a very common jump from simpler area concepts. They might forget or never fully internalize the `1/2` factor.
    *   **Perimeter Confusion:** A smaller subset might confuse area with perimeter, adding the numbers (`8 + 6 = 14`), although this is less likely to produce a seemingly "valid" answer for an area question when only two dimensions are given.
    *   **Random Operations:** Some might simply add `8 + 6` or `8 - 6` if they completely forget formulas and resort to basic operations.

2.  **Lack of Conceptual Understanding (Mathematics):**
    *   Some students might know *a* formula but not understand *why* the `1/2` is there (i.e., a triangle is half a parallelogram/rectangle). Without this underlying understanding, the formula is easily forgotten or misapplied.

3.  **Language Misunderstandings (Limited Impact for this question):**
    *   **"Find the area":** This phrase is quite standard in math problems and should be understood.
    *   **"Base" and "Height":** These terms are also fairly standard in geometry. If a student has reached Class 7 and encountered geometry, they likely know these terms in context, or can infer them from the numerical values provided in a basic triangle problem.
    *   **"Triangle":** Obviously crucial, and usually understood.
    *   **"cm":** The unit will be understood, but whether they correctly include `cm²` in their answer is another matter (not typically penalized for *finding* the area, but for full marks, units are important).

4.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **Attempt and Fail:** The vast majority of students who attempt this will attempt but fail by using the wrong formula (e.g., `base × height`).
    *   **No Attempt:** A significant portion of students will not attempt it at all if they are completely unfamiliar with area formulas or lack confidence in mathematics. This would particularly be true for those with lower attendance or prior learning gaps.

**Most Common Wrong Answer Look-alike:**

The overwhelmingly most common wrong answer will be **48 cm²**. This directly results from `base × height`.

**Applying to the Pass Rate (Average 29% for all questions):**

Given an average pass rate of 29% across *all* questions, this specific question is moderately easy *if* the student remembers the specific formula for a triangle. However, the `1/2` factor is a frequent pitfall.

*   Students who *know* the formula for the area of a triangle will almost certainly get this right, as the numbers are simple (8 x 6 = 48, half of 48 is 24).
*   Students who confuse it with a rectangle's area will get 48 cm², failing the rubric.
*   Students who do not attempt or attempt with random operations will also fail.

If 29% is the *average*, this question, being a fairly direct application of a specific formula, might have a slightly *higher* pass rate than a complex problem involving multiple steps or concepts, but the *common error* of forgetting `1/2` is a significant barrier.

Considering the simplicity of the numbers, and the commonality of `base x height` for rectangles being taught before `1/2 x base x height` for triangles:

*   Let's assume a portion of students remember the specific triangle formula.
*   A larger portion will apply `base × height`.
*   Some will not attempt.

I'd estimate this question to be slightly *above* the average pass rate because it's a very standard, direct formula application, provided the correct formula is recalled. However, the prevalence of the `48` cm² error cannot be understated.

Let's break down a hypothetical distribution for the **attempting** students:
*   Correct formula used (1/2 b h): ~35-40% of those attempting correctly.
*   Incorrect formula (b h): ~40-50% of those attempting incorrectly.
*   Other random errors/blank: ~10-20%

If a significant chunk (e.g., 20-30%) don't even attempt, that brings the
