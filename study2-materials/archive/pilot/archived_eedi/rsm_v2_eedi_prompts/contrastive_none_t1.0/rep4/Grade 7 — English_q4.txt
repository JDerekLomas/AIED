Let's break down the question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their background.

**Contrastive Analysis of Difficulty:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Passage Comprehension:** The most crucial prior knowledge is the ability to understand the preceding passage about the king's three questions. The question directly refers to "the king's questions," implying the student has read and understood the context. This isn't general knowledge, but reading comprehension of a specific text.
    *   **Concept of "Importance in Real Life":** Students should be able to connect abstract questions (like "right time," "right people," "right thing") to practical relevance. This requires a degree of maturity and critical thinking, not just factual recall.
    *   **Reasoning/Justification:** The demand to "Give one reason" requires the student to articulate a cause-and-effect relationship or a justification, moving beyond a simple "yes/no."

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **"Do you think..."**: This phrasing is common and generally understood for opinion.
    *   **"king's questions"**: If they understood the passage, this phrase should be clear.
    *   **"important"**: A very common and high-frequency word. Likely understood.
    *   **"in real life"**: This phrase might be slightly more abstract but is also common enough in elementary English. It translates well to "daily life" or "practical life."
    *   **"Give one reason"**: Clear and direct.
    *   **Overall:** The vocabulary is quite accessible. The main language challenge isn't individual words, but the *conceptual* understanding required to link the king's philosophical questions to practical importance and then articulate a reason in English. Constructing a grammatically correct and coherent sentence for the reason might be a hurdle for some.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   It's primarily **reasoning** and **application**.
        *   **Recall** is minimal (recalling the *content* of the king's questions from the passage).
        *   **Application** comes in when they apply the *concept* of the king's questions to the *context* of "real life."
        *   **Reasoning** is central, as they must formulate a justification for *why* these questions are important. This is higher-order thinking than simple recall.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Slightly harder than direct recall:** Typical textbook exercises often ask for direct answers from the text ("What were the king's three questions?"). This question goes a step further by asking for an *opinion* and a *justification*.
    *   **Less difficult than complex inference/analysis:** It's not asking for deep literary analysis or understanding of subtle themes. The "importance" of knowing the right time/people/actions is fairly intuitive.
    *   **Comparison to "29% average pass rate":** Given the average pass rate, items requiring *reasoning* and *articulation* in English tend to be more challenging. A 29% average suggests many students struggle with even basic comprehension and direct answers. This question, requiring an additional step of personal opinion and justification, would likely be harder for a significant portion.

**Specific Challenges for this Group:**

1.  **Transition from Comprehension to Opinion/Reasoning:** Many students might be trained to extract answers directly from the text. Shifting to an opinion-based question with a "reason" can be a new challenge.
2.  **Formulating a Coherent Reason in English:** Even if they have a good idea in Hindi, articulating a grammatically correct and understandable reason in English can be difficult. Common errors might include incorrect verb tense, subject-verb agreement issues, or poor sentence structure.
    *   *Example of a potentially difficult-to-articulate reason:* "It helps us to make good decisions in our life." (This is a good reason, but might be hard for some to phrase.)
    *   *Simpler, but potentially incomplete answers:* "Yes." "Yes, they are." (These wouldn't get full credit for lack of a reason.)
3.  **Understanding "importance in real life":** While the words are common, connecting the philosophical questions (right time, right people, right thing) to tangible "real life" outcomes might require a cognitive leap for some. However, the questions themselves are quite practical in nature, which helps.

**Rubric Consideration:** "Any valid reason." This broadness is very helpful. It doesn't require a sophisticated philosophical answer, just a sensible one. E.g., "Yes, because it
