Let's break down the question's difficulty for Class 6 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Grammar:** Basic understanding of count nouns ("apples") and the use of determiners (quantifiers like "some/any"). This involves knowing that "some" is generally used in affirmative statements, and "any" is typically used in negative statements and questions. This is a fairly standard concept introduced around Class 4-6 in English grammar curricula, but depth of understanding and practice can vary significantly.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Apples," "basket" are very common, basic words. "Choose," "correct," "word" are also foundational instructions.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure: "There are X apples in the basket." This is very basic.

*   **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** The vocabulary itself ("apples," "basket," "choose," "correct," "word") is low-level and likely familiar even to students with limited English.
    *   **Grammar Concept:** This is where the challenge lies. While "some" and "any" are common words, understanding the *rule* for their usage (affirmative vs. negative/interrogative) is a grammatical concept that requires specific instruction and practice.
        *   Students might intuitively use "some" because it sounds "right" in an affirmative context, or they might guess.
        *   The instruction "Choose the correct word" is straightforward.
    *   **Distractors:** The choice between "some" and "any" is a direct test of this specific grammatical rule. If a student doesn't know the rule, it's a 50/50 guess unless they have developed an intuitive feel for it through exposure.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application** of a grammatical rule. Students need to recall the rule for "some" vs. "any" and apply it to an affirmative sentence. It's not just rote recall of a definition, but applying a learned principle. There's minimal "reasoning" beyond applying the rule.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very **typical, foundational grammar exercise** for Class 6. It's the kind of question that appears frequently in "fill in the blanks" or "choose the correct word" sections in English grammar textbooks.
    *   It is not overly complex in sentence structure or vocabulary. The core difficulty is solely the specific grammar point.
    *   Compared to a problem asking for complex sentence construction or nuanced meaning, this is relatively straightforward *if* the rule has been taught and practiced.
    *   However, given the context of "economically weaker sections," "Hindi-medium schools," and "limited English proficiency," the depth of grammar instruction and the amount of practice with such specific rules might be significantly less than in private or more resourced schools. The average pass rate of 29% suggests that even typical textbook exercises can be quite challenging.

**Synthesizing the Difficulty:**

The question is conceptually simple for a native speaker or a student with good English exposure. For a Class 6 student in a Hindi-medium government school, the vocabulary is easy, but the grammatical rule for "some" vs. "any" can be a sticking point.

*   Many might get it right by intuition or by guessing (50% chance).
*   Those who have specifically learned and practiced this rule will get it right.
*   Those who haven't been taught or haven't grasped the rule will struggle.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% across items, and acknowledging that this is a very common grammar point, it should perform *slightly better* than the average due to its simplicity in structure and vocabulary, and the 50/50 guess factor. However, it won't be exceptionally high because the underlying grammatical rule is often challenging for learners.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **40%**
