Contrastive Analysis:

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Core Concept:** Understanding of "voice" (active vs. passive), specifically the grammatical structures involved in each. This requires recognizing the subject, verb, and object in a sentence.
*   **Verb Forms:** Knowledge of irregular past participles (specifically "blown" as the past participle of "blow").
*   **Auxiliary Verbs:** Understanding the use of "to be" verbs (was/were) in the passive construction.
*   **Prepositions:** Use of "by" to introduce the agent in the passive voice.
*   **Basic Sentence Structure:** Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) recognition.

**Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**

*   **Vocabulary:**
    *   "Change" - common, likely known.
    *   "following sentence" - common, likely known.
    *   "Active Voice," "Passive Voice" - These are technical grammatical terms. While "active" and "passive" might be known in other contexts, their specific grammatical meaning needs to be explicitly taught and understood. This is a significant hurdle.
    *   "wind," "blew," "leaves," "away" - These are relatively common words for Class 7, likely within their receptive vocabulary, though "blew" (past tense of blow) might be slightly less common than "blow."
*   **Grammar:** The instruction itself ("Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice") is grammatically complex. The student needs to parse this instruction to understand the task.
*   **Conceptual Understanding:** The core difficulty lies in understanding "active voice" and "passive voice" in English. Even if they have a similar concept in Hindi grammar, mapping it precisely to English grammatical rules is challenging.

**Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

*   **Application:** This is a clear application task. Students need to apply the rules of active-passive voice transformation to a given sentence. It's not pure recall (like defining active voice) nor abstract reasoning, but rather the practical application of grammatical rules.

**How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Difficulty Level:** This specific question is of *medium-high difficulty* for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, especially those with limited English proficiency and who learn in Hindi medium.
*   **Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Easier:** Identifying active/passive voice in a given set of sentences. Filling in the blanks with the correct "to be" verb in a passive sentence. Simple transformations with very common regular verbs (e.g., "The boy hit the ball" -> "The ball was hit by the boy").
    *   **Similar:** Other transformation exercises of this type, especially those using irregular verbs.
    *   **Harder:** Transformations involving more complex tenses, modal verbs, or sentences with indirect objects.
*   **Specific Challenges for this question:**
    1.  **Technical Terminology:** "Active Voice," "Passive Voice" are abstract grammatical terms. If these haven't been taught extensively in English, or if the students haven't grasped their application, they will struggle. They may have learned "Karmavachya" and "Kartruvachya" in Hindi, but the direct transfer isn't always smooth without explicit bridging.
    2.  **Irregular Verb:** "Blew" (past tense of "blow") requires knowledge of its past participle "blown." Irregular verbs are a common point of error for ESL learners.
    3.  **Syntactic Transformation:** Rearranging the sentence components (object becomes subject, original subject becomes agent with "by," verb changes form) is a multi-step process.

Given the average pass rate of 29% across items and the specific challenges of this question (technical English grammatical terms, irregular verb, and the application of a multi-step syntactic transformation), this question is likely to be harder than the average item. Many students might know some basic English words but lack the specific grammatical meta-language and transformation rules.
