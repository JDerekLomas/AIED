Let's break down the question for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, keeping their context in mind.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students should have been taught about the Battle of Plassey (1757) in their history curriculum. This is a foundational event in Indian history, usually covered extensively in Class 8. They should know it involved the British East India Company and the Nawab of Bengal (Siraj-ud-Daulah).
    *   **Less Assumed/Potential Gap:** While they might know *of* the battle, understanding its *contribution* to the *expansion of British power* requires a grasp of cause and effect, and the concept of political dominance, rather than just knowing who fought and who won. The idea of a "puppet nawab" or indirect control might be slightly more nuanced than simple recall.
    *   **Contextual Relevance:** This topic is highly relevant to Indian history and national identity, so it usually receives significant attention in textbooks.

*   **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **"How did... contribute to..."**: This phrase requires understanding causality and impact. While "how" is common, "contribute to" might be slightly more complex than simpler verbs like "caused" or "led to."
    *   **"Expansion of British power"**: "Expansion" and "power" are generally common vocabulary, but the whole phrase implies an abstract concept of growing influence and control, not just physical territory.
    *   **"Battle of Plassey"**: This is a proper noun they would have learned.
    *   **"Rubric terms"**: "Establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal" and "puppet nawab" are key concepts they would need to either recall or articulate in some form. "Political dominance" is a somewhat academic term.
    *   **Overall:** The vocabulary is not overly complex, but the abstract nature of "contribute to the expansion of power" could pose a slight challenge for those struggling with English comprehension beyond literal translation. However, the core event is so central that they might recognize the keywords and recall the associated facts.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Primarily Recall with mild Reasoning/Application:** Students are primarily expected to recall the *consequences* of the Battle of Plassey. While simply stating "British won" isn't enough, explaining *how* that victory led to expansion requires connecting the dots – e.g., "they controlled Bengal," or "they put their own ruler." This isn't deep application or complex reasoning, but it's more than just a name or a date. It's recalling a cause-and-effect relationship that would typically be taught explicitly.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Moderate Difficulty:**
        *   **Easier than:** A question requiring critical analysis of long-term impacts or comparing it to other battles.
        *   **Harder than:** A direct recall question like "When was the Battle of Plassey fought?" or "Who fought in the Battle of Plassey?"
        *   **Comparable to:** A short-answer question asking for "key outcomes" or "significance" of the battle. Most Class 8 history textbooks would have similar questions directly following the chapter on Plassey. The rubric's requirement for "political dominance/control over Bengal" or "puppet nawab" directly aligns with the core significance typically highlighted.

**Overall Assessment:**

This question targets a central, well-taught event in Class 8 history. The language, while not entirely simplistic, is manageable for students familiar with the topic, especially given the commonality of "how... contribute" type questions in social science. The required answer is a direct consequence that is heavily emphasized in textbooks. The main challenge will be for students who either:
1.  Have not adequately covered or understood the *significance* of Plassey, beyond just knowing it happened.
2.  Struggle significantly with the English phrasing to fully grasp what is being asked (though the key terms "Battle of Plassey," "British power," and "India" should help them cue into the topic).

Given the average pass rate of 29% for general items and the fact that this is a core historical event, I would expect it to perform slightly above average for a Class 8 Social Science question. Students from economically weaker sections often perform better on factual recall and directly taught concepts, which this question largely is.
