Let's break down the question "Describes the poet's writing style" for a Class 7 student in an Indian government school, considering the stated context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Implicit:** The student must have read *something* by a poet or be familiar with the concept of a "poet" and "writing."
    *   **Explicit:** The student needs to understand what "writing style" means. This is a higher-order concept than just understanding the plot or characters. It requires a meta-cognitive understanding of *how* something is written.
    *   **Literary Analysis:** They need to have been exposed, even minimally, to discussing elements of literature beyond just comprehension. This might be a stretch for Class 7 students in these schools, whose curriculum often focuses more on basic comprehension and grammar.

2.  **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   **"Describes":** This is a relatively common verb. While perhaps not "describe the colour of the apple," it's understandable in the context of "tell me about."
    *   **"Poet's":** "Poet" is likely known if they've studied poetry. The possessive 's might be a small hurdle, but usually understood in context.
    *   **"Writing style":** This is the biggest vocabulary and conceptual hurdle.
        *   "Writing" is common.
        *   "Style" in this context is abstract. Many students might primarily associate "style" with fashion or appearance. Understanding it as the *manner* or *way* of writing requires a leap.
        *   The combination "writing style" is a specific literary term. It's not a phrase used in everyday conversation.
    *   **Rubric examples ("simple, descriptive, informal, direct"):** These words themselves vary in difficulty. "Simple" is likely understood. "Descriptive" and "direct" are moderately difficult. "Informal" is likely harder. Students might struggle to retrieve *any* suitable adjective even if they grasp the concept.
    *   **Overall:** The phrase "writing style" makes this significantly harder than a question asking "What did the poet write about?" or "Who is the poet?". It requires understanding an abstract literary concept in English.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application and Reasoning**. It's not recall (unless they've been explicitly taught and memorized a style for a *specific* poet they're asked about, which is unlikely as a general question).
    *   It requires reading a piece of text (which is not provided in this isolated question, implying it's a follow-up to a text they've just read), analyzing *how* it's written, and then applying an appropriate descriptive term. This is a complex cognitive task.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 7 English textbook exercises in these schools often focus on:
        *   Reading comprehension (answering factual questions about a passage).
        *   Vocabulary (matching words, fill-in-the-blanks).
        *   Basic grammar (tenses, parts of speech).
        *   Poetry questions might ask about rhyming words, the central theme, or difficult words.
    *   **Discussing "writing style" is a higher-level analytical task that goes beyond typical comprehension and grammar drills.** It's more akin to what might be introduced in higher grades or in schools with a stronger emphasis on literary analysis. Many Class 7 textbooks might *not* explicitly teach students to identify and describe "writing style." They might be taught to identify "themes" or "mood," but "style" is a more nuanced term.

**Impact of Context (Economically Weaker Sections, Hindi-medium, Limited English):**

*   The abstract nature of "writing style" will be a major barrier. Even if they understand "writing" and "style" individually, the compound meaning is complex.
*   Lack of exposure to such analytical questions in their curriculum will mean they haven't developed the schema or vocabulary for this task.
*   The pressure of an exam and limited English will make it harder to process the question and retrieve appropriate English adjectives for the style.
*   The average pass rate of 29% across *all* items suggests that even basic items are challenging. This question is far from basic.

**Conclusion on Difficulty:**

This is a **moderately to highly difficult** question for this specific student population. The main difficulty stems from:
1.  The abstract concept of "writing style."
2.  The demand for analytical reasoning over simple recall or comprehension.
3.  The specific English vocabulary "writing
