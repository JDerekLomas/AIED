Let's break down the question and its demands on Class 8 students in Indian government schools.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Core:** Students are expected to know about the Battle of Plassey (1757) itself, who fought in it (British East India Company vs. Nawab of Bengal), and that the British won. This is a very standard topic in Indian history textbooks for Class 7/8, typically covered under "Advent of Europeans" or "British Expansion."
    *   **Implicit:** An understanding of what "expansion of British power" means beyond just military victory – i.e., political and economic control. The concept of "contribution" requires understanding cause-and-effect.
    *   **Less Common but Helpful:** Knowledge about Mir Jafar and the puppet nawab concept, though the rubric suggests this as an example of "political dominance/control."

*   **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   **Keywords:** "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "contribute," "expansion," "British power," "India."
    *   **Difficulty:** "Contribute" might be slightly more complex than simpler verbs like "What was the result of..." or "How did it help..." but it's a common enough term in Social Science questions. "Expansion of power" is a standard phrase.
    *   **Overall:** The sentence structure is straightforward (How did X contribute to Y?). It doesn't use highly academic or abstract vocabulary beyond the core historical terms. For students with *limited* English, understanding "contribute" and linking it to "expansion" is the main linguistic hurdle, but it's not insurmountable.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   This is primarily **recall and basic reasoning/understanding of cause-and-effect.** Students are recalling a key event and its immediate political consequence.
    *   It's not simple factual recall (e.g., "When was the Battle of Plassey?"). It requires connecting the event (victory) to its *impact* (political dominance/control). This is a step beyond mere memorization.
    *   It's not high-level application or complex reasoning, which would involve comparing Plassey's impact with other battles or analyzing long-term socio-economic consequences.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical:** Textbooks often have "short answer" or "explain" questions like this. For example, "Explain the significance of the Battle of Plassey." or "How did the British gain control over Bengal after Plassey?"
    *   **Similarity:** This question is very much in line with a standard short-answer question designed to check understanding of a major historical turning point. It's not a trick question, nor does it require obscure knowledge.
    *   **Slightly harder than pure recall:** It's slightly more demanding than questions asking for dates or names, as it requires articulating the *impact*. However, the "impact of Plassey" (control over Bengal) is usually highlighted as a core takeaway in textbooks.

**Overall Assessment:**

The question is about a crucial, prominently taught event in Indian history. The concept of British "political dominance" over Bengal after Plassey (often exemplified by the puppet nawab) is a core learning outcome. The language, while English, is relatively clear and uses standard Social Science terminology. It moves beyond simple recall to basic causal understanding.

Given the average pass rate across items is 29%, this question is likely *easier* than the average item. The content is foundational, and the expected answer (British political control/dominance over Bengal) is a direct consequence emphasized in teaching. Students might struggle with articulating it perfectly in English, but the core idea should be present for many who have studied the topic.

The difficulty lies more in the *articulation* of the answer in English rather than the *comprehension* of the historical event itself for those who have been taught it. Many might understand the concept but struggle to phrase it as "establishment of political dominance." However, phrases like "British got control of Bengal" or "British started ruling Bengal" would likely be accepted by the rubric.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40-45%**

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

*   **Content Familiarity:** High. This is a cornerstone event in Class 8 history.
*   **Cognitive Demand:** Moderate. Not just recall, but understanding impact.
*   **Linguistic Demand:** Moderate. "Contribute" and "expansion of power" require a reasonable grasp of English, but the core historical concept should be understandable.
*   **Rubric Flexibility:** The rubric is quite accepting ("establishment of British political dominance/control over
