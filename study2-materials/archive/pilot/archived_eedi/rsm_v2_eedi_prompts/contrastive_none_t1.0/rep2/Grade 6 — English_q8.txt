Let's break down the question for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, keeping their context in mind.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** All words are very common and likely introduced early in English learning: "book," "reading," "a," "is," "he." "Reading" as an action verb is fundamental. "Book" is a concrete noun. "He" is a basic pronoun. "Is" is a basic auxiliary verb. "A" is a basic article.
    *   **Grammar:**
        *   Understanding of basic English word order (Subject-Verb-Object).
        *   Recognition of "he" as a subject pronoun.
        *   Recognition of "is" as a form of "to be" used with "he" for present continuous.
        *   Recognition of "-ing" ending for present continuous verbs.
        *   Understanding of "a" as an indefinite article for a singular noun.
    *   **Concept of "Meaningful Sentence":** Students should understand that a sentence needs to convey a complete thought and follow some grammatical structure.

*   **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** As noted, these are extremely high-frequency words. Even students with limited English exposure would likely have encountered these words multiple times in their textbooks, spoken English classes, or even general exposure (e.g., "book" in Hindi is किताब, but "book" as an English word is ubiquitous).
    *   **Sentence Structure:** This is the primary challenge. While the words are simple, putting them in the correct *English* order is crucial. The standard Hindi sentence structure is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), which is different from English's SVO. For example, "He a book is reading" (वह एक किताब पढ़ रहा है - *वह* is he, *एक किताब* is a book, *पढ़ रहा है* is reading) is the direct Hindi translation. This difference can lead to errors like "He a book is reading" or "He a book reading is."
    *   **Instructional Language:** "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence" - this instruction itself uses common English terms ("rearrange," "words," "make," "meaningful," "sentence") that should be familiar to Class 6 students who are taking English exams.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application** of grammatical rules. Students are not just recalling facts; they are applying their understanding of English sentence structure to a given set of words.
    *   There's a minor element of **Reasoning** to identify the subject, verb, and object, and then logically sequence them.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a **very common and foundational type of exercise** found in Class 3, 4, 5, and 6 English textbooks across India, especially for building basic sentence construction skills. Textbooks often start with simpler versions (e.g., "is/he/a boy") and gradually introduce more complex structures.
    *   This specific sentence structure (Subject + "is/are" + Verb-ing + Object) for the present continuous tense is typically introduced and drilled extensively.

**Synthesizing the Analysis:**

*   **Ease:** The vocabulary is extremely simple and high-frequency. The concept of forming a sentence is basic. It's a very common exercise type.
*   **Hardness:** The primary difficulty stems from the difference in native language (Hindi SOV) sentence structure compared to English (SVO). Students might struggle with placing the auxiliary verb "is" and the object "a book" correctly relative to the main verb "reading." However, given it's Class 6, they should have been exposed to this specific SVO pattern for present continuous tense for a few years.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%):** This is a critical piece of information. If the overall average is low, it suggests that many items are indeed challenging. However, this particular question is a foundational grammar item. Questions that are difficult usually involve more complex vocabulary, abstract concepts, or multi-step reasoning.

This question tests a very basic and frequently taught grammatical structure. While the SOV influence from Hindi is a factor, dedicated English teaching at the Class 6 level would have focused heavily on SVO structures. Compared to other potential Class 6 English questions (e.g., reading comprehension of a short paragraph, filling in blanks with appropriate prepositions, answering questions about a story), this is relatively straightforward.

Given the commonality of this exercise type and the simple vocabulary, it should be on the *easier* end of the spectrum for a Class 6 English exam,
