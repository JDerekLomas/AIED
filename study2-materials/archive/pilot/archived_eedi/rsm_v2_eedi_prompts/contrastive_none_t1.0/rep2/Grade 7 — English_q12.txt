Let's break down the question for a Class 7 student in an Indian government school, considering the context provided.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Grammar Concepts:** This question *directly* tests the understanding of "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice." This is a specific grammatical concept typically introduced around Class 6 or 7 in English language curricula. Students would need to know:
        *   What a subject, verb, and object are.
        *   The basic structure of active voice (Subject + Verb + Object).
        *   The basic structure of passive voice (Object + "to be" verb + Past Participle + "by" + Subject).
        *   The past participle form of common irregular verbs (like 'blow' -> 'blown').
    *   **Vocabulary:** "wind," "blew," "leaves," "away." These are common, everyday words that Class 7 students are highly likely to know. "Change," "sentence," "Active Voice," "Passive Voice" are also core instructional vocabulary.
    *   **Context:** The sentence "The wind blew the leaves away" describes a common, observable event, making it relatable.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Instructional Language:** "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice." While "change," "sentence," "active voice," "passive voice" are technical terms, they are central to grammar lessons. The challenge lies not in the words themselves, but in the *concept* they represent.
    *   **Sentence Complexity:** The original sentence "The wind blew the leaves away" is simple, SVO structure.
    *   **Vocabulary:** As noted above, the vocabulary within the sentence itself is simple and common.
    *   **Abstract Concept:** The concepts of "active" and "passive" voice are abstract grammatical rules. Students with limited English proficiency often struggle more with abstract grammatical manipulation than with direct comprehension or simple recall of vocabulary. They might understand what the sentence *means* but not how to *transform* its grammatical structure.
    *   **Idiomatic Usage/Phrasal Verbs:** "Blew away" is a phrasal verb. While simple here, it adds a tiny layer of complexity, but likely not a major barrier.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application**. Students need to *apply* a specific grammatical rule (active to passive transformation) to a given sentence.
    *   It requires **Recall** of the specific rules for passive voice formation and the past participle of 'blow'.
    *   It involves a degree of **Reasoning** to correctly identify the subject, verb, and object in the active sentence and then rearrange them, select the correct 'to be' verb tense, and form the past participle.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a **standard textbook exercise** for Class 7 when introducing or practicing active/passive voice. It's not overly complex or obscure.
    *   It's a foundational skill for this level of grammar.
    *   The sentence provided is quite straightforward, making it an entry-level example for this topic.

**Synthesis of Difficulty Factors:**

*   **Harder Aspects:** The primary difficulty will be the *abstract nature* of grammatical transformation and the need to apply specific rules (identifying object, choosing correct 'to be' verb tense, using past participle). Students might rote-learn definitions but struggle with application, especially if their foundational understanding of parts of speech is weak due to limited exposure to English. The need to recall 'blown' as the past participle of 'blow' is also a specific hurdle.
*   **Easier Aspects:** The vocabulary is very common. The original sentence is simple. The question format is direct. This is a very common grammar topic for this grade level. If a student has been taught active/passive voice, this is a very typical example they would encounter.

Given the average pass rate of 29% across *all items*, this specific grammar question might perform slightly better than average, but not by a huge margin, due to the application of a specific, somewhat abstract grammatical rule. Many students might struggle with remembering the precise "were blown by" structure, particularly the correct 'to be' verb and past participle.
