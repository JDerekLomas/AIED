Let's break down the question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, keeping their specific context in mind.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Content:** The core content (having a hobby, knowing when/why you do it) is universal and accessible. Every student, regardless of background, likely has some form of leisure activity they enjoy.
    *   **Structure:** They need to know what a "paragraph" is – a connected set of sentences on one topic. This is taught in Class 7, but mastery might vary. They also need to understand the concept of "short" (4-5 sentences).
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Hobby," "enjoy," "mention" are common enough words taught by Class 7, even in English-as-a-second-language contexts.
    *   **Grammar/Sentence Construction:** Basic sentence structures (Subject-Verb-Object), simple present tense (for habitual actions), and use of conjunctions (like 'and', 'because') are expected.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** The vocabulary is fairly simple and high-frequency. There are no complex scientific, historical, or literary terms.
    *   **Sentence Length/Complexity:** The prompt itself is straightforward. The expectation is for simple, descriptive sentences from the student.
    *   **Phrasing:** "Write a short paragraph... about 'My Favourite Hobby'" is a common essay prompt structure they would have encountered. "Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it" clearly breaks down the requirements, acting as a helpful scaffold.
    *   **Potential Hurdles:** While basic, consistently forming 4-5 *grammatically correct* and *coherent* sentences in English can be a struggle for students with limited exposure. They might struggle with subject-verb agreement, correct prepositions, or sequencing ideas logically in English, even if they can do it in Hindi. They might also translate directly from Hindi, leading to awkward English phrasing.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Minimal factual recall needed (only their own hobby).
    *   **Application:** Primarily *application* of writing skills. They need to apply their knowledge of paragraph structure, basic grammar, and vocabulary to express personal information.
    *   **Reasoning:** Limited high-level reasoning. It's more descriptive and explanatory.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Easier:**
        *   **Personal Topic:** Unlike a science or history question, it doesn't require memorizing facts from a textbook. The content is personal and intrinsically known. This reduces cognitive load related to content retrieval.
        *   **Clear Instructions:** The breakdown of "what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it" is a significant scaffold that many textbook questions don't explicitly provide for paragraph writing.
        *   **Low Stakes Content:** There's no "right" or "wrong" hobby, reducing pressure.
    *   **Similar:**
        *   **Writing Task:** It's a standard short writing task, common in English language learning.
    *   **Harder (in context of limited English):**
        *   **Producing vs. Recognizing:** Many textbook exercises focus on multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blanks, or short answer (one-word/one-sentence) questions where students *recognize* correct English. This task requires *producing* multiple original sentences coherently, which is a higher-order skill for language learners.
        *   **Sustained Writing:** 4-5 sentences, while short, requires sustained effort and a minimum level of grammatical and lexical control that might be challenging if their productive vocabulary/grammar is weak.

**Overall Assessment:**

This question is relatively easy in terms of *content accessibility* and *clarity of instructions*. The major hurdle will be the *productive English writing skill* itself. Students might know what they want to say but struggle to articulate it correctly and cohesively in English within the required sentence count. The average pass rate of 29% suggests a general struggle with English tasks. This specific question removes many external barriers (complex content, obscure vocabulary) but still demands a basic level of English writing fluency.

Considering the "average pass rate across items on this exam is about 29%," and that this task requires production rather than recognition, but with high scaffolding and personal relevance, it should perform *slightly better* than the average due to its accessibility. However, it won't be exceptionally high because of the demand for coherent sentence construction. Many might write 1-2 correct sentences but fail to reach 4-5 coherent ones or fulfill all conditions.
