Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school.

**Question:** At `10` am in the morning, the temperature of Jodhpur was `30^0 C`. If the temperature increases by `2^0 C` per hour, then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?
**Rubric:** Calculates the time elapsed from `10:00` am to `4:00` pm as `6` hours.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Time:** Understanding of AM/PM, the concept of an hour, and how to calculate time elapsed over several hours, including crossing noon. This is a crucial step.
    *   **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition, multiplication.
    *   **Temperature:** Understanding of degrees Celsius and that temperature can increase.
    *   **Word Problems:** Ability to extract numerical information and the operation required from a text.
    *   **Units:** Understanding that the final answer needs to be in degrees Celsius.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **"At 10 am in the morning"**: Fairly common phrase. "Morning" reinforces "am."
    *   **"temperature of Jodhpur was 30°C"**: "Temperature" and "was" might be slightly tricky, but "30°C" gives a strong numerical clue.
    *   **"If the temperature increases by 2°C per hour"**: "Increases" is a key verb. "Per hour" is also important. This indicates multiplication or repeated addition.
    *   **"then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?"**: "What will be" indicates a future state and requires calculation. "Evening" reinforces "pm."
    *   **Overall:** The vocabulary is relatively simple for a math problem. The context is clear (temperature, time). The numbers are integers, avoiding decimals or fractions which often add linguistic complexity.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily an **application** problem. Students need to apply their knowledge of time, addition/multiplication, and interpreting word problems to a specific scenario.
    *   There's a mild element of **reasoning** in breaking down the problem into steps: first finding the time elapsed, then calculating the total temperature increase, and finally adding it to the initial temperature.
    *   It's not pure recall of a formula, but it follows a standard pattern of "rate x time + initial value."

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This problem is a fairly standard, multi-step word problem often found in Class 5 or 6 textbooks.
    *   The numbers are simple (integers, small multiplication).
    *   The time calculation from AM to PM (10 am to 4 pm) is a common point of practice. Many students might count on their fingers or use a number line: 10-11-12-1-2-3-4 (6 hours). This is a well-practiced skill.
    *   The "per hour" rate is straightforward.
    *   It's not a "trick" question. It directly tests the application of concepts.
    *   The main challenge lies in successfully completing all steps without error:
        1.  Calculate time elapsed (10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours).
        2.  Calculate total temperature increase (6 hours * 2°C/hour = 12°C).
        3.  Calculate final temperature (30°C + 12°C = 42°C).

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29% across items):**

The average pass rate is very low, suggesting significant challenges with many items. This question, however, has several factors that make it *potentially* easier than average for a math item:

*   **Relatable Context:** Temperature and time are daily concepts.
*   **Simple Numbers:** No decimals or complex fractions.
*   **Clear Operations:** "Increases by," "per hour" point directly to multiplication/addition.
*   **Standard Problem Type:** This kind of rate problem is common.
*   **Minimal Ambiguity:** The language, while English, is quite direct for a math problem.

The biggest hurdles will likely be:
1.  **Correctly calculating the time elapsed (10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours).** This is where errors often occur, e.g., students might just subtract 10 from 4 directly, or miss the noon transition. However, counting
