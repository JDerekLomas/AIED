Let's break down the question "Describes the poet’s writing style" for a Class 7 student in an Indian government school, considering the stated context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Implicit:** The student must have read *something* by a poet recently. The question is a standalone item, implying it's part of an assessment about a specific text. If it's a general question without a preceding text, it's impossible to answer. Assuming there *is* a preceding text:
    *   **Literary Concepts (Basic):**
        *   Understanding of "poet" (कवि - *kavi* - likely known).
        *   Understanding of "writing style" (लेखन शैली - *lekhan shaili* - this is the critical part).
        *   Ability to differentiate between "what the poet writes about" (theme/subject) and "how the poet writes" (style). This is a common point of confusion even for native English speakers.
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Describes": वर्णन करना (*varnan karna* - common verb).
        *   "Poet": कवि (*kavi* - very common noun).
        *   "Writing style": This is the trickiest. "Writing" (लेखन - *lekhan*) and "style" (शैली - *shaili*) are individual words they might know, but the compound "writing style" as a literary concept might be new or not firmly established, especially in English.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **"Describes"**: This is a fairly common verb. Students might be familiar with it from "describe the picture" or "describe the animal."
    *   **"Poet's"**: Possessive form might be slightly confusing if they primarily encounter simple sentences.
    *   **"Writing style"**: This is the major hurdle.
        *   Many students might interpret "style" literally as "design" or "fashion," rather than "manner of writing."
        *   They might translate "style" (शैली) and "writing" (लेखन) separately and struggle to combine them into the specific literary meaning requested.
        *   The *absence* of a clear Hindi equivalent like "लेखन शैली" being used consistently in their English classes could make this abstract.
        *   They might confuse "writing style" with "what the poem is about" (theme) or "what kind of poem it is" (genre).

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Application/Reasoning (primarily):** It requires students to have read a poem (application of reading comprehension), then *analyze* it to identify stylistic features (reasoning), and then *articulate* those features using appropriate descriptive words (application of vocabulary).
    *   It is *not* pure recall, unless they were explicitly taught "Poet X has a simple writing style" right before the exam.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Higher Difficulty:**
        *   Typical Class 7 English exercises often focus on literal comprehension ("Who said what?", "What happened next?").
        *   Vocabulary building might focus on common nouns, verbs, and adjectives, but less on abstract literary terms.
        *   Grammar exercises are usually sentence-level.
        *   While they might be asked to "describe" characters or events, describing an abstract concept like "writing style" is a step up.
        *   In Hindi or regional language classes, they *might* discuss "kavi ki shaili" (poet's style), but translating that nuanced understanding into appropriate English adjectives is hard.
        *   The *rubric* itself ("simple, descriptive, informal, direct") requires a relatively sophisticated set of English adjectives for literary analysis, which might not be part of their active vocabulary. Many might just say "good" or "nice," which wouldn't get credit.

**Factors making it harder:**
1.  **Abstract Nature:** "Writing style" is an abstract concept that requires analytical thinking, not just recall.
2.  **Specific Literary Terminology:** The term "writing style" is itself a specific literary concept, likely introduced more thoroughly in later grades or in specific literature classes, not general English.
3.  **English Vocabulary for Description:** Even if they understand the concept in Hindi, finding suitable English adjectives (simple, descriptive, informal, direct) to express it is a significant challenge for students with limited English.
4.  **Confusion with Theme/Subject:** A very common mistake is to describe *what* the poet wrote about rather than *how* they wrote it.
5.  **Lack of Context:** As
