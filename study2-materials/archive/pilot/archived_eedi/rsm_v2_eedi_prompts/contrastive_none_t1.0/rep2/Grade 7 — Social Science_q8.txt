Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimate:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Easy:** Students are expected to have a basic understanding of what "rural areas" are and what "occupations" mean. These are fundamental concepts typically covered in early geography/social studies lessons. They would also have learned about different regions of India, including Rajasthan, and likely some basic characteristics of its geography and economy. Agriculture and animal husbandry are core topics related to rural life across India.
    *   **Moderate:** Knowing specific details about Rajasthan's primary rural occupations beyond just "farming" might require a slightly deeper recall, but animal husbandry (especially related to desert/semi-desert regions) is often highlighted for Rajasthan. Handicrafts might be slightly less universally known but still common.
    *   **Hard:** No particularly complex or obscure prior knowledge is assumed beyond general Class 7 Social Science curriculum.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Easy:**
        *   "What are the main occupations..." - "Main" and "occupations" are relatively common words in a social studies context, even for Hindi-medium students who might encounter them in bilingual lessons or textbooks.
        *   "rural areas" - "Rural" might be a new word for some, but "areas" is common. The concept of "rural" (गाँव के इलाके) would be very familiar.
        *   "Rajasthan" - This is a proper noun, universally recognizable.
        *   "Describe any one in brief." - "Describe," "one," and "brief" are fairly basic English instructions.
    *   **Potential Difficulty:** The word "occupations" itself might be slightly challenging for some very low-proficiency students, but the context usually makes it clear. The instruction "Describe any one in brief" requires them to formulate a sentence or two, which can be harder than just naming. However, the *rubric* only requires naming two, suggesting the description part might be a stretch goal or less critical for full marks based on a low-score item. If the rubric was strictly followed for "Max score: 1" for *naming two and describing one*, it would be harder. But the provided rubric focuses only on *naming two*.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Primarily Recall:** This question heavily relies on direct recall of information learned about Rajasthan's geography and economy.
    *   **Some Application/Understanding:** Briefly describing one occupation requires a basic understanding of what that occupation entails, not just memorizing its name. However, as noted, the rubric only requires naming.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical/Slightly Easier:** Questions asking to list occupations of people in different regions are very common in Class 6-7 Social Science textbooks. Listing main characteristics of a state (including its economy) is standard. The "describe any one in brief" part makes it slightly more demanding than just listing, but still within typical exercise difficulty. For Class 7 students, this is a foundational type of question about India's diverse geography and economy.

**Overall Difficulty Assessment:**

This question is of **moderate-low difficulty**.
*   The core concepts are foundational.
*   The vocabulary, while English, is within the expected range for Social Science.
*   It's primarily a recall question.
*   The rubric for maximum score (just naming two occupations) significantly reduces the burden for students. If they can recall "farming" and "animal husbandry," they've scored. These are extremely common and expected occupations for rural Rajasthan.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29% across items):** This specific item should perform *better* than the average.
*   Many items on an exam can be complex, involve multi-step reasoning, or higher-level vocabulary. This one is quite direct.
*   Students from economically weaker sections often have a strong connection to and understanding of rural life and occupations, as it might be their family's reality or that of their relatives.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%**
