Let's break down the question for a Class 7 student in an Indian government school, considering the context provided.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Passage Comprehension:** The primary assumed knowledge is a thorough understanding of the preceding reading passage (which describes the king's three questions and their context). Without this, the question is unanswerable.
    *   **General Life Experience:** "Real life" implies a connection to everyday situations, decision-making, and understanding the implications of choices. This is generally within a Class 7 student's grasp, even if their "real life" context differs from more privileged children.
    *   **Concept of "Importance":** Students should understand what it means for something to be significant or valuable.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **"Do you think... important in real life?":** This phrasing is relatively common and accessible. "Important" and "real life" are high-frequency vocabulary.
    *   **"Give one reason":** This is a standard instruction in English exams, and most students would understand they need to provide a justification.
    *   **Subtle Nuance:** The term "king's questions" directly refers to the passage content. If the student struggled with the passage's overall meaning, they might misinterpret what "the king's questions" actually entail. However, given the rubric's specific mention of "the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with," it implies the student needs to have extracted these core questions from the passage.
    *   **Answering in English:** The biggest hurdle is articulating a "reason" coherently and grammatically in English. Many students might understand the concept in Hindi but struggle to translate it into acceptable English. They might give very short, fragmented answers.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Partially, as it requires recalling the *content* of the king's questions from the passage.
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** Predominantly reasoning and application. Students must:
        *   Understand the *purpose* of the king's questions from the passage.
        *   Connect this purpose to their understanding of "real life."
        *   Formulate a judgment ("yes" or "no," though "yes" is strongly implied by the question's framing and the nature of the questions themselves).
        *   Provide a *justification* (the "one reason") for their judgment. This requires critical thinking and expressing an opinion.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Recall-based questions:** Typical textbook exercises often focus on direct recall (e.g., "What were the three questions the king asked?"). This question goes beyond that.
    *   **Inference/Opinion questions:** Many textbooks *do* include questions that ask for student opinions or inferences, but the complexity of expressing a reasoned opinion in English can be higher for this demographic.
    *   **Relatability:** The "real life" aspect makes it potentially more engaging and relatable than a purely factual question, which can sometimes make it easier if the language barrier isn't too high. However, if they struggle with the language for explanation, this advantage is lost.
    *   **Open-endedness:** It's more open-ended than a multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank question, which often presents a greater challenge for students with limited writing fluency in English.
    *   **Rubric's leniency:** The rubric "Any valid reason" is very lenient, which helps. A simple, even grammatically imperfect, but conceptually sound reason could get full marks (e.g., "Yes, because we need to make good choices," or "Yes, to be successful").

**Overall Difficulty Assessment:**

This question is moderately difficult.
*   The vocabulary and phrasing of the question itself are relatively simple.
*   The "real life" connection is relatable.
*   The leniency of "any valid reason" in the rubric is a significant aid.
*   **However, the primary hurdles will be:**
    1.  **Full comprehension of the preceding passage:** If they didn't grasp the king's *specific* three questions and why he asked them, they can't answer this.
    2.  **Ability to articulate a reason in coherent (even if simple) English:** Many students might have the right idea in their head but struggle to put it into words that would be considered "valid" by an examiner looking for an English answer. They might provide a single word or a very garbled sentence.
