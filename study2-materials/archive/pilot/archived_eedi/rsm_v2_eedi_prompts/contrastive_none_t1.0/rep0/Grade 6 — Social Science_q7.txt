Let's break down the question and its demands on a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the context provided.

**Question:** Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there.
**Rubric:** Mentions two correct natural resources (e.g., water, Marble, Copper, Sandstone, Gypsum, mica, limestone, zinc, salt, Sunlight for solar energy, Wind for wind energy). Max score: 1

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geographical Knowledge:** Students are expected to know that Rajasthan is a state and have some basic understanding of its geography and resources. This is standard Class 6 Social Science (Geography) curriculum in India, where students learn about different states and their characteristics.
    *   **Definition of Natural Resources:** They need to understand what constitutes a "natural resource." This is a fundamental concept taught early in Geography.
    *   **Basic Cause-and-Effect:** To explain the influence, they need to grasp simple cause-and-effect relationships (e.g., "less water means difficulty in farming").

2.  **Language Demands (English):**
    *   **Keywords:** "Mention," "natural resources," "found," "explain," "influences," "lives," "people."
    *   **Complexity:** The sentence structure is relatively straightforward. "Mention any two..." is simple. "explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there" is a slightly more complex instruction requiring a short descriptive sentence.
    *   **Potential Difficulties:**
        *   "Natural resources" might be a chunk they know, but "influences" could be challenging for students with limited English. They might understand "effect" or "impact" better.
        *   Formulating an explanation in English, even a simple one, can be a major hurdle. They might know the *concept* in Hindi but struggle to articulate it in English.
        *   The rubric only requires mentioning two resources to get a point, *not* the explanation. This significantly lowers the language barrier for scoring a point.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Recall (Primary):** Identifying two natural resources found in Rajasthan is primarily a recall task. They would have learned about these in their textbooks. Common examples like water (due to desert), marble, copper, salt, or even sand are frequently associated with Rajasthan.
    *   **Application/Reasoning (Secondary, but not scored for full credit):** The "explain how one of them influences the lives" part requires a simple application of knowledge or basic reasoning. For instance, knowing Rajasthan is a desert implies water scarcity, which influences agriculture and daily life. This part is critical for a complete understanding but *not* for scoring the maximum point as per the given rubric (max score 1 for just mentioning two resources).

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Identifying Resources:** This is a very common type of question found in "fill in the blanks," "match the following," or "short answer" sections in Class 6 Geography textbooks for various states.
    *   **Explaining Influence:** Explaining "how it influences" is also a standard short-answer question type, though it requires slightly more descriptive writing than just listing. However, given the *rubric*, the actual scoring element is very much like a simple recall exercise.

**Factors making it easier/harder for *this specific question* to score:**

*   **Ease:**
    *   **Rubric:** The biggest factor making this *easy to score a point* is the rubric. A student only needs to list two natural resources to get the full score of 1. They *don't* need to provide the explanation in English, which would have been the major linguistic hurdle.
    *   **Common Knowledge (within curriculum):** Water, sand, marble, salt are very commonly associated with Rajasthan. Students are likely to have encountered these multiple times.
    *   **Bilingual Advantage:** Even if they don't know "natural resources," they might understand "things found in nature in Rajasthan" if the teacher explained it in Hindi or if the textbook has a bilingual glossary. They can recall the Hindi terms and try to translate them or just write the English words they know (e.g., "pani" for water).
    *   **Multiple Correct Answers:** The wide range of acceptable answers in the rubric (water, Marble, Copper, Sandstone, Gypsum, mica, limestone, zinc, salt, Sunlight for solar energy, Wind for wind energy) significantly increases the chances of students correctly identifying two.

*   **Hardness:**
    *   **English Proficiency (for the explanation
