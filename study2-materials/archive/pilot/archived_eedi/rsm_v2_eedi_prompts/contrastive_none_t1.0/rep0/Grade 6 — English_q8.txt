Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering their typical background.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Grammar:** Basic understanding of sentence structure (subject-verb-object). They would have encountered this in Hindi (कर्ता-कर्म-क्रिया), but the English word order is different (subject-verb-object vs. Hindi's typical subject-object-verb). This is a *key difference* they need to map.
    *   **Vocabulary:** All words are extremely common (book, reading, a, is, he). These would likely be among the first English words learned. "Reading" might be slightly less common than the others, but contextually, it's very accessible.
    *   **Concepts:** The action of "reading a book" is a universal, everyday concept.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** Low demand. As noted, all words are high-frequency.
    *   **Syntax/Grammar:** Moderate demand. While the words are simple, rearranging them correctly requires an understanding of English sentence structure, specifically the SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) order. This contrasts with Hindi's common SOV order. Students might initially try to form a Hindi-like structure.
    *   **Instructions:** "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence" is a common instruction type. Even if "rearrange" isn't fully understood, the task becomes clear once they see the jumbled words and the expectation of a coherent output. The word "meaningful" is key here, guiding them to form a sensible statement.

3.  **Type of Task:**
    *   This is primarily an **application** task. Students need to apply their knowledge of English grammar rules (SVO) to a given set of words. It's not pure recall (like memorizing a definition) nor complex reasoning (like solving a multi-step problem). It involves *syntactic reasoning* within the constraints of English grammar.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Easier:**
        *   The vocabulary is extremely simple. Many textbook exercises might use slightly more varied or less frequent words.
        *   The sentence is short and consists of only five words.
        *   The topic (reading a book) is very concrete and relatable.
    *   **Similar:**
        *   This type of "jumbled words" or "unscramble the sentence" exercise is very common in early English language learning textbooks, precisely to practice basic sentence structure.
    *   **Harder:**
        *   Compared to a simple fill-in-the-blanks or matching exercise, rearranging requires a more active construction of the sentence, demonstrating a deeper (though still foundational) understanding of structure.
        *   The SVO vs. SOV difference with Hindi could trip up some students initially, but by Class 6, they've likely had some exposure to basic English sentence formation.

**Factors Influencing the Estimate:**

*   **Low Vocabulary Barrier:** This is a huge advantage. Students won't get stuck on individual words.
*   **Common Sentence Structure:** "He is reading a book" is a very basic present continuous sentence, often one of the first structures taught.
*   **Contrast with Hindi:** This is the main potential hurdle. However, by Class 6, students in English classes are specifically taught English grammar, which includes SVO. They've likely seen and practiced this.
*   **Average Pass Rate of 29%:** This is a crucial benchmark. It suggests that many items are challenging. However, this particular item targets a foundational skill that is explicitly taught early on. It's designed to assess a core competency, not a nuanced one.
*   **Focus on Economically Weaker Sections/Hindi Medium:** While English exposure might be limited, the curriculum for English in government schools *does* cover these basics. Teachers would repeatedly drill simple sentence formation.

**Conclusion:**

Given the simplicity of the vocabulary, the fundamental nature of the grammar concept, and the fact that this is a very common type of exercise in early English learning, this question should be significantly easier than the average item on an exam with a 29% pass rate. Students are explicitly taught SVO structure in English, even if their mother tongue uses a different word order. The challenge lies in *applying* that learned rule.

I would expect a substantial number of students, even with limited English proficiency, to correctly answer this, as it tests a very basic and frequently drilled aspect of English.
