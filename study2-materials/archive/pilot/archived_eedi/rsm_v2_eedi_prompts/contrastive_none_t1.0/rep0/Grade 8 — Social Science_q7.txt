Let's break down the question and its likely impact on Class 8 students in Indian government schools.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students are expected to have studied the Battle of Plassey (1757) as a significant event in Indian history, particularly within the context of the rise of British power. They should know *who* fought, *who won*, and the immediate aftermath in Bengal. This is standard Class 8 Indian history curriculum.
    *   **Potential Gaps:** While the *event* itself is taught, the *nuances* of "contribution to expansion" beyond "British won" might be less deeply understood or recalled by all. Many might remember the facts of the battle but struggle with the cause-and-effect relationship to broader British power expansion.

2.  **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   **Keywords:** "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "British power," "India" are likely recognizable due to repeated exposure in textbooks, even if the medium is Hindi. The names are often transliterated or used consistently.
    *   **Core Verb/Concept:** "Contribute to the expansion of..." This is the trickiest part. "Contribute" means to help cause something, and "expansion" implies growth or spread. Students with limited English might understand "Plassey" and "British power" but miss the *linkage* implied by "contribute to the expansion." They might give facts *about* Plassey without directly answering *how* it contributed.
    *   **Rubric Match:** The rubric requires explaining *how* it led to *political dominance/control over Bengal*. This is a step beyond simply stating "British won." It requires understanding the political consequences. "Puppet nawab" is a specific concept that might be challenging if not explicitly taught and understood in English.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This question primarily requires **recall** of specific historical information and **application** of that knowledge to a cause-and-effect scenario.
    *   It's not pure recall (like "When was the Battle of Plassey?"). It requires connecting the event to its historical significance.
    *   It's not deep reasoning or analysis, but it does require moving beyond just the immediate outcome of the battle to its broader implications for British control. The specific requirement of explaining *how* (i.e., through political dominance/puppet rule) makes it more than just superficial recall.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical:** Many textbook questions might be simpler recall (e.g., "Who won the Battle of Plassey?", "What was the significance of Plassey?").
    *   **This Question:** "How did it *contribute to the expansion*..." is slightly more demanding than a basic recall question. It requires synthesizing information about the battle's outcome with the subsequent political changes in Bengal. It asks for a *mechanism* of contribution, which is precisely what the rubric targets (political dominance/puppet nawab).
    *   The "average pass rate of 29% across items" suggests that even relatively straightforward Social Science questions pose a challenge. This question is on the slightly harder side of "straightforward" due to the specific demand for the *mechanism* of contribution and the English phrasing.

**Synthesis and Estimate:**

*   **Positive Factors:**
    *   Battle of Plassey is a core topic.
    *   Key terms are likely somewhat familiar.
    *   The core idea (British dominance after Plassey) is foundational.
*   **Negative Factors:**
    *   English language demands, especially "contribute to the expansion," can be a significant hurdle. Students might know the facts but struggle to articulate the *how* in English.
    *   The need to explain *political dominance/control over Bengal* (and ideally the "puppet nawab" concept) goes beyond simple "British won." This requires a slightly more nuanced understanding of the *consequences*.
    *   The overall low average pass rate for Class 8 students on this exam suggests a general struggle with both content mastery and test-taking in English.

Considering these factors, many students might recall that the British won and that it was important, but fail to articulate *how* it contributed to the expansion of power in the way the rubric expects (political dominance over Bengal, puppet nawab). The English phrase "contribute to the expansion of British power" and the need for a specific, rather than general, explanation will filter out a significant portion.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%**

This estimate is slightly below the average pass rate of 29% because of the specific demands of the question
