Let's break down the question and estimate the proportion of Class 8 Indian government school students who would answer it correctly, specifically focusing on the initial part "Does gardener notice any change after some days?" to align with the provided rubric's focus.

**Question Analysis (Focusing on the first part):**

"A gardener has collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit. Does gardener notice any change after some days? Give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health"

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Easy:** Students are likely familiar with plants, vegetables, and fruits as organic matter. They have probably seen these items decay or rot in their daily lives, even if they don't know the scientific term "decomposition." The idea of "waste" is also relatable.
    *   **Hard:** No advanced scientific concepts like microbial action, nutrient cycling, or specific chemical reactions are directly required *just to answer if a change is noticed*.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Easy:**
        *   "Gardener," "waste," "plants," "vegetables," "fruits," "pit," "change," "some days" are all relatively common and concrete nouns/verbs/timeframes.
        *   The sentence structure is simple subject-verb-object.
        *   "Notice any change" is a straightforward question about observation.
    *   **Hard:** No particularly complex vocabulary or grammatical structures for the first part of the question.

*   **Cognitive Demand:**
    *   **Recall:** While "decomposition" might be a recall term, noticing a change in organic waste is more of an observation-based deduction. They recall that things "rot" or "spoil."
    *   **Application:** Not directly applying a formula or rule, but applying a general understanding of how organic matter behaves over time.
    *   **Reasoning:** Minimal reasoning is needed *just to state if a change is noticed*. The "give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial" part requires more reasoning, but the first part is more observational.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 8 science textbooks in India often cover topics like "Waste Management," "Microorganisms," or "Soil" where decomposition is discussed.
    *   This question, especially the first part, aligns well with basic observational science and environmental awareness. It's less abstract than many physics or chemistry concepts.
    *   It's a relatively direct question that doesn't require complex calculations or deep theoretical understanding for the initial observation. Many textbook questions might ask "What is decomposition?" or "List the benefits of compost," which require more specific recall. This question starts with a more relatable scenario.

**Focusing on the Rubric: "The user suggests that the gardener will notice significant changes."**

To get this correct, students just need to answer "Yes" or "The waste will decompose/rot/shrink/smell differently." They don't need to explain *why* or *how* for this specific part of the rubric.

**Conclusion for "Does gardener notice any change after some days?":**

The core concept that organic waste changes over time (rots, decomposes, shrinks, changes smell) is very common and observable. Even without formal scientific terms, students would have encountered this phenomenon. The language is simple. This part of the question is quite accessible.

**Factors for lower scores overall (but not for *this specific point*):**
*   The "give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health" part is where the difficulty significantly increases due to scientific vocabulary and application of knowledge.
*   Limited English proficiency would impact the *articulation* of the reasons and evaluation, but less so the simple "yes, there's a change."
*   Average pass rate of 29% suggests many items are indeed hard. However, this specific observational component is likely easier than the average item.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT (for "Does gardener notice any change after some days?"):** 60%
