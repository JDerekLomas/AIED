Let's break down the question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, keeping their context in mind.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Content:**
        *   Understanding of "hobby" (likely familiar concept, even if the English word itself is not immediately recognized by all).
        *   Ability to identify their own "favourite" hobby.
        *   Basic understanding of "when" and "why."
    *   **Writing Structure:**
        *   Understanding of "paragraph" (a common concept taught from early grades, even if English writing practice is limited).
        *   Understanding of "4-5 sentences."
        *   Ability to connect sentences logically to form a coherent paragraph.
    *   **Grammar/Vocabulary:**
        *   Basic English vocabulary to describe common hobbies (e.g., playing cricket, reading, drawing, gardening).
        *   Basic sentence construction (subject-verb-object).
        *   Use of simple tenses (present tense for describing hobby, past tense for when they started, future tense for aspirations if they choose).
        *   Connectors like 'and', 'because', 'when', 'so'.

*   **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Favourite Hobby": This phrase is relatively common. "Hobby" might be understood through context or direct teaching. "Favourite" is also a common word.
        *   "Mention": Clear instruction.
        *   "Enjoy": Common verb.
    *   **Sentence Structure/Phrasing:**
        *   "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences)": Clear, direct instruction.
        *   "Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it": This is a *scaffolded* prompt, which greatly reduces the cognitive load. It explicitly tells them what to include.
    *   **Cognitive Load:** The instructions are relatively simple and direct. The topic ("My Favourite Hobby") is personal and easily accessible, reducing the need for external factual knowledge or complex reasoning. They can draw directly from their own experiences.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   Predominantly **Application** and **Recall** (of personal experience and basic English writing rules).
        *   **Recall:** Recalling their own hobby, when they do it, and why they like it.
        *   **Application:** Applying basic English sentence formation and paragraph structure rules to describe their personal experience.
    *   There's very little *abstract reasoning* required.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Easier than many:**
        *   Many textbook exercises might involve complex grammar structures, reading comprehension of unfamiliar texts, or answering questions based on academic content.
        *   This question is highly personal and requires very basic descriptive English.
        *   The explicit bullet points ("what it is, when you do it, why you enjoy it") are a significant aid, making it much easier than a generic "Write about My Hobby" prompt.
    *   **Similar to "My Pet" or "My Best Friend" style essays:** These are common, foundational writing tasks designed to build confidence in English.
    *   **Challenge:** The main challenge will be the *fluency* of writing 4-5 grammatically acceptable English sentences and ensuring they cover all three points. Students might write 2-3 sentences and struggle to elaborate, or their sentences might be very simple (e.g., "My hobby is cricket. I play everyday. I like it."). The rubric asks for a "complete paragraph that clearly mentions..."

**Rubric Consideration:**
The rubric is quite generous: "Student writes a complete paragraph that clearly mentions the hobby, when it is done, and why it is enjoyable." It doesn't demand perfect grammar or elaborate vocabulary, just that the core information is present in paragraph form. Even simple sentences like "My hobby is reading. I read after school. I enjoy new stories." would likely score 1.

**Overall Assessment:**
This is a relatively **easy** question for Class 7 students, especially given the clear scaffolding and personal nature of the topic. The average pass rate of 29% for the exam generally suggests a difficult exam or a population with significant challenges. However, this *specific* question targets basic expressive writing, which is a fundamental skill. The explicit instructions mitigate much of the usual difficulty related to understanding the prompt. The primary hurdle will be the students' *productive* English skills (vocabulary, sentence formation, spelling) and their ability to string 4-5 sentences together.

Students who understand the English words in the prompt and have even basic sentence construction ability should be
