Let's break down the question and its context for Class 7 students in Indian government schools.

**Contextual Factors:**

*   **Economically Weaker Sections:** This implies less exposure to English outside school, limited access to supplementary resources, and potentially higher levels of stress or distraction in their home lives that could affect academic focus.
*   **Hindi-medium schools, limited English proficiency:** This is the most critical factor. Direct translation or simple vocabulary is key. Complex sentence structures or idiomatic expressions will be major hurdles.
*   **Average pass rate across items: 29%:** This is a low baseline, suggesting that even "easy" questions might be challenging for a significant portion of the student population.

**Contrastive Analysis of "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Passage Comprehension:** The most significant prior knowledge is understanding the preceding reading passage (implied by "the king's questions"). The rubric clarifies these questions: "the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with." Students *must* have grasped these three core questions from the text. This is a primary dependency. If they didn't understand the passage, they cannot answer this question meaningfully.
    *   **Concept of "importance":** This is a relatively basic concept, but linking it to "real life" requires a degree of abstract thinking and the ability to extrapolate from a fictional story to their own experiences or observations.
    *   **Concept of "reason":** They need to understand what constitutes a "reason" – a justification or explanation.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Do you think": Common, should be understood.
        *   "king's questions": Directly refers to the passage. "Questions" is a basic word.
        *   "important": Common adjective.
        *   "real life": Slightly more abstract than just "life," but still a common phrase.
        *   "Give one reason": "Give" and "one" are basic. "Reason" is a core vocabulary word for academic tasks.
    *   **Sentence Structure:**
        *   "Do you think...?" is a standard interrogative structure.
        *   "...are important in real life?" is a straightforward declarative statement framed as a question.
        *   "Give one reason" is a simple imperative.
    *   **Cognitive Load from English:** The vocabulary is fairly basic for Class 7. There are no complex grammatical inversions, passive voice, or highly idiomatic expressions. The challenge is primarily in translating and processing the *concepts* rather than deciphering complex English grammar. However, "real life" might be slightly tricky to connect immediately for some, as their school English often focuses on direct factual recall from texts.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall (of the passage):** Yes, to identify "the king's questions." Without recalling these, the subsequent parts are impossible.
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** This is primarily **reasoning** and **application**. It asks for a subjective opinion ("Do *you* think...") and requires students to apply the abstract concepts from the king's questions to their own understanding of "real life." They need to synthesize their understanding of the questions' content with their worldview to provide a justification. This is not rote recall from the passage; it requires independent thought.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical exercises:** Often focus on direct recall (e.g., "What were the three questions the king asked?"), identifying characters, or sequencing events.
    *   **This question:** Moves beyond direct recall into higher-order thinking. It's more analytical and requires personal engagement. This type of question might appear in a "thinking beyond the text" section, but often with more scaffolding or simplified reasoning prompts. The open-ended nature of "Give one reason" can be challenging if students aren't practiced in articulating their thoughts in English.
    *   **Difficulty vs. Typical:** This question is **moderately harder** than a typical recall question. The language itself is not exceptionally difficult, but the demand for subjective reasoning and connecting a fictional text to "real life" in a coherent English sentence makes it more challenging than simple fact retrieval. The requirement to *generate* a reason, rather than pick from options, significantly increases difficulty for students with limited English writing skills. They might have the thought in Hindi but struggle to phrase it correctly in English.

**Rubric Considerations:** "Any valid reason." This is broad, which is good. A simple, even slightly awkward, statement like "Yes, because we need to
