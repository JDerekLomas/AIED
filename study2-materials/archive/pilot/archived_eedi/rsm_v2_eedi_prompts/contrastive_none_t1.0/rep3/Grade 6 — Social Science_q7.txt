Let's break down the question and its demands on a typical Class 6 student in an Indian government school, specifically considering the context provided.

**Question:** Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there.

**Rubric:** Mentions two correct natural resources (e.g., water, Marble, Copper, Sandstone, Gypsum, mica, limestone, zinc, salt, Sunlight for solar energy, Wind for wind energy).
*Note: The rubric only gives 1 mark for mentioning two resources. It doesn't seem to account for the explanation part of the question. This is a critical point as the question asks for an explanation, but the rubric focuses solely on naming resources. Assuming the intent is just to *name* two resources for a "correct" answer based on the rubric, this simplifies the task significantly.*

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Concept of "natural resources":** This is a fundamental concept taught in Social Science (Geography) from Class 5 or 6. Students should have a basic understanding that natural resources are things from nature that are useful to humans.
    *   **General geography of India, specifically Rajasthan:** Students are expected to know that Rajasthan is a state in India and have some general idea of its climate and environment (desert/dry region, mining).
    *   **Specific natural resources of Rajasthan:** This is direct recall. Textbooks often list prominent resources for different regions. For Rajasthan, common ones taught are water (its scarcity), minerals (marble, copper, zinc, gypsum, salt), and more recently, solar/wind energy.
    *   **Influence of resources on lives:** This requires a basic understanding of how a resource connects to human activity – e.g., water for farming/drinking, minerals for livelihoods/industries, salt for food/livelihoods.

2.  **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **"Mention":** Relatively simple and common verb.
    *   **"Natural resources":** A key term, likely taught and reinforced in English and Hindi (प्राकृतिक संसाधन). Students might recognize the Hindi equivalent first.
    *   **"Found in Rajasthan":** Straightforward.
    *   **"Explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":** This is the most complex part linguistically, requiring not just recall but articulation of a cause-and-effect relationship.
        *   "influences": Can be a challenging vocabulary word. Students might understand "affect" or "change" better.
        *   "lives of the people": Simple.
        *   "there": Refers to Rajasthan.
    *   **Overall:** The prompt is relatively direct, but the "explain" part ramps up the linguistic demand significantly. If the *rubric truly only asks for two named resources*, the language demand drops considerably to just understanding "mention" and "natural resources."

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Naming two natural resources:** Pure **recall**. Students either know them or they don't.
    *   **Explaining influence:** This requires basic **reasoning** and **application** of knowledge about the resource's utility. For example, recalling that Rajasthan is dry and then linking water scarcity to agriculture/drinking is a form of simple reasoning.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Naming resources:** This is a very common type of "fill in the blanks" or "list two examples" exercise in Class 6 Social Science textbooks. It's a standard recall question.
    *   **Explaining influence:** This is a slightly more demanding "short answer" type question. Textbooks often have questions like "How is X important for Y?" or "What is the use of Z?" which are similar in cognitive demand.

**Revisiting the Rubric's Impact:**

The rubric states: "Mentions two correct natural resources (e.g., water, Marble, Copper, Sandstone, Gypsum, mica, limestone, zinc, salt, Sunlight for solar energy, Wind for wind energy). Max score: 1".

This is *critical*. If a student gets full marks (1) just by naming two resources, then the "explain how one of them influences the lives..." part of the question is *ignored* for scoring purposes. This drastically reduces the difficulty.

**Assuming the rubric dictates the actual scoring criteria, and only naming two resources is needed for "correctness":**

*   **Prior Knowledge:** Knowledge of common resources in Rajasthan. Many students would know water and maybe a mineral like marble or copper, or even salt.
*   **Language Demands:** Very low.
