Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty for Class 8 Indian government school students, followed by an estimate:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students are expected to know about the Battle of Plassey (1757) as a significant historical event. This is a core topic in Indian history for Class 8, usually covered in textbooks. They should have learned about the key players (British East India Company, Nawab of Bengal, Mir Jafar) and the outcome.
    *   **Less Assumed (but helpful):** A nuanced understanding of "British power" expanding beyond mere trade to political dominance. The concept of a "puppet nawab" might be introduced, but its full implications might not be deeply grasped by all.

2.  **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Contribute," "expansion," "political dominance," "puppet nawab" are key terms. "Contribute" and "expansion" are fairly common and would likely be understood within a historical context. "Political dominance" and "puppet nawab" are more specific historical terms.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The question is straightforward in its structure: "How did X contribute to Y?" This is a direct cause-and-effect inquiry.
    *   **Challenge:** For students with very limited English, even common words can pose a barrier. While "Battle of Plassey" and "1757" are proper nouns they'd recognize, interpreting "contribute to the expansion of British power" requires understanding the abstract concepts involved, not just recalling facts. They might understand "British power grew" but struggle to articulate *how*.
    *   **Rubric's language:** The rubric uses terms like "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal" and "placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab." Students would need to express similar concepts in their own words.

3.  **Nature of the Task (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   This question is primarily **recall with an element of causal reasoning**. Students need to recall the outcome of Plassey and then articulate the *causal link* between that outcome and the expansion of British power. It's not just "What happened at Plassey?" (recall) but "How did it *lead to* something else?" (causal reasoning).
    *   It's a step beyond simple factual recall, requiring them to connect events and explain their significance.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical:** Many textbook exercises at this level would ask "When was the Battle of Plassey fought?" (recall), "Who fought in the Battle of Plassey?" (recall), or "What was the result of the Battle of Plassey?" (simple recall of outcome).
    *   **This question's challenge:** It requires them to synthesize that recalled information and explain its *consequence* or *impact*. It's a "why/how" question, which is generally harder than a "who/what/when/where" question. It moves from describing an event to explaining its historical significance.
    *   The rubric's expectation (political dominance/puppet nawab) is exactly the kind of higher-order understanding that social science aims for, but it's not always easy for students to articulate.

**Specific Difficulties for This Cohort:**

*   **English as a barrier:** Even if they know the history in Hindi, translating and formulating the answer accurately in English is a significant hurdle. They might have a fragmented understanding of "British power" rather than a clear concept of political dominance.
*   **Conceptual understanding:** "Political dominance" or "puppet nawab" requires understanding abstract power dynamics, which can be challenging for this age group, especially if their foundational general knowledge is weaker.
*   **Articulating causality:** Explaining *how* something contributed is harder than stating *what* happened. They might know Mir Jafar became Nawab, but linking that explicitly to British political control takes more sophisticated understanding.

**Factors that might make it easier:**

*   It's a very prominent event in Class 8 history.
*   The "cause and effect" aspect is a common theme in history lessons.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 15-20%**

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

*   **Average pass rate (29%):** This question is harder than an average recall item.
*   **English language barrier:** This will significantly reduce the number of correct answers, even from students who have the historical knowledge in their native language. They might struggle to convey the nuance of "political dominance" or "puppet nawab" in English.
*   **Causal reasoning required:**
