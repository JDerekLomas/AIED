Let's break down the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their background.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geographical Knowledge:** Students are expected to have a basic understanding of India's geography, specifically the concept of "mountain ranges" and some awareness of the names of prominent ones within the country. This knowledge is usually introduced in Class 5 and heavily emphasized in Class 6 Social Science (Geography section).
    *   **Vocabulary:** They need to understand "major," "mountain ranges," and "located in India."
    *   **Recall:** This is purely a recall question. They need to retrieve names from memory.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Simplicity:** The question's English is extremely simple and direct: "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India." There are no complex sentence structures, idioms, or difficult vocabulary.
    *   **Cognate Advantage:** "Mountain" is a common word, and "India" is their country. "Ranges" might be slightly less common but is generally understood in the context of mountains.
    *   **Hindi-medium context:** While the question is in English, the content (names of mountain ranges) is heavily taught in Hindi in Hindi-medium schools. Students will learn these names (e.g., हिमालय, अरावली, विंध्य, सतपुड़ा, पश्चिमी घाट, पूर्वी घाट) and often associate them with their English equivalents even if they don't fluently speak English. They are likely to be able to *write* these names in English even if their pronunciation is not perfect.
    *   **Translation:** It's a question that can be easily translated mentally or verbally by a teacher/peer if a student struggles, but the question itself is simple enough that many would grasp it directly.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** This is a straightforward recall question. There is no application of concepts or complex reasoning required. Students either know the names or they don't.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Easier to Medium:** This is a very common type of question found in end-of-chapter exercises or quick checks in Class 6 Social Science textbooks. "Name two..." or "List three..." are standard formats.
    *   **Core Content:** Identifying major physical features of India is fundamental Class 6 geography. Mountain ranges like the Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, and Satpura are among the very first and most emphasized features taught.
    *   **High Salience:** The Himalayas are globally famous and taught extensively. The other major ranges are also central to Indian geography.
    *   **Compared to average pass rate (29%):** Given the simplicity of language and the direct recall of core geographical content, this question should perform significantly better than the average item on an exam that likely includes more complex English, application-based questions, or more nuanced social science concepts.

**Factors making it easier:**

1.  **Direct Recall:** No inference or complex processing needed.
2.  **Simple English:** Minimal language barrier.
3.  **Core Curriculum:** Names of major Indian mountain ranges are foundational Class 6 geography.
4.  **Multiple Correct Answers:** Students only need to name *any two* out of several prominent options, increasing their chances of success.
5.  **High Emphasis in Teaching:** These topics are often drilled in classrooms.
6.  **Rubric Lenience:** Naming just *one* correct range gets 0.5 points, which is a lenient scoring approach for this type of question. Even if they miss the "two" instruction, they can still get partial credit.

**Factors making it harder (relatively minor):**

1.  **Memory Recall Failure:** Some students might simply forget the names, especially if their foundational knowledge is weak.
2.  **Writing in English:** While they might know the names in Hindi, accurately spelling them in English could be a minor hurdle for some, though phonetic attempts are often accepted.

**Conclusion:**

This is a very accessible question for Class 6 students who have received basic instruction in Indian geography. The language is simple, the content is fundamental and highly emphasized, and there are multiple correct answers. The "any two" instruction, coupled with the lenient rubric (0.5 for one correct), makes it even more achievable. It targets knowledge that would have been recently covered and revised.
