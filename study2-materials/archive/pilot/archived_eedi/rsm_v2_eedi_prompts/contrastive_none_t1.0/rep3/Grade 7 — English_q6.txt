Let's break down the question "Describes the poet's writing style" for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their background.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Understanding of "poet," "writing," and "style." This requires exposure to poetry and the concept that writers have distinct ways of writing. They would have encountered poems in their Hindi textbooks, but perhaps the analytical concept of "writing style" isn't explicitly taught or discussed in depth at this level.
    *   **Likely Gap:** The analytical framework to *identify* and *label* a "writing style." While they might instinctively understand that one poem feels different from another, formalizing this into terms like "descriptive," "simple," "informal" might be new. They might know *what* a style is, but not *how to articulate it* using specific English adjectives. They might be familiar with *poetic devices* in Hindi (like *alankar* - metaphors, similes), but not the overarching "style."
    *   **Crucial Missing Piece:** The question doesn't *provide* the poem. This is critical. To describe a poet's writing style, they need the text itself. If this question is isolated without context, it's impossible to answer meaningfully. Assuming this question *follows* a poem they've just read, then the prior knowledge is about analyzing *that specific poem*.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   **Key Vocabulary:**
        *   "Describes": A common verb, likely understood.
        *   "Poet's": Possessive form, probably understood.
        *   "Writing style": This is the most demanding phrase. "Writing" is known. "Style" in this context (manner or way of expression) is more abstract than "style" meaning fashion. "Writing style" as a combined concept requires a nuanced understanding.
    *   **Grammatical Structure:** Simple declarative sentence. Low grammatical complexity.
    *   **Limited English Proficiency Impact:** Even if they understand "describe" and "poet," the phrase "writing style" is where many will falter. They might think "style" refers to the *topic* or *message* of the poem, rather than *how* it's written. Furthermore, generating an appropriate *English adjective* (e.g., simple, descriptive, informal) is a significant hurdle. They might have a word in Hindi for a particular style but struggle to find the English equivalent, especially one that fits the rubric. They might describe the *content* instead of the *style*.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application** and **Reasoning**.
        *   **Application:** Apply their understanding of what "writing style" means to the provided poem.
        *   **Reasoning:** Analyze the poem to discern its characteristics and then select an appropriate adjective to describe those characteristics.
    *   It is NOT recall, as there's no factual information to retrieve directly.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Higher Difficulty:** Typical Class 7 English textbook exercises in government schools often focus on:
        *   Literal comprehension (e.g., "What did the boy do?").
        *   Vocabulary (matching words, filling in blanks).
        *   Grammar (tenses, parts of speech).
        *   Simple sentence construction.
    *   **Analytical Gap:** Asking students to *analyze* a text for its "writing style" and then *articulate* that analysis with a precise English adjective goes beyond basic comprehension. It demands critical thinking about literary elements, which is often introduced later or in a less formal way in Hindi literature classes, but rarely in English at this level in the specific analytical terms expected here.
    *   The rubric's examples ("simple, descriptive, informal, direct") are abstract concepts that require a certain level of meta-linguistic awareness.

**Combined Analysis & Estimate:**

*   **Positive Factors:** The core verbs are fairly simple. If the poem is very straightforward, some students might grasp "simple" or "direct."
*   **Negative Factors:**
    *   The absence of the poem makes this question unanswerable in its current form. *Assuming* a preceding poem, the difficulty remains.
    *   "Writing style" is an abstract, analytical concept that is likely not explicitly taught or practiced in English at this level.
    *   Generating suitable English adjectives for an analytical purpose is a high language demand for students with limited proficiency. They might have the concept in Hindi but not the English vocabulary.
    *   The average pass rate of 29% suggests a general difficulty with the exam. This question, being
