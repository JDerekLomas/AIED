Let's break down the question "Who lived inside the book?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering the context provided.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Direct:** The student must have read the specific passage or story from which this question is drawn. Without the context of the story, this question is unanswerable.
    *   **Indirect:** Basic understanding of narrative structure (characters, setting), the concept of "living inside" a place (even if metaphorical for a book character).
    *   **General World Knowledge:** No complex general knowledge is needed, beyond understanding what a "book" is.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Who": Very common interrogative pronoun, likely known.
        *   "lived": Past tense of "live," a basic verb. Likely known.
        *   "inside": Common preposition, likely known.
        *   "the book": Common noun, definitely known.
        *   **Key Vocabulary for the Answer:** The answer "magical fairy" is where the potential difficulty lies.
            *   "Magical": Might be known or inferable from context, but could be tricky if unfamiliar.
            *   "Fairy": A relatively common word in children's stories, but not necessarily a core academic vocabulary word. Its recognition depends heavily on exposure to such stories in English or its Hindi equivalent.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple "Wh-" question. Very common and easily parsable.
    *   **Conceptual Understanding:** The phrase "lived inside the book" is straightforward. It doesn't present abstract or metaphorical challenges beyond the normal understanding of characters existing within a story's world.
    *   **Output:** Students need to recall and produce specific nouns/adjectives. This requires accurate recall of the name of the character.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily a **recall** question. The student needs to remember a specific detail (the character's identity) directly stated or strongly implied in the preceding text.
    *   It's not an application question as it doesn't require applying a rule or concept.
    *   It's not a reasoning question as it doesn't require inferring or drawing conclusions beyond direct retrieval.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Lower to Medium Difficulty (for recall):** Questions asking "Who," "What," "When," "Where" about directly stated facts in a passage are common and usually among the easier types of reading comprehension questions.
    *   **Dependency on Passage Difficulty:** The actual difficulty hinges almost entirely on:
        *   How clearly the information ("A magical fairy lived inside the book") was stated in the preceding text.
        *   How much other information was presented alongside it, potentially distracting or overwhelming students.
        *   The overall length and complexity of the passage.
    *   **Vocabulary Trap:** If "magical" or "fairy" were not common words in the passage itself or its overall theme, and the students primarily operate in Hindi, recalling these specific English terms could be a hurdle even if they understood the character's nature in Hindi. However, if the passage itself uses these words repeatedly, it becomes much easier.
    *   **Rubric:** The rubric is lenient ("Accept: 'a magical fairy', 'fairy'"). This helps, as students don't need to recall the adjective "magical" if they just remember the core character "fairy."

**Considering the Context:**

*   **Economically Weaker Sections, Hindi-medium, Limited English:** This is the most crucial factor.
    *   While "who," "lived," "inside," "book" are basic, "fairy" (and especially "magical") might be less familiar vocabulary for students who primarily learn in Hindi and have limited exposure to English children's literature or media. They might know the concept in Hindi (परी - 'pari'), but struggle with the English word.
    *   The "average pass rate across items is about 29%" suggests that many questions are indeed challenging. A simple recall question *could* be easier, but the specific vocabulary for the answer is a potential stumbling block.
    *   If the preceding text was well-written, with simple sentences and clear identification of the fairy, and perhaps repeated the term "fairy," the students' chances increase. If it was buried in complex sentences or a long paragraph, it decreases.
    *   The question assumes prior reading of the text. If students didn't read or understand the preceding text due to other English comprehension challenges, this question becomes impossible, regardless of its individual simplicity.
