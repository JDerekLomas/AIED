Let's break down the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their typical background.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Poetry Comprehension:** Students need to have read and understood the *given* poem. This is a crucial prerequisite. If they didn't understand the poem itself, answering this question becomes impossible.
    *   **Basic English Vocabulary:** They need to understand "line," "poem," "like," "most," "why." These are relatively common words for Class 6, but "why" can be challenging for some in constructing a response.
    *   **Opinion Formation:** The question requires them to form and express a personal opinion. This is a higher-order skill than simple recall.
    *   **Justification:** They need to provide a reason ("why"). This requires analytical thinking and the ability to articulate a connection between their preference and something specific in the line or poem.

*   **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   **Understanding the Question:** The individual words are fairly common. The structure "Which X do you like most and why?" is a common question pattern. However, constructing a *written* answer explaining "why" in English will be a significant hurdle for many.
    *   **Expressing an Opinion:** "I like..." is a simple sentence, but articulating *why* can be very difficult. They might struggle to find the right descriptive words or connect cause and effect in English. For example, if they like a line because it "makes them feel happy," they might struggle to translate "makes me feel happy" into correct English. They might just say "it is good."
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Students might provide very short, fragmented answers for the "why" part, or revert to simpler Hindi thought patterns translated directly into broken English.
    *   **Vocabulary for Justification:** They'd need vocabulary to describe emotions, imagery, themes, or personal connections. This is often weak in students with limited English.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Reasoning** and **Application**.
        *   **Recall:** They need to recall lines from the poem.
        *   **Application:** They need to apply their understanding of the poem and their personal preferences.
        *   **Reasoning:** They need to reason *why* they prefer a particular line, connecting it to meaning, imagery, or personal impact. This is not a direct recall of facts.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Higher Difficulty:** Typical Class 6 textbook exercises often focus on:
        *   Direct recall questions (e.g., "Who is the main character?").
        *   Finding specific information from the text.
        *   True/False, Fill-in-the-blanks.
        *   Simple vocabulary matching.
    *   This question requires **synthesis, personal reflection, and justification**, which are more complex. While some textbooks might include "think and discuss" questions, writing a coherent answer in English for this type of question is generally more challenging than standard exercises. The "why" part is particularly difficult.
    *   The rubric's requirement to "mention why" means a simple "I like line X" would not get full marks.

**Synthesis of Difficulty Factors:**

The biggest hurdles are:
1.  **Understanding the poem itself:** If the poem's language is complex, this question immediately becomes harder. (We don't have the poem, so this is a crucial unknown, but we assume it's Class 6 appropriate).
2.  **Articulating the "why" in grammatically correct and meaningful English:** This is a major challenge for students with limited English. They might know *why* in their minds but struggle to express it. Many might just write "it is good" or "I like it," which might not fully satisfy the "mentions why" part of the rubric for full marks.

Considering the average pass rate across items is 29%, this question, with its demand for personal opinion and justification in English, is likely to be on the harder side of that average. Many will attempt it, but few will provide a sufficiently clear "why" to earn full credit under the rubric. They might identify a line, but their "why" might be too simplistic or poorly articulated to fully satisfy the rubric.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:** 20%

**Reasoning for 20%:**

*   **Identifying a line:** A good percentage of students (perhaps 50-60%) will be able to identify *a* line from the poem, demonstrating some basic comprehension.
