Let's break down the question "Describes the poet's writing style" for a Class 7 student in an Indian government school, considering the context provided.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Low Difficulty:** Students are expected to understand what a "poet" is and, more importantly, have just read a poem or a relevant passage from a poem. So, they have the *content* to describe.
    *   **Moderate Difficulty:** The core concept of "writing style" is what's tricky. Have they been explicitly taught about different writing styles (e.g., descriptive, narrative, persuasive) in the context of poetry or prose in their Hindi-medium curriculum? While they might intuitively grasp that different authors write differently, explicitly articulating a "style" might not be a common exercise. They might be more familiar with questions about themes, characters, or the literal meaning of lines.
    *   **Assumed understanding of 'describes':** This is a basic verb, likely understood.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **"Describes":** This is a fairly common verb and likely encountered. It should be understandable.
    *   **"Poet's":** "Poet" is a cognate or near-cognate in some Indian languages (e.g., "kavi" in Hindi), and the concept is universal. The possessive 's might be a small hurdle for some but generally manageable.
    *   **"Writing style":** This is the most significant lexical challenge.
        *   "Writing" is common.
        *   "Style" is the key. While "style" might be used in other contexts (e.g., fashion), its application to *writing* might be less familiar in an academic English context for these students. They might not have an equivalent direct translation or a concept that is regularly discussed in their Hindi literature classes as "writing style" in the same analytical way. They might think of it literally as handwriting rather than the literary manner.
        *   The rubric allows for "simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct." These are abstract adjectives. "Simple" might be the easiest to grasp. "Descriptive" requires understanding "describe" and then applying it as an adjective for a style. "Informal" and "direct" are more nuanced.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** and **reasoning**. It requires students to:
        1.  **Understand** the prompt (the hardest part due to "writing style").
        2.  **Recall** the poem/passage they just read.
        3.  **Analyze** that text to identify characteristics of how it was written.
        4.  **Synthesize** that analysis into a single descriptive word.
    *   It's not simple recall of facts. It requires an evaluative judgment based on textual evidence, which is a higher-order thinking skill.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 7 Hindi-medium English textbook exercises often focus on:
        *   Literal comprehension (e.g., "Who said this?", "What happened next?").
        *   Vocabulary (e.g., matching words, filling in blanks).
        *   Grammar (e.g., identifying parts of speech, tense changes).
        *   Simple summary or character description.
    *   Questions asking to describe "writing style" are **less common** and more advanced. They are more frequently found in higher grades or in more advanced literature studies. Students might be able to identify *what* the poet talks about or *how* they feel, but articulating *how* the poet expresses it (their style) is a different level of analysis.
    *   The open-ended nature of the answer ("Identifies a suitable and relevant word...") is also a challenge. They need to come up with the word themselves, not choose from options.

**Likely Challenges:**

1.  **Understanding "writing style":** This is the primary hurdle. Many students might misunderstand what is being asked and provide answers related to the poem's theme, content, or their feelings about it, rather than its stylistic elements. They might even try to describe the poet's handwriting if they misinterpret "style."
2.  **Lack of specific vocabulary:** Even if they understand the concept, they might lack the English vocabulary to describe a writing style effectively (e.g., "descriptive," "simple," "narrative," "lyrical"). "Simple" might be the most accessible, but even then, it's an abstract concept.
3.  **Analytical skills:** While they can understand the literal meaning of a poem, analyzing *how
