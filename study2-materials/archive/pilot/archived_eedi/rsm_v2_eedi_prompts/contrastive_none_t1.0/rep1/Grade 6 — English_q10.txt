Let's break down the question for Class 6 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic understanding of nouns (apples, basket).
    *   Basic sentence structure (subject-verb-object).
    *   Crucially, an understanding of countable nouns.
    *   The core knowledge required is the usage rule for "some" and "any." Specifically, "some" for affirmative statements and "any" for negative statements or questions. This is a grammatical rule.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Apples" and "basket" are very common, basic English words, likely familiar even to students with limited English, especially if they have some exposure to textbook English or basic spoken English. "Are" and "in" are also fundamental.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** "There are... in the basket" is a simple, common sentence structure used for existence. It's not complex.
    *   **Grammar Point:** This is where the difficulty lies. Differentiating "some" and "any" is a specific grammatical rule. While the words themselves are short and common, understanding *when* to use which requires explicit instruction and practice. For someone whose primary language is Hindi, the direct translation of "some" (कुछ - *kuchh*) and "any" (कोई भी - *koi bhi*, कोई - *koi*) doesn't perfectly map the grammatical usage in English regarding affirmative/negative contexts. They might use "kuchh" in situations where "any" would be used in English questions, for instance. This can lead to interference.
    *   **Reading Comprehension:** The sentence itself is very short and clear. The "Choose the correct word" instruction is also straightforward.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   This is primarily an **application** task, but it relies heavily on **recall** of a specific grammatical rule. Students need to recall the rule for "some" vs. "any" and then apply it to an affirmative sentence. There's not much high-level reasoning involved beyond applying a learned rule.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This type of question (fill-in-the-blank with "some/any") is **extremely common** in English language textbooks for this age group, both in India and globally. It's a foundational grammar point typically introduced early when discussing quantities and existence.
    *   It's generally considered an entry-level grammar exercise. It's less complex than sentence transformation, error identification, or tasks requiring extensive vocabulary.
    *   However, given the context of "limited English proficiency," what might be "easy" for a native speaker or a student in a private English-medium school becomes more challenging. If their teachers haven't explicitly taught this rule or if they haven't had sufficient practice, they might guess or rely on intuition that could be influenced by their native language. The average pass rate of 29% suggests that even basic English items are challenging.

**Synthesizing the Difficulty:**

The question uses simple vocabulary and sentence structure. The core challenge lies entirely in the specific grammatical rule of "some" vs. "any" for affirmative sentences. While a foundational topic, it requires explicit instruction and practice. The low average pass rate across items suggests that even such basic grammatical rules might not be universally mastered due to limited exposure and teaching resources. Students might struggle if they haven't been drilled on this specific distinction, or if their Hindi syntax interferes. It's not a trick question, but it's a test of a specific learned grammar point.

Given the "limited English proficiency" and the "average pass rate across items is about 29%," a question testing a specific grammatical rule, even a basic one, is unlikely to significantly exceed that average unless it's exceptionally simple. While easier than many items, it's not universally intuitive.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **35%**
