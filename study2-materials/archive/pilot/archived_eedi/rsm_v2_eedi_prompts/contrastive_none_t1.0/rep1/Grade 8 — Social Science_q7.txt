Let's break down the question for Class 8 students in Indian government schools.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students should have covered the Battle of Plassey (1757) in their Class 8 Social Science (History) curriculum. This is a foundational event in the Indian independence struggle narrative. They should know *what* it was (a battle) and *when* it was (1757). They might also recall key figures like Robert Clive and Mir Jafar, and the British East India Company.
    *   **Less Certain:** A deeper understanding of "expansion of British power" as a concept, beyond just winning a battle, might be less solidified. They might know the *fact* but struggle with the *implication*.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Key terms:** "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "British power," "India" are fairly straightforward and likely encountered in textbooks, even if the primary medium is Hindi (these terms are often transliterated or learned as proper nouns).
    *   **Challenging phrases:** "contribute to the expansion of..." is the most demanding part. "Contribute" implies cause and effect, and "expansion" requires understanding a process of growth in influence or territory. For students with limited English, "expansion" might be understood simply as "increase" but the nuance of political and territorial expansion might be lost. They might grasp "British power became more" but struggle to articulate *how*.
    *   **Rubric language:** The rubric requires "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)." This specific vocabulary ("political dominance," "puppet nawab") might be too advanced for many to reproduce in English, even if they grasp the concept in Hindi. They might describe Mir Jafar being put in charge by the British, but not necessarily use the term "puppet."

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Identifying the Battle of Plassey and its immediate outcome (British victory) is recall.
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** Explaining *how* it "contributed to the expansion of British power" requires a degree of application or reasoning. It's not just "what happened?" but "what was the *consequence* in the larger picture?" This moves beyond simple factual recall to understanding the significance and impact. The rubric demands this deeper understanding of political control.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 8 textbook exercises often include questions like: "When was the Battle of Plassey fought?" or "Who fought in the Battle of Plassey?" or "What was the immediate result of the Battle of Plassey?" These are direct recall.
    *   This question, by asking "How did it *contribute* to the *expansion* of British power?", is slightly more analytical and inferential. It requires students to link an event to its long-term consequence and political significance, which is a step beyond basic factual recall. While the information might be present in the text (e.g., "After Plassey, the British gained control over Bengal"), articulating it as a "contribution to the expansion of power" requires processing that information. The specific example of Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab would likely be mentioned, but articulating it as an example of "political dominance" is the challenge.

**Synthesis of Difficulty:**

The question itself is on a core topic. The "what" and "when" are easy. The "how" and "to what effect" make it harder. The English language demand, particularly around "contribute to the expansion of," "political dominance," and "puppet nawab" (as articulated in the rubric), significantly increases the difficulty for students with limited English proficiency. Many might know *that* the British got more powerful in Bengal after Plassey, and *that* Mir Jafar was made Nawab by them, but struggle to formulate this answer precisely in English to meet the rubric's specific demands for "political dominance/control."

Given the average pass rate of 29% for the exam generally, and the higher cognitive demand and significant language barrier for this specific question, I expect it to be below the average. Students might recall snippets but fail to provide a cohesive, correctly articulated answer in English that fully satisfies the rubric. They might say "British won and got more power in Bengal" but miss the "political dominance" or "puppet nawab" detail needed for a full mark.
