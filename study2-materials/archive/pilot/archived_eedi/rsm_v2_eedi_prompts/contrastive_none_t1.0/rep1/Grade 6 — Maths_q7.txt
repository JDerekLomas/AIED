Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the context provided.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition, multiplication.
*   **Time:** Understanding am/pm, telling time, calculating duration between two times (e.g., 10 am to 4 pm). This is crucial and often taught in Class 4/5.
*   **Units:** Understanding degrees Celsius for temperature.
*   **Word Problems:** Ability to extract numerical information and the operation required from a text.

**Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**

*   "At 10 am in the morning": Fairly straightforward. "Morning" reinforces "am."
*   "temperature of Jodhpur was 30°C": "Temperature" might be a new or less common word for some, but the context with "30°C" usually makes it clear.
*   "If the temperature increases by 2°C per hour": "Increases" is key, indicating addition. "Per hour" means for each hour. This phrase is critical and could be a point of confusion.
*   "then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?": "What will be" implies future, "evening" reinforces "pm."
*   **Overall:** The language is relatively simple and direct for a word problem. The core vocabulary ("temperature," "increases," "per hour") might be slightly challenging for a student with very low English proficiency, but the numbers and context often help. The most common errors would likely stem from misunderstanding "increases by X per hour" or miscalculating the time duration.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   **Application:** This is a direct application of arithmetic concepts (addition, multiplication) and time calculation in a practical word problem context. It doesn't require deep reasoning or novel problem-solving strategies, but rather applying learned procedures.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Moderate Difficulty:**
    *   **Easier aspects:** The numbers are small and whole. The operations are basic (addition, multiplication). The concept of temperature change over time is relatable.
    *   **Harder aspects:** The multi-step nature (calculating duration, then multiplying, then adding) is where students often falter. Calculating the time from 10 am to 4 pm, especially if they are unfamiliar with converting pm to 24-hour format or just doing simple count-up, can be a hurdle. Typical textbook exercises often break these steps down or provide simpler time intervals. This question requires combining two distinct skills: time duration and rate-based change.

**Contrastive Analysis Summary:**

*   **Strengths (making it easier):** Simple numbers, direct operations, common real-world scenario.
*   **Weaknesses (making it harder):** Multi-step problem, calculating time duration (10 am to 4 pm) is a crucial intermediate step that isn't explicitly given, potential for misinterpreting "per hour" or "increases." Language barrier, while present, is not as severe as it could be for more abstract concepts. The "rubric" focuses solely on the time calculation, implying this is the *main* expected hurdle, followed by the arithmetic.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%):**

This question feels like it would be *slightly above* the average difficulty for these students, mainly due to the multi-step nature and the implicit time calculation. Students who get stuck on calculating the time duration (10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours) will not be able to proceed. Those who get the duration might still make arithmetic errors.

*   A significant portion might calculate the time correctly as 6 hours. (e.g., 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 - that's 6 hours).
*   Then, 6 hours * 2°C/hour = 12°C increase.
*   Finally, 30°C + 12°C = 42°C.

The common errors would likely be:
1.  Incorrect time duration (e.g., 5 hours, 7 hours, or even just doing 4-10 = -6 or 10-4=6 without understanding am/pm).
2.  Multiplying by 10 or 4 instead of the duration.
3.  Forgetting to add the initial temperature.
4.  Adding 2 to 30 without considering the hours.

Given the average pass rate of 29%, a question that requires two distinct but fundamental mathematical skills (time duration + rate calculation) will likely be around that mark, perhaps a bit
