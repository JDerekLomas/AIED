Let's break down the question and its demands on a typical Class 7 student in an Indian government school from an economically weaker section, with limited English proficiency.

**Question:** Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason.

**Rubric:** The king wanted to answer (based on the reading passage) the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with. Any valid reason. Max score: 1

---

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Passage Comprehension:** The most crucial prior knowledge is the understanding of the preceding passage where the king asks these three questions (what is the right time, who are the most important people, what is the most important thing to do). If the student hasn't grasped the core content of the passage, they won't understand "the king's questions." This is a significant hurdle given their English proficiency.
    *   **General World Knowledge:** The concepts of "importance," "real life," and "reason" are relatively fundamental. Students, even with limited education, would have a basic understanding of these concepts in their own language.
    *   **Critical Thinking/Opinion Formation:** The question asks for an opinion and a reason, which requires a basic level of critical thinking beyond mere recall.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Do you think": Fairly common, might be understood.
        *   "king's questions": If "king" and "questions" are understood individually, the compound might be inferred, especially after reading a story about a king asking questions.
        *   "important": A common adjective, likely encountered.
        *   "real life": This phrase is moderately complex. Students might understand "real" and "life" separately, but the idiomatic combination might be challenging for some, potentially interpreted as "my life" or "actual life" rather than "in general."
        *   "Give one reason": Straightforward command.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** "Do you think X is Y? Give Z." This is a relatively simple interrogative and imperative structure.
    *   **Translational Challenge:** The core meaning of the king's questions (right time, right people, right thing) is likely quite abstract and philosophical even in Hindi. Translating and grasping these concepts fully in English would be very difficult. The difficulty isn't just word-for-word translation, but understanding the *implication* of those questions.
    *   **Answering in English:** Even if they understand the question's intent, formulating a *valid reason* in grammatically correct and coherent English to earn the point is a substantial challenge. They might have the thought in Hindi but struggle to express it.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   It's primarily **reasoning/application** based on prior **passage comprehension**. It's not a direct recall of facts from the passage.
    *   Students need to:
        1.  Recall/understand what "the king's questions" refer to (from the passage).
        2.  Understand the meaning of "important in real life."
        3.  Formulate an opinion (Yes/No, though "Yes" is almost implicitly expected).
        4.  Provide a valid justification for their opinion in English.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Typical Textbook Exercises (English Medium):** Might involve direct recall ("Who was the king?"), simple factual answers ("What were the three questions?"), or basic comprehension ("Why did the king want answers?"). This question goes a step further by asking for a personal opinion and justification.
    *   **Typical Textbook Exercises (Hindi Medium):** Similar questions might appear in Hindi, where students would be much more comfortable expressing their reasoned opinions.
    *   **Compared to the average pass rate (29%):** This question is likely *more difficult* than the average item. The 29% average probably includes easier recall questions or simpler vocabulary items. This question layers passage comprehension, abstract concepts, opinion formation, and expression in a second language.

**Specific Difficulties for this Cohort:**

*   **Abstract Nature:** The king's questions themselves (right time, right people, right thing) are quite philosophical. Understanding their *real-life importance* requires a level of abstract thinking that, while present, is hard to express in a limited second language.
*   **Formulating a "Reason":** This is the biggest hurdle for earning the point. A student might genuinely *feel* the questions are important, but translating that feeling into a coherent, relevant English sentence like "Because making the right
