I will consider the provided pass rates and the student demographics.

*   **Average pass rate (29%):** This is a general indicator of the overall difficulty.
*   **English proficiency:** Students have "limited English."
*   **Economic background:** "Economically weaker sections."
*   **Common issues:** "Basic" concepts not basic, exam anxiety leading to blanks, lack of practice with specific question types.
*   **Teacher overestimation:** Teachers/experts tend to overestimate performance.

Let's look at the calibration anchors:

*   **5% (Theme of a poem):** Very difficult, requires nuanced comprehension and expression in English.
*   **15% (Differentiate historical sources):** Requires conceptual understanding, classification, and examples. More factual recall than deep comprehension.
*   **30% (Paragraph on favorite season):** Open-ended writing, personal opinion. Allows for simple English and relies less on specific learned content.
*   **50% (Three questions king wanted to answer):** Specific factual recall from a story, likely memorized or easily located if the story was known.
*   **66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Very high recall of specific, foundational civic knowledge. This is likely repeatedly drilled.

The question "Define fable" requires:

1.  **Understanding "define":** This is a common instruction, but students with limited English might struggle to provide a formal definition.
2.  **Recall of the concept "fable":** While "fable" is a relatively common literary term, whether it's explicitly taught and understood in detail in government schools for Class 8 students with limited English is debatable. Many might recognize a fable without being able to define it.
3.  **Expressing the definition in English:** The rubric requires two key elements: "short story, animals as characters, and imparts a moral lesson." This is a multi-part definition.

Comparing it to anchors:

*   It's **less open-ended** than "My favorite season" (30%) but requires more precise factual recall and structured English than just listing three items (like the 50% anchor).
*   It's **more complex** than simply listing two rights (66%) because it requires synthesizing multiple attributes into a coherent definition.
*   It's **less abstract** than finding a "theme" (5%), but more abstract than simple "differentiation" by example (15%).

My initial instinct might be 35-40%, thinking "fable" is a common term. However, applying the cautionary notes:

*   "Limited English" makes a multi-part definition challenging. They might know some parts but struggle to formulate it correctly.
*   "Basic concepts aren't basic": Many students might know what a fable *is* (i.e., they recognize examples) but have never learned to formally *define* it using the specific criteria in the rubric.
*   Exam anxiety: Leads to partial or incorrect answers even if they have some knowledge.

The pass rate for a similar question (defining a specific term, especially with multiple criteria) might be closer to the lower end of the anchors for factual recall, particularly when requiring a coherent sentence in English. If students just put "animal story," that might not get full credit according to the rubric's specifics ("imparts a moral lesson").

The 50% anchor was simple recall of specific items. The 15% anchor required differentiation. Defining a complex term falls in between. The added constraint of *imparting a moral lesson* means just "story with animals" won't suffice for a full score (which the max score of 1 implies for this rubric).

Let's think of how students would approach this:
*   "Story animals" (maybe part correct)
*   "Animal story lesson" (better, possibly correct)
*   Blank (due to anxiety or not knowing how to formulate)
*   Something completely off-topic (misunderstanding the word "fable" or "define")

Considering the limitations, the specific criteria in the rubric (animals + moral lesson), and the language barrier for a formal definition, it's quite challenging. It's likely many will miss one of the key elements or fail to phrase it clearly enough.

Therefore, it should be below the 50% mark and possibly below the 30% mark given the demand for a specific, multi-part definition rather than just personal expression. I would place it somewhere between the differentiation question (15%) and the paragraph writing (30%).

Let's go for slightly above the 15% anchor, given it's a more common literary term, but significantly below the factual recall of a specific story's questions or fundamental rights.

Revised estimation: Many would recognize "
