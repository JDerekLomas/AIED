I will analyze the question and rubric against the provided calibration anchors and student characteristics.

**Question Analysis:**
*   "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."
*   This requires factual recall and the ability to articulate a description in English.
*   "Key feature" implies selecting from a few core characteristics taught in the curriculum.
*   "Urban planning" is a relatively specific historical concept.

**Student Profile (Class 8, Indian government schools, economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate 29%):**
*   **Limited English:** Students struggle with both comprehension of the question and articulation of the answer. Complex vocabulary or sentence structures in the answer are difficult.
*   **Factual Recall:** History is a subject that relies on memory. If they studied the Harappan Civilization, they might remember facts.
*   **"Basic" Concepts:** While Harappan Civilization is a standard topic, the specific concept of "urban planning" and its "key features" might not be deeply understood or remembered, especially by students who struggle.
*   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** As noted in the prompt, this significantly reduces pass rates.
*   **Absent for topic:** Another factor reducing performance.

**Rubric:**
*   "Correctly describes one key feature, such as the well-planned grid layout of streets, the advanced drainage system, the use of baked bricks, or the division of the city into a citadel and a lower town."
*   This is lenient: *any* one of several correct points suffices. Simple phrases or short sentences could earn the point.

**Calibration Anchors Analysis:**

*   **5% Pass Rate:** "Theme or central idea of the poem." Very abstract, requires interpretation and good English expression. Difficult.
*   **15% Pass Rate:** "Differentiate archaeological and literary sources + 1 example each." More factual, but requires understanding *differentiation* and giving two examples. Still a bit complex for struggling English speakers. Example responses show ability to give definitions or bullet points, but not always complete differentiation.
*   **30% Pass Rate:** "Short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season." Very personal, accessible vocabulary, but requires structuring a *paragraph* and answering multiple prompts. Pass examples show short sentences, often just lists of words.
*   **50% Pass Rate:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" Pure factual recall from a story. If they knew the story, it's easy. If not, impossible. The example answer shows that recall of even a phrase gets the point.
*   **66% Pass Rate:** "Name any two Fundamental Rights." Pure factual recall. Naming is easier than describing. Two specific facts. Even partially correct responses (e.g., "Right to freedom") count.

**Applying Calibration to the Question:**

*   **Factual Recall:** Similar to the 50% (King's questions) and 66% (Fundamental Rights) items in its reliance on recall. Harappan Civilization is a core Class 8 history topic.
*   **Complexity of Answer:** It requires *describing* one feature, which is slightly more complex than *naming* two (66% item) but less abstract than interpreting a poem (5% item). It's simpler than differentiating two types of sources (15% item) because only one point is needed. It's much simpler than writing a 6-8 line paragraph (30% item).
*   **Lenient Rubric:** A short, somewhat broken English phrase (e.g., "grid system roads" or "good drainage system" or even "bricks for houses") should theoretically pass if it conveys the idea. This is crucial for students with limited English.

Considering these points:
*   The topic (Harappan Civilization) is standard, increasing the chances of *some* students having studied it.
*   The need to "describe" is the main hurdle compared to "naming." However, the rubric shows that a very simple description is acceptable.
*   Students' limited English and high anxiety are the biggest deterrents, pulling the score down. Many might leave it blank or write something completely irrelevant, as seen in the 0-point calibration anchors.

Let's compare it more closely to anchors:
*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%):** This requires exact recall of phrases. If they remember, it's easy. "Grid system" or "drainage" for Harappan civ are single key phrases. The "describing" part for Harappan is perhaps *slightly* harder than simply quoting phrases, but if they know "drainage system," writing "They have good drainage system" is close.
*   **"Name any two
