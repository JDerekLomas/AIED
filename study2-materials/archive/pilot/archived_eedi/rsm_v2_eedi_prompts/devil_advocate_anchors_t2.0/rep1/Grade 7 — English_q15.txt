I'll calibrate my estimate based on the provided anchor items and the student characteristics.

*   **Average Pass Rate (29%):** This is the baseline.
*   **English Fluency:** Many students have very limited English. This means complex sentences or nuanced expression will be difficult.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** Even simple writing prompts can be challenging if students haven't practiced them extensively or struggle with generating ideas in English.
*   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** This consistently lowers scores.
*   **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** While "My Favorite Season" is similar, a paragraph on "My Favorite Hobby" requires recalling and organizing personal information in English, which isn't always easy.

Let's look at similar anchor items:

*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season." Talk about what you like to do, what you eat or wear, and w**
    *   This is the *most* directly comparable. Students scored 30%. The rubric for 'My Favourite Hobby' is slightly simpler (4-5 sentences, max score 1), but the underlying task (generate a personal paragraph in English) is very similar. The "My Favorite Season" prompt asked for more details (what you like to do, eat, wear).
    *   Example "Winter / Sweater / Baju / Hot water / Tea / Gever feali / Hat" shows very minimal English, yet scored 3. This indicates that a fragmented, list-like response *can* score. However, our hobby prompt is looking for a *complete paragraph* clearly mentioning the three elements, which might be a slightly higher bar than the list-style response from the "season" example.
    *   The 30% pass rate suggests that writing *any* coherent paragraph of this nature is challenging for the majority.

*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?**
    *   This required recall of specific factual information, often done by copying directly from text or recalling a memorized phrase. Less open-ended than a paragraph.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India.**
    *   Direct recall, likely memorized. Much simpler writing task.

**Comparison with "My Favorite Season" (30%):**

The "My Favorite Hobby" question is structurally very similar. It asks for a 4-5 sentence paragraph vs. 6-8 lines, which is a minor difference. The specific criteria (hobby, when, why) are clear.

Students who struggled with "My Favorite Season" often gave very short, fragmented, or incomplete answers. The examples from the 30% anchor show that even with clear instruction, a lot of students just list words or provide minimal context.

*   **Constraint of 4-5 sentences:** This forces some degree of paragraph structure.
*   **Clarity of what to include:** (hobby, when, why) helps students, but *expressing* those clearly in English is the hurdle.

Given that a prompt like "My Favorite Season" only yielded a 30% pass rate, and it seems slightly less demanding in terms of the structure required for a score, "My Favorite Hobby" could be slightly more difficult if the rubric truly demands a *complete paragraph* rather than just fragments or lists. However, a 'max score: 1' might mean the threshold for passing is relatively low, focusing on presence of key information more than perfect grammar or fluency.

If we assume the passing criteria are generous enough for students who can provide the three pieces of information, even in imperfect English or simple sentences, it might be slightly higher than the 30% from the "season" prompt which had more parts and was scored on a 3-point scale.

However, the "complete paragraph" part of the rubric is key. Many students might provide bullet points in effect or struggle to link sentences together meaningfully, making it fail the 'complete paragraph' criteria even if the information is present.

Considering the strong similarity to the 30% "My favorite season" item, and the potential for a slightly stricter interpretation of "complete paragraph" compared to just generating some content, I think the rate will be very close. If it's slightly easier because it's only 3 components and fewer sentences, it won't be dramatically easier.

I'll lean slightly below the "season" task due to the explicit paragraph structure requirement combined with limited English.
