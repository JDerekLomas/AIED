The question asks students to describe the poet's writing style. The rubric allows for a broad range of simple, relevant words. Given the student population and the calibration anchors, several factors will impact performance:

*   **Understanding "writing style":** This term itself might be challenging for students with limited English. They might know what "write" means but not "style" in this context.
*   **Recalling the poem:** To describe the style, students need to have a reasonable understanding of the poem (which is "The Last Bargain" from the 5% pass rate question, suggesting many struggled with its central idea). If they didn't grasp the content, describing its style will be very hard.
*   **Vocabulary:** Even if they understand "writing style" and the poem, can they articulate a suitable descriptor? "Simple" might be accessible, but "descriptive," "informal," or "direct" might not be.
*   **Question Type:** Describing literary elements like "writing style" is a more abstract task compared to recalling facts (like fundamental rights or the king's questions). This abstraction often trips up struggling learners.

Let's compare to the anchors:

*   **5% anchor ("theme or central idea"):** This is a conceptual question, requiring deeper understanding. Describing writing style is similar in its conceptual nature, maybe slightly less abstract than "theme" if they focus on superficial aspects.
*   **15% anchor ("differentiate sources"):** Requires definition and example. This involves specific terminology. "Writing style" and its descriptors are also specific terminology.
*   **30% anchor ("My favorite season"):** This is a creative writing task on a familiar topic. While challenging due to English proficiency and the 6-8 line requirement, the core concept is familiar. This is easier than the current question.
*   **50% anchor ("king's three questions"):** This is pure recall from a text, which many students, even those struggling with English, can often do if they've paid some attention. The current question is more demanding than recall.
*   **66% anchor ("Fundamental Rights"):** Pure recall of two simple facts. This is the most straightforward, lowest-level cognitive demand. The current question is far more complex.

Considering that the theme/central idea of the *same* poem had a 5% pass rate, suggesting very low comprehension, it's highly improbable that a large number of students would be able to then analyze its *writing style* and articulate a suitable descriptor. The leap from not grasping the theme to accurately describing the style is significant.

The word "simple" could potentially be used by some students, but they would still need to connect it to the writing. Many responses might be generic, incorrect, or blank because they don't understand the question or the poem sufficiently. The expert bias would likely be much higher, assuming students could just say "simple" or "good." But that overlooks the English barrier and conceptual understanding needed.

If the poem itself was barely understood (5% pass on theme), the number of students who could effectively describe its *style* is going to be very low. Many will likely not know what "style" means in this context, or lack the vocabulary even if they grasp it somewhat.

I expect this question to perform worse than the "differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" (15%) because "writing style" for a *specific* poem requires more integrated understanding than differentiating general source types, and the underlying poem's comprehension was shown to be very low. It might be closer to the "theme" question but slightly higher since "style" can sometimes be described with simpler observations than a "theme," if the students manage to extract *any* quality. However, the low base comprehension of the poem (5% pass for theme) will severely limit performance.

Let's split the difference between the 5% (theme) and the 15% (differentiate sources), leaning towards the lower end given the demonstrated difficulty with the poem itself.
