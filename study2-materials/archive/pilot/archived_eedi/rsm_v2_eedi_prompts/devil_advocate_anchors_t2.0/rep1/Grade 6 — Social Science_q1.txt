Given the calibration anchors and the context of Class 6 students from economically weaker sections with limited English, here's my reasoning for the estimated proportion correct:

**Analysis of the Question:**
*   **"Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."**
*   **Concepts:** Requires knowledge of geography (major mountain ranges) and identification within India.
*   **Language:** Simple, direct English. "Name," "two," "major," "mountain ranges," "located in India" are all straightforward.
*   **Recall vs. Application:** Primarily a recall question. Students either know it or they don't.
*   **Rubric:** Very lenient. Only one correct answer needed for 0.5 points.

**Comparing with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 66%: "Name any two Fundamental Rights..."** This is very similar in structure ("Name any two...") and requires factual recall from a civics/social studies context. Fundamental Rights are a core topic taught in Indian schools.
    *   **Reasoning:** Mountain ranges are also a core topic in Indian geography. While not every student will know *two* perfectly, knowing *one* major range like the Himalayas is extremely common, even for struggling students. It's often one of the first geographical features taught.
*   **Pass Rate 50%: "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"** This is factual recall from a specific story, often taught in English textbooks. Students who remember the story can get it right.
    *   **Reasoning:** Geography facts (like mountain ranges) are arguably more consistently covered and drilled than specific details from every story.
*   **Pass Rate 30%: "Write a short paragraph... on 'My favorite season.'"** This requires paragraph construction, coherence, and multiple ideas, which is a much higher cognitive load and English proficiency requirement.
    *   **Reasoning:** Our target question only requires listing.
*   **Pass Rate 15%: "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..."** Requires deeper understanding, comparison, and examples.
    *   **Reasoning:** Our question is simpler factual recall.
*   **Pass Rate 5%: "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'"** This is complex interpretation and articulation in English, very difficult for limited English speakers.
    *   **Reasoning:** Again, our question is much simpler.

**Challenging Assumptions:**

*   **"Most students could do this."** My initial instinct is often that Himalayas would be widely known. However, *two* might be harder for some, and the question asks for *two* but the rubric gives points for *one*.
*   **Limited English:** The English required is minimal for this question ("Himalayas"). It doesn't require constructing sentences or complex vocabulary.
*   **"Basic concepts aren't basic."** While some geography concepts might be tricky, identifying the major mountain ranges, especially the Himalayas, is a very fundamental part of Indian geography taught from early grades. Other ranges like Aravalli or Vindhya are also fairly common knowledge.
*   **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** Yes, some students will leave it blank. But for those who remember even one, it's an easy win.
*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** "Name two X" is a very common question type.

**Calibration against 66% anchor:**
The "Fundamental Rights" question is a very strong anchor. Both questions ask for two factual items from general knowledge (Social Science/Civics and Geography respectively).
The content of "major mountain ranges" (especially the Himalayas) is arguably *more* widely and repetitively taught and recognized in India than specific fundamental rights for a Class 6 student. Students see the map of India with the Himalayas prominently featured from a very young age. Even if they don't know the exact "right to freedom," they will likely know "Himalayas."

Given that only *one* correct answer is needed for half a point, this makes the question even easier than the 66% anchor where *two* were likely needed for full credit (the example shows a '1' score for two rights). To get 0.5 for just *one* correct mountain range, the hurdle is quite low.

Considering all this, a significant majority of students should be able to name at least *one* major mountain range. The 66% anchor is very relevant. I would place this question slightly higher than 66% because:
1.  The simplicity of the answer (just a name, minimal English)
2.  The universality of the knowledge (Himalayas in particular)
3.  The lenient scoring rubric (only one needed for 0.5 points)

However, considering the overall average pass
