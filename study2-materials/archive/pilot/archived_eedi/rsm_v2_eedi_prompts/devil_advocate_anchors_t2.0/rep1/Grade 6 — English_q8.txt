Let's break down the challenge of this question for Class 6 students in Indian government schools.

**Initial Intuition vs. Reality Check:**

My initial instinct, as a native English speaker, is "this is really easy, almost everyone should get this." But then I force myself to apply the provided anchors and the caveats.

*   **Limited English:** This is the absolute biggest factor. While "he," "is," "reading," "a," "book" are very common words, constructing a grammatically correct sentence from them might not be as intuitive for students who are still grappling with basic vocabulary and sentence structure. Many might struggle with word order in English.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** Subject-verb-object order *is* a basic concept, but not if your primary language has a different default word order or if your exposure to structured English sentences is limited. Students might attempt word-for-word translation from their mother tongue, which could lead to incorrect order.
*   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** While this question is relatively simple, some students will still freeze or not even attempt it if they lack confidence or the very basic understanding.
*   **Lack of Practice:** Have they *practiced* this exact type of "rearrange the words" question often? They might recognize the words but not know the "game" of reordering.

**Analyzing with Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 66% (Name two Fundamental Rights):** This requires specific factual recall in simple English. The words are provided implicitly by the question, but the answer itself needs to be pulled from memory.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer?):** This requires understanding a narrative and extracting key information. Again, the complexity isn't in generating complex language, but in recalling specific details.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This allows for creativity and simpler sentence structures. The student has full control. Even so, many struggled with constructing basic coherent sentences, getting fragmented answers or just lists.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological and literary sources):** This is much higher-order thinking and requires more complex vocabulary and comparative language.

**Comparison to the Current Question:**

The target question asks students to *actively construct* a grammatically correct sentence from provided words.

*   **Difficulty of "He is reading a book.":** It's one of the simplest possible English sentences in terms of structure and vocabulary. All words are very high-frequency.
*   **Potential Errors:**
    *   `He a book is reading` (influenced by other language structures, or just not grasping English SVO)
    *   `Book reading he is a` (random ordering)
    *   `Reading a book he is`
    *   Leaving it blank.
*   The fact that a paragraph on "My favorite season" (where they *control* the difficulty of their own output) only got 30%, is a *huge* indicator. Students often default to lists or very short, broken sentences. Here, they *must* follow SVO for a correct answer.

The target question is simpler than constructing an original paragraph, and simpler than recalling specific facts from memory in coherent sentences. It's more aligned with the ability to form basic, high-frequency sentences.

Given the 50% pass rate for "What were the three questions..." (which is about information extraction in fairly direct terms), and the 66% for naming rights (simple factual recall), this question feels like it *should* fall above 50% but not reach the highest anchor. It tests a very basic sentence construction rule using very common words.

However, remembering the advice to challenge first instinct and the struggle with English, many will still mess up the word order or omit words. The 30% for a "My favorite season" paragraph indicates how much basic sentence generation is a challenge. This question requires *correct* word order for full credit.

I think the 66% mark is for extremely simple recall where the words *almost appear in the question or are extremely common knowledge*. This question requires reordering. The 50% mark requires understanding and recalling specific narrative points.

Rearranging words into a correct, albeit simple, sentence will be easier than *generating* a descriptive paragraph. It's also likely easier than correctly recalling two abstract concepts like "Fundamental Rights" (even if common) for many students who struggle with meaning.

However, the "empty response" for simple questions and fragmented answers for the paragraph are strong indicators. While the words are given, the *grammatical rule* for SVO might not be universally solid.

Let's calibrate. The 50% anchor requires recall from a story. This question is purely
