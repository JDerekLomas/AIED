I'm going to carefully consider the calibration anchors and the description of the student population before making my estimate.

The question asks for a 4-5 sentence paragraph about 'My Favourite Hobby', mentioning what it is, when it's done, and why it's enjoyed. The rubric is quite lenient, only requiring the paragraph to "clearly mention" these three points. Max score is 1, indicating binary correctness.

Let's break down the difficulty:
1.  **Understanding the prompt (English comprehension):** "My Favourite Hobby" is common vocabulary. "When you do it" and "why you enjoy it" are also straightforward. However, "short paragraph (4-5 sentences)" might be a constraint for some, particularly if they struggle with generating enough English.
2.  **Generating content:** Students need to identify a hobby, a time they do it, and a reason for enjoyment. Hobbies are usually quite personal and something most students would have, even if simple (e.g., playing with friends, watching TV, drawing). The challenge is articulating it in English.
3.  **Grammar/Syntax for a paragraph:** This is where the pass rates on other paragraph/short answer questions become crucial.
    *   **Item (pass rate 30%):** "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'" This is a very similar task, just slightly longer. The examples show that even rudimentary sentences ("Winter\nSweater\nBaju") could get some points, and full sentences that were short but addressed the prompt were fine. The current question only asks for 4-5 sentences, making it slightly easier to meet the length requirement than the 6-8 line prompt.
    *   **Item (pass rate 15%):** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." This is a more complex, academic task requiring factual recall and comparative writing. The English requirements are higher, and the topic is less personal.
    *   **Item (pass rate 50%):** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" This requires recall from a specific text and usually involves transcribing parts of sentences or short phrases. It's often about direct information retrieval.
    *   **Item (pass rate 66%):** "Name any two Fundamental Rights..." This is pure recall of names. Minimal sentence construction.

Considering the "My favorite season" item, which had a 30% pass rate for a slightly longer paragraph:
*   Many students got some credit even with very broken English or lists.
*   The 'My Favourite Hobby' prompt is very similar in structure and demands, perhaps even *slightly* simpler because 'hobbies' are generally easier for students to access personally than "seasons" which might involve more descriptive language.
*   The length requirement is slightly *less* for 'Hobby' (4-5 sentences vs. 6-8 lines for 'Season'), which is an advantage for students struggling with English generation.

**The "My favourite season" prompt got a 30% pass rate.**
The "My favourite hobby" is almost identical in cognitive demand and English production. The core differences are:
1.  **Topic:** Hobby vs. Season. Both are personal and relatively easy to access for most students.
2.  **Length:** 4-5 sentences vs. 6-8 lines. This makes "Hobby" slightly *easier* as fewer sentences are required for full marks.

Given that the "Season" item, which was a very close parallel (paragraph on a personal preference, slightly longer), had a 30% pass rate, I would expect 'My Favourite Hobby' to perform similarly, if not slightly better, due to the shorter length requirement.

However, I need to be cautious about overestimating. The average pass rate is 29%, so a score much higher than this usually requires a very simple question. This is a paragraph.

Let's re-evaluate "My favorite season" (30%) - example correct responses for that were:
*   "Rainy season is my favorite season.\n\nI am so enjoy the Rainy season.\n\nfastly Growing plants and " (got a 3/3, for 'short paragraph', not necessarily full sentences.) This shows a student can put together a few basic sentences.

For 'My Favourite Hobby':
*   "My favorite hobby is playing cricket. I play cricket every evening with my friends. I enjoy it because it is fun and keeps me healthy." - This would be a perfect answer and achievable for many students.
*   "I like drawing. I draw pictures at home. It is very nice." - This could also potentially pass, meeting the 'mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it'
