I will analyze the question, the student demographic, and the provided calibration anchors to arrive at a calibrated estimate.

**Question Analysis:**
The task is to rearrange five common English words into a simple, declarative sentence.
*   **Words:** "book", "reading", "a", "is", "he"
*   **Target Sentence:** "He is reading a book."
*   **Grammar:** Present continuous tense, basic subject-verb-object (SVO) structure.
*   **Vocabulary:** All words are very common and foundational.
*   **Cognitive Load:** Requires understanding word roles (pronoun, verb, article, noun) and basic sentence structure.

**Student Demographics:**
*   Class 6 students in Indian government schools.
*   Economically weaker sections.
*   **Limited English:** This is the most critical factor. While "he," "is," "a," "book" are likely known, "reading" might be understood in context but active formation with the verb "to be" might be challenging.
*   Average pass rate for the exam is 29%.

**Challenging First Instinct:**
My first instinct might be "This is easy, most Class 6 students should get this." However, the strong emphasis on "limited English" and the example of experts overestimating difficulty force me to reconsider.

*   **Limited English:** A student with truly limited English might not grasp the SVO order consistently. They might know the individual words but struggle to arrange them grammatically. For instance, "He a book reading is" or "Is he reading a book?" (turning it into a question) or even "Book a is he reading." are plausible errors if the SVO structure isn't ingrained.
*   **Exam Anxiety/No Practice:** Some students might just give up or provide a garbled response due to anxiety or lack of prior practice with sentence reordering tasks, even if they recognize the words.
*   **"Basic" Concepts:** SVO order is basic *in English grammar*, but it's not basic for a student struggling with the language. Their native language structure might be different, causing interference.

**Calibration Anchors Analysis:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain."** Highly abstract, requires deep comprehension and expressive English. This is extremely difficult for the demographic.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate archaeological/literary sources.** Requires recall of definitions, examples, and comparative thinking. Moderate difficulty. The success suggests some content knowledge but also highlights the struggle with explanation.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Paragraph on "My favorite season."** Free response, requires idea generation and coherent sentence formation. The examples show students can produce fragmented but related ideas. This suggests a struggle with continuous narrative.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer.** Requires recall of specific plot points from a story. If the story was known, it's a direct retrieval. This is factual recall, less demanding than grammar or composition.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Two Fundamental Rights.** Pure recall of specific, likely memorized, information. The high pass rate suggests many can parrot memorized facts.

**Comparison with Target Question:**
The current question, "book/reading/a/is/he", requires understanding of basic sentence structure. It's more complex than direct factual recall (50-66% items) because it requires active application of grammar rules. However, it's significantly less demanding than composing a paragraph (30%) or extracting a theme (5%).

The closest comparison might be that it's harder than simple recall (66%) but easier than composition or differentiation (15-30%). The issue is the *type* of English skill required. Reordering sentences, even with common words, tests fundamental grammatical understanding often overlooked by those proficient in English.

If a student understands the individual words but not SVO, they will struggle. Many students might struggle with "He *is reading* a book" vs. "He reading a book" due to the auxiliary verb.

Given the emphasis on "limited English" and the average pass rate of 29% for the exam:
*   Recall of simple facts has 50-66% pass rates.
*   Composition has 30% pass rates.
*   Comparative analysis has 15% pass rates.
*   Abstract interpretation has 5% pass rates.

This question tests a skill (sentence formation) that is foundational but also an area where "limited English" students commonly falter. It's not factual recall, but application of grammatical rules. It's also not asking for extensive writing.

I believe it's harder than
