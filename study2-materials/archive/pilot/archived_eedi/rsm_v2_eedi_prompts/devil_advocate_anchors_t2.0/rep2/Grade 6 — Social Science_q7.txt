Let's break down the question and rubric against the calibration anchors.

**Question Analysis:**
*   **Concepts:** "Natural resources," "Rajasthan," "influences the lives." These are relatively straightforward geographical and social studies concepts for Class 6.
*   **Cognitive Load:**
    1.  Recall two natural resources specific to Rajasthan. This requires some regional knowledge.
    2.  Select one of those resources.
    3.  Explain its influence on people's lives. This requires understanding cause and effect.
*   **Language:** "Mention any two," "explain how one of them influences." The language is relatively simple and direct.
*   **Difficulty Traps:**
    *   **Specific knowledge:** Students need to know resources *in Rajasthan*, not just any natural resources.
    *   **Explanation:** The "explanation" part requires more than just listing. A student might list two resources but struggle to elaborate on the influence.
    *   **Limited English:** While the words are common, constructing a coherent explanatory sentence might be hard for very weak English speakers.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of a poem):** This is very abstract, requiring interpretation and advanced vocabulary/sentence structure. Our question is more factual and concrete. So, it should be much higher than 5%.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** This requires comparing two concepts and providing examples, which is a higher-order thinking skill than just recall and simple explanation. Our question is less about formal differentiation and more about concrete examples and impact. A Class 6 student is probably more familiar with "natural resources" than "archaeological/literary sources." This suggests our question should be higher than 15%.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Short paragraph "My favorite season"):** This requires sustained writing (6-8 lines) and elaboration on personal preferences, eating, and wearing. The writing load is higher than ours, though the topic is familiar. A key difference is that this is *personal* and can be answered even with very poor English if a student can string a few words together (like the 3-score example "Winter / Sweater / Baju"). Our question requires *factual recall* for the first part.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is pure recall of specific plot points from a story. It requires memory but very little synthesis or explanation. Students who know the story will get it, those who don't, won't. This question has a recall component *and* a simple explanation component. The recall here ("natural resources in Rajasthan") might be slightly harder than recalling plot points if geography isn't a strength. However, the explanation is simpler than writing a paragraph. This is a good comparator.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Name any two Fundamental Rights):** This is pure recall of a specific factual list. Many students likely memorize these. Our question has a similar "recall two facts" component, but then adds the "explain how one influences" part. This makes our question *harder* than 66%.

**Synthesizing and Adjusting:**

*   It's harder than pure recall (66%) because of the explanation.
*   It's easier than differentiating abstract concepts (15%) or writing a multi-sentence theme (5%).
*   It's arguably similar in difficulty or slightly harder than the "favorite season" (30%) due to the factual recall component vs. personal expression, but simpler writing requirement.
*   It's comparable to, but slightly harder than, recalling specific facts from a story (50%) because it requires *factual knowledge specific to a region* (Rajasthan resources) *and then* a basic explanation. Many students might struggle with the specific Rajasthan resources part, or fail to elaborate sufficiently on the "influence."

The primary challenge will be knowing resources *specific to Rajasthan* and then crafting even a very simple sentence about its influence. For example, "Rajasthan has sand. People live in sandy houses." or "Rajasthan has copper. People mine copper." would likely score. Many students might know general resources, but not be able to tie them to Rajasthan specifically. The English constraint is also crucial for the explanation part.

Given the typical knowledge gaps and limited English, hitting the two correct resources for *Rajasthan* specifically, and then providing a *comprehensible explanation* of influence for at least one, will reduce the pass rate from what an expert might intuitively expect. I'd lean closer to the lower end of the 30-50% range. Let's assume some will list resources, but only partially get the explanation. Some will list resources, but not for Rajasthan.

Let's reconsider the "My favorite
