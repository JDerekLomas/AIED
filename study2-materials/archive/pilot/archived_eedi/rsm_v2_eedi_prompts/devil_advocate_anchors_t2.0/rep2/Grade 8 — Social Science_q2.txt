I'm going to carefully consider the calibration anchors and the "challenges to assumptions" before making my estimate.

**Analysis of the Question and Rubric:**

The question asks for *one key feature* of Harappan urban planning. The rubric provides several excellent examples: grid layout, advanced drainage, baked bricks, division into citadel/lower town. These are all fundamental concepts taught about the Harappan Civilization.

**Considering the Student Demographics and Challenges:**

*   **Economically weaker sections, limited English:** This is the most crucial factor. Students may have learned these concepts in their local language but struggle to articulate them in English, even simply.
*   **Average pass rate 29%:** This is a low baseline, indicating significant academic struggle overall.
*   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic for struggling learners:** While Harappan civilization is a core history topic, a student who has gaps in learning or weak comprehension skills might not retain these specific details.
*   **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** Even if they know *something*, anxiety can lead to a blank or fragmented answer.
*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** While "describe" is common, the ability to pull a specific detail from memory and articulate it simply in English is key.

**Calibrating with Anchors:**

Let's look at the anchors to gauge difficulty:

*   **5% Pass Rate (Theme of Poem):** Requires interpretive skills, abstract thinking, and articulating a nuanced idea in English. Very difficult. Our question is more factual, less interpretive.
*   **15% Pass Rate (Differentiate Archaeo/Literary sources):** Requires knowing two distinct definitions and providing examples for *each*. More demanding than our question, which only asks for *one* feature. The examples provided (physical objects vs. written) show that even partial, fragmented English can score.
*   **30% Pass Rate (Short paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires personal expression, more sustained writing, and connecting ideas (what you do, eat, wear). Some answers were just lists of words or fragmented sentences, still scoring. This suggests that basic English sentence formation is challenging.
*   **50% Pass Rate (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Requires recalling specific factual details (three items). The rubric likely accepts just a list. Responses show fragmented recall but still getting the credit for identifying the main ideas. This is probably the closest in type – recall of specific factual points.
*   **66% Pass Rate (Name any two Fundamental Rights):** Requires recalling two specific, rote-learned terms. "Right to equality" and "Right to freedom" are common and often memorized phrases. This is purely recall and seems slightly easier than the Harappan question because the terms are typically exact phrases.

**Challenging Initial Instinct:**

My first instinct might be "Harappan planning is a fundamental topic, many would know *something*." However, the anchors strongly suggest otherwise.

*   The 50% anchor asks for *three* specific questions, implying students have to retrieve a short list of concrete ideas.
*   The 30% anchor shows how much students struggle with even simple sentence construction and connecting ideas.
*   The 15% anchor shows the difficulty of differentiating two concepts, even when they're relatively basic history terms.

The Harappan question requires recalling a *specific feature* of urban planning. While "drainage system" or "grid layout" are common, expressing it simply and correctly in English will be the hurdle. Many might know *of* Harappan civilization but struggle to recall a *key feature of its urban planning* precisely. Some might recall other aspects of the civilization, not necessarily urban planning.

Given the 50% pass rate for recalling *three* specific questions from a story, recalling *one* specific feature from a historical topic seems comparable, maybe slightly harder because it's not always just a "listable" item; it requires a descriptive phrase. The struggle with English expression for students at this level often leads to partially correct but incoherent answers, or simply blank responses.

The crucial difference from the 50% question is that the Harappan question asks to "describe" a feature, not just list it. This pushes towards slightly more demanding English, though "well-planned grid layout" or "advanced drainage system" are quite brief and could pass.

I need to consider that many might know a *bit* but not enough to formulate even one correct feature *in English* to meet the rubric.

Let's look at the example scoring:
For the 15% item (differentiate historical sources):
"archaeological source are physical objects such as corn tools building and other" -> Scores 1
This shows leniency for fragmented English, as long as the core idea is there. This bodes well for
