I'll analyze the question and rubric against the calibration anchors, focusing on the specific challenges faced by Class 6 Indian government school students.

The question asks: "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"
Rubric: Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why. (Max score: 1.5)

Let's break down the requirements:

1.  **"Which line from the poem..."**: This requires students to have *read and understood* at least parts of the poem "The Last Bargain" (from the 5% anchor, we know even understanding the central idea is extremely difficult for these students). They need to recall or find a specific line.
2.  **"...do you like the most..."**: This asks for a subjective preference. While simple, it does require comprehension of the line itself.
3.  **"...and why?"**: This is the critical part. Students need to *articulate a reason* for their choice. This requires expressive English, even if simple.

Considering the calibration anchors:

*   **5% anchor (Theme of "The Last Bargain")**: This is about *understanding* the poem at a higher level (theme/central idea). The fact that only 5% can do this is a huge red flag. Our current question asks for a *personal preference* about a line, and a *reason*. This is conceptually easier than abstracting a theme, but still requires understanding of specific lines.
*   **15% anchor (Differentiate sources)**: This involves comparing and contrasting, and giving examples. It's an information recall and structured response question. Students who could score here likely have better general comprehension and expressive skills than the 5% group.
*   **30% anchor (Paragraph on "My favorite season")**: This is the closest in *structure* (personal preference + explanation) and *expressive demand*. However, "My favorite season" is a highly familiar topic, requiring common vocabulary and simple sentence structures. Even here, students struggled, giving fragmented lists ("Winter, Sweater, Baju...") or very short, simple sentences.
*   **50% anchor (Three questions the king wanted to answer)**: This is direct recall from a story. Simpler than articulating a reason.
*   **66% anchor (Name two Fundamental Rights)**: This is pure recall of learned facts, which students can often rote-learn.

**Challenges for the current question:**

1.  **Poem comprehension**: Many students will struggle to even read and understand enough of the poem to pick a line, let alone articulate why. The 5% anchor strongly supports this. If they can't even get the central idea, how can they select and justify a line?
2.  **Vocabulary for explanation**: Even for a "liked" line, students will need some vocabulary to express *why*. Phrases like "I like this because it talks about freedom," or "It shows the value of..." require slightly more complex sentence structures than the 30% anchor showed students typically produce for even simpler topics.
3.  **Specific recall of a line**: They must pinpoint a specific line. Vague references might not count for the "denotes a line" part of the rubric.
4.  **"Why" part is often left blank**: As seen in other anchors, articulating the "why" is a common sticking point. Students often struggle to move beyond stating "I like it."

Comparing it to the 30% anchor ("My favorite season"):
The structure is similar (express preference + give reason). However, "My favorite season" uses familiar, everyday concepts. Picking a line from a *poem* and explaining *why* it's liked requires deeper engagement with the text and slightly more abstract reasoning/expression than simply listing things associated with a season. If only 30% can give even basic, fragmented responses for a familiar topic, doing so for a poem line will be harder.

Considering the extremely low pass rate for understanding the theme (5%), I think the difficulty of extracting a line and articulating a reason is much closer to that lower end than to the 30% anchor. A student would need to:
1. Understand some lines of the poem.
2. Select one.
3. Formulate a simple English sentence to explain *why*.

Many students will likely just copy a line (if they recognize one) and stop there, or offer a one-word justification like "good." According to the rubric, "denotes a line and mentions why" means a one-word "good" might not suffice for "why," especially if it doesn't elaborate at all. But even if it did, getting both components is tough.

My initial instinct would be higher, perhaps 20-25%, but given the harsh reality of the calibration anchors, especially the
