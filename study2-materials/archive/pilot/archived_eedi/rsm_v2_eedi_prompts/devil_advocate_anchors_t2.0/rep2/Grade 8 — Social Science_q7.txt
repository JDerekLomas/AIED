I'll analyze the question against the calibration anchors, keeping in mind the students' context.

**Question Analysis:**
*   **Topic:** Indian History, specifically the Battle of Plassey and its impact. This is a standard topic in Indian history curricula for Class 8.
*   **English Difficulty:** The question itself uses relatively straightforward English ("How did X contribute to Y?"). The key concepts are "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "expansion of British power," and "India."
*   **Conceptual Difficulty:** Understanding *how* a battle led to *political expansion* (i.e., not just a military victory but control over resources, trade, or governance) is more complex than just naming facts. It requires understanding cause-and-effect in historical events.
*   **Specificity of Answer Required:** The rubric requires explaining that the victory led to "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)." This is a specific historical understanding, not just a vague mention of British power increasing.

**Comparing with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of a poem):** Very high cognitive demand (inference, abstraction), often requires strong vocabulary. My question is fact-based but requires cause-and-effect reasoning.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** Requires definitional knowledge and examples for two distinct concepts. This is recall + basic analysis. My question is similar in structure (explain *how* A led to B). Students who struggle with conceptual differentiation will also struggle with cause-and-effect explanation.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires personal expression, but also organization, basic sentence structure, and meeting a length requirement. Even simple responses get credit. This suggests that students can form basic sentences but often lack structure or depth. My question is objective, not personal, and demands historical accuracy and explanatory depth.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer?):** Direct recall of specific facts from a story. This is relatively low cognitive demand if the story was known. This question type generally has a higher pass rate for students who simply remember.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Name two Fundamental Rights):** Direct recall of specific legal/civics facts. Even fragmented answers receive full credit, suggesting low bar for correctness. This is a very direct recall task, hence the higher pass rate.

**Re-evaluating based on constraints:**

*   **Economically weaker sections, limited English:** The nuance of "contribute to expansion of political dominance" will be lost on many. They might know "British won" or "British got more powerful" but fail to connect it specifically to Bengal and the establishment of *political control* as the rubric requires.
*   **"Basic concepts aren't basic":** While the Battle of Plassey is covered, the *implications* for political dominance (especially with a specific example like Mir Jafar) might be seen as an advanced application for struggling learners. Many might remember the facts but not the deeper "how" and "why."
*   **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** Even for familiar topics, a non-trivial percentage will leave it blank or give irrelevant answers.
*   **Lack of practice for exact question type:** Explaining a historical *contribution* (cause and effect) requires a certain analytical ability beyond mere recall.

**First Instinct vs. Challenged Assumption:**
My first instinct might have been closer to 25-30% because it's a known historical event. However, after considering the need for specific explanation of *political dominance/control over Bengal* rather than just "British power increased," the difficulty escalates significantly. Students might offer vague answers like "British won and got more land" or "British became strong" which might not meet the strict rubric requirement for "political dominance/control over Bengal." The example of Mir Jafar shows the level of detail expected for full credit, which many struggling students would miss.

The 15% pass rate item ("Differentiate between sources") involves two distinct concepts and examples, which has a similar conceptual burden as explaining *how* one historical event led to *political control* – it's more than simple recall. Many will know the "what" (Plassey, British power) but struggle with the "how" in detail.

The "theme of poem" at 5% is too high-level inference. "Favorite season" at 30% allows simple, direct answers. "King's questions" at 50% is pure recall. "Fundamental Rights" at 66% is also pure recall.

This question requires specific analytical and factual recall beyond basic remembering. Students need to grasp the concept of "
