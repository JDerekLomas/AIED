I need to estimate the pass rate for a Class 7 student in an Indian government school on a grammar question, converting an active voice sentence to passive voice. The students are mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English, and the average pass rate on this exam is about 29%.

Let's break down the challenge:
1.  **Grammar Complexity**: Active to passive voice conversion requires understanding the subject, verb, and object, changing the verb form (to be + past participle), and often adding "by [original subject]".
2.  **Limited English Proficiency**: This is a major factor. While "blew" and "leaves" might be somewhat familiar, understanding the grammatical structure change might be hard.
3.  **Basic Concepts Not Basic**: While taught, consistent application of grammar rules like this can be a struggle even for native speakers, let alone second-language learners with limited exposure.
4.  **Specific Verb "blew"**: The past participle of "blow" is "blown," which is an irregular verb. This adds another layer of difficulty. Many students might struggle with irregular past participles.
5.  **Anxiety/Blank Responses**: A significant portion will likely leave it blank or attempt something incorrect due to lack of understanding or anxiety.
6.  **Question Type**: Grammar transformation questions are common, but correct application can be tricky.

Let's compare to the calibration anchors:

*   **5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and expression of a complex idea. High difficulty. Converting to passive voice is more formulaic but still challenging for English learners.
*   **15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** Requires factual knowledge, recall of specific terms, and ability to give examples. "Physical objects" and "written" are somewhat easier to grasp, but differentiation and proper examples are harder.
*   **30% (Short paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires basic paragraph construction, expression of personal preferences, and recalling related vocabulary (food, clothing, activities). This allows for some leniency in grammar/spelling as long as the ideas are there. The example answers show basic lists get points.
*   **50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Requires recalling specific plot details from a known story. It's rote memory of somewhat longer phrases, but it's *recall*, not transformation. Students just need to list the items.
*   **66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Similar to the king's questions, it requires recall of specific terms from civics. It's factual recall, which students often do better on if they've memorized. The names of rights can be long but are often repeated.

**Analysis of the "Active to Passive" question:**

*   It's a grammar transformation. It's not rote recall.
*   It requires understanding tense (past simple) and knowing the correct "to be" verb form ("were").
*   It requires knowing the irregular past participle ("blown").
*   It requires re-ordering the sentence elements and introducing "by the wind".
*   "The leaves were blown away by the wind."

I anticipate significant difficulty with:
*   Getting "were" correct (plural subject "leaves," past tense "blew").
*   Recalling "blown" as the past participle of "blow." Many might use "blowed."
*   Properly inserting "by the wind."

Many will probably try:
*   "The leaves blow away by the wind." (Incorrect verb form/tense)
*   "The leaves blew away by the wind." (Incorrect verb form/tense)
*   "The leaves were blow away." (Missing participle/by phrase)
*   Blank responses.
*   Incorrect transformations (e.g., "The wind was blew away the leaves").

Comparing it to the 30% item ("My favorite season") which allows for very fragmented but partially correct answers, this grammar question has a very specific correct answer. It's much less forgiving. Students often score lower on grammar transformation if they don't know the rules well, especially with irregular verbs.

The 50% and 66% items are recall, which is generally easier than applying complex grammatical rules, especially for students with limited English.

The 15% item involves definition and examples, requiring understanding and synthesis. This grammar question also requires understanding and application, arguably a bit more precise than giving one example of each type of historical source, especially given the irregular verb.

I think it's harder than recalling factual lists (50-66%), and probably harder than writing a simple paragraph where you get points for scattered relevant words (30%). It's comparable to, if not slightly harder than, differentiating archaeological/literary sources (1
