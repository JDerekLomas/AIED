I will analyze the question and the provided calibration anchors, considering the characteristics of the student population.

**Question Analysis:**
"Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"
Rubric: Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why. Max score: 1.5

This question requires:
1.  **Reading and comprehending a poem:** The students need to have understood the poem ("The Last Bargain" based on one of the anchors). If they haven't read or understood the poem, they cannot select a line meaningfully.
2.  **Choosing a line:** This is a subjective choice, but requires extracting a specific line.
3.  **Explaining "why":** This is the crucial part that demands critical thinking and articulation. Students need to justify their choice, even if it's a simple reason.

**Challenges for Class 6 Indian Government School Students (economically weaker, limited English, average pass rate 29%):**

*   **Poem Comprehension:** Many might struggle to understand the nuances or even the basic meaning of the entire poem, especially if their English is weak. If they don't grasp the poem, their "favorite line" choice will be arbitrary or they might not choose one at all.
*   **Vocabulary/Sentence Structure:** Even if they pick a line, explaining "why" in coherent English can be a major hurdle. They might have a thought but lack the vocabulary or grammatical structure to express it.
*   **Subjectivity:** While choosing a "favorite" is subjective, justifying it is not always easy, especially if they haven't been taught expressive writing or critical analysis of poetry.
*   **Anxiety/Lack of Practice:** As noted, these students might not have practiced this exact question type extensively. Exam anxiety can lead to blank or very short, unconvincing responses.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Item (5%): Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."**
    *   This is conceptually harder. It requires deep comprehension and abstraction. The question "Which line... and why?" is less abstract; it's about personal preference and explanation. However, a student struggling to find a *theme* might also struggle to justify *why* they like a specific *line*. The 5% rate for theme suggests very few truly grasp the poem deeply.
*   **Item (15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources...**
    *   This requires factual recall and conceptual understanding. The explanation part is fairly direct.
*   **Item (30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season."**
    *   This is a highly subjective, personal narrative. It's about personal experience and less about analysis. The task is to *write about* something familiar, not analyze a text. This had a 30% pass rate, indicating that about 30% can manage a paragraph even if basic. The current question is a bit more demanding as it links to a poem.
*   **Item (50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?**
    *   This is direct recall from a story. It doesn't require "why" or "theme." The higher pass rate indicates many can extract direct information.
*   **Item (66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights...**
    *   Pure factual recall, highly practiced. Very high pass rate.

**Re-evaluating "Which line... and why?"**

Compared to "My favorite season" (30%), this question adds a layer of difficulty:
*   It requires interacting with an *external text* (the poem), not just personal experience.
*   It demands explaining a *preference*, which can be harder than just describing personal actions (what you do/eat/wear in your favorite season).
*   For a score, they must identify a line *and* give a reason. Many might identify a line but struggle with "why," or give a very superficial "why."

Given the 5% pass rate for identifying a *theme* from the same poem, the proportion of students who deeply understand the poem enough to meaningfully pick a favorite line *and* explain why, is likely not high.
Many students will:
*   Leave it blank (exam anxiety, lack of comprehension).
*   Write a line but no "why."
*   Write a line and a very generic "why" (e.g., "I like this line because it is good"). The rubric specifies "mentions why," so even a simple reason might count for 1 point. For 1.5, perhaps a slightly more elaborated reason? Let's assume a basic, somewhat logical reason is sufficient.

A significant portion of students will likely get partial credit
