I will use the provided pass rates as calibration anchors and consider the context of Class 8 Indian government school students, who generally have limited English proficiency and come from economically weaker sections.

Let's break down the question and expected response:

**Question:** "A gardener has collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit. Does gardener notice any change after some days? Give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health"

**Expected elements for a correct (or partially correct, given the rubric for 0.5) answer:**
1.  **Notice change:** Yes, changes will be noticed.
2.  **Reason:** Decomposition / Rotting / Maggots / Smell / Composting.
3.  **Beneficial for soil health:** Yes, it is beneficial.

**Rubric:** "The user suggests that the gardener will notice significant changes."
*This rubric is quite specific and only addresses the first part of the question. A student needs to explicitly state or strongly imply "yes, changes will be noticed."*
*Crucially, to get 0.5, they don't need to give reasons or evaluate benefits. This makes the specific rubric easier to satisfy than answering the full question.*

**Analysis considering calibration anchors:**

*   **English proficiency:** Students with limited English might struggle with the vocabulary "collected," "waste of plants," "vegetables," "fruits," "pit," "significant changes," "beneficial for soil health," and "evaluate." However, the core concept of waste rotting and changing is visually observable and often taught.
*   **"Basic" concepts:** Composting and decomposition are often part of environmental science or biology curricula. The visual observation of waste changing (smell, disappearance, etc.) is a very common experience, even if the formal term "decomposition" isn't used.
*   **Question Type:** It's a multi-part question, requiring observation, reasoning, and evaluation. However, the rubric for 0.5 only requires the observation part.
*   **Comparison to anchors:**
    *   **5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, understanding nuanced language, and expressing a conceptual idea. Much harder than this.
    *   **15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires precise definition, specific examples, and contrasting two distinct concepts. This is more complex than simply observing a change.
    *   **30% (Paragraph on favorite season):** Requires constructing a coherent paragraph, describing personal preferences, and fulfilling specific criteria. This involves more sustained writing and imagination.
    *   **50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Requires recalling specific factual details from a story. This is purely recall.
    *   **66% (Name two Fundamental Rights):** Requires recalling specific facts, which many might remember due to repetition or rote learning, especially if it's considered important civic knowledge.

The target rubric only requires acknowledging a "change." This is very basic observation. Even students who can barely articulate reasons might simply say "Yes, it changes" or "Yes, it rots." The word "notice" is common. "Changes" is also fairly common.

I initially think it would be quite high, perhaps 60-70% for just noticing a change. However, I need to apply the "challenge your instinct" rule and consider the students' reality:

*   **Limited English:** While "change" and "notice" are common, stringing them into a coherent sentence *in English* might be a barrier for many.
*   **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** Even for seemingly simple questions, a significant number of students provide blank or irrelevant answers, as seen in the 50% and 66% anchors where some get 0.
*   **Absent for topic:** While decomposition is fundamental, some students might have missed the specific class or discussion, or might not connect "waste of plants" in a pit to decomposition immediately if not phrased exactly as they learned it.
*   **Focus on 'significant change':** While any change would fit, students might hesitate if they don't perceive it as "significant" or might not know how to express that in English.

Considering that the 50% item only requires recalling three specific factual details, and 66% requires naming two fundamental rights (often memorized), the ability to conceptualize "change" in waste and articulate it in English, even simply, for a Class 8 student with limited English and background might be closer to the lower end of that range, especially with potential exam anxiety leading to empty or off-topic responses.

The critical difference is that the rubric *only* requires "noticing significant changes." Not why, not if beneficial. Just that something *happens*. This simplifies the task dramatically. It doesn't require complex scientific vocabulary like
