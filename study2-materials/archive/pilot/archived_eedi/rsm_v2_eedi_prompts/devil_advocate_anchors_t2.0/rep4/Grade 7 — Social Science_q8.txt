I'm tasked with estimating the proportion of Class 7 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections with limited English who would correctly answer the question: "What are the main occupations of people in the rural areas of Rajasthan? Describe any one in brief."

Let's break down the question's difficulty in light of the calibration anchors and warnings:

*   **Content Knowledge:** Rajasthan is a prominent state in India. Basic geography and socio-economic patterns of a major state's rural areas *should* be part of their general knowledge curriculum or civics. The primary occupations (agriculture, animal husbandry) are foundational. However, "handicrafts" might be less common knowledge for all, and recall beyond just "farming" could be challenging.
*   **Vocabulary/Language:** "Main occupations," "rural areas," "Rajasthan," "describe in brief." These terms are fairly standard. No complex literary or scientific vocabulary is used.
*   **Question Type:** This is a direct recall and simple descriptive question. Students need to list at least two and then elaborate on one. This is a common exam format.
*   **English Proficiency:** While English is limited, "main occupations" and "rural areas" are concepts they've likely encountered in English social science textbooks, even if simplified. They might not use perfect grammar or complex sentences, but if they know "farming" and "rearing animals," they can probably get credit.
*   **Recall vs. Interpretation:** This is purely recall of factual information. There's no interpretation needed, unlike the poem's theme question.
*   **Complexity:** Listing two items and briefly describing one is not very complex, assuming they have the underlying knowledge.
*   **Anxiety/Blank Responses:** Some students will likely draw blanks due to anxiety or not having studied Rajasthan's specific economy.

Let's compare to anchors:

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Poem Theme):** This required abstract thinking and interpretation of a poem, which is extremely difficult for limited English speakers. Our current question is factual recall.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Archaeological vs. Literary sources):** This required differentiating two abstract historical concepts and providing examples. The differentiation itself is harder than just listing occupations. It required more conceptual understanding and careful definition.
*   **Pass Rate 30% ("My favorite season"):** This was a creative writing task requiring 6-8 lines of self-expression. Many students struggle with generating coherent sentences and paragraphs, even on a personal topic.
    *   Our current question requires recall of two specific occupations and a *brief* description. The "brief description" might be 1-2 words like "grow crops" or "sell milk." The pass examples for "My favorite season" show a struggle even to write basic sentences, which means structured recall is often easier than open-ended writing.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This required direct recall of specific plot points from a story. This is *very* similar in nature to our target question – recall of specific factual details. The key difference here is that the story likely was covered in an English textbook. Our question covers general knowledge of a state's economy. The fact that many struggle to recall specific details from a story they ostensibly read or had taught is a strong indicator of low retention or engagement.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This was direct recall of two specific items from a list, likely from a civics textbook. This is perhaps the closest in structure, but Fundamental Rights are very heavily emphasized in the curriculum, and students often memorize these. The topic might also feel more 'direct' and easier to remember as a set list.

**Re-evaluating based on anchors:**

The 50% anchor ("Three questions the king wanted to answer") is the most relevant in terms of requiring factual recall from a learned context. If only half of students could recall three specific questions from a story, recalling two occupations and briefly describing one might be in a similar range, *if the content knowledge of Rajasthan's occupations is equally solidified.*

Given the warning that teachers overestimate and students struggle with "basic" concepts or those not explicitly drilled, and the limited English often reduces precise recall:

*   Many will likely only name one occupation (e.g., farming), missing the requirement for two.
*   Many might name two but struggle to describe even one in brief, especially if their vocabulary is limited.
*   "Rajasthan" specific context: while farming is universal, the prevalence of animal husbandry/pastoralism might be less salient than just "farming" to some, leading to an incomplete answer.
*   The fact that a simple 6-8 line paragraph on "My favorite season" only achieved 30% pass suggests that descriptive writing, even brief, is a
