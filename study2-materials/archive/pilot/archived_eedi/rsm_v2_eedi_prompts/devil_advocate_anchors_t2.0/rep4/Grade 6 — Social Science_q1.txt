The question asks for "any two major mountain ranges located in India." The rubric only requires naming one correct range for a score of 0.5.

Let's break down the potential difficulties:

1.  **English Comprehension:** "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India." This is relatively straightforward English. "Mountain ranges" is a common geographical term. "India" is clear.

2.  **Geographical Knowledge:**
    *   **Himalayas:** This is by far the most prominent and commonly taught mountain range in India. It's almost synonymous with Indian mountains in a general education context. Even students with very limited formal education are likely to have heard of the Himalayas, perhaps in stories, songs, or basic geography lessons.
    *   **Other Ranges (Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western/Eastern Ghats):** These are also major and are covered in Class 6 geography. However, the recall might be less universal than the Himalayas.

3.  **Recall and Specificity:** The question asks for "two," but the rubric only requires one. This is a crucial factor. If a student can recall even *one* major range, they get the point.

**Calibration Anchors Analysis:**

*   **Pass rate 66%:** "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India."
    *   This is conceptually more abstract than naming a mountain range. While taught, the terms like "Right to Equality" or "Right to Freedom" might be harder to recall precisely for all students, especially given English limitations. Students who only wrote "Viser to epumat" got 0. Yet, many scored 1.

*   **Pass rate 50%:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"
    *   This requires recall of a specific plot point from a story. The story might have been read, but exact recall of three specific questions can be tricky. However, "the right time to do everything, the right thing to do and the right people to work with" suggests students remembered the core ideas.

*   **Pass rate 30%:** "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'"
    *   This requires creative writing, organizing thoughts, and generating content, which is significantly harder for these students, especially in English, despite the common theme. Responses like "Winter Sweater Baju Hot water Tea Gever feali Hat" show struggle with coherent sentence formation but still score well.

*   **Pass rate 15%:** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..."
    *   This is a higher-order thinking skill (differentiation) combined with recalling specific examples and vocabulary. Much harder than simple recall.

*   **Pass rate 5%:** "Write a theme or central idea of the poem..."
    *   Requires deep comprehension, interpretation, and expression of an abstract idea, which is extremely challenging.

**Applying to the current question:**

*   Naming the **Himalayas** is almost guaranteed to be known by a significant portion of students, given its importance in Indian geography.
*   The English required for the answer (e.g., "Himalayas") is minimal.
*   The rubric being lenient (requiring only one for 0.5 points) significantly boosts the pass rate compared to needing two precise answers or complex sentences.
*   Compared to recalling abstract "Fundamental Rights" (66% pass), "Himalayas" is a concrete geographical term. Compared to specific plot details (50%), the Himalayas are a fundamental part of national identity and geography lessons.

Considering the simplicity of the required answer ("Himalayas"), the directness of the question, and the lenient rubric, I expect this item to be on the higher end of difficulty among the recall questions, perhaps even exceeding the 66% mark for Fundamental Rights because it's a more universally recognized proper noun without needing a full phrase. Even if a student struggles with English, writing "Himalaya" (even with a misspelling) would likely get the point. Many might name "Himalayas" and one other.

Given that 66% could name two fundamental rights, I believe naming just *one* prominent mountain range (especially the Himalayas) would be even more accessible. Even those with weak English can often write proper nouns related to their country.

My first instinct would be around 75-80%. Challenging this: Could a student who *barely* reads English name the Himalayas? Yes, it's a name, often learned verbally. Could a student absent for the topic? Possibly, if it's such common knowledge. Exam anxiety leading to blanks? Some, but for such a fundamental and "easy" (to some) recall, many will attempt it.

I think the comparison with Fundamental Rights (
