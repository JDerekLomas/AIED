The question asks students to "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India." The rubric states that naming one correct mountain range earns a score of 0.5. The calibration anchors show a range of pass rates, from 5% for an open-ended interpretation question to 66% for naming two fundamental rights.

Let's break down the difficulty factors:

1.  **Recall and Specific Knowledge:** Students need to recall specific geographical facts about India. This is a knowledge-based question.
2.  **English Comprehension:** The English is straightforward ("Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."). Most students should understand what is being asked.
3.  **Familiarity of Content:** Geography, especially about India, is a common subject in Indian schools. Major mountain ranges like the Himalayas are very well-known, even by students with limited formal education, due to general knowledge and their prominence in maps and social studies.
4.  **Open-ended vs. Specific:** While it asks for "any two," students only need to list one to get partial credit (0.5 score which the pass rate tracks for). This makes it easier than questions requiring differentiation or writing a paragraph.
5.  **Impact of Limited English:** The English constraint is minimal here. Even if a student struggles with full sentences, they can still write a single word (e.g., "Himalayas") to get credit.
6.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** This is a factor for all questions.

**Comparing with Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 66%: "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India."**
    *   This question is very similar in structure: "Name any two X."
    *   Fundamental Rights are also a core Civics topic, much like major geographical features are core Geography.
    *   Students just need to list the names.
    *   The provided question asks for mountain ranges, which are perhaps even more visually distinct and commonly referred to than specific legal rights for students from weaker sections, some of whom might have less exposure to civics concepts compared to physical geography (which they can literally see or associate with their region).

*   **Pass rate 50%: "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"**
    *   This requires recall from a specific story, and usually full sentences are implied by the question structure.
    *   The mountain range question is simpler because it's a direct fact recall, not something embedded in a narrative.

*   **Pass rate 30%: "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'"**
    *   This requires paragraph writing, multiple details, and good English expression. Our question only requires naming one or two words. Much harder.

*   **Pass rate 15%: "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..."**
    *   This requires comparative analysis and examples, a higher-order thinking skill. Our question is purely recall.

*   **Pass rate 5%: "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'"**
    *   This is open-ended, interpretive, and requires a strong grasp of both English and literary analysis. Much, much harder.

Given that the question asks to "Name any two" and only requires *one* for a 0.5 score, and given the extremely high prominence of the Himalayas (and others like the Aravallis) in general knowledge and Indian curriculum, I anticipate a high pass rate. It is comparable to, if not slightly easier than, naming two Fundamental Rights because mountain ranges are tangible and universally recognized within India. Even students with very basic English should be able to spell at least one name phonetically or correctly.

**Challenging initial assumptions:** My first instinct would be closer to 80-90% because "Himalayas" is so obvious. However, the calibration anchors remind me that 66% is the highest pass rate for *any* question on this exam, even for straightforward fact recall. There will always be blank responses, complete misspellings (though mountains are often proper nouns that don't need "perfect" grammar, just recognizable form), and students who genuinely don't know *any* of them.

Considering the "pass rate 66%" anchor for naming two fundamental rights, naming major mountain ranges is likely in a similar ballpark, perhaps even slightly higher given the general visibility of geography. However, the cap is 66% according to the examples. While a single, common mountain like the Himalayas might be known by many, getting two *recognizable* names from "economically weaker sections with limited English" might push it down slightly from the very highest possible, but not significantly. Many students might only list "Himalaya." The rubric specifically states that naming *one* is sufficient
