I will estimate the proportion of Class 6 students who would answer this question correctly, taking into account the specified student demographics, English limitations, and common biases in difficulty assessment.

The question asks students to rearrange the words "book/reading/a/is/he" to make a meaningful sentence. The correct answer is "He is reading a book." This involves basic English sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object).

Let's break down the difficulty:
1.  **Vocabulary:** All words are extremely common (he, is, a, reading, book).
2.  **Grammar/Syntax:** It requires understanding the typical English sentence order. "He is reading a book" is a very standard present continuous sentence.
3.  **English Proficiency:** While limited English is a factor, forming simple sentences is often one of the first things taught.
4.  **Cognitive Load:** There are only five words, so the rearranging task is not overly complex.
5.  **Anxiety/Blank Responses:** Some students will always leave it blank, as seen in the calibration examples.
6.  **"Never practiced this exact question type":** While direct "rearrange words" might not be practiced daily, the underlying skill of understanding sentence structure is fundamental to learning English.

Let's compare to calibration anchors:
*   **Pass rate 5% ("Write a theme..."):** Requires abstract thinking, deep comprehension, and the ability to articulate a complex idea in written English. Much harder.
*   **Pass rate 15% ("Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources..."):** Requires factual recall of two specific academic definitions, comparative thinking, and providing examples. Still much harder.
*   **Pass rate 30% ("Write a short paragraph... My favorite season"):** Requires generating ideas, connecting them, and writing multiple sentences coherently, often with some level of descriptive vocabulary. This is significantly more demanding than rearranging 5 words. Students who barely read English would struggle immensely here.
*   **Pass rate 50% ("What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"):** Requires factual recall from a specific story. Students need to have understood the story and accurately remembered specific details. If they were absent or didn't understand the story, they'd fail.
*   **Pass rate 66% ("Name any two Fundamental Rights..."):** Requires specific factual recall of names (which can be long and somewhat technical like "cultural and educational rights," "constitutional remedies"). There's a chance students might get one right but not two, or misremember the exact wording.

This "rearrange the words" question is far simpler than all of the calibration anchors, except perhaps parts of the 66% anchor if simplified to "name any basic right." However, naming two *specific* Fundamental Rights is still a memory task that many struggling learners might miss.

Forming a simple SVO sentence in English is very basic. Students are likely introduced to this sentence structure early on. Even students with very weak English often can grasp basic sentence components, especially with common words like "he," "is," "reading," "a," "book."

Challenging assumptions:
*   "Most students could do this." Is this true for someone who barely reads English? Yes, because it uses the most fundamental building blocks of the language. Even a rudimentary understanding of English often involves SVO patterns for basic actions.
*   "Basic concepts aren't basic for struggling learners." While true for some "basic" concepts (like literary themes), simple sentence structure for common words is one of the *most* basic and reinforced concepts.
*   "Exam anxiety causes blank responses." This will happen, lowering the score from what it theoretically could be.
*   "Never practiced this exact question type." Even without direct practice, understanding that "He is reading" describes an action, and "a book" is what's being read, naturally leads to the correct structure for someone who has even a minimal grasp of English word order.

I think the 66% anchor required specific memory ("Name two Fundamental Rights"), which might be harder than assembling a very basic sentence. While some might write "Book is reading he," or "Reading is he a book," the correct structure "He is reading a book" is the most intuitive for even nascent English speakers.

Given that 66% of students could recall two specific (and somewhat academic) Fundamental Rights, a higher percentage should be able to construct a very simple sentence with common words. This is almost foundational to early English comprehension and production.

I will estimate it to be higher than the 66% anchor.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%
