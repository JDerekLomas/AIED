This question tests a specific grammatical transformation from active to passive voice.

Based on the calibration anchors:

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme/Central Idea):** Requires analytical comprehension and articulate expression, which is very difficult for students with limited English.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate Archaeological/Literary Sources):** Requires recalling specific factual knowledge and providing concise definitions/examples. Students struggle with structuring two distinct ideas.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Allows for more open-ended, simpler sentence construction but still requires forming coherent ideas into a short paragraph. Many responses are fragmentary or simple lists.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Requires specific recall of details from a text. The directness makes it easier if the text was understood.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Straightforward recall of commonly taught facts. This is about as "easy" as it gets for content recall.

The active to passive voice transformation is a grammatical concept that requires understanding the structure of both active and passive sentences, identifying the subject, verb, and object, and then rearranging them while changing the verb tense.

**Challenges for these students:**

1.  **Limited English Proficiency:** Even if the concept is taught, the mental load of transforming the sentence accurately in English, considering verb conjugations (blow -> blew -> blown), might be significant.
2.  **Grammar Focus:** Grammar topics, especially transformations, can be challenging even for native speakers, as they require rule application rather than just recall.
3.  **Verb Irregularity:** "Blew" (simple past) becoming "were blown" (past passive) involves the irregular past participle of "blow." Regular verbs would be slightly easier.
4.  **Concept vs. Application:** Students might be able to *state* the rule for passive voice but struggle to *apply* it correctly to a given sentence under exam pressure.
5.  **Lack of Practice:** It's unlikely that all students have extensively practiced this exact transformation or question type to mastery.
6.  **"Basic" but not Easy:** While voice is a fundamental grammar concept, applying it accurately requires a certain level of linguistic sophistication that many struggling learners might not possess.

Comparing it to anchors:

*   It's more complex than recalling two rights (66%) or even three facts from a story (50%).
*   It's arguably harder than writing a short, simple paragraph on a familiar topic (30%), where some fragmented answers still get points.
*   It's probably on par with or slightly easier than differentiating sources (15%), which requires specific recall and clear articulation of two distinct ideas. The active/passive transformation is a single, clear task, but it requires precise execution of grammatical rules.

Considering the average pass rate is 29%, this specific type of precise grammatical transformation with an irregular verb, under limited English proficiency conditions, would likely fall below average. The common errors would include incorrect verb forms ("was blew"), missing "by the wind," or maintaining an active structure.

I'd estimate this closer to the 15-25% range, perhaps slightly above the "differentiate" question due to being a single grammatical rule application rather than two distinct factual differentiations. However, the exact precision required, including the irregular verb, pulls it down.

Let's say 20% for a strong estimate, reflecting the difficulty of accurate grammatical transformation for this demographic. Many students will get part of it right (e.g., "The leaves was blown") but might miss the tense or the participle, leading to a score of 0 on a strict rubric.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 22%
