The question asks students to identify an adjective phrase, but the rubric states that "tiny" is to be identified as an adjective. This mismatch significantly impacts the difficulty, as identifying a single adjective is much easier than identifying an adjective phrase (which in this sentence, could be argued that "a tiny bird" is a noun phrase acting as the subject, where "tiny" is an adjective modifying "bird", but "a tiny" is not a typical "adjective phrase"). Given the rubric explicitly says "tiny" is the correct answer, the question effectively becomes: "Identify the adjective in the sentence."

Let's re-evaluate based on the simpler task of identifying an adjective.

*   **Student background:** Economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate 29%.
*   **Item type:** Identifying a part of speech. This is a common grammar topic taught in elementary/middle school English.
*   **Vocabulary:** "Tiny," "bird," "built," "nest," "balcony" are all very common words. "Adjective phrase" is a more technical term, but if the task is simplified to identifying an adjective, "adjective" is a common grammar term.
*   **Complexity:** Identifying "tiny" as the word describing "bird" is relatively straightforward for someone with basic English grammar knowledge.

**Calibration Anchors Analysis:**

*   **5% Pass Rate (Theme of "The Last Bargain"):** Requires comprehension of a poem and ability to synthesize a theme in written English. This is high-level thinking and writing, much harder than identifying an adjective.
*   **15% Pass Rate (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** Requires knowledge of historical sources, ability to differentiate, and provide examples, all in written English. Moderate difficulty.
*   **30% Pass Rate (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires expressing personal preferences, recalling details (food, clothing), and organizing thoughts into a short paragraph. Demands sustained writing effort and vocabulary.
*   **50% Pass Rate (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Requires recalling specific details from a story. If the story was read in class, this is essentially a memory recall task. Less linguistic output required.
*   **66% Pass Rate (Two Fundamental Rights):** Recalling two specific facts from Civics/Social Studies. This is memory-based, assuming students were taught these rights. Again, limited English production needed, often just listing two items.

**Re-evaluating the current question:**

If the question truly meant "identify an adjective phrase" and expected something more complex than "tiny," the pass rate would be significantly lower, perhaps in the 10-20% range due to the complexity of the grammatical concept for these students.

However, the rubric explicitly makes it easier by scoring "tiny" as correct, meaning the effective question is "Identify the adjective in the sentence."

Compared to the 50% anchor ("Three questions the king wanted to answer"), identifying a simple adjective like "tiny" might be on par or slightly easier. Both require a degree of knowledge recall (grammar rule vs. story detail). The English output required for "tiny" is minimal (just writing the word "tiny").

Compared to the 66% anchor ("Name any two Fundamental Rights"), which is also fact recall, identifying a basic adjective might be slightly harder than just listing two common facts that might be frequently discussed in class. However, the conceptual hurdle of 'adjective' isn't huge. Many students would correctly pick up on "tiny" describing "bird."

Students who barely read English might struggle, but "tiny" is a relatively common adjective taught early on. "Adjective" is also a fundamental grammar term. The short nature of the answer reduces exam anxiety impact, as there's no complex paragraph writing.

Considering that the average pass rate is 29%, a straightforward grammar identification task that avoids complex writing, uses simple vocabulary, and has a minimal output requirement ("tiny"), will likely be above average. The fact that the question specifies "adjective *phrase*" but the rubric accepts a single "adjective" suggests there might be some flexibility in how it was intended or scored. But following the rubric exactly, "tiny" is the answer.

It's simpler than writing a paragraph (30%) or explaining a theme (5%). It's comparable to recalling facts (50%, 66%). The critical factor is whether students understand the term "adjective" and can spot it. Given the basic level of education in Indian government schools, "parts of speech" are fundamental topics.

Let's assume a significant portion of students, even with limited English, would be able to point to the word that describes the bird. The word "tiny" is unambiguous in its function.

**Challenging the assumption:** Could a student who barely reads English identify "
