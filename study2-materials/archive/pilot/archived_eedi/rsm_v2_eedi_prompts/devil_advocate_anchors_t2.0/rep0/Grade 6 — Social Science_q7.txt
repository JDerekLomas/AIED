This question requires two parts to be correct for a score of 1:
1.  Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan.
2.  Explain how *one* of them influences the lives of the people there.

Let's break down the difficulty for each part:

**Part 1: Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan.**
*   **English:** "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan." The language is fairly straightforward. "Natural resources" might be a term they've heard. "Found in Rajasthan" specifies the region.
*   **Knowledge:** Rajasthan is a large, well-known state. Even students with limited specific knowledge of *all* resources might be able to recall "water" (given its scarcity, it's highly salient) or "sand/desert" (which is effectively a resource for things like tourism, building materials, or even just a defining characteristic). "Marble" or "copper" are also fairly famous for Rajasthan.
*   **Likelihood:** I think a significant portion (maybe 50-60%) could correctly name at least two, even if they're generic like water and sand/desert (assuming sand/desert would count). Students might also just name a random mineral if they've heard of mining in the area.

**Part 2: Explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there.**
*   **English:** "explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there." "Explain how... influences" is a more complex demand than just "mention." It requires a cause-and-effect understanding and the ability to articulate it. "Lives of the people there" broadens it but still requires a coherent thought.
*   **Knowledge & Articulation:** If they name water, they might be able to say "lack of water makes farming difficult" or "people have to travel far for water." If they name marble, they might say "people make statues from it" or "it's used for building houses." However, "influences" is a bit abstract, and students might struggle to connect the resource directly to the *lives* in a descriptive way, even if they understand the concept implicitly. Their explanations might be very basic, fragmented sentences, or grammatically incorrect.
*   **Anxiety/Completeness:** This second part is often where students run out of time, confidence, or English proficiency, even if they got the first part right. Many might just list two resources and leave it at that.

**Comparison with Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5%:** "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" This is highly conceptual, requires strong reading comprehension, inferential skills, and abstract thinking. My question is more factual initially, but the explanation part has a degree of abstraction.
*   **Pass rate 15%:** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each." This requires defining two related terms and providing specific examples, involving both recall and basic comparison. My question requires listing resources and *explaining impact*. The "explaining impact" part is harder than "giving an example."
*   **Pass rate 30%:** "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'" This is a personal response, low-stakes knowledge, high-stakes writing. Many score for minimal correct words. My question is factual *and* requires explanation. The word count is not specified, so basic explanations might pass.
*   **Pass rate 50%:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" This is direct recall from a story, likely well-practiced. My question requires general knowledge about a region + explanation, making it more challenging than simple recall.
*   **Pass rate 66%:** "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India." This is pure factual recall of well-taught and generally remembered items. Much simpler than explaining influence.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

My initial gut feeling might be around 30-40% because students "should" know about Rajasthan's resources. However, considering the calibration anchors and the "expert overestimate" warning:

*   The requirement for *two* resources is okay.
*   The "explain how one influences lives" is the real stumbling block. It's more demanding than just giving examples (like the 15% item) and certainly more demanding than mere recall (like the 50% or 66% items).
*   Limited English and exam anxiety will lead to many getting the first part but failing on the explanation, or just giving very minimal, un-rubric-worthy explanations.
*   Many might just list two resources and get no score for failing to explain, or try a very weak explanation that doesn't articulate "influence"
