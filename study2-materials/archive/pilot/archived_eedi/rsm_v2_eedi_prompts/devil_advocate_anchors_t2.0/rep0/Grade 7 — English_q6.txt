Here's my thinking process to arrive at the estimate:

1.  **Analyze the Question:** "Describes the poet’s writing style." This is an analytical question requiring a conceptual understanding of "writing style" and the ability to articulate it in English. The rubric accepts a single descriptive word.

2.  **Consider the Target Audience:**
    *   Class 7 students in Indian government schools.
    *   Mostly economically weaker sections.
    *   Limited English proficiency.
    *   Average pass rate for the *exam* is 29%. This is crucial context.

3.  **Deconstruct the Difficulty:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** Do they know words like "descriptive," "simple," "direct," "informal," or "lyrical"? They might know "simple" more readily than the others.
    *   **Concept of "Writing Style":** This is abstract. Even if they understand the *content* of a poem, categorizing its *style* requires a higher-order thinking skill, usually taught explicitly in literature classes.
    *   **Prior Exposure:** Have they been explicitly taught how to analyze and describe a poet's writing style? Given the context (government schools, limited English), it's less likely this is a common or well-understood concept.
    *   **Poem Context:** The question *implicitly* relies on students having read the poem in question and formed an opinion on its style. Without knowing *which* poem, it's hard to judge, but the general difficulty of style analysis remains.
    *   **Expressing the Answer:** A single word is required, but it must be *relevant and suitable*. This still demands a correct conceptual link.

4.  **Calibrate Against Anchors:**

    *   **Item (5%): Theme/Central Idea.** This is a similar, abstract analytical skill. Requires understanding the deeper meaning of a poem. The 5% rate tells me that identifying a theme is very difficult for these students, even with some allowance for partial answers. Describing *style* feels conceptually related but possibly slightly more accessible if the poem's language is obviously plain or ornate.
    *   **Item (15%): Differentiate archaeological/literary sources.** Requires definitions and examples. More factual/definitional, but still needs structured thought and relevant examples. 15% for differentiating two clear concepts.
    *   **Item (30%): Paragraph "My Favorite Season."** This is creative writing about a personal topic. High fluency is not required to score, but it shows the difficulty in constructing a coherent piece. This is more "expressive" than analytical.
    *   **Item (50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is pure recall of specific information from a story. Many students *can* find specific facts if they've read it. Much easier than analysis.
    *   **Item (66%): Two Fundamental Rights.** Also recall/factual from civics. High pass rate indicates clear, often memorized, factual information is relatively easy.

5.  **Re-evaluate based on calibration and challenges:**
    *   My initial gut might be "well, they just need one word, maybe 'simple'?"
    *   *Challenge:* But do they know what "writing style" means? Do they apply it? Look at the 5% theme question. If abstract ideas like "theme" are only grasped by 5%, then "style" is likely in the same ballpark or slightly higher due to the single-word requirement being less demanding than a sentence or two for a theme.
    *   "Simple" as a style description is one of the most common answers a teacher might expect for basic prose or poetry. If the poem were indeed simple, could they express that? Perhaps, but only if they grasp the concept of style *first*.
    *   The "limited English" factor is huge. Can they *spell* "simple" correctly? Do they know *other* suitable words (descriptive, narrative)?

6.  **Final Estimate Rationale:**
    *   The question demands abstract analysis, similar in cognitive load to identifying a theme (5%).
    *   The single-word requirement makes it slightly less burdensome than crafting a thematic statement.
    *   However, the fundamental concept of "writing style" is likely alien or very weakly understood by most of these students, particularly those struggling with basic English and overall pass rates of 29%.
    *   Many will leave it blank because they don't understand the question (like the 5% item showing "score 0" for completely off answers).
    *   Some might use a general positive word that doesn't really describe style.
    *   Considering the 5% for "theme" and the single-word constraint
