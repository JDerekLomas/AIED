Let's break down the challenge here.

The question asks students to identify an adjective *phrase*. However, the rubric explicitly states that identifying "tiny" as an adjective is sufficient for a full score. This is a crucial discrepancy.

If the question truly required an adjective *phrase*, the answer "a tiny bird" or just "a tiny" could be argued as an adjective phrase modifying "bird." "Tiny" alone is just an adjective.

Given the rubric allows "tiny" alone, the task is much simpler: identify a single adjective.

Now let's apply the calibration anchors and student profile:

*   **Student Profile:** Mostly economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate 29%. Exam anxiety, missed topics, never practiced specific question types are all factors.
*   **"Identify the adjective *phrase*":** The term "adjective phrase" itself is more advanced English grammar. Even if a student knows what an adjective is, they might struggle with the "phrase" part.
*   **Rubric:** The saving grace is that the rubric simplifies it to identifying "tiny."

**Calibration Anchor Analysis:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of a poem):** Requires abstract thinking, comprehension of poetry, and articulate expression in English. Very difficult.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate sources):** Requires recall of specific terms, understanding of differences, and providing examples. Often memorized.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph "My favorite season"):** Allows for simple sentence construction, personal expression, and limited vocabulary. The scoring for the example ("Winter / Sweater / Baju / Hot water / Tea / Gever feali / Hat") shows a high tolerance for minimal, fragmented responses. This suggests that even very basic, broken English can pass.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Requires specific recall from a text. The example responses show direct lifting of phrases, indicating a text was likely provided or the story was very well-known. This is recall, not complex analysis or grammar.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Direct recall of civics knowledge. Again, specific information. Students are likely drilled on these.

**Revisiting the Question with Rubric:**

The question asks for an "adjective phrase." The sentence is "A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony."
The rubric scores 1 for identifying "tiny" as an adjective.

*   **Challenge for "tiny":**
    *   Many students will understand what an adjective is in principle (describing word).
    *   "Tiny" is a relatively common adjective.
    *   Even if they don't know the grammatical term "adjective," they might intuitively pick out the describing word.

*   **Confusion from "phrase":**
    *   This is the major confounding factor. A student might correctly identify "tiny" as describing the bird but *not* understand "adjective phrase," leading them to either give a blank response, or provide a wrong "phrase" because they are overthinking the "phrase" part.
    *   If they literally scan for "a phrase," they might pick "A tiny bird" or "in our balcony" (prepositional phrase), or even just parts of words.

Considering the pass rates, particularly the 30% for the paragraph (which accepts very fragmented, basic English) and the 50% for direct recall, identifying a simple adjective like "tiny" *if they disregard "phrase"* seems moderately difficult for this cohort.

If the question had simply been "Identify the adjective in the sentence," the pass rate would likely be closer to 40-50% because "tiny" is conspicuous and a basic adjective.

However, the inclusion of "phrase" introduces a level of grammatical complexity that would confuse a significant portion of the students, especially those with limited English or who struggle with specific grammatical terminology. Many will get tripped up on "phrase" and either fail to respond correctly or provide a non-adjective phrase. Those who *do* understand what an adjective is might still hesitate or get it wrong because they're looking for more than one word.

I need to calibrate the impact of "phrase" acting as a distractor for a student cohort with limited English, against the leniency of the rubric (allowing a single word).

*   If 50% can do direct recall ("king's questions"), they understand basic sentence parts.
*   If 30% can write a paragraph with extremely broken English, their writing comprehension and expression of grammatical concepts is low.

The prompt specifically warns that experts overestimate students' ability, especially with exact question types and "basic" concepts not being basic. "Adjective phrase" for students with limited English falls squarely into
