I'm going to carefully consider the calibration anchors and the description of the student population.

Here's my thought process:

1.  **Analyze the question:** "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence: book/reading/a/is/he". The correct answer is "He is reading a book." This requires understanding basic English sentence structure (subject-verb-object, present continuous tense).

2.  **Consider the student population:**
    *   Class 6 students in Indian government schools.
    *   Mostly from economically weaker sections.
    *   Limited English.
    *   Average pass rate is about 29%.
    *   Exam anxiety and lack of practice with exact question types are factors.

3.  **Evaluate against calibration anchors:**

    *   **Pass rate 66% (Name two Fundamental Rights):** This is a recall question of known facts. Students might struggle with English spelling, but the core concept is either known or not. The examples show some struggle with spelling but successful recall.
        *   *Comparison:* Rearranging a sentence is more about applying a rule of grammar than recalling facts. While basic, it might trip up those with extremely limited English. However, sentence formation is fundamental.

    *   **Pass rate 50% (What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?):** This is a recall question from a specific story. Students who knew the story could probably pull out the phrases, even with grammatical imperfections. Empty responses still common.
        *   *Comparison:* This rearrangement task is arguably simpler in terms of cognitive load (no prior text to remember). It's just a direct application of syntax.

    *   **Pass rate 30% (Short paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This requires sentence construction and content generation. Even short, broken sentences with poor grammar could score points (e.g., "Winter Sweater Baju..."). Full coherent sentences are hard for many.
        *   *Comparison:* The current question is *much* simpler. Students don't have to generate their own thoughts or even a complete paragraph. They just need to put pre-given words in order. The required sentence "He is reading a book" is very basic. If students can even produce fragmented English in the 30% pass rate example, surely a higher proportion can get this *exact* sentence correct.

    *   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources):** This requires conceptual understanding, examples, and expressing that in English. This is quite abstract for many.
        *   *Comparison:* Much harder than rearranging a simple sentence.

    *   **Pass rate 5% (Write a theme or central idea of "The Last Bargain"):** This requires deep comprehension of a poem, abstract thinking, and articulating a theme in English. Very difficult for this demographic.
        *   *Comparison:* Worlds apart in difficulty.

4.  **Challenging initial assumptions:** My first instinct might be that "most" students (70-80%) should get this, as it's so basic. However, the anchor data, especially the 66% anchor, makes me reconsider. "Name two Fundamental Rights" is factual recall, yet only two-thirds get it right, and some answers show significant struggle with English or content.

    *   The phrase "He is reading a book" is a cornerstone of basic English grammar. They are given all the words.
    *   The alternative incorrect arrangements could be things like "Reading is he a book" or "Book he is reading a." These show a lack of understanding of subject-verb agreement or general sentence structure.
    *   Even if a student doesn't perfectly understand "present continuous," they should at least recognize the Subject-Verb-Object pattern. "He is book reading a" is wrong, but "He is reading a book" is very common.

    *   The "empty response" factor is crucial. For very limited English speakers, even seemingly simple tasks can lead to a blank if they freeze or genuinely don't grasp *any* order.
    *   However, if they know *any* English at all, this is one of the most common sentence structures. If a student gets "Winter Sweater Baju" (30% pass rate item) correct for partial credit, they should have some capacity for sentence recognition. The fact that the average pass rate is 29% implies that a *lot* of students struggle with *everything*.

5.  **Refined estimate:**
    *   It's more complex than recalling facts (66% item), but it doesn't require generative writing like the 30% item.
    *   It's a foundational skill in English.
    *   Considering the low average pass rate and the struggle
