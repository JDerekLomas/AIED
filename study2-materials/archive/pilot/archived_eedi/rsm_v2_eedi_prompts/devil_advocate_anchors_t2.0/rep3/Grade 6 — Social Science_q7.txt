I will apply the lessons from the calibration anchors and the "IMPORTANT" section to estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of the Question:**
*   **Knowledge required:** Students need to recall two natural resources specific to Rajasthan. This requires geographical knowledge.
*   **Explanation required:** They also need to explain how *one* of these resources influences people's lives. This requires a bit more critical thinking and descriptive ability.
*   **English proficiency:** "Mention" and "explain how... influences the lives" are fairly common command words. The vocabulary for common resources like "water," "sand," "marble," "salt" might be familiar, but terms like "gypsum," "mica," "limestone" might be less so. "Influences" could be a stumbling block for some.

**Applying Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract understanding and concise expression in English. Very difficult. Our question is less abstract.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate sources):** Requires recalling two distinct definitions and examples. More conceptual and multi-part. Explaining influence is conceptually similar to giving an example.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Favorite season paragraph):** Requires personal description within specific prompts and maintaining a short paragraph structure. This involves free-form writing on a familiar topic. Many students provided incomplete or very short responses.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted):** Requires recall of specific facts from a story. Many could recall the essence. This question is similar in *recall* to naming two resources.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Requires recalling two specific facts. High recall, little explanation needed.

**Challenging Initial Instincts:**

My first instinct might be: "Rajasthan is known for deserts, so sand and water (or lack thereof) are obvious. Many might also know about minerals. Explaining how water/lack of water influences lives should be easy."

However, remembering the warnings:

*   **Limited English:** "Influences the lives" might be harder than I think. A simple statement like "water helps farming" might not fully satisfy the "influence" part in a nuanced way for all students, even if it is scored 1. Many students might just name two resources without explanation.
*   **"Basic" isn't basic:** Not all students might know specific resources of Rajasthan. While "water" is universal, knowing it as a *natural resource* *in Rajasthan* specifically and how its scarcity defines life is a step. Marble/salt are more specific to Rajasthan.
*   **Anxiety/Absence:** Some will blank or only partially answer (e.g., just name resources).
*   **Never practiced:** While "explain" is common, "explain how [resource] influences lives" specifically might not have been practiced for *this* content.

Let's break down the required knowledge:
1.  **Identify 2 natural resources of Rajasthan:** This is recall. If students have learned about the geography/economy of Rajasthan, they might recall common ones like water, sand, various minerals (marble, salt, copper). This feels akin to "two Fundamental Rights" (66% pass) but perhaps slightly harder because specific geographical knowledge of *Rajasthan* is needed, not just general civic knowledge. However, they only need *two*.
2.  **Explain influence of one:** This adds a layer of description. It needs more than just naming. "Water for crops/drinking," "marble for buildings/economy," "salt for food/economy," "solar/wind energy production." This is a moderate level of explanation, similar to the "differentiate and example" (15% pass) but with a slightly simpler explanation component (influence vs. full differentiation). The "favorite season" (30% pass) suggests students can write a few descriptive sentences if prompted well.

Considering the split:

*   **Many could name at least one resource:** Similar to the 50% anchor, many could recall a fact.
*   **Naming two resources:** This is doable for a significant portion.
*   **Explaining influence:** This is where many might fall short. They might state the obvious but struggle to articulate "influence," or might just state a use case (e.g., "marble for buildings") which might barely count, or not at all depending on strictness. The low performance on paragraph writing (30% anchor, where responses were very rudimentary) suggests sophisticated explanations will be rare.

The closest comparable is the 30% anchor (paragraph on favorite season), where students struggled with structured descriptive writing. This question requires recalling facts *and* then giving a brief explanation. While "water" is easy, linking it to "influences the lives" and writing it
