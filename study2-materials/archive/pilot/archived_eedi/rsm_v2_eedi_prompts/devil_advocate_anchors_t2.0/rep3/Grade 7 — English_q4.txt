I'll walk through my thought process to arrive at the estimated proportion correct.

1.  **Analyze the Question:** "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason." This is a two-part question: a yes/no opinion and then a justification.
    *   **Part 1: Opinion ("Do you think...")** This is generally easy. Most students would probably say "yes" or something equivalent. The "yes/no" part isn't what trips them up.
    *   **Part 2: Justification ("Give one reason.")** This requires students to connect the abstract idea of "the king's questions" to "real life" and articulate a reason. The core of the king's questions is about optimal decision-making and human interaction, which *are* important in real life.

2.  **Consider the Rubric:** "The king wanted to answer (based on the reading passage) the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with. Any valid reason. Max score: 1"
    *   The rubric doesn't require quoting the king's questions directly (though it's implicitly part of the context). The most crucial part is "Any valid reason." This broadens the scope significantly.
    *   Since it's Max score: 1, a minimal, even awkwardly worded but generally sensible, reason would likely score.

3.  **Evaluate Against Calibration Anchors:**

    *   **Item (pass rate 5%): "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'"** This requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and summarizing a complex literary idea. This is *much harder* than our target question. Our question is more concrete ("important in real life") and asks for a simple justification.

    *   **Item (pass rate 15%): "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each."** This requires recall of specific definitions and examples from a potentially taught concept. While definitions can be rote, differentiation implies understanding and comparison, which is harder than our question's "any valid reason." Our question doesn't require technical definitions.

    *   **Item (pass rate 30%): "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.' Talk about what you like to do, what you eat or wear, and w"** This is a creative writing task requiring sustained coherent thought, sentence construction, and specific detail. Many students struggled even to produce full sentences. Our question is much shorter, more direct, and needs only one sentence for a reason.

    *   **Item (pass rate 50%): "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"** This is pure recall from the text. "the right time to do everything, the right thing to do and the right people to work with he will nev" scored 1. This demonstrates that if the students recall the core elements, they get it. Our target question builds on this but *doesn't require exact recall*. It requires understanding *the gist* of those questions and their relevance. If 50% can recall the questions (which implies they understood them to some extent), a significant portion of them should be able to make the simple jump to "why they are important."

    *   **Item (pass rate 66%): "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India."** This is rote recall of common civic knowledge. Very direct. Many scored despite spelling/grammar errors. This is likely easier than our target question because it's a direct memorization task. Our question, while simple, requires a tiny bit of analytical thinking to connect "king's questions" to "real life importance."

4.  **Challenging Initial Instincts:**

    *   My initial gut might be "Oh, this is easy, everyone would say yes and give some generic reason."
    *   **Challenge 1: Limited English.** Even a simple reason needs to be expressed in English. "Helps you make good decisions" or "to live a happy life" are simple, but some might struggle even with that construction.
    *   **Challenge 2: "Basic" concepts not basic.** Connecting "right time/thing/people" to "importance in real life" *is* pretty fundamental to logical thinking. However, the wording might be intimidating, or some students might genuinely struggle to abstract the relevance from a story context.
    *   **Challenge 3: Exam anxiety/blank responses.** A non-trivial number of students give blank responses even for easier questions (see 50% item).
    *   **Challenge 4: Never practiced this exact question type.** While the concept of justifying an opinion is general, explicitly linking
