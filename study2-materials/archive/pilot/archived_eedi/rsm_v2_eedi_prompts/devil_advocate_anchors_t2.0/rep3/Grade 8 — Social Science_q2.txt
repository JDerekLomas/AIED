I'll consider the calibration anchors carefully and challenge my initial assumptions about how familiar students would be with the Harappan Civilization.

The topic of the Harappan Civilization is typically covered in Class 6 or 7 social studies/history textbooks in India. So, the content itself is likely to have been taught. However, the phrasing "Describe one key feature" requires students to recall specific details and articulate them in English, which is a major hurdle.

Let's look at the anchors:

*   **5% pass rate: "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'"** This requires abstract thinking and nuanced English comprehension to identify a theme. The correct responses, while showing some understanding, are quite basic.
*   **15% pass rate: "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each."** This requires differentiating two concepts and providing examples, also relying on good recall and ability to express it in English. Even with a good grasp of the concepts, students might struggle with the "differentiate" part in English.
*   **30% pass rate: "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'"** This is a much more open-ended and personal question, requiring simpler vocabulary. Students can draw on personal experience, which is easier than factual recall. Even here, responses can be very brief or poor.
*   **50% pass rate: "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"** This is pure recall of specific factual details from a story likely read. The question is straightforward, asking "what were the three questions." The language is simple.
*   **66% pass rate: "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India."** This is specific factual recall from a core civic education topic. "Name any two" is also a very direct instruction, making it easier than "describe."

The Harappan Civilization question is a factual recall question, similar in type to the 50% pass rate "Three questions the king wanted to answer" or the 66% "Fundamental Rights." However, "Describe one key feature" is slightly more demanding than "Name any two" or "What were the three questions." It requires slightly more elaborative language than just listing.

Key features like "grid layout," "drainage system," "baked bricks," "citadel and lower town" are quite specific and easily taught. However, a student needs to be able to *articulate* one of these.

Given the limited English and the "economically weaker sections" context:

*   Many students might know "Harappa" or "Mohenjo-Daro" but struggle to articulate a *feature* of their urban planning in English.
*   "Describe" is a slightly higher-order task than "name" or "list."
*   Exam anxiety leading to blank responses is a real factor.
*   Teachers often simplify content, and students might remember "towns were well planned" but not specific aspects like "grid system" or "drainage."

Comparing it:
*   It's harder than "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66%) because "describe" is more involved than "name," even if the content is also important.
*   It's similar in *content recall difficulty* to "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%), but slightly harder due to "describe" vs. "what were the questions." The "king's questions" example could be almost word-for-word recall, whereas "describe a feature" needs some paraphrasing or summarization.
*   It's definitely easier than differentiating two concepts (15%) or finding a theme of a poem (5%).
*   It's a factual recall, not personal opinion like "favorite season" (30%).

Considering the nuance of "describe" and the potential for limited English to struggle with expressing a complex concept even if vaguely understood, I think it will be lower than the 50% for "King's questions." Perhaps between 35-45%.

A key feature like "well-planned city" or "good drainage system" is quite fundamental. However, if a student only writes "planned city," would that count as a "key feature description"? The rubric says "correctly describes one key feature, such as the well-planned grid layout of streets, the advanced drainage system..." "Planned city" alone might be too vague, leading to some answers scoring 0 that have a glimmer of understanding.

Given that even writing about a "favorite season" gets only 30% for a "short paragraph," articulating a factual feature will be challenging. If the question was "Name one feature of Harappan urban planning," it would be higher. "Describe" requires slightly more English competence.
