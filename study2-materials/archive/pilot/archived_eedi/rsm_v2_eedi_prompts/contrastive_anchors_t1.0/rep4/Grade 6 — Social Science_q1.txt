Here's a breakdown of the analysis for the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Basic geographical knowledge of India, specifically awareness of its major physical features like mountain ranges. This is typically covered in Class 6 Social Science/Geography textbooks.
    *   **Compared to anchors:**
        *   "Theme of poem": Requires deeper comprehension and abstract thinking about a literary text, which is significantly harder.
        *   "Archaeological vs. Literary sources": Requires understanding definitions and providing examples, also a higher cognitive load than simple recall.
        *   "My favorite season": Relies on personal experience and simple descriptive writing, making it relatively accessible, but still requires sentence construction.
        *   "Three questions the king wanted to answer": Requires recall of specific plot points from a story, similar to factual recall but from a narrative.
        *   "Fundamental Rights": Requires specific factual recall of civics knowledge, directly comparable to the current question in terms of type of knowledge.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **This question:** "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India." The language is very straightforward. "Name," "two," "major," "mountain ranges," "located in India" are all common words in a geographical context. Students only need to provide the names, not define or elaborate.
    *   **Compared to anchors:**
        *   "Theme of poem": High language demand (understanding abstract concepts, expressing them coherently).
        *   "Differentiate between... by giving one example": Moderate language demand (understanding "differentiate," "sources," providing structured answers).
        *   "Short paragraph... talk about what you like to do, eat or wear": Moderate to high language demand (constructing sentences, linking ideas, specific content requirements).
        *   "What were the three questions...": Low language demand (identifying specific phrases from a text).
        *   "Name any two Fundamental Rights": Low language demand (identical structure and demand to the current question).

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **This question:** Pure recall of factual geographical information.
    *   **Compared to anchors:**
        *   "Theme of poem": Reasoning and application (interpreting a text, synthesizing a theme).
        *   "Differentiate between...": Recall (definitions) and application (examples).
        *   "My favorite season": Application (using personal experience to write).
        *   "Three questions...": Recall (specific plot details).
        *   "Fundamental Rights": Recall (specific civic facts).

*   **Difficulty compared to typical textbook exercises:**
    *   This question is a very common type of "fill in the blanks" or "name the following" exercise found at the end of geography chapters in Class 6 textbooks. It's considered foundational recall for this topic. Students would have encountered maps and lists of mountain ranges multiple times.

**Overall Assessment:**

This question is a straightforward recall task. The language demand is very low, requiring only the production of two common proper nouns. Geography is a core component of Social Science in Class 6, and students are regularly drilled on major physical features.

Compared to the anchors:
*   It's significantly easier than the "Theme of poem" (5%) and "Archaeological vs. Literary sources" (15%) due to lower cognitive load and language demands.
*   It's comparable in recall difficulty to "Fundamental Rights" (66%) and "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%). The difference might lie in the sheer number of possible correct answers for mountain ranges (Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats are all valid and commonly taught), which might make it slightly easier than needing *specific* fundamental rights or *specific* questions. Also, mountain ranges are very visually prominent on maps, aiding recall.
*   It's easier than "My favorite season" (30%) because it requires only short factual answers rather than paragraph construction.

Given the low language barrier, the direct recall nature, the commonality of this topic in Class 6 geography, and the multiple correct options available, a significant portion of students should be able to answer this. It aligns most closely with the "Fundamental Rights" question in terms of cognitive demand and type of knowledge. The visual aid of maps throughout their learning would also be beneficial for geography questions.
