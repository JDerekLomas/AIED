## Contrastive Analysis of the Temperature Question:

Let's break down the difficulty of this specific math problem for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, comparing it to the provided calibration anchors.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition, multiplication.
*   **Time Calculation:** Understanding hours, AM/PM, and calculating duration between two times (e.g., 10 am to 4 pm). This involves understanding a 12-hour clock cycle.
*   **Concept of Temperature Change:** Understanding "increases by X degrees per hour."

**Language Demands:**

*   **Vocabulary:** "temperature," "increases by," "per hour," "morning," "evening." These are relatively common terms, but "per hour" might require careful understanding.
*   **Sentence Structure:** The question is a single, relatively straightforward sentence structure, but it's a multi-step word problem.
*   **English Proficiency:** While the math itself is universal, setting up the problem correctly requires comprehending the English text. For students with limited English, accurately extracting the numbers and operations from the sentence is the primary hurdle.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   **Application:** This is a direct application of arithmetic and time concepts. It's a multi-step word problem, requiring students to identify the relevant information, perform a time calculation, then a multiplication, and finally an addition. It's not just recall of a fact, nor does it require complex abstract reasoning.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Standard Word Problem:** This is a very common type of word problem found in Class 5 or 6 math textbooks. It combines time, rate, and initial/final values.
*   **Multi-step:** The multi-step nature (calculate time difference, then calculate total temperature increase, then add to initial temperature) makes it slightly more challenging than a single-step problem.
*   **No Complex Numbers:** The numbers are whole numbers and easy to work with (30, 2, 6).
*   **Relatable Context:** Temperature is a common concept, and most students would have some intuitive understanding of it changing throughout the day.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" (5% pass rate):** This is extremely difficult. It requires deep comprehension of a poem, abstract thinking, and articulating a complex idea in English. Our math question is far less demanding in terms of language and abstract thought.

*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15% pass rate):** This requires specific historical knowledge, analytical comparison, and a more structured English response. The math question doesn't require domain-specific knowledge outside of basic math.

*   **"Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'" (30% pass rate):** This requires sustained English writing, idea generation, and grammatical coherence over several sentences. While challenging, the topic is personal and accessible. Our math question requires much less extensive writing, just a numerical answer. The "Winter / Sweater / Baju" example shows how even simple answers can score if they address parts of the prompt.

*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50% pass rate):** This is a recall question based on a story, which is generally easier than reasoning or complex application. Students just need to remember specific details. The English phrasing is short and direct. Our math question involves more steps and calculation than pure recall, making it slightly harder if the student struggles with time difference or multiplication.

*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India." (66% pass rate):** This is direct recall of civics knowledge. If students have memorized these, it's very easy. The language demand is minimal. Our math question requires calculation and understanding, not just memorization, which is inherently a bit more prone to error.

**Synthesizing the Difficulty:**

The temperature question sits in a sweet spot. It's a standard word problem, common in math curricula. The numbers are simple. The core challenge lies in:
1.  **Reading Comprehension:** Extracting the numerical data and the operations required from the English text.
2.  **Time Calculation:** Accurately calculating the difference between 10 am and 4 pm (which involves crossing noon). This is a common point of error for this age group.
3.  **Multi-step execution:** Performing multiplication followed by addition.

It's harder than pure recall ("Fundamental Rights," "King's questions") because it requires multiple steps and application. It's significantly easier than abstract interpretation ("poem theme") or extended writing ("favorite season"). It's also
