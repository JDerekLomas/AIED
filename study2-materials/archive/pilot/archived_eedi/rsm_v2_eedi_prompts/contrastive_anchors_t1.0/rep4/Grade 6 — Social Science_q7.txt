Let's break down the question and compare it to the calibration anchors.

**Question Analysis:**

*   **Content:** Social Science (Geography/Environmental Studies). It asks about natural resources in a specific Indian state (Rajasthan).
*   **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   Basic understanding of "natural resources."
    *   Knowledge of Rajasthan's geography and what resources are commonly found there. This might come from specific state-level geography lessons, or general knowledge if they live in or near Rajasthan.
    *   Understanding the concept of "influence" on people's lives.
*   **Language Demands:**
    *   "Mention any two natural resources..." - straightforward recall.
    *   "...and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there." - requires a more descriptive and explanatory response. "Influences" might be a slightly more complex vocabulary word for some, but generally understandable in context.
*   **Cognitive Demand:**
    *   Part 1 (mention two resources): Recall.
    *   Part 2 (explain influence): Application/simple reasoning. They need to connect a resource to a real-world impact.
*   **Difficulty vs. Textbook:** This feels like a very standard textbook question for a unit on Indian geography or states and their resources. It's not a deep analytical question, but requires specific factual recall and a basic explanation.

**Contrastive Analysis with Anchors:**

*   ** vs. 5% (Theme of "The Last Bargain"):** The 5% item is highly abstract and requires interpreting poetry, which is very difficult for this demographic, especially in English. Our question is factual and concrete, making it significantly easier.
*   ** vs. 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** This item requires understanding two distinct concepts and providing examples. It's a "differentiate" question, which is slightly more complex than a "mention and explain." The vocabulary ("archaeological," "literary") is also more specialized. Our question is simpler in its core concepts and vocabulary.
*   ** vs. 30% ("My favorite season" paragraph):** This is a creative writing task. While personal and relatable, it demands sustained writing (6-8 lines) and organization. Many students struggle with generating coherent text, especially in English, as seen in the examples. Our question requires two specific facts and a short, direct explanation, not extensive creative writing. Students can score points even with fragmented answers.
*   ** vs. 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is pure recall from a specific story. If they know the story, it's easy. If not, it's impossible. This is a very direct recall task, similar to the "mention two resources" part of our question. The success rate suggests a good portion of students likely read or heard the story.
*   ** vs. 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is also pure recall of specific facts from Civics. This is a high-recall, high-importance topic, likely explicitly taught. The high pass rate indicates many students successfully remember these.

**Factors influencing our question's difficulty:**

*   **Specificity of Rajasthan:** While natural resources are a general topic, knowing *Rajasthan's* specific resources might be a hurdle if they haven't covered state-specific geography well or if Rajasthan isn't their home state. However, common resources like water (its scarcity in Rajasthan is famous) or marble are quite well-known.
*   **"Explain how it influences":** This part moves beyond simple recall. It requires a rudimentary understanding of cause-and-effect (e.g., "Water scarcity leads to traditional water harvesting and impacts agriculture"). This is harder than just listing.
*   **Rubric:** The rubric for "Max score: 1" is crucial. This means they just need *any* two correct resources and *any* reasonable explanation for one. Even a very brief or somewhat vague explanation might pass, as long as the core idea is there. This makes it easier than if it required a multi-point, detailed explanation.
    *   For example, if a student writes "Water, Marble. Water influences because it is scarce, so people save it," that likely scores 1.

**Comparison Summary:**

Our question is harder than the 66% and 50% items because it involves both recall *and* a simple explanation/application, and requires specific geographical knowledge (Rajasthan). It's easier than the 5% (abstract poetry), 15% (complex differentiation), and 30% (sustained creative writing).

The "explain how it influences" part is the main differentiator that pushes it below the 50-66% range, but the low bar for scoring (Max Score 1
