This question asks students to transform a sentence from active to passive voice. Let's break down its difficulty compared to the calibration anchors and general Class 7 expectations in this context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Understanding of basic sentence structure (subject, verb, object).
    *   Knowledge of active and passive voice concepts.
    *   Understanding of past tense verbs (blew) and their past participle forms (blown).
    *   Grasping the concept of prepositions like "by."
    *   This is a grammatical transformation, a specific skill often taught in English language classes.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   The source sentence ("The wind blew the leaves away") is relatively simple in vocabulary and structure.
    *   The instruction "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice" uses specific grammatical terminology that might be challenging for students with limited English proficiency, *unless* these terms are routinely taught and reinforced in their Hindi-medium English classes. If "active voice" and "passive voice" are concepts they've only encountered a few times or via rote memorization of definitions rather than application, it becomes harder.
    *   The transformation itself requires manipulating word order and verb forms. This is more complex than simply understanding the meaning of a sentence or recalling facts.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of grammatical rules. Students need to recall the rules for converting active to passive voice (object becomes subject, "be" verb + past participle, "by" + original subject) and apply them to a specific sentence. It's not pure recall (like naming rights) nor complex reasoning (like analyzing a poem theme).

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Transformations like active/passive voice are common exercises in English grammar textbooks for Class 7. However, the *average pass rate* of 29% across items indicates that even common textbook exercises might be challenging for this cohort, particularly those requiring specific grammatical transformations.
    *   Compared to the anchors:
        *   **5% anchor (Poem Theme):** This question is *significantly easier* than writing a theme. That requires deep comprehension, analytical skills, and expressive writing, which are very high-level.
        *   **15% anchor (Archaeological vs. Literary Sources):** This question is *easier* than differentiating historical sources. That requires conceptual understanding, factual recall, and the ability to articulate differences with examples. While the concepts might be taught in Hindi, articulating them in English is hard. The voice transformation is a more focused grammatical task.
        *   **30% anchor (My favorite season):** This question is *comparable in difficulty but leans slightly harder* than "My favorite season." "My favorite season" allows for more free-form expression within a general topic, even with limited English, students can string together simple sentences. The voice transformation has *one correct answer* and requires precise application of rules. There's less room for partial credit if the core transformation is wrong.
        *   **50% anchor (King's three questions):** This question is *harder* than recalling the king's three questions. That's a direct factual recall from a story, which is generally easier than applying a complex grammatical rule.
        *   **66% anchor (Two Fundamental Rights):** This question is *harder* than naming two fundamental rights. That's a factual recall task, often memorized, with a low linguistic burden if the terms are known.

*   **Key Challenges:**
    *   Understanding the grammatical terms "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice."
    *   Correctly identifying the subject and object in the active sentence.
    *   Knowing the past participle form of "blew" ("blown").
    *   Correctly forming the passive auxiliary verb ("were blown").
    *   Rearranging the sentence elements correctly.

Given the average pass rate of 29% and the specific linguistic and grammatical demands, this question sits in a tricky spot. Students might recognize the words but fail to apply the transformation. The one-point rubric also means there's no partial credit for getting parts right. Many might attempt it but get the verb form or structure wrong.

I think it's harder than the 30% anchor because that anchor allows for more "simple English" success, whereas this requires precise grammatical understanding. It's easier than the 15% and 5% anchors due to its more constrained nature. It's definitely harder than the 50% and 66% factual recall anchors.

I'd place it somewhere between the 15% and 30% anchors, leaning closer to
