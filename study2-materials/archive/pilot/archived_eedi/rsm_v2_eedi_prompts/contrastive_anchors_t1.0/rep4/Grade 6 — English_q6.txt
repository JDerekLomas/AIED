Here's a breakdown of the analysis for the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?":

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students need to have read and understood (to some degree) the poem from which the line is to be chosen. The difficulty here largely depends on the complexity of the poem itself. If the poem is simple and relatable, this prior knowledge burden is low.
    *   **Compared to anchors:**
        *   "Theme of 'The Last Bargain'" (5%): Requires deep understanding and abstraction. Much higher prior knowledge burden.
        *   "Archaeological vs. Literary sources" (15%): Requires specific historical knowledge and ability to differentiate concepts.
        *   "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%): Requires recall of specific plot points from a story, implying prior reading and comprehension. This is somewhat similar, as it assumes prior engagement with a text.
        *   "Fundamental Rights" (66%): Requires recall of specific civic information.
        *   "My favorite season" (30%): Requires personal experience, not specific prior knowledge from a text.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **"Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"**:
        *   "Which line...": Straightforward question.
        *   "...do you like the most": Uses common vocabulary ("like," "most"). "Most" might be tricky for some, but generally understandable in context.
        *   "...and why?": This is the primary language challenge. Students need to be able to articulate a reason. This requires expressive language beyond simple recall. They don't just state a fact; they have to justify a preference.
        *   **Response requirement**: The rubric ("Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why") means they need to *quote or paraphrase* a line (easy for recall if they remember it) and then *explain their reasoning*. Explaining "why" in English, even simply, is a hurdle for students with limited proficiency. Simple, direct reasons might be acceptable, but forming a coherent sentence or two can be hard.
    *   **Compared to anchors:**
        *   "Theme..." (5%): Very high language demand for abstract expression.
        *   "Differentiate..." (15%): High language demand for comparison and example giving.
        *   "Short paragraph on 'My favorite season'" (30%): Requires sustained writing (6-8 lines) on a personal topic. This is a higher writing demand than just "why." However, the *vocabulary* might be simpler as it's about everyday life.
        *   "What were the three questions..." (50%): Pure recall. Low language demand beyond listing.
        *   "Name any two Fundamental Rights..." (66%): Pure recall. Very low language demand.

*   **Type of Cognitive Task:**
    *   **"Which line...and why?"**: This is a combination of **recall** (remembering a line from the poem) and **reasoning/personal opinion/application**. It's not just stating a fact; it asks for a personal connection and justification. This makes it more complex than pure recall.
    *   **Compared to anchors:**
        *   "Theme..." (5%): High-level reasoning and synthesis.
        *   "Differentiate..." (15%): Application of knowledge and analytical comparison.
        *   "My favorite season" (30%): Personal opinion and descriptive writing (application of language skills).
        *   "Three questions..." (50%): Pure recall.
        *   "Fundamental Rights" (66%): Pure recall.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Many Class 6 textbooks include "comprehension questions" that ask for recall (e.g., "Who said this?", "What happened next?").
    *   Questions asking for personal opinion and justification ("Do you agree?", "What do you think?") are also common but often come after basic comprehension checks and are generally considered slightly more challenging because they require more than just finding the answer in the text.
    *   The "why" aspect elevates it from simple recall. Students are used to answering factual questions. Expressing a personal preference and a reason for it, especially in English, is less formulaic.
    *   The rubric's leniency (Max score 1.5, suggesting even partial answers might get credit) helps. A simple quote + a very basic "I like it because it is good" might receive some credit.

**Synthesis and Estimate:**

The question asks for a personal response and a justification.
