Here's a breakdown of the question "Who lived inside the book?" to estimate the proportion of Class 6 students in Indian government schools who would answer it correctly:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Text Comprehension:** The student needs to have read and understood a story where a magical fairy lives inside a book. This is crucial. If the story wasn't covered, or they didn't comprehend that specific detail, they cannot answer. Given the context of an exam, it's highly likely this question refers to a text *that was taught* or is part of the curriculum.
    *   **Vocabulary:** The words "who," "lived," "inside," and "book" are very basic English vocabulary for a Class 6 student. "Fairy" might be slightly less common but is often introduced in children's stories.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Simplicity:** The question is extremely simple, direct, and uses basic sentence structure (Who + verb + prepositional phrase). There are no complex grammatical structures, abstract concepts, or idiomatic expressions.
    *   **Response Format:** The required answer is a simple noun phrase ("a magical fairy" or "fairy"). It doesn't require a full sentence, paragraph, or any complex explanation.
    *   **Limited English Proficiency:** For students with limited English, this question is about as accessible as it gets for text-based comprehension. The core words are likely known. The main barrier would be if they fundamentally didn't understand the story itself in English.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** This is a direct recall question. The information "who lived inside the book" is a factual detail from the story. It requires no application of concepts or higher-order reasoning.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very common type of comprehension question found at the end of story chapters in Class 6 textbooks. It's usually among the easiest questions, designed to check if students grasped the basic plot points. It's much simpler than differentiating between historical sources, writing a paragraph, or identifying a poem's theme.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain."** This requires abstract thinking, synthesis, and expressing a complex idea. Much harder.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources.** Requires understanding two distinct concepts, providing definitions/characteristics, and examples. More complex vocabulary and analytical thinking.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph on "My favorite season."** Requires sentence construction, organization of ideas, vocabulary, and sustained writing. While personal, it demands more generative language skills.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is also a recall question, but it asks for *three* specific details, which might be slightly harder to remember accurately than just *one* character. However, the structure is similar.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights.** This is direct recall of specific names (though possibly learned in Hindi). It's a list item, similar to "who lived inside X" in its directness. The pass rate is high, suggesting that if students know the content, the English barrier for naming two items is low.

**Conclusion:**

This question is a very straightforward, direct recall question about a basic plot point. The language demands are minimal. If the students have been taught the story and paid attention, they should be able to answer this. It's simpler than the "three questions the king wanted" (50%) because it only asks for one detail, and potentially easier than naming "two Fundamental Rights" if the story was very engaging and the character memorable. The main risk factor is if the story itself was poorly understood or not taught well. Given the 50% anchor, this question, asking for a single, prominent character, should be at or above that level.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60%**
