Here's an analysis of the "My Favourite Hobby" question compared to the calibration anchors, followed by the estimated proportion correct:

### Contrastive Analysis of "My Favourite Hobby" Question:

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Minimal factual knowledge:** Unlike the history differentiation or the king's questions, this question does not require recall of specific academic facts. It's entirely personal.
*   **Concept of "hobby":** Students are expected to understand what a hobby is. This is a common and relatively simple concept, likely introduced in earlier grades or through general life experience.
*   **Basic sentence structure for personal expression:** Students need to be able to express personal preferences and simple routines.

**Language Demands:**
*   **Simple vocabulary:** The core words ("favourite," "hobby," "when," "why," "enjoy") are foundational and likely within the vocabulary of most Class 7 students, even with limited English proficiency.
*   **Sentence construction:** Students need to form 4-5 coherent sentences. This is a common task in basic English writing.
*   **Paragraph structure:** The prompt explicitly asks for a "short paragraph." This requires some understanding of how sentences link together to form a cohesive text, but the rubric is quite lenient (just needs to "clearly mention" the points).
*   **No complex grammar or abstract concepts:** The question avoids passive voice, conditional clauses, or advanced descriptive language.
*   **No specific literary analysis or deep comprehension:** Unlike the "The Last Bargain" theme question, there's no need for interpretation or inferencing.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
*   **Recall (personal):** Students are recalling their own personal hobby, when they do it, and their reasons for enjoying it. This is a very direct and personal form of recall.
*   **Application (basic writing skills):** Students are applying fundamental English writing skills to express personal information.
*   **Minimal Reasoning:** There's no complex reasoning required beyond linking cause and effect for "why I enjoy it."

**Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   **Very common exercise:** Writing about personal topics like "My Favourite Hobby," "My School," "My Best Friend," or "My Favourite Season" (similar to the 30% anchor) is a staple of English language learning in Indian schools, especially at this level. These are often used for basic composition practice.
*   **Similar to "My Favourite Season" (30% pass rate):** Both require writing a short paragraph on a personal topic, addressing specific prompts (what you like to do/eat/wear vs. what it is/when/why). The length requirement is also similar (6-8 lines vs. 4-5 sentences, which are roughly equivalent).
*   **Less demanding than "Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" (15% pass rate):** That question requires specific academic knowledge, comparative analysis, and more precise vocabulary.
*   **More demanding than "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66% pass rate):** That is pure recall of two specific facts. This requires sentence construction and slightly more extended writing.
*   **Less demanding than "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50% pass rate):** While also factual recall, it requires remembering a specific plot detail from a story, which can be hit or miss depending on recent revision or comprehension of that particular text. "My Favourite Hobby" is self-generated.

### Factors Making it Easier:
*   **Highly personal and self-referential:** Students don't need to learn new information; they draw from their own lives. This reduces the cognitive load of information retrieval.
*   **Common topic:** Most students will have a hobby or can easily invent one for the purpose of the exam.
*   **Clear prompts:** "What it is," "when you do it," and "why you enjoy it" are straightforward questions that guide the student's writing.
*   **Simple English required:** The vocabulary and grammar needed are basic.
*   **Low bar for scoring (Max score: 1):** The rubric is quite forgiving, simply requiring the points to be "clearly mention[ed]" in a "complete paragraph." Even a grammatically imperfect but comprehensible response would likely score 1.

### Factors Making it Harder:
*   **Extended writing:** It requires more than just recalling facts or single words. Students need to construct multiple sentences and link them into a paragraph.
*   **Paragraph coherence:** While the rubric is lenient, some students might struggle to structure their thoughts into a cohesive paragraph, especially those with very limited writing practice.
*   **Basic English comprehension of the prompt:** While simple, a few students might misinterpret "hobby" or struggle with the "when" and "why" aspects if their English
