Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Poetry analysis:** Students need to have some foundational understanding of how to analyze poetry, specifically identifying aspects like "writing style." This is a higher-order skill than simple recall.
    *   **Vocabulary for literary analysis:** They need to know words to describe writing styles in English (e.g., simple, descriptive, informal, direct). This can be challenging even for native speakers at this age if not explicitly taught.
    *   **Reading comprehension of the poem:** They must have understood the poem "The Last Bargain" well enough to form an opinion on its style. The poem itself is likely from their curriculum, but understanding it deeply enough for stylistic analysis is another matter.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Understanding the question:** "Describes the poet's writing style" is fairly direct, but "writing style" itself is an abstract concept. Students might understand "what the poet wrote" but struggle with "how the poet wrote it."
    *   **Generating an answer in English:** Even if they grasp the concept, finding an appropriate English word to articulate the style (e.g., "simple," "descriptive") can be very difficult if their vocabulary is limited. They might know the *Hindi* equivalent for "simple" but not the English.
    *   **Abstract vs. Concrete:** This question asks for an abstract description rather than concrete facts, which is generally harder for language learners.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   This is primarily **application and reasoning**. It's not recall (like naming fundamental rights or questions the king asked). It requires students to apply their understanding of literary concepts to a specific text and reason about its characteristics. This is a significantly higher cognitive demand.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 7 English textbook exercises in India often focus on:
        *   Literal comprehension (e.g., "What did the king want?"). (Similar to the 50% pass rate item)
        *   Vocabulary building (matching, fill-in-the-blanks).
        *   Grammar exercises.
        *   Simple creative writing (like "My favorite season," which has a 30% pass rate but requires less analytical thought and more personal expression).
        *   Identifying themes (like the 5% pass rate item, which is very abstract and yielded poor results).
    *   "Describing writing style" is more sophisticated than most basic textbook questions. It's closer to the difficulty of "Write a theme or central idea" (5% pass rate) but perhaps slightly easier because "style" might be perceived as less profound or abstract than "theme." However, the requirement to use a specific descriptive word (e.g., "simple," "direct") adds a vocabulary challenge that "theme" might not have in the same way (students might use a phrase for theme).

**Comparison to Anchors:**

*   **vs. 5% item (Theme):** This question is similar in its abstract nature and the need for literary analysis, but "style" might be slightly more approachable than "theme" for some students as it relates more directly to how the words are arranged. However, the vocabulary demand for "style" is quite specific.
*   **vs. 15% item (Archaeological vs. Literary sources):** That item required differentiation and examples, demanding factual knowledge and some comparison. This "style" question is more subjective and requires interpretation, which is generally harder for these students.
*   **vs. 30% item (My favorite season):** That was personal expression, allowing for simpler language and less analytical thinking. This "style" question is much harder.
*   **vs. 50% item (King's questions):** That was direct recall from a story. This "style" question is much harder.
*   **vs. 66% item (Fundamental Rights):** That was direct recall of memorized facts. This "style" question is incomparably harder.

Considering the abstract nature, the need for interpretation, the specific vocabulary required for descriptive words, and the likely limited exposure to such analytical questions in their curriculum, this question will be very challenging. The average pass rate is 29%, but this item is significantly above average difficulty. It has similar cognitive demands to the "theme" question (5% pass rate) but perhaps with a slightly lower linguistic barrier if a student can manage to convey "simple" or "easy to understand" even imperfectly. However, the rubric demands a "suitable and relevant word," which emphasizes the vocabulary.

My initial thought is closer to the 5-10% range. While "style" might be marginally less abstract
