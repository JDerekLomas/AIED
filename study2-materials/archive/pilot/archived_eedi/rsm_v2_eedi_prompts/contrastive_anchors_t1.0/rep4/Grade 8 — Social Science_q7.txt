Let's break down the question and its difficulty for Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students should have covered the Battle of Plassey (1757) in their history curriculum. This is a foundational event in Indian history concerning the British Raj. They should know *what* it was and *who* was involved (British, Nawab of Bengal, Mir Jafar).
    *   **Less certain:** Understanding the *implications* of the battle, specifically how it contributed to the *expansion of British power*. This moves beyond mere recall of facts to understanding cause-and-effect and historical significance. The concept of "political dominance" or "puppet nawab" might be familiar, but applying it specifically to Plassey could be a stretch for some.

2.  **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   The question uses relatively straightforward English ("How did X contribute to Y?"). No particularly complex vocabulary or sentence structure.
    *   Key terms like "Battle of Plassey," "contribute," "expansion," "British power," and "India" are common in the history context.
    *   The rubric's terms ("political dominance/control," "puppet nawab") are also standard historical vocabulary, but applying them accurately requires conceptual understanding.
    *   Students might struggle with articulating their understanding coherently in English, even if they grasp the concept in Hindi. The brevity of the required answer (Max score: 1) helps somewhat, but clear expression is still needed.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **recall and application/reasoning**.
        *   **Recall:** Students need to recall the outcome of the Battle of Plassey.
        *   **Application/Reasoning:** They then need to apply that knowledge to explain *how* it led to the expansion of British power. This requires understanding the causal link – not just that the British won, but that their victory had specific political consequences (e.g., control over Bengal, installation of a compliant ruler). It's more than just a factual statement; it's an explanation of historical impact.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical textbook exercises might ask "When was the Battle of Plassey?" (Recall, easy), "Who fought in the Battle of Plassey?" (Recall, easy), or "What was the result of the Battle of Plassey?" (Recall, moderate).
    *   This question ("How did... contribute to...") is a step beyond simple recall. It requires a more analytical understanding of the event's significance. It's a common type of question found in chapter-end exercises or exams, but it's usually considered a higher-order thinking question than pure fact retrieval.
    *   The expectation for a single point often focuses on a key outcome, like control over Bengal or the puppet government, which is a fairly direct consequence.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** This requires deep interpretive understanding and abstract thinking, which is very hard. Our question is more factual and cause-and-effect.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** This requires defining and exemplifying two distinct concepts. While conceptual, it's about definition and classification. Students might mix them up or provide insufficient examples. Our question is about a specific historical event's impact.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (My favorite season - short paragraph):** This is a creative writing task requiring personal expression and adherence to structural guidelines. English fluency is crucial here for a good response. The question about Plassey is more about historical knowledge than creative writing. Students might write less for "favorite season" if they have poor English.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is direct recall from a story. If they read and remember the story, it's quite straightforward. The difficulty here likely comes from not having read/remembered the specific story or struggling with direct recall of multiple items. Our question requires more than just recalling facts; it requires explaining significance.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is direct recall of specific, well-taught constitutional facts. This is generally considered "easy" if the content has been covered adequately.

**Conclusion:**

The question on the Battle of Plassey is more challenging than direct recall (like Fundamental Rights or the King's questions) because it demands an understanding of *causation* and *consequences* rather than just facts. It's not as abstract or interpretive as finding a poem's theme, nor does it require extensive creative writing in
