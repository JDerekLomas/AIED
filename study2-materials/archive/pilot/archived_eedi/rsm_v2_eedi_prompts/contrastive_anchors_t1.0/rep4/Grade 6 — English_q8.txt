Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimate:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic English sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object).
    *   Understanding of common English words: "he," "is," "reading," "a," "book." These are very high-frequency words typically introduced early in English language learning.
    *   No specific factual content or advanced vocabulary is required.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** All words are extremely common and likely within the vocabulary of most Class 6 students who have had even basic English instruction.
    *   **Grammar/Syntax:** The core challenge is rearranging words into a grammatically correct English sentence. This is a fundamental skill in English language learning. The target sentence "He is reading a book" uses the present continuous tense, which is typically taught early.
    *   **Cognitive Load:** The task is straightforward rearrangement. There's no complex reasoning, inference, or deep comprehension required. It's a direct application of basic grammatical rules.
    *   **Ambiguity:** There's very little ambiguity. While "A book he is reading" might be grammatically plausible in some poetic contexts, the most natural and expected "meaningful sentence" is the SVO order. The rubric confirms this direct SVO structure.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   Primarily **Application**. Students need to apply their knowledge of basic English sentence structure. It's not pure recall (like definitions) or complex reasoning.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very common type of exercise found in early English language textbooks, often in Class 3, 4, or 5. By Class 6, students should have encountered and practiced this many times. It's generally considered a foundational exercise to reinforce sentence structure.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain."** Requires advanced comprehension, abstract thinking, and sophisticated English expression. Much harder.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate archaeological/literary sources.** Requires recall of definitions, understanding of historical concepts, and structured explanation. Significantly harder in terms of both content and language demands.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Paragraph on "My favorite season."** Requires sustained writing, idea generation, organizing thoughts, and using descriptive language. While some students might score with fragmented answers, a full paragraph is a much higher demand. This rearrangement task is much simpler.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer.** Requires recall of specific plot details from a story. This is a recall task. The language of the question is simple, but it depends entirely on having read and remembered the specific details of "The Three Questions" story.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name two Fundamental Rights.** Requires specific recall of civic knowledge. The concept itself (Fundamental Rights) might be complex, but "naming" two is a direct recall if studied. The language demand to produce the names is low.

**Conclusion:**

This sentence rearrangement task is significantly easier than all the provided anchors, except possibly the "Fundamental Rights" if students have rote-learned them. The words are very basic, the sentence structure (SVO) is fundamental, and it's a very common exercise. It doesn't require deep comprehension, creative writing, or specific factual recall beyond basic English grammar.

Given that the average pass rate across items is 29%, and this item is foundational, high-frequency, and very simple, it should perform much better than average. The 66% anchor is about specific recall of civic content; this is more about basic language structure. Students with even minimal English exposure should be able to form "He is reading a book." The only major barrier would be absolute lack of English instruction or severe literacy issues. However, if they are taking an English exam, some baseline is expected.

I expect a substantial portion of students to correctly assemble this basic sentence.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%**
