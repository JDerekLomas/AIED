**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic understanding of decomposition/rotting of organic matter.
    *   Awareness that living things (microbes) cause decomposition.
    *   Some understanding of the concept of "soil health" and how organic matter contributes to it (e.g., nutrients, water retention).
    *   This is typically covered in Class 6-8 science chapters on waste management, ecosystems, or soil.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   The question uses relatively straightforward English ("collected waste," "pit," "notice any change," "beneficial for soil health").
    *   "Evaluate" might be a slightly more complex verb, but the context makes it clear they need to explain *why* it's beneficial.
    *   Students need to be able to articulate the concepts of decomposition and its benefits, which can be challenging for those with limited English, even if they understand the science. They might struggle with specific vocabulary like "decompose," "nutrients," "fertility," or "microbes."

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   **Recall:** Students need to recall the concept of decomposition and its products.
    *   **Application:** They apply this knowledge to the specific scenario of a "gardener collecting waste in a pit."
    *   **Reasoning/Evaluation:** They need to reason about *why* the changes occur and *evaluate* the benefits for soil health. This involves linking decomposition to nutrient cycling and soil improvement. It's not just a simple recall; it requires connecting concepts.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a common conceptual question in environmental science/biology at this level.
    *   Textbooks often have diagrams of composting pits or questions about how organic waste is managed.
    *   The "give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial" part elevates it slightly above a simple recall question like "What is decomposition?" It requires a more complete explanation and justification.
    *   The maximum score of 0.5 for simply suggesting "significant changes" means that a minimal, albeit correct, observation of change is enough to get the score. This lowers the bar considerably compared to needing to fully explain the *why* and *how*. If the full explanation were required, the pass rate would be much lower. The question effectively asks: "Will there be a change?" which is easy, and "Is it good for soil?" also relatively easy.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" (5%):** This requires abstract thinking, literary interpretation, and strong English comprehension. Much harder.
*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15%):** Requires precise definitions, comparative analysis, and examples. More demanding in terms of structured knowledge and vocabulary.
*   **"Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'" (30%):** Requires creative writing, sentence construction, and sustained output. The difficulty is in the writing quality and length. Many students can list things (like the "Winter, Sweater" example), but getting a coherent paragraph is harder.
*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%):** This is pure recall from a specific story, likely from their English textbook. If they know the story, it's easy. If not, impossible. The partial credit for one or two points makes it more achievable. This question has a low language barrier *if* they know the content.
*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India." (66%):** This is straightforward recall of key social science facts. The language is simple, and the concepts are usually drilled. Very high success rate if taught.

**Applying to the Target Question (Score 0.5 for just "gardener will notice significant changes"):**

Given the low bar for scoring (just noticing change), the question becomes quite accessible.
*   Most students, even from economically weaker sections, have some real-world experience or observation of plant matter rotting. They know waste doesn't stay fresh forever.
*   The concept of things decaying in a pit is intuitive.
*   The connection to "beneficial for soil health" is also generally taught as part of basic environmental science/agriculture.
*   The language demands are moderate, but the core idea of "change" and "beneficial" is relatively simple.

The main hurdle would be articulating it in English. However, for 0.5 marks, a simple "Yes, it will change" or "It will rot" would likely suffice if interpreted generously. The common experience of observing decomposition (e.g.,
