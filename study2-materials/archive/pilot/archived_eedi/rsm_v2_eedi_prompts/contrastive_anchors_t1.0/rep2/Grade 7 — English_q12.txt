Here's a breakdown of the analysis for the target question:

**Target Question:** Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice:\nThe wind blew the leaves away.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Understanding of basic sentence structure (subject, verb, object).
    *   Familiarity with the concept of active and passive voice (even if not by name, then by recognizing the transformation).
    *   Knowledge of past tense verbs and their past participle forms (blew -> blown). This is a key hurdle.
    *   Understanding of prepositions like "by."
    *   Implicitly, the ability to identify the agent and recipient of the action.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "wind," "blew," "leaves," "away" are relatively common words for Class 7. "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" are technical terms that many students might not have formally learned in English, especially in Hindi-medium schools. They might recognize the *task* if they've practiced similar transformations, even if they don't know the terminology.
    *   **Grammar:** This question directly tests a complex grammatical transformation. Students need to:
        *   Identify the object ("the leaves") and make it the new subject.
        *   Identify the tense (past simple) and form the correct "to be" verb (were).
        *   Use the past participle of the main verb ("blown").
        *   Reintroduce the original subject as an agent ("by the wind").
        *   Maintain the adverb ("away").
    *   **Instructions:** "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice" - The technical terms "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" are the most challenging part of the instruction. If a student doesn't know what these terms mean, they won't even know what the question is asking, regardless of their grammatical understanding. This is a significant barrier.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of grammatical rules. Students need to recall the rules for voice transformation and then apply them to a specific sentence. It requires more than simple recall of facts.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Voice transformation is a standard grammar topic taught around Class 6-8. However, the *explicit instruction* to "change from Active Voice to Passive Voice" using these specific technical terms might be more common in higher-level English grammar books or those with a stronger emphasis on formal grammar. Many textbooks might present exercises simply as "Rewrite the following sentences..." or "Transform the sentences..." without explicitly naming the voices, or they might name them but not emphasize the terms for students from economically weaker sections.
    *   The sentence itself ("The wind blew the leaves away") is fairly straightforward in terms of vocabulary and structure. The main challenge is the correct application of the passive voice rules, especially the irregular past participle "blown" and the correct auxiliary verb "were."

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **5% Anchor (Theme of a poem):** Requires deep comprehension, abstract thinking, and sophisticated English expression. Much harder than the target.
*   **15% Anchor (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** Requires recall of specific social science terms, definition, and examples. It's factual recall and basic differentiation, but the terms themselves are likely specialized. The target is a grammatical application. The technical terms "active/passive voice" in the target question are analogous to "archaeological/literary sources" in this anchor – if you don't know the terms, you're stuck.
*   **30% Anchor (Short paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This is a creative writing task requiring simple paragraph construction, expression of personal preference, and basic vocabulary. It's relatively open-ended and forgiving on minor grammatical errors if the overall meaning is conveyed. The target is very specific and less forgiving. The 30% anchor is likely easier because it doesn't have a single "right" answer and allows for simpler English.
*   **50% Anchor (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is direct recall from a story. If they read the story and remembered, it's easy. If not, it's impossible. The target requires application, not just recall. This anchor is likely easier for those who know the story.
*   **66% Anchor (Name two Fundamental Rights):** Direct recall of specific facts from civics/social science. If they memorized them, it's easy. This is a relatively high-frequency topic. The target requires more active manipulation of language.
