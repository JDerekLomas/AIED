Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Poem Comprehension:** Students need to have understood the *meaning* and *tone* of "The Last Bargain" to infer the poet's writing style. This poem, by Rabindranath Tagore, often uses somewhat metaphorical or philosophical language, even if presented simply.
    *   **Vocabulary for "Writing Style":** Students need to understand what "writing style" means in this context and have a basic English vocabulary to describe it (e.g., simple, descriptive, metaphorical, lyrical, direct). This is a higher-order concept than just recalling facts.
    *   **General English Proficiency:** Basic reading comprehension of the question "Describes the poet's writing style" is required.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   **Abstract Concept:** "Writing style" is an abstract concept. It's not a concrete noun or a simple action. This makes it inherently more challenging for students with limited English proficiency (LEP). They might struggle to grasp what the question is even asking.
    *   **Expressing Nuance:** Even if they understand the concept, finding the *right* English word to describe the style (e.g., "simple," "descriptive," "poetic," "metaphorical") can be difficult if their vocabulary is limited to very basic terms.
    *   **Comparison to Anchors:**
        *   **5% anchor ("Write a theme..."):** This is also abstract and requires sophisticated comprehension and articulation. The target question is similar in its demand for abstract thought, though perhaps slightly less complex than articulating a "theme" which often involves deeper interpretation.
        *   **15% anchor ("Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..."):** This requires specific factual recall and comparison of definitions, which is less abstract than describing a writing style. The target question is harder.
        *   **30% anchor ("My favorite season"):** This is personal expression on a familiar topic, much easier as it doesn't require deep comprehension of a text or abstract vocabulary. The target question is significantly harder.
        *   **50% anchor ("three questions the king wanted to answer"):** This is direct recall from a story. Much easier than inferring a writing style. The target question is much harder.
        *   **66% anchor ("Name any two Fundamental Rights"):** This is direct factual recall, very straightforward. The target question is vastly harder.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   This question primarily demands **reasoning** and **application** of comprehension. Students must read and understand the poem, then synthesize that understanding to infer how the poet uses language. It's not simple recall. It also involves an element of **expression** to articulate that reasoning using appropriate vocabulary.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 7 English textbook exercises for poems often focus on:
        *   Direct comprehension questions (e.g., "What did the old man offer the speaker?").
        *   Identifying literary devices (e.g., "Find an example of alliteration").
        *   Recalling facts about the poet or poem.
        *   Writing summaries.
    *   Describing a "poet's writing style" is a more advanced literary analysis task, often introduced at a higher level or in more advanced sections. It requires a deeper, analytical engagement with the text than many standard exercises. For students with LEP, this is particularly challenging as they might be focused simply on translating words rather than understanding stylistic choices.

**Conclusion:**

This question is significantly harder than most of the calibration anchors, especially for students with limited English proficiency. It requires:
*   Strong comprehension of a poem (which itself can be challenging).
*   Understanding an abstract literary concept ("writing style").
*   Having appropriate English vocabulary to articulate that style.
*   Moving beyond simple recall to analytical reasoning.

Given that the average pass rate is 29% and questions requiring abstract thought and good English expression (like the 5% theme question) are very low, this question will likely fall on the lower end of the spectrum. While "writing style" might seem like a simple concept to a native speaker, for an LEP student, it's a significant hurdle. Even if they grasp the general tone, finding a single, appropriate English word will be tough.

I expect this to be closer to the "theme" question in difficulty, perhaps slightly easier because a single word or short phrase is accepted, rather than a full theme statement.
