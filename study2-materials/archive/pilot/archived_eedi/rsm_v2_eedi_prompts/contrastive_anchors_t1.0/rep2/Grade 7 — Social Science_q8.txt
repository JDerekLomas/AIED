Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion of correct answers:

## Contrastive Analysis of "Main occupations of people in rural Rajasthan"

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Basic understanding of "rural areas":** Students need to grasp that "rural" refers to villages, not cities. This is likely covered in Social Science.
*   **Knowledge of Rajasthan:** They need to know that Rajasthan is a state in India. This is fundamental geography.
*   **Common occupations:** Students should have a general idea of common livelihood activities, especially those prevalent in their own country's rural settings.
*   **Specific knowledge of Rajasthan's rural economy:** This is the core knowledge required. They would have learned this in their Social Science (Geography/Economics) curriculum, likely in chapters about Indian states, diverse livelihoods, or regional geography. Rajasthan is known for its arid/semi-arid climate, which heavily influences its agriculture and animal husbandry. Handicrafts are also a very prominent feature.

**Language Demands:**
*   **"Main occupations":** Straightforward vocabulary.
*   **"Rural areas of Rajasthan":** Clear geographical context.
*   **"Describe any one in brief":** Requires simple sentence construction and basic descriptive ability in English.
*   **Overall:** The English is quite simple and direct. It avoids complex sentence structures or abstract concepts. This is a significant advantage for students with limited English proficiency compared to questions involving poetry analysis or philosophical differentiation (like the 5% or 15% items).

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
*   **Recall (primary):** This is predominantly a recall question. Students need to remember factual information about the livelihoods in a specific region of India, which is standard Social Science content.
*   **Description (secondary):** The "describe any one in brief" part requires a very basic level of descriptive recall rather than deep application or complex reasoning. They just need to state a characteristic or two.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   **Typical:** This question is highly typical of textbook exercises in Social Science for Class 7. Chapters on geography, states of India, or diverse livelihoods often ask students to identify occupations in different regions.
*   **Direct and factual:** It's not a higher-order thinking question that requires synthesis or critical analysis. It's a direct information retrieval task.
*   **Similar to "Fundamental Rights" (66%):** Both require recall of factual information that is explicitly taught in Social Science. "Fundamental Rights" is perhaps slightly easier because it's about rights applicable across India, whereas Rajasthan's occupations are region-specific, though still a core part of the curriculum. However, the *type* of task is very similar.
*   **Easier than "Differentiate archaeological/literary sources" (15%):** That question requires not just recall but also understanding the distinction and providing examples, a slightly more complex cognitive task.
*   **Easier than "Theme of a poem" (5%):** That requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and expressing a conceptual idea, which is significantly harder.
*   **Slightly harder than "King's three questions" (50%):** While both are recall, the "King's three questions" is from a story, which can sometimes be easier to recall for some students. The occupations question is more purely academic social science content.

**Why this question is relatively easier for this demographic:**

1.  **Direct Recall:** It's a straightforward recall of facts.
2.  **Familiar Context:** Rural occupations like farming and animal husbandry are highly relevant and visible in India, even if not specifically in Rajasthan. Many students might have direct experience or family connections to these.
3.  **Simple Language:** The English is uncomplicated.
4.  **Core Curriculum:** This is fundamental Social Science content for Class 7 in India.
5.  **Specific Content:** Rajasthan is a prominent state, and its geography and related livelihoods are generally covered.

**Why some might struggle:**

1.  **Limited English:** While simple, if their English is *extremely* limited, even basic descriptive sentences could be challenging.
2.  **Lack of Specific Recall:** If they haven't adequately studied the specific chapter on Rajasthan or forgot the details.
3.  **Vagueness:** Some might just list "work" or "labor" without naming specific occupations.
4.  **Incomplete Description:** They might name occupations but fail to "describe any one in brief" sufficiently to get the point.

Comparing to the anchors:
*   It's more specific and requires more factual recall than "My Favorite Season" (30%), which allows for personal expression.
*   It's very similar in type to "Fundamental Rights" (6
