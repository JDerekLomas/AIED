Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:** This question assumes specific historical knowledge about the Harappan Civilization, a topic typically covered in Class 6-8 Social Science (History) curriculum in India. Students would have learned about its features, including urban planning. It's direct recall of factual information.

2.  **Language Demands:** The language demand is moderate. "Describe one key feature" is a straightforward instruction. "Urban planning" is a specific historical term, but likely introduced in textbooks. The challenge lies in recalling the feature and articulating it in English, even if simply. Students might know the answer in Hindi and struggle to translate it or use basic English words like "grid," "drainage," "bricks," or "two parts."

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:** This is primarily a **recall** question. Students need to remember specific details about Harappan urban planning. There's no application of concepts or complex reasoning required beyond recalling facts.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:** This is a very common type of question found in textbooks and exams for this topic. "List features of Harappan civilization" or "Describe the urban planning of Harappa" are standard exercises. It's not obscure or highly analytical.

**Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" (5% pass rate):** This question is significantly harder. It requires higher-order thinking (identifying a theme, abstraction), interpreting a poem (which can be subjective), and expressing a complex idea. The Harappan question is purely factual recall.
*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history..." (15% pass rate):** This involves differentiation, which is slightly more complex than simple recall, and requires providing examples. However, "sources of history" is also a core topic. The Harappan question is simpler in its demand – just "describe one feature." Students might struggle with the term "differentiate" or structuring a comparison.
*   **"Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'" (30% pass rate):** This is a writing task requiring personal expression and sustained writing, which can be challenging for students with limited English. While the topic is accessible, the length and coherence demands are high. The Harappan question only requires a single point, potentially just a few words.
*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50% pass rate):** This is also recall, but from a specific story/text. It requires recalling three distinct points accurately. The Harappan question requires recalling *one* feature, and there are multiple acceptable options (grid, drainage, bricks, citadel/lower town), increasing the chances of a student getting it right if they recall any one. This is quite comparable in terms of cognitive load: single fact recall from a learned text/topic.
*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India." (66% pass rate):** This is very similar in cognitive demand to the Harappan question: recall two specific facts from a well-known Social Science topic. The Harappan question asks for *one* feature, making it slightly easier than recalling *two*. Fundamental Rights are often drilled, but so are features of ancient civilizations.

**Conclusion:**

The Harappan question is a direct recall question on a very standard topic in Indian history. It's less demanding than interpreting poetry or writing a paragraph, and on par with or slightly easier than recalling specific facts like the king's questions or Fundamental Rights, given that *one* feature is required and several options exist. The primary hurdle will be accurate recall and expressing it in basic English. The 50% anchor ("king's questions") is a good benchmark, as it also requires recalling specific details from a story. The Harappan question is arguably slightly easier than naming *two* Fundamental Rights, as only one is needed.

Given the average pass rate of 29% and the difficulty of the anchors, this question sits squarely in the easier half of the exam. It's a foundational history topic.
