Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Students are expected to know about the Battle of Plassey (1757) as a significant event in Indian history. This is standard Class 8 Social Science curriculum (History section).
    *   They need to understand its outcome (British victory) and the immediate political consequences, specifically the installation of Mir Jafar and the establishment of British control over Bengal.
    *   They also need to understand the concept of "expansion of British power."

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   The question uses relatively straightforward English vocabulary: "contribute," "expansion," "power."
    *   The core concepts (Battle of Plassey, British power) are likely taught in Hindi or regional languages and students would be expected to translate them mentally.
    *   The answer requires explaining a cause-and-effect relationship, which demands more than simple recall of facts. Students need to articulate how the victory *led to* expansion, rather than just stating that it happened. This requires some sentence construction and use of connectors.
    *   The rubric accepts explaining "political dominance/control over Bengal" or "placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab." These phrases are specific historical terms and might be challenging for students with limited English to formulate precisely, even if they grasp the concept in their native language.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   This question is primarily **reasoning/explanation** based on **recall** of historical facts. It's not just "What was the Battle of Plassey?" (recall) but "How did it *contribute* to expansion?" (reasoning about its significance and impact).
    *   Students need to connect the event (Plassey) to a broader consequence (expansion of British power).

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 8 history questions often ask for definitions, dates, names, or "describe the events of..."
    *   "How did X contribute to Y?" is a common type of question that requires a higher level of understanding than simple recall. It's an analytical question.
    *   While the Battle of Plassey is a central topic, articulating its *contribution* to broader power expansion, rather than just its events, makes it moderately difficult.
    *   The concept of "puppet nawab" or direct political control over Bengal as a *mechanism* for power expansion is key. Students might know the facts but struggle to articulate this causal link clearly in English.

**Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"Theme of The Last Bargain" (5%):** This is highly subjective and abstract, requiring deep comprehension and sophisticated articulation. Our question is more factual and less abstract.
*   **"Differentiate archaeological and literary sources" (15%):** This requires understanding two concepts and comparing/contrasting them with examples. It's conceptual recall and application. Our question requires reasoning about a single historical event's impact. It's arguably slightly easier than a complex differentiation, but harder than simple recall.
*   **"My favorite season" (30%):** This is a personal descriptive paragraph. It tests basic writing skills and imagination, but not specific academic content recall or reasoning. The language burden is lighter as students can use simpler vocabulary. Our question is harder due to specific historical content and the need for a precise explanation.
*   **"Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%):** This is direct recall from a story. If students know the story, it's easy to answer. The language burden is minimal, as they can often quote or paraphrase directly. Our question is harder because it requires explanation and understanding of cause-effect, not just fact recall.
*   **"Two Fundamental Rights" (66%):** This is direct recall of specific names/phrases from civics. If memorized, it's easy. The language burden is low. Our question is significantly harder than this because it's not a simple memorization task.

**Conclusion:**

The question requires specific historical knowledge (Battle of Plassey, its immediate aftermath) and the ability to articulate a cause-and-effect relationship in English. While the topic itself is central to Class 8 history, the demand for explanation and linking it to "expansion of power" elevates its difficulty beyond simple recall. The English language demands are moderate – not extremely complex vocabulary, but requires constructing a coherent explanatory sentence. Many students might know *that* the British won and *that* they gained power, but struggle to clearly explain *how* Plassey specifically *contributed* to this expansion through specific mechanisms like the puppet ruler or control over Bengal.

It's harder than direct recall questions (50-66%) but less abstract than the poem theme
