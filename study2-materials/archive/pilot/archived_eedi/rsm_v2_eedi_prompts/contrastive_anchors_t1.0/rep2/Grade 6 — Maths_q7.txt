Here's a breakdown of the analysis for the given math problem:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic arithmetic: Addition, multiplication.
    *   Understanding of time: Calculating elapsed hours across AM/PM.
    *   Understanding of temperature change (increase).
    *   Recognition of numbers in English (10, 30, 2, 4).
    *   Understanding of standard time notation (am/pm, 4:00).
    *   Concept of "per hour."

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   "At 10 am in the morning..." - Fairly straightforward.
    *   "...the temperature of Jodhpur was 30°C." - Simple statement.
    *   "If the temperature increases by 2°C per hour..." - "Increases by" and "per hour" are key phrases. "Per" can sometimes be tricky for students with limited English, but "per hour" is a common mathematical context.
    *   "...then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?" - "What will be" and "at 4:00 in the evening" are clear.
    *   The overall sentence structure is quite direct and lacks complex grammatical constructions or abstract vocabulary.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Application:** This is a multi-step application problem. Students need to:
        1.  Determine the elapsed time.
        2.  Multiply the hourly increase by the elapsed time.
        3.  Add this total increase to the initial temperature.
    *   It's not pure recall, nor does it require very abstract reasoning beyond sequential problem-solving.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very common type of word problem in Class 6 mathematics textbooks in India. Problems involving time calculations, rates of change (often with distance, speed, or temperature), and multi-step arithmetic are standard.
    *   The numbers are small and easy to work with (10, 30, 2, 6 hours).
    *   The "time elapsed" calculation across AM/PM is a common hurdle but also a frequently practiced skill.

**Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of a poem.** Highly abstract, requires deep comprehension, inference, and articulation in English. Much harder.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate archaeological/literary sources.** Requires specific historical vocabulary, understanding of abstract concepts, and comparative thinking. Harder.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Short paragraph on "My favorite season."** Requires sentence construction, vocabulary, and sustained writing in English, which is challenging. The math problem avoids the difficulty of producing free-form English prose.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer.** This is recall from a specific text, but likely from a story often read aloud or discussed. It tests memory and identification, but less complex than multi-step math.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name two Fundamental Rights.** This is direct recall of civics knowledge, often memorized. While specific, it doesn't involve calculation or multi-step logic.

**Conclusion for the Math Problem:**

The math problem's core difficulty lies in accurately calculating the elapsed time (10 AM to 4 PM is 6 hours, not 14 hours if they just subtract, or 5 if they miscount). Once that's done, the multiplication (6 * 2 = 12) and addition (30 + 12 = 42) are straightforward. The English is simple enough for students who can grasp basic math word problems.

Given that the average pass rate across items is 29%, and this is a standard, moderately complex (multi-step but common) math problem with relatively low language demands compared to writing tasks, it should perform *above* the average. It's more complex than simple recall (like the Fundamental Rights or the King's questions) but significantly less demanding than writing a paragraph or abstract differentiation.

The most common error would likely be the time calculation. If they get 5 hours instead of 6, or misinterpret "per hour."

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:** 55%

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

*   It's a very common type of problem, so many students would have practiced it.
*   The numbers are easy.
*   The language demands are relatively low for a word problem.
*   It requires two distinct steps (time calculation, then rate *
