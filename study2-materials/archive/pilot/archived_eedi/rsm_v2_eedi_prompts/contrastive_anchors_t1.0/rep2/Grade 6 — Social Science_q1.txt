Here's an analysis of the question and my estimate:

**Contrastive Analysis of "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geographical Knowledge:** Basic awareness of the major physical features of India, specifically mountain ranges. This is typically covered in Class 6 Social Science (Geography) textbooks in India. Students would have seen maps with these ranges marked.
    *   **Recall:** This is a direct recall question. There's no application or reasoning required beyond remembering names.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Extremely Low:** The question uses very simple English ("Name any two major mountain ranges located in India"). The vocabulary is common and direct.
    *   **Minimal Production:** Students only need to recall and write down two names. There's no sentence construction, paragraph writing, or complex explanation required. This is significantly easier than explaining a theme, differentiating concepts, or writing a short paragraph.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Pure Recall:** This is a straightforward recall of factual information from their geography lessons.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very common type of question found at the end of geography chapters, or as part of map-based exercises. It's akin to "Name two rivers in India" or "Name two neighboring countries of India." It's considered a foundational knowledge check.

**Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Vs. Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** This question is *vastly* easier. The poem theme requires interpretation, understanding abstract concepts, and expressing them in coherent sentences. The language demand is high, and abstract thinking is needed. "Mountain ranges" is concrete and direct recall.
*   **Vs. Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** This question is significantly easier. Differentiation requires understanding definitions, comparing two concepts, and providing distinct examples. It's a higher-order thinking skill than mere recall. The language demand is also higher.
*   **Vs. Pass Rate 30% (My favorite season - paragraph):** This question is much easier. Writing a short paragraph requires sentence construction, organization of thoughts, and a reasonable vocabulary, even if on a personal topic. "Mountain ranges" just needs two words.
*   **Vs. Pass Rate 50% (Three questions king wanted to answer):** This question is comparable in its recall nature, but the "king's questions" require remembering specific details from a story. While also recall, it might be slightly harder if the story wasn't deeply internalized. However, the mountain ranges are a core geographic concept that is typically drilled.
*   **Vs. Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is the closest anchor in terms of cognitive demand (direct recall of two specific items). Fundamental Rights are also core civic concepts taught in Class 6. The mountain ranges might even be slightly *easier* as they are visual and repeatedly shown on maps, making them potentially more concrete than abstract "rights." Students might struggle with precise names of Fundamental Rights more than well-known mountain ranges.

**Conclusion:**

This question is a straightforward, low-language-demand recall item on a fundamental geography topic. It's one of the easiest types of questions given the constraints of English proficiency and the nature of the exam. It is easier than the 5%, 15%, and 30% anchors. It is comparable to or slightly easier than the 50% and 66% anchors, due to the concrete nature of geography and the prevalence of map work in Class 6. Many students will have memorized these names directly from their textbooks or maps.

Given the average pass rate is 29% for all items, this particular item, being one of the easiest, should have a significantly higher pass rate.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 72%**
