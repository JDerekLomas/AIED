Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimate:

## Contrastive Analysis

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Difficulty:** Moderate to High.
    *   **Geographic Knowledge:** Students need to know what natural resources are and specifically recall at least two that are found in Rajasthan. This requires specific regional geographical knowledge, which might be covered in Class 6 Social Science (Geography section), but depth of coverage can vary.
    *   **Causal Relationship:** They then need to explain *how* one of these resources influences lives. This requires understanding a cause-and-effect relationship between a natural resource and human activities/lifestyles, which is a slightly higher-order thinking skill than simple recall.

**2. Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
*   **Difficulty:** Moderate.
    *   **Keywords:** "Natural resources," "found in Rajasthan," "explain how one of them influences the lives." These are fairly common terms in Social Science. "Influences" might be a slightly more challenging verb for some, but generally understandable in context.
    *   **Response Format:** The question asks for two resources and an *explanation*. This requires constructing a few sentences, not just single words or short phrases. For students with limited English, generating coherent sentences to explain a concept can be a significant barrier, even if they have the content knowledge in their native language.
    *   **Comparison to Anchors:**
        *   "My Favorite Season" (30%): Requires paragraph writing, similar to the explanation here. However, "My Favorite Season" is a personal topic, making the language simpler and more accessible.
        *   "Three Questions the King Wanted to Answer" (50%): Simple recall, often copying from the text. This question requires generating original content.
        *   "Fundamental Rights" (66%): Simple recall of two terms. No explanation needed.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
*   **Recall:** Identifying two natural resources in Rajasthan is direct recall.
*   **Reasoning/Application:** Explaining *how* one influences lives is a form of simple reasoning or application. Students need to connect the resource (e.g., water) to human activities (e.g., agriculture, daily life, industry) and consequences (e.g., scarcity leading to specific practices).

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
*   **Recall Part:** Similar to "List the resources found in X region," which is a common textbook exercise.
*   **Explanation Part:** Slightly more demanding than a basic recall question. Textbook questions often ask "What are the uses of X?" or "How is X important?" which are similar in cognitive demand to explaining influence. However, the open-ended nature and the need to connect it to "lives of people" makes it a bit more involved than just listing uses.

## Calibration Anchor Comparison:

*   **"Theme of The Last Bargain" (5%):** Very high-level abstract thinking, deep comprehension, and nuanced explanation required. This question is significantly easier than that.
*   **"Differentiate archaeological and literary sources" (15%):** Requires defining two concepts and giving examples. This question is somewhat similar in requiring two pieces of information (two resources) and then an explanation. The explanation part here (influence) might be slightly easier than *differentiating* two abstract concepts clearly.
*   **"My favorite season" (30%):** Requires paragraph writing on a personal topic. The language burden here is lower because it's personal experience. The current question requires factual recall and a more academic explanation. If students struggle with constructing a few sentences in English for "My favorite season," they will definitely struggle with the explanation here.
*   **"Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%):** Simple recall, often directly from the text. The current question requires more original thought and explanation.
*   **"Two Fundamental Rights" (66%):** Very simple recall of two specific terms. The current question is much harder due to the explanation component and broader geographic knowledge.

**Synthesizing the Difficulty:**

The question combines specific geographical recall with a basic cause-and-effect explanation. The English language demand for the explanation is the primary barrier for many students, similar to the paragraph writing task for "My favorite season," but on a factual, academic topic rather than a personal one. The factual recall for resources in Rajasthan is also specific and might not be universally known or easily remembered. The average pass rate is 29%, and this question feels slightly above that average for the *explanation* part. However, getting *any two correct resources* is a separate partial credit opportunity. The rubric says "Max score: 1" implying it's an all-
