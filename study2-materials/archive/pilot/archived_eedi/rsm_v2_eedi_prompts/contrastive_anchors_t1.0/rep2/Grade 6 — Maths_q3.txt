Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated pass rate:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Number Recognition:** Students need to be able to read and recognize 3-digit and 4-digit numbers. This is fundamental and expected by Class 6.
    *   **Place Value:** The core skill is understanding place value (hundreds, thousands) to compare numbers effectively. This is typically introduced in earlier grades (Class 2-3 for 3-digit, Class 3-4 for 4-digit).
    *   **Concept of Ascending Order:** Understanding that "ascending" means smallest to largest. This vocabulary is usually taught with number comparison.
*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Minimal English Demand:** The only English word is "ascending order." While "ascending" might be unfamiliar to some, the concept of "chote se bada" (small to large) is often taught alongside it in Hindi-medium schools. The numbers themselves are universal symbols.
    *   **Simplicity of Instructions:** The instruction is very direct: "Arrange in ascending order."
*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Application:** This is a straightforward application of number comparison and ordering skills. It doesn't require complex reasoning or recall of specific facts beyond the concept itself.
*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Very Easy/Basic:** This is a foundational type of question often found in early chapters on numbers. It's usually among the simplest exercises to build confidence before moving to more complex operations or larger numbers. Class 6 textbooks would likely have much more challenging number-related problems (e.g., operations with large numbers, understanding number systems, factors/multiples).
    *   **Distractor:** The numbers themselves are simple. One is a 3-digit number (736) and the others are 4-digit numbers. This makes identifying the smallest number (736) very easy, as 3-digit numbers are always smaller than 4-digit numbers. This is a common "trick" or simplification in early number ordering problems.

**Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Compared to 5% (Poem Theme):** Far, far easier. That requires abstract understanding, interpretation, and expression in English. This question requires only basic numerical skills.
*   **Compared to 15% (Differentiate Archaeological/Literary Sources):** Easier. That requires recalling definitions, understanding abstract categories, and providing examples, which has higher memory and conceptual demands. This is just applying a simple rule.
*   **Compared to 30% ("My Favorite Season" paragraph):** Easier. That requires creativity, structure, specific content points, and writing coherent sentences in English. This is just ordering numbers. Even a partially correct answer (like the "Winter, Sweater" response) for the paragraph involved more generation.
*   **Compared to 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Similar or slightly easier. That's recall from a specific text, which can be hit or miss depending on memorization. This is a basic math skill that is more universally taught and practiced. The "Empty Response" rate for the king's questions suggests pure recall can be challenging. For our question, even if a student struggles with the full order, identifying the smallest (for 0.5 points) is very accessible.
*   **Compared to 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Slightly easier to significantly easier, especially for the 0.5 points. That's pure recall of specific terms/concepts from Civics. This is a fundamental math skill. While "Fundamental Rights" are important, memorizing two specific ones can be harder than comparing numbers. The incorrect "Viser to epumat" response highlights the difficulty of exact recall and English transcription.

**Reasoning for Estimate:**

Given that this is a very basic number ordering task, the primary hurdle would be:
1.  **Understanding "ascending order":** Most Class 6 students would have encountered this term in math class, even if it's a Hindi-medium school (often taught as "badhte kram" or "chote se bada").
2.  **Basic Place Value Comparison:** Identifying the 3-digit number as the smallest is a very elementary comparison.
3.  **Basic 4-digit comparison:** Comparing the remaining 4-digit numbers.

The average pass rate is 29%, indicating many struggles with English, abstract concepts, and complex tasks. This question avoids almost all of those complexities. It's a fundamental math skill taught in earlier grades. The maximum score for identifying *just* the smallest number (736) and placing it first is 0.5. This
