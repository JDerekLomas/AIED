Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimate:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Direct knowledge:** Students are expected to have studied the Harappan Civilization as part of their Social Science (History) curriculum. This is a foundational topic for ancient Indian history in Class 8. Key features of urban planning are typically highlighted in textbooks.
    *   **Implicit knowledge:** Basic understanding of terms like "urban planning," "civilization," and the general concept of ancient societies.
*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   The question is straightforward: "Describe one key feature..."
    *   The vocabulary ("key feature," "urban planning," "Harappan Civilization") is standard historical terminology that they would encounter in their textbooks (even if translated to Hindi).
    *   Students need to *describe*, which requires forming a complete sentence or two, rather than just listing. However, the rubric allows for a concise description.
    *   The options for correct answers (grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town) are relatively simple concepts to express.
*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily a **recall** question. Students are expected to remember specific facts about Harappan urban planning as taught in their curriculum.
    *   There's no complex application or reasoning required beyond recalling the information and stating it clearly.
*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This type of question (e.g., "List features of X," "Describe Y") is very common in Social Science textbooks and exams. It directly tests factual recall of important characteristics of a historical period.
    *   It's less demanding than questions requiring comparison (like the archaeological/literary sources item) or subjective expression (like "My favorite season"). It's also less abstract than finding a "theme" of a poem.

**Difficulty Compared to Anchors:**

*   **"Theme of 'The Last Bargain'" (5%):** Much harder. Requires abstract interpretation and sophisticated language.
*   **"Differentiate archaeological/literary sources" (15%):** Slightly harder. Requires understanding two concepts and their distinction, plus giving an example for each. "Harappan features" is about recalling one specific detail for one concept.
*   **"My favorite season" (30%):** Similar, but potentially slightly harder to *score full points* on "My favorite season" if the student struggles with sustained paragraph writing in English. For "Harappan," a single correct sentence is enough. However, the creative aspect of "My favorite season" might appeal to some students more than historical recall.
*   **"Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%):** Comparable. This is also a direct recall question from a specific story. The Harappan features are also direct recall from a specific history topic. The "three questions" are very specific details, whereas "one key feature" for Harappan might allow for a broader range of correct answers.
*   **"Two Fundamental Rights" (66%):** Easier. Fundamental Rights are heavily emphasized and often memorized. Naming *any two* offers flexibility. "One key feature" of Harappan is also quite straightforward, but maybe slightly less "rote memorization" than Fundamental Rights.

**Conclusion:**

The question asks for a single, commonly taught factual detail about a significant historical topic. The language is simple, and it's a direct recall task. Most students who have engaged with the Class 8 history curriculum would have encountered and likely memorized one or more features of Harappan urban planning. The open-ended nature of "one key feature" (allowing for drainage, grid, bricks, etc.) also increases the chances of a correct answer compared to a highly specific single-point recall.

Given that "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (specific story detail recall) was 50%, and "Two Fundamental Rights" (heavily taught recall) was 66%, "one key feature of Harappan urban planning" falls somewhere in between or potentially closer to the higher end for students who have studied history adequately. It's a core concept.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%**
