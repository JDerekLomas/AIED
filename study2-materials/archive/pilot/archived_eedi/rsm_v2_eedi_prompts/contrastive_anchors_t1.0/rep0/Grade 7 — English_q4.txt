Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimate:

## Contrastive Analysis of "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Reading Comprehension:** Students need to have understood the preceding story (likely "The Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy) to know what the king's questions were. However, the rubric implies that the *king's questions themselves* are not what is being assessed, but rather the importance of *them*.
*   **General Life Experience:** The question asks for an opinion on the "importance in real life," which draws on students' own understanding of decision-making, relationships, and time management. This is relatable, even for students from economically weaker sections, as these are universal human experiences.
*   **Basic Argumentation:** Students need to be able to form a simple opinion and provide one supporting reason.

**2. Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
*   **Vocabulary:**
    *   "Important": Common and likely understood.
    *   "Real life": Common idiom, likely understood.
    *   "Reason": Common and likely understood.
*   **Sentence Structure:** The question uses a direct interrogative structure ("Do you think...") followed by an imperative ("Give one reason."). This is relatively straightforward.
*   **Output:** Students need to produce a short sentence or two expressing an opinion and a reason. This is less demanding than writing a paragraph or differentiating complex concepts.
*   **Passive Voice (Implicit):** The prompt uses "the king's questions are important," which implies an understanding of the questions *themselves* without explicitly asking to recall them. This is less complex than the 5% item (identifying a theme) or the 15% item (differentiating sources).

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
*   **Recall (Minimal):** Students don't explicitly need to recall the king's three questions (though having them in mind helps). The core is about evaluating their *importance*.
*   **Reasoning/Application:** This is primarily a reasoning question. Students need to:
    1.  Form an opinion ("Yes" or "No," although "Yes" is the far more intuitive and common answer for this type of question).
    2.  Justify that opinion with a simple reason related to real-world applicability. This applies the abstract questions to their own understanding of life.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
*   This type of question (opinion + reason) is very common in English language arts textbooks, especially after reading a story. It promotes critical thinking and personal connection to the text.
*   It's generally considered easier than:
    *   Summarizing a theme (5% item).
    *   Differentiating academic concepts (15% item).
    *   Writing a descriptive paragraph with specific requirements (30% item).
*   It's comparable to or slightly easier than questions that require recalling specific facts from a passage (like the 50% item asking for the three questions, *if* the student remembers the content). However, this question pivots to personal relevance, which can sometimes be easier to articulate than precise recall.
*   It's harder than simply naming two common facts (66% item - Fundamental Rights) as it requires a personal judgment and justification.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Harder than 66% (Name two Fundamental Rights):** That's direct recall of memorized facts. This question requires more cognitive processing (opinion formation, justification).
*   **Easier than 50% (What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?):** That item requires precise recall of specific details from the text. This question is about the *relevance* of those details, not their exact wording. Many students might struggle to recall all three questions perfectly, but they can still understand their general intent and importance. The current question only requires understanding *that* there were questions and considering their real-world value.
*   **Easier than 30% (Write a short paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This question has much lower production demands (one sentence opinion, one sentence reason vs. 6-8 lines). The English demands are also simpler.
*   **Easier than 15% (Differentiate archaeological and literary sources):** This involves domain-specific vocabulary and understanding of academic distinctions, which is much higher level than the current question.
*   **Much easier than 5% (Write a theme of "The Last Bargain"):** Identifying a theme requires abstract thinking, synthesis, and often more nuanced language, which is very challenging for limited English proficiency students.
