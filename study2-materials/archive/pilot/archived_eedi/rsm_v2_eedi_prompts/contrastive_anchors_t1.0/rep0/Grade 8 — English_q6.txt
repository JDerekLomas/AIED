Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Concept of "fable":** Students need to have encountered fables (or their equivalents in Hindi/local languages) and the underlying concept of a story with a moral. Many Indian folk tales and parables fit this structure, so the *concept* itself might be somewhat familiar even if the specific English term isn't.
    *   **Vocabulary related to storytelling/literature:** Terms like "short story," "moral lesson," "characters," "animals" are all required to construct a full definition.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Single word definition:** Unlike paragraph writing or differentiation, this requires a concise definition. This could be a double-edged sword: easier if they know the exact English definition, harder if they need to explain a concept they know in Hindi using limited English vocabulary.
    *   **Vocabulary:** The key words for the definition (short story, animals, moral lesson) are relatively common English words, but combining them correctly can be challenging. "Imparts" might be too advanced; they might use "gives" or "teaches."
    *   **Grammar:** Forming a coherent sentence for a definition requires a basic understanding of English sentence structure.
    *   **Lack of context:** "Define fable" is a very direct, decontextualized question. There's no passage or narrative to help them infer meaning.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   This is primarily **recall**. Students either know the definition of "fable" or they don't. There's no application of a concept or complex reasoning involved beyond remembering the definition itself.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Vocabulary/Definition exercises:** Defining literary terms is a common exercise in English language arts. However, the exact phrasing of the definition might vary, and students might struggle to translate a conceptual understanding into precise English.
    *   **Comparability to anchors:**
        *   **"Theme of a poem" (5%):** This is much harder because it requires abstract interpretation and expression. "Define fable" is concrete.
        *   **"Differentiate archaeological/literary sources" (15%):** This requires understanding two concepts and comparing them, which is more complex than defining one. It also has a higher language demand for comparison.
        *   **"My favorite season" (30%):** This is a creative writing task, allowing for simpler language, but requires generating content. "Define fable" requires specific content. A student who knows "fable" but can't define it fully might get 0, whereas a student who struggles with English might still manage some points for "My favorite season."
        *   **"Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%):** This is direct recall from a specific text. If they read and remembered the text, it's straightforward. "Define fable" is similar in being direct recall, but it's a general literary term, not from a specific, immediately preceding passage.
        *   **"Two Fundamental Rights" (66%):** This is also direct recall of specific, well-known information from Civics. These are often memorized. The terms are also quite specific (Right to Equality, Right to Freedom), making recognition easier if they've studied them. "Fable" is a single concept rather than a list.

    *   **Key Differences:**
        *   "Fable" is a core literary term that should ideally be covered. However, memorizing a precise English definition can be hard.
        *   It's less subjective than "theme" and less comparative than "differentiate."
        *   It's more specific recall than "favorite season."
        *   It's similar to "king's questions" and "fundamental rights" in being recall, but the content is different. "Fundamental Rights" are probably drilled more heavily in Civics than "fable" is in English, and the names of the rights themselves are often distinct and memorable. "Fable" requires understanding the *components* of the definition.

Considering that the average pass rate is 29%, and this question is a direct recall of a literary term, it's likely to fall in the middle-to-lower range of the direct recall questions. Students might know what a fable is in their local language but struggle to articulate it concisely in English. They might get partial credit for mentioning "animals" or "moral." However, the rubric requires a fairly complete definition to get a 1.

If students have done specific vocabulary work or learned definitions of literary terms, this could be easier. Given the economic background and limited English proficiency, rote memorization of such definitions is less
