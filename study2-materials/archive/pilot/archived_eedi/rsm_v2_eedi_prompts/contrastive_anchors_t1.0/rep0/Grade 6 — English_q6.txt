Here's a breakdown of the analysis for the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?":

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Poem Comprehension:** Students need to have understood at least some parts of the poem to select a line they "like" and articulate *why*. This is a significant hurdle given the general English proficiency.
    *   **Basic Literary Appreciation:** The concept of "liking" a line and providing a reason requires some very basic interpretative or emotional response skills, which might not be explicitly taught or frequently assessed in this context.
    *   **Vocabulary:** Students need to understand "line," "most," and "why." These are relatively common words, but still, a potential barrier.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Identifying a Line:** This is the easiest part. Many students might be able to copy a line from the poem.
    *   **Expressing "Why":** This is the biggest challenge. Articulating a reason, even a simple one, requires constructing a sentence or two in English that explains their preference. This moves beyond simple recall or copying and demands basic generative English.
    *   **Vocabulary for "Why":** Students might struggle to find the right words to explain *why* they like a line (e.g., "it's beautiful," "it makes me feel happy," "it's about friendship"). They might default to very simple, repetitive explanations or struggle to form coherent sentences.
    *   **Grammar and Syntax:** Even if they have the vocabulary, forming grammatically acceptable sentences for the "why" part will be a major obstacle.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall (of the line):** This is straightforward if they've read the poem.
    *   **Application/Reasoning (of "why"):** This is where the difficulty lies. It's not rote memorization. It requires a personal response and the ability to articulate that response. It's more of a low-level application of personal preference and reasoning.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 6 English exercises often focus on:
        *   Answering factual comprehension questions (e.g., "What did the king want to know?" - Pass rate 50%)
        *   Identifying specific details (e.g., "Name two Fundamental Rights" - Pass rate 66%)
        *   Defining terms (e.g., "Differentiate archaeological/literary sources" - Pass rate 15%, but the examples provided suggest even partial answers got credit)
        *   Simple writing tasks with clear prompts (e.g., "My favorite season" - Pass rate 30%, but very simple, fragmented answers scored well).
    *   This question is *harder* than pure factual recall because of the "why" component.
    *   It's *harder* than "My favorite season" because it requires connecting a personal preference directly to a specific textual element and then explaining it. "My favorite season" allows for more generic, pre-learned sentences or very simple descriptors.
    *   It's *easier* than "Write a theme..." (5%) because the scope is narrower (a single line vs. the whole poem's theme) and the "why" can be a simpler personal preference rather than a deeper literary analysis.

**Anchor Item Comparison:**

*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%):** This is pure recall from the text. Many students could likely identify key phrases. The "why" for our target question makes it harder than this.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... My favorite season." (30%):** This required generating a paragraph, but even very fragmented answers scored. Our question also requires generation, but it's tied to the poem and specifically asks for a *reason*. A student might be able to list things they like about a season, but articulating *why* they like a specific line from a poem is a step up in cognitive and linguistic demand. The "why" for the poem requires linking the feeling to the specific text, which is more abstract than listing clothes or food for a season.
*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15%):** This required defining and exemplifying, showing some conceptual understanding. The partial answers getting credit indicate the bar wasn't extremely high. Our question is less about factual definitions and more about personal expression linked to text. While "why" is hard, it's arguably less conceptually demanding than defining historical sources.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem..." (5%):
