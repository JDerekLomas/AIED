Here's an analysis of the question and my estimated proportion correct:

**Contrastive Analysis of "My Favourite Hobby" vs. Anchors:**

*   **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   **"My Favourite Hobby":** Assumes students understand the concept of a "hobby" and can identify one they enjoy. This is likely accessible to most students, even those from economically weaker sections, as hobbies can be simple and universal (e.g., playing, drawing, reading). It also assumes basic knowledge of English vocabulary for common activities.
    *   **Anchor (5%): "The Last Bargain" theme:** Requires deep comprehension of a specific poem, abstract thinking (identifying a theme), and a higher level of English to articulate it.
    *   **Anchor (15%): Archaeological vs. Literary sources:** Requires specific historical knowledge and the ability to differentiate between abstract concepts.
    *   **Anchor (30%): "My favorite season":** Very similar to "My Favourite Hobby." The only difference is the topic.
    *   **Anchor (50%): King's three questions:** Requires recall of specific plot points from a story.
    *   **Anchor (66%): Fundamental Rights:** Requires specific civics knowledge.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **"My Favourite Hobby":** The prompt is relatively straightforward. "Write a short paragraph," "My Favourite Hobby," "when you do it," "why you enjoy it." The vocabulary is basic and functional. Students will need to use simple sentences and common verbs. The requirement for 4-5 sentences is achievable with basic sentence structures.
    *   **Anchor (5%): "The Last Bargain" theme:** High language demand for expressing abstract ideas.
    *   **Anchor (15%): Differentiate between...:** Requires comparative language and precise vocabulary.
    *   **Anchor (30%): "My favorite season":** Very similar language demands.
    *   **Anchor (50%): King's three questions:** Lower language demand if they can recall the phrases.
    *   **Anchor (66%): Fundamental Rights:** Low language demand if they can recall the names of the rights.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   **"My Favourite Hobby":** Primarily an application/expressive task. Students need to draw on their personal experience and translate it into English. It's not recall of specific facts or complex reasoning.
    *   **Anchor (5%): "The Last Bargain" theme:** High-level reasoning and interpretation.
    *   **Anchor (15%): Archaeological vs. Literary sources:** Recall and application of definitional knowledge.
    *   **Anchor (30%): "My favorite season":** Application/expressive, identical type of task.
    *   **Anchor (50%): King's three questions:** Recall.
    *   **Anchor (66%): Fundamental Rights:** Recall.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **"My Favourite Hobby":** This is a very common type of "free writing" or "personal response" exercise found in English language textbooks, especially at the primary/early secondary level. It's designed to encourage simple sentence construction and self-expression.
    *   **Anchor (30%): "My favorite season":** Directly comparable. The slight variation in topic (hobby vs. season) is negligible in terms of overall difficulty or cognitive demand.

**Comparison to "My Favorite Season" (30% pass rate):**

The prompt structure, required output (short paragraph), and personal nature of the topics are almost identical.
*   **"My Favorite Season":** "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season." Talk about what you like to do, what you eat or wear, and w"
*   **"My Favourite Hobby":** "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it."

The only minor differences:
1.  **Length:** "Hobby" asks for 4-5 sentences, "Season" for 6-8 lines. This makes "Hobby" *slightly* less demanding in terms of quantity of writing.
2.  **Specific Prompts:** Both provide clear sub-points to cover.

Given the extremely high similarity, particularly with the 30% anchor for "My favorite season," I anticipate a very similar pass rate. The slight reduction in required length (4-5 sentences vs. 6-8 lines/sentences) might make "My Favourite Hobby" negligibly easier, as the 6-8 line requirement for "My Favourite Season" led
