Let's break down the question and its potential difficulty for Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Students are expected to know *about* the Battle of Plassey (date, key players like British East India Company, Nawab of Bengal). This is a foundational event in Indian history taught in Class 8 social science textbooks.
    *   They need to understand the concept of "expansion of British power" and how military victories can lead to political control.
    *   Understanding terms like "contribute" and "political dominance/control" is crucial.
*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   "How did... contribute to..." is a fairly common question structure but requires understanding causality.
    *   "Expansion of British power" is a standard historical phrase.
    *   "Political dominance/control" and "puppet nawab" (if they choose to use that specific detail) are higher-level vocabulary. However, the rubric accepts a simpler explanation of "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal."
    *   Students might struggle to articulate the *causal link* clearly in English, even if they understand the facts. They might know *what happened* but not be able to precisely explain *how* it contributed.
*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   This is primarily **reasoning/application** based on recall. Students need to recall the outcome of Plassey and then reason about how that outcome led to the expansion of British power. It's not just a direct factual recall ("When was Plassey?"). They need to connect the event to its historical significance.
    *   It's a step beyond simple recall but less complex than intricate analysis.
*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Textbooks will definitely cover the Battle of Plassey and its significance. Questions like "Describe the significance of the Battle of Plassey" or "What were the consequences of the Battle of Plassey?" are very common. This question is a slightly more directed version of such a question.
    *   The challenge for many students will be moving from factual recall to expressing the *causal relationship* clearly and concisely in English, hitting the specific point about "political dominance/control over Bengal."

**Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'"** This is highly interpretive and abstract, requiring nuanced understanding of poetry and strong expressive skills in English. Plassey is much more concrete and factual.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each."** This requires defining two distinct concepts and providing examples, which involves clear categorization and specific knowledge. The Plassey question requires explaining a consequence of a single event. The difficulty might be comparable for students who struggle with definitions and explanations. However, the Plassey question is about a very major event they've likely studied extensively.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'"** This is a creative writing task requiring paragraph structure, descriptive language, and personal expression. While it has a higher pass rate than the sources question, it's a different skill set. The Plassey question is more about factual historical explanation, which often has less room for error in content if the facts are known.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"** This is a direct recall question from a specific text. If students know the story, it's straightforward. The Plassey question requires more than just direct recall; it needs an explanation of causality.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India."** This is direct, specific recall of high-salience information, often memorized. This is the easiest type of question.

**Estimated Difficulty of the Plassey Question:**

The Battle of Plassey is a cornerstone of Class 8 Indian history. Students will have studied it. The key challenge is articulating the *contribution to expansion of power* in a way that matches the rubric (political dominance over Bengal).

Many students might state facts about the battle, or that the British won, or that Mir Jafar became Nawab, but might struggle to explicitly link this to "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal" as the *contribution*. They might offer incomplete explanations due to language barriers or difficulty with causal reasoning.

Given that it's a critical topic, and the expected answer is relatively straightforward if the concept is understood, it should fall somewhere above the more abstract/interpretive questions and below
