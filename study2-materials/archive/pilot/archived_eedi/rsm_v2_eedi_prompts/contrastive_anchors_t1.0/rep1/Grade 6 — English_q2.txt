Here's a breakdown of the analysis for "Who lived inside the book?":

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Low:** This question assumes *only* knowledge of the specific story from which it is drawn. It's a direct recall question about a character. There's no external general knowledge, historical facts, or scientific concepts required.
    *   **Comparison:** This is much lower than the "Fundamental Rights" question (66%), which requires specific civics knowledge, or the "Archaeological vs. Literary Sources" question (15%), which requires conceptual understanding and examples. It's even lower than "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%), which assumes understanding of a slightly more complex plot point.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Very Low:** The question uses extremely simple, direct English: "Who lived inside the book?" The vocabulary is basic, and the sentence structure is straightforward subject-verb-object.
    *   **Comparison:** This is far simpler than "Write a theme or central idea..." (5%), which requires understanding abstract concepts and expressing them coherently. It's also simpler than "Differentiate between..." (15%), which requires comparative language. Even "Write a short paragraph on 'My favorite season'" (30%) requires more generative writing and sentence construction. The key here is that the expected answer is also very short and simple ("a magical fairy" or "fairy").

*   **Type of Cognitive Demand:**
    *   **Recall (Direct Fact Retrieval):** This is a purely recall-based question. Students simply need to remember a specific detail from the story. There's no application, analysis, or reasoning required beyond recalling the information presented in the text.
    *   **Comparison:** This is simpler than identifying a "theme" (5%), differentiating concepts (15%), or even summarizing a plot point (50% for the king's questions, though that one also relies on recall). It's more akin to "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66%) in terms of being direct recall, but the content of the "book" question is likely much simpler and more concrete from a story perspective.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Easy:** This type of "who, what, where" question is among the most basic comprehension checks found at the end of story chapters in Class 6 textbooks. They are designed to ensure students have read and understood the most fundamental elements of a narrative. It would likely be one of the very first questions asked about the story.
    *   **Comparison:** This is far easier than extended writing tasks (30%), conceptual differentiation (15%), or even identifying themes (5%). It's on par with the simplest "check your understanding" questions.

**Overall Assessment:**

This question is extremely easy across all dimensions: low prior knowledge, minimal language demands, direct recall, and typical of very basic comprehension exercises. The expected answer is also very short and common in children's stories. Given the calibration anchors, especially the 50% for recalling three plot points and 66% for two factual rights, this question should be significantly higher. Students who have *any* grasp of the story and can decode the simple English should be able to answer this. The main barrier would be not having read the story at all or complete inability to understand the simple English words "who," "lived," "inside," and "book."

Considering the average pass rate is 29%, this question is far above average difficulty. The 66% anchor is for recalling two somewhat abstract "Fundamental Rights." Recalling a concrete character from a story, especially if it's a prominent one, should be easier.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:** 75%
