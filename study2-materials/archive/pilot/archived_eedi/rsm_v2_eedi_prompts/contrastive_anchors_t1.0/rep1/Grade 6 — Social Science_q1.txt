**Contrastive Analysis for "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."**

Let's break down the question's difficulty compared to the calibration anchors and typical Class 6 Social Science content in India.

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geographical Awareness:** Students are expected to have a basic understanding of India's physical geography, specifically the location and names of major mountain ranges. This is standard content for Class 6 Geography in India, usually covered in textbooks discussing landforms.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Mountain ranges" is a core geographical term.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Simplicity:** The question uses very simple, direct English: "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India." There are no complex sentence structures, idioms, or abstract concepts.
    *   **Keywords:** "Name," "two," "major," "mountain ranges," "India" are all straightforward.
    *   **Comparison to anchors:**
        *   Much simpler than "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (pass rate 15%) which requires understanding and explaining two distinct concepts.
        *   Simpler than "Write a theme or central idea of the poem..." (pass rate 5%) which requires comprehension of abstract literary concepts.
        *   Comparable in linguistic simplicity to "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (pass rate 50%) and "Name any two Fundamental Rights..." (pass rate 66%).

*   **Cognitive Demand (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   **Pure Recall:** This is a direct recall question. Students simply need to remember the names of two mountain ranges. There is no application of principles, analysis, or complex reasoning involved.
    *   **Comparison to anchors:**
        *   Similar to "Name any two Fundamental Rights..." (recall).
        *   Easier than "Differentiate..." (application/analysis).
        *   Easier than "Write a theme..." (interpretation/analysis).
        *   Similar to "What were the three questions..." (recall, though from a story, which might be slightly more prone to memory errors if the story wasn't recently reviewed).

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very common type of "fill in the blanks" or "short answer" question found in Class 6 Geography textbooks and end-of-chapter exercises. It's foundational knowledge.
    *   The rubric is generous: "Names one correct mountain range" gets half credit. This significantly lowers the bar for partial correctness. Many students might only recall one, but still score.

*   **Factors Making it Potentially Harder (Minor):**
    *   **Specific Recall:** While foundational, students need to retrieve specific names. If they haven't revised geography recently, or if their general knowledge of India's geography is weak, they might struggle.
    *   **Variety of Correct Answers:** While a benefit for students (they have options), it doesn't inherently make the question easier or harder to answer *if they know the content*.

**Overall Assessment:**

This question is highly accessible in terms of language and cognitive demand. It's a direct recall of fundamental geographical facts typically covered in Class 6. The allowance for one correct answer to get half credit further boosts potential scores. It's directly comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" question in structure and cognitive load, and arguably slightly easier than the "King's three questions" if the specific names are more frequently reinforced. The "My favorite season" prompt (30%) requires more creative writing and coherent thought, making "mountain ranges" simpler.

Given the average pass rate of 29% and considering the anchors:
*   "Fundamental Rights" (66%) is very similar in structure and recall from Social Science.
*   "King's three questions" (50%) is also recall, but from a narrative, which can sometimes be less firmly memorized than factual lists.
*   "Differentiate between..." (15%) is much harder.

The question about mountain ranges is core, repeated geographical knowledge. Students from government schools, even with limited English, are likely to have encountered and memorized these facts in their geography classes, often taught bilingually or in Hindi. The simplicity of the English here is a huge advantage.

I expect the pass rate to be closer to the higher end of the recall-based questions.
