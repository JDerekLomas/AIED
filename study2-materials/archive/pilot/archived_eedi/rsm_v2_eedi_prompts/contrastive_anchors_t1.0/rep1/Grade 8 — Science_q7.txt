**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic understanding of decomposition/rotting of organic matter.
    *   Awareness that pits are used for composting or waste disposal.
    *   Elementary concept of "soil health" and what makes it beneficial.
    *   This knowledge is typically covered in Class 6-8 science textbooks under topics like waste management, natural resources, or soil. It's fundamental environmental science.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   "Collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits": Relatively straightforward vocabulary.
    *   "In a pit": Simple.
    *   "Does gardener notice any change after some days?": Clear question, asking for observation.
    *   "Give reasons": Requires explanatory language.
    *   "Evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health": This is the most complex part. "Evaluate" implies judgment and linking the changes to a positive or negative impact on soil. "Beneficial for soil health" is specific terminology.
    *   Students with limited English might struggle with "evaluate" and precisely articulating the *reasons* for the changes and the *benefits* for soil health, even if they grasp the core concept of decomposition.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Students need to recall the concept of decomposition.
    *   **Application:** They need to apply this concept to the scenario of organic waste in a pit.
    *   **Reasoning:** They need to reason about *why* the changes occur (decomposition by microorganisms) and *how* these changes are beneficial for soil (forming manure/compost, adding nutrients). The "evaluate" part requires higher-order reasoning.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical exercises might ask "What happens to fruit peels left in the open?" (Recall/Application).
    *   Asking for "reasons" and "evaluating beneficial for soil health" elevates it beyond simple recall. It's more akin to a short-answer question requiring a mini-explanation.
    *   The question structure is common for Class 8 science, testing understanding of a process and its implications.

**Difficulty Analysis vs. Anchors:**

*   **Compared to 5% (Theme of poem):** That's abstract and requires interpretation of literature, which is highly challenging for these students. This science question is far more concrete.
*   **Compared to 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** That requires specific historical definitions and examples, which are recall-based but can be mixed up. This science question is about a natural process that students might observe in daily life, making it more relatable. However, the "reasons" and "evaluate" parts are more demanding than simply listing examples.
*   **Compared to 30% ("My favorite season" paragraph):** That's a creative writing task requiring sustained output and vocabulary. While many can write something, achieving a good score might be hard. This science question is shorter in expected output but requires specific scientific concepts.
*   **Compared to 50% (Three questions king wanted to answer):** This is direct recall from a story. If they read the story, it's easy. If not, it's impossible. Our science question is less about specific recall and more about understanding a process.
*   **Compared to 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is direct recall of civics knowledge. If taught and remembered, it's easy.

**Specific Considerations for this question and rubric:**

*   The rubric "The user suggests that the gardener will notice significant changes" is very generous (max score 0.5).
*   Students only need to acknowledge that *some change* will occur. They don't need to elaborate on *what* change (e.g., decay, smell, reduction in volume) or *why* it happens, let alone the benefits.
*   This makes the "does gardener notice any change after some days?" part very easy to get credit for, as long as they respond affirmatively.
*   Many students will have observed organic matter decaying at home or in their surroundings. "Yes, it will change" or "Yes, it will rot" is a likely answer.
*   Even if they don't know the scientific terms, common sense observation of waste might lead them to affirm a change.

Given the generous rubric (just acknowledging a change), the question becomes significantly easier than if it required explanation or evaluation for full marks. The core concept of "change" in organic waste is very basic and observable.
