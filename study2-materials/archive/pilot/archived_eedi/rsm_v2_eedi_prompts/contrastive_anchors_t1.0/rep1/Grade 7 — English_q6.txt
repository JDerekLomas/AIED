Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Concept of "writing style":** Students need to understand what "writing style" refers to – the way an author uses language, structure, tone, etc. This is a somewhat abstract concept, especially for Class 7 students.
    *   **Ability to analyze a text for stylistic elements:** This implies having read the poem (presumably "The Last Bargain" based on the 5% anchor, though the question doesn't explicitly state it's about that poem, which adds a layer of ambiguity). Even if they've read it, identifying "style" requires a higher-order thinking skill than simple recall.
    *   **Vocabulary for describing style:** They need appropriate English adjectives like "simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct," or synonyms. This can be challenging for students with limited English.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   **Understanding "Describes the poet's writing style":** The phrase itself uses relatively sophisticated vocabulary ("describes," "writing style"). "Style" in this context is not a common everyday word.
    *   **Formulating a concise answer:** They need to provide a single word or a very short phrase.
    *   **Limited English proficiency impact:** Students might understand the *poem's content* but struggle to articulate its *style* using appropriate English terms. They might resort to describing the plot or feelings rather than the mechanics of the writing.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   This is primarily **application** and **reasoning**. It's not recall; they can't just pluck an answer from the text. They need to:
        *   Recall the poem (if it's assumed).
        *   Analyze the poem for stylistic elements (e.g., word choice, sentence structure, imagery).
        *   Reason about what adjective best fits those observations.
        *   Apply suitable vocabulary to describe it.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **More difficult than typical recall questions:** Most textbook exercises at this level focus on plot, characters, themes, or direct comprehension (e.g., "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" - 50% pass rate).
    *   **Similar to "Write a theme..." (5% pass rate) in cognitive demand, but potentially harder in specific vocabulary:** The "theme" question also requires abstract thinking and synthesis. This "writing style" question requires similar abstraction but then demands a specific type of descriptive vocabulary.
    *   **Higher-order thinking:** Identifying writing style is generally a more advanced literary analysis skill than identifying plot points or basic facts.

**Comparison with Anchors:**

*   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5%):** This question is conceptually similar in that it requires abstract interpretation of a text. The "style" question might be slightly easier in that it asks for *a word* rather than a full statement, but the underlying cognitive process of analysis and synthesis is comparable. The challenge here is the *abstraction* of "style."
*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15%):** This involves definitions and examples, a more structured and recall-based task, even with differentiation. "Writing style" is less concrete.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My favorite season.'" (30%):** This is a creative writing task requiring personal expression and basic paragraph structure, far less abstract than identifying a writing style.
*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%):** Pure recall from the story. Much easier.
*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights..." (66%):** Pure recall of factual information. Much easier.

**Conclusion:**

The question "Describes the poet’s writing style" is very demanding. It requires a sophisticated understanding of literary concepts, the ability to analyze a text for subtle stylistic elements, and the vocabulary to articulate that analysis in English. Given the low average pass rate (29%) and the difficulty of similar abstract questions (like the 5% theme question), this question sits at the very difficult end of the spectrum for this student population. Students are more likely to either misinterpret the question, struggle to find appropriate English terms, or simply lack the analytical skills for "style" at this level. The rubric allows for "simple, descriptive, informal, direct," which are common enough words, but the *application* of them to "writing style" is the hurdle.

I anticipate the pass rate will be quite low, likely closer to the "theme" question due to the abstract nature and the need for specific, less common vocabulary application in English.
