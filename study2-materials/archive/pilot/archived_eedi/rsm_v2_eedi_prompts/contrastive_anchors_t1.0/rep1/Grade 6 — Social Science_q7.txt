Here's an analysis of the question and my estimate:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geographic Knowledge:** Students need to know what natural resources are, and specifically what natural resources are found in Rajasthan. This is likely covered in Class 6 Social Science (Geography section). Textbooks often focus on states and their resources.
    *   **Causal Relationship:** Students need to be able to identify a link between a resource and its impact on people's lives (e.g., water -> agriculture/scarcity, minerals -> mining/industry, sunlight -> solar power/tourism).

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Keywords:** "natural resources," "Rajasthan," "influences," "lives of the people." These are relatively straightforward terms for Class 6 Social Science. "Influences" might be a slight challenge for some, but the context should make it clear.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** "Mention any two... and explain how one of them influences..." This requires two distinct parts to the answer and a simple explanatory sentence or two. The explanation part is where the language demand increases slightly, as they need to articulate a connection.
    *   **Comparison to Anchors:**
        *   **"Theme of a poem" (5%):** Much higher language demand (abstract concept, literary analysis).
        *   **"Differentiate archaeological/literary sources" (15%):** Requires defining two concepts and giving examples. "Differentiate" is a higher-order thinking skill and vocabulary item.
        *   **"My favorite season" (30%):** Personal, common topic, but requires paragraph writing (6-8 lines) and specific details. The language demand is on sustained writing.
        *   **"Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%):** Pure recall, direct from text, low language demand.
        *   **"Two Fundamental Rights" (66%):** Pure recall, direct from civics content, very low language demand.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Naming two resources is pure recall of geographic facts.
    *   **Application/Simple Reasoning:** Explaining the influence requires a basic understanding of how resources impact human activity. It's not complex reasoning but connecting a cause (resource) to an effect (influence on lives).

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Naming resources for a state is a very common textbook exercise.
    *   Explaining the *influence* of a resource is also common, often found in "short answer" or "explain why" questions. It's a foundational concept in geography.
    *   The question is direct and does not require complex analysis or creative thought.

**Overall Assessment:**

This question has two parts: a straightforward recall part (naming two resources) and a slightly more demanding, but still simple, explanation part.

*   Many students will be able to recall at least one or two resources from Rajasthan. Common ones like water (due to scarcity) or minerals (mining is a major activity) are likely to be known.
*   The explanation part requires a basic understanding of cause and effect. "Water scarcity leads to less agriculture" or "Minerals lead to mining jobs" are fairly intuitive connections taught in Class 6.
*   The language demands are manageable. "Influence" is a common enough word in the Social Science context.
*   The average pass rate for items on this exam is 29%. This question is more demanding than pure recall (like Fundamental Rights or the King's questions) but less abstract or demanding than literary analysis or complex differentiation.
*   The "My favorite season" item at 30% required more sustained writing and expression of personal ideas. This question is more factual and constrained.

Considering the common knowledge about Rajasthan's resources (minerals, water, desert environment suggesting sand/solar), and the straightforward nature of the explanation, a significant portion of students should be able to get at least some credit, if not full credit. The biggest hurdle might be articulating the *explanation* clearly in English. However, even a basic, incomplete explanation might score some points depending on the lenient scoring indicated by the anchors ("Winter Sweater Baju" got 3 points for "My favorite season").

Given the 30% for a paragraph, and 50% for direct recall of a story detail, this question sits somewhere in between. The explanation part is what pushes it slightly below the easier recall items.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **38%**
