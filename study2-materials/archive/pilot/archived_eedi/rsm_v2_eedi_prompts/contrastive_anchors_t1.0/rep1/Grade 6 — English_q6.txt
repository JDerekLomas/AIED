Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimate:

## Contrastive Analysis of "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Poem Comprehension:** Students need to have understood the poem "The Last Bargain" to some extent. This includes understanding the literal meaning of lines and potentially their emotional or thematic content.
*   **Vocabulary:** Understanding the words within the chosen line and being able to express a reason for liking it requires a certain level of vocabulary.
*   **Basic Opinion/Preference:** The fundamental concept of "liking" something and being able to articulate *why* is assumed. This is a common social and cognitive skill, but expressing it in written English can be challenging.

**2. Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
*   **Identifying a Line:** This is relatively straightforward if they can read and find a specific sentence.
*   **Expressing Preference ("I like..."):** This is basic English, likely taught early.
*   **Providing a Reason ("because..."):** This is the main linguistic hurdle. Students need to:
    *   Formulate a coherent sentence or phrase.
    *   Use appropriate connectors (like "because").
    *   Access descriptive vocabulary to explain their reason (e.g., "it shows freedom," "it is beautiful," "it makes me happy").
    *   The "why" can be abstract (e.g., "it teaches a lesson") or concrete (e.g., "it talks about nature"). Abstract reasons are harder to articulate.
*   **Grammar and Spelling:** While the rubric is lenient (Max score: 1.5, suggesting partial credit for attempts), students still need to convey meaning intelligibly.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
*   **Recall:** Partially, as they need to recall lines from the poem.
*   **Application:** Partially, as they apply their understanding of the poem to form a personal opinion.
*   **Reasoning:** Primarily. The "why" component requires a personal reflection and explanation, which is a form of simple reasoning. It's not deep critical analysis, but it goes beyond mere factual recall.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
*   **Similar to "Explain why..." or "What is your opinion...":** Many textbook exercises for Class 6 will ask for opinions or explanations, but often these are about more concrete topics or have more structured prompts.
*   **Less demanding than abstract theme analysis (like the 5% anchor):** They don't need to deduce a theme, just state a preference and a reason.
*   **More demanding than simple recall (like the 50% anchor):** It's not just listing three questions; it requires original thought.
*   **Comparable to the "My Favorite Season" (30% anchor) in structure, but potentially harder in content:** "My favorite season" allows for very personal, concrete descriptions (wear, eat, do). "Why do you like a *line from a poem*" requires engaging with the text itself and articulating a potentially more abstract reason. This is a subtle but important difference. Students might struggle more to explain *why* a particular phrase or sentiment in a poem resonates, compared to explaining why they like playing in the rain.

**Comparison to Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea...** This is much harder. It requires higher-order thinking, abstract synthesis, and sophisticated vocabulary. Our target question is easier.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources...** This requires specific factual knowledge and the ability to compare/contrast, using specific terminology. Our question is less about factual recall and more about personal response. The language demand for the 15% item is higher for precise definition.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph on "My favorite season."** This is the closest comparison. Both require personal expression and explanation. However, "My favorite season" allows for very concrete details (what you wear, eat, do), which are often easier for students with limited English to describe. Explaining *why* a line from a poem is liked might require more abstract reasoning and vocabulary. The structure is similar, but the content "why a line" is slightly more demanding than "why a season."
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is pure recall of specific details from a story, making it significantly easier than our target question, which requires personal opinion and justification.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%
