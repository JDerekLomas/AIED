Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic understanding of geometric shapes, specifically a triangle.
    *   Knowledge of the concepts of "base" and "height" in the context of a triangle.
    *   Recall of the formula for the area of a triangle: `Area = 1/2 × base × height`.
    *   Basic multiplication and division (specifically, multiplying by 1/2 or dividing by 2).
    *   Understanding of units of measurement (cm, cm²).

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   The question uses relatively simple English: "Find the area," "triangle," "base," "height." These are common mathematical terms.
    *   The numbers `8` and `6` are clearly presented.
    *   Compared to the "theme of the poem" or "differentiate between sources" items, the language here is significantly less complex and abstract. It doesn't require inferring meaning, complex sentence parsing, or understanding nuanced vocabulary.
    *   The instructions are direct and unambiguous.

3.  **Type of Cognitive Task:**
    *   This is primarily an **application** task, leaning heavily on **recall** of a specific formula.
    *   Students need to recall the formula and then plug in the given values and perform a simple calculation.
    *   It does not involve complex reasoning, multi-step problem-solving, or deep conceptual understanding beyond applying the formula. It's a direct computation.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very **standard and fundamental** exercise for Class 7 mathematics when learning about the area of triangles. It's often one of the first few examples or practice problems presented after the formula is introduced.
    *   It's simpler than problems that might require deriving the base or height from the area, or problems involving composite shapes, or word problems where the base and height aren't explicitly given.
    *   It's comparable to the "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%) in terms of direct recall/application, but the math problem has a single, unambiguous correct answer, making it slightly more 'findable' for those who know the formula. The "three questions" item requires remembering specific details from a story, which can be prone to slight variations in recall.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **5% item (Poem theme):** Much harder. Requires deep comprehension, abstract thinking, and articulating a nuanced idea in English. This math problem requires none of that.
*   **15% item (Differentiate sources):** Harder. Requires understanding historical concepts, distinguishing between types, and providing examples, which demands both recall and some analytical thought, along with more complex language.
*   **30% item (Favorite season paragraph):** Involves creative writing, organization of thoughts, and sustained English prose. While seemingly simple, many students struggle with the writing demands. The math problem is objective and computational.
*   **50% item (King's questions):** More comparable. Both require recall of specific information/formula and direct application. The math question is arguably slightly easier because the formula is universally true, and the calculation is straightforward. The king's questions require remembering specific textual details.
*   **66% item (Fundamental Rights):** This is a direct recall item from Civics/Social Science. It's very similar in structure to recalling a math formula. If students have learned the Fundamental Rights, they can list them. Similarly, if they've learned the area of a triangle formula, they can apply it. The math problem might be slightly harder than just *naming* two rights, as it requires a calculation step. However, the calculation is very basic.

**Overall Assessment:**

The question is a direct application of a fundamental formula. The language is simple, and the cognitive load is low. The main hurdle will be whether students have learned and remembered the formula for the area of a triangle and can perform basic multiplication. Given the average pass rate of 29% across the exam, this question, being a core math concept and a direct application, should perform significantly above average, especially compared to the English and abstract reasoning items. It's simpler than the 30% writing task and at least as accessible as the 50% recall task, if not more so due to its objective nature. The calculation `1/2 * 8 * 6 = 4 * 6 = 24` is very simple.
