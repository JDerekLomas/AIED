Here's a breakdown of the analysis for the question "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it."

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic understanding of the concept of "hobby."
    *   Ability to identify and articulate one's own hobby.
    *   Knowledge of simple sentence structure and paragraph formation.
    *   Vocabulary related to common hobbies and expressing enjoyment.
    *   No specific factual knowledge from a curriculum is required, making it universally accessible in terms of content.
    *   *Comparison:* This is similar to the "My favorite season" item in that it requires personal expression rather than factual recall.

*   **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Hobby," "mention," "enjoy." These are relatively common words, but "mention" might be slightly less frequent than "talk about" (used in "My favorite season").
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Requires forming cohesive sentences and linking them into a paragraph. The prompt explicitly asks for 4-5 sentences, providing a clear structural guide.
    *   **Grammar:** Basic present tense (for describing the hobby and when it's done) and expressing reasons (e.g., "because I enjoy...").
    *   **Cohesion:** Connecting ideas smoothly within the paragraph (e.g., "My favourite hobby is X. I do it Y. I enjoy it because Z.").
    *   *Comparison:* This question has slightly higher structural demands than simply listing (like the Fundamental Rights item) or identifying parts of a story (like the King's questions). It's comparable to "My favorite season" but potentially slightly easier due to the more concrete and personal nature of hobbies (often simpler vocabulary). The explicit sentence count (4-5) is a good scaffold.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   Primarily **application** of language skills to express personal information.
    *   It requires a degree of **reasoning** to articulate *why* they enjoy it, moving beyond simple description.
    *   It is not recall of facts.
    *   *Comparison:* Similar to "My favorite season" in requiring personal expression and justification, but less abstract than identifying a "theme" (5% pass rate item).

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   This is a very common type of "free writing" or "personal expression" exercise found in Class 7 English textbooks, especially for developing paragraph writing skills.
    *   The prompt is clear and structured, making it a standard task.
    *   It's less demanding than differentiating concepts (15% pass rate item) or analyzing literature (5% pass rate item).
    *   *Comparison:* Very similar in type and difficulty to the "My favorite season" prompt (30% pass rate item). Both require personal, descriptive writing within a set structure. The topic of "hobby" might be slightly more universally accessible and less subject to seasonal variations or cultural specificities than "season."

**Overall Assessment:**

This question is very similar to "My favorite season" (30% pass rate). Both require:
*   Writing a short paragraph (4-5 sentences for hobby, 6-8 for season).
*   Expressing personal preferences.
*   Explaining *why* they enjoy it.
*   Relatively simple vocabulary.

The main differences are:
*   "My favorite hobby" asks for 4-5 sentences, while "My favorite season" asks for 6-8 lines. The slightly shorter length *might* make "hobby" marginally easier for students struggling with writing stamina or English fluency.
*   The concept of a "hobby" is very concrete and widely understood, often with simple associated vocabulary. "Season" is also concrete, but descriptions can vary more widely.
*   The "My favorite season" item's examples show students often just listed words related to the season rather than forming full paragraphs. The explicit "4-5 sentences" for 'My Favourite Hobby' might encourage more complete sentence formation, but some students might still resort to fragmented answers.

Given the average pass rate of 29% and the strong similarity to the "My favorite season" item (30%), this question should fall in a similar range. It's a fundamental English writing task for this age group, but the language barrier and general low average pass rate will still limit the number of correct responses that meet the "complete paragraph" rubric. The slight reduction in required sentence length (4-5 vs 6-8) could make it *marginally* easier or less daunting.
