Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis: "Identify the adjective phrase in the sentence: A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony."

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Basic grammar:** Students need to know what a "phrase" is and what an "adjective" is. This is typically covered in Class 6 or 7 English grammar in Indian schools.
*   **Vocabulary:** The words "tiny," "bird," "built," "nest," "balcony" are all very common and should be within the vocabulary of most Class 7 students, even those with limited English.
*   **Sentence structure:** Understanding that "tiny" modifies "bird."

**2. Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
*   **Misleading term "adjective phrase":** This is the *biggest* challenge. The question asks for an "adjective phrase," but the correct answer, "tiny," is a single adjective, not a phrase. A true adjective phrase would be something like "very tiny" or "tiny and brown." This is a significant trap for students who have a literal understanding of grammar terms. They might be looking for multiple words or get confused when "tiny" is the only option that fits the adjective description.
*   **Simple sentence:** The sentence itself is very straightforward, with no complex clauses or unusual vocabulary.
*   **Instruction comprehension:** "Identify" and "in the sentence" are common instructions.

**3. Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
*   **Application with a twist:** It requires applying the definition of an adjective to a sentence. However, the "adjective phrase" terminology turns it into a test of precision and potentially, how students handle an instruction that doesn't perfectly align with the simplest correct answer. Students might recall what an adjective is, but struggle to apply it under the "phrase" constraint.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   **Typical exercises:** Often, Class 7 exercises would simply ask "Identify the adjective" or "Underline the adjective." Asking for an "adjective phrase" when the answer is a single adjective makes it *more difficult* than a standard exercise.
*   **Potential for overthinking:** Students might correctly identify "tiny" as an adjective but then discard it because it's not a "phrase," leading them to search for something else or leave it blank. This is a common pitfall in assessments designed by people who don't anticipate how learners interpret instructions.

## Comparison to Calibration Anchors:

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of a poem:** Requires deep comprehension, abstract thinking, and English expression. Much harder.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate archaeological/literary sources:** Requires recall of specific history definitions, comparative analysis, and clear articulation. More demanding than identifying a single word.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Paragraph on "My favorite season":** Requires creative writing, sentence construction, and sustained English output. Much more demanding in terms of language production. Students scoring here likely have decent vocabulary and sentence structure.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer:** Requires recall of specific plot details from a known story. If they know the story and can recall the details, it's relatively straightforward. This is purely recall.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name two Fundamental Rights:** Pure recall of specific, often-memorized facts. If they know the facts, it's easy. This is the closest in *type* (identifying a specific piece of information), but the "adjective phrase" trap makes our target question harder than just naming facts.

## Conclusion on Difficulty:

The core task of identifying "tiny" as modifying "bird" is quite easy. However, the instruction "adjective phrase" introduces significant cognitive load and potential for error.
*   Many students will correctly spot "tiny" as the modifier.
*   A significant portion of those will then get confused by "phrase" and either try to find something else (like "in our balcony" as a prepositional phrase, or "built its nest" as a verb phrase) or doubt their initial correct identification.
*   Some might even incorrectly assume "a tiny bird" is the phrase, but the rubric specifically asks for "tiny."

Given the average pass rate of 29% and the fact that the "phrase" instruction is a strong distractor for what is otherwise a simple identification, I expect the performance to be higher than the 30% creative writing task, but lower than the direct recall tasks (50% and 66%) due to the grammatical nuance and potential misinterpretation. It's likely
