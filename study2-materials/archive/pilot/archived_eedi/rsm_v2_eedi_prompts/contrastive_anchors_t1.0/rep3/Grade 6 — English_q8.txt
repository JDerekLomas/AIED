This question tests basic sentence construction in English. Let's break down its difficulty compared to the anchors and Class 6 context:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic English vocabulary (book, reading, is, he, a). These are very common words, likely encountered early in English learning.
    *   Fundamental understanding of English sentence structure: Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). This is a core concept taught in elementary English grammar.
    *   Knowledge of capitalization for the start of a sentence and ending punctuation (implied, though not explicitly required by the rubric for scoring, a complete answer would include it).
*   **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** Extremely low demand. All words are very basic.
    *   **Grammar/Syntax:** The core challenge is rearranging words into a grammatically correct SVO structure. While this is a fundamental concept, for students with limited exposure, it might not be intuitive. However, the given words strongly suggest the 'He is reading a book' structure due to the common verb phrase 'is reading' and the common noun phrase 'a book'.
    *   **Length/Complexity:** Very short and simple sentence. No complex clauses or abstract concepts.
*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of grammatical rules. Students need to apply their knowledge of SVO structure to the given words. It's not pure recall (like naming fundamental rights) nor complex reasoning (like differentiating historical sources).
*   **How it compares in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   This is a very common type of exercise found in early English language textbooks for beginners. It's often one of the first grammatical exercises after learning basic vocabulary and present continuous tense. It's foundational.

**Comparison with Anchors:**

*   **vs. 5% (Theme of a poem):** Far, far easier. That item requires abstract comprehension, inference, and articulate expression in English, which is very challenging for this demographic. This sentence rearrangement is concrete and direct.
*   **vs. 15% (Differentiate sources):** Much easier. That item requires specific factual recall, conceptual understanding of two different types of historical sources, and the ability to articulate examples, all in English. This is a higher-order thinking skill compared to simple sentence construction.
*   **vs. 30% (Paragraph on favorite season):** Easier. That item requires sustained writing, organization of ideas, and a broader vocabulary within a specific topic. While the vocabulary here is simpler, the task is much more constrained and has only one correct answer. The "Winter / Sweater / Baju" response shows a very basic level of English, but even that student might be able to arrange these simpler words.
*   **vs. 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Likely similar or slightly easier. That item requires recall of specific details from a story. If the story was well-understood, recalling the three questions is straightforward. If not, it's a blank. This sentence rearrangement, however, tests a fundamental skill (grammar) that might be applicable even if story recall is weak. The words themselves provide strong clues.
*   **vs. 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Likely slightly harder, but in the same ballpark. That item is pure recall of specific facts, which if memorized, is easy. If not memorized, it's impossible. This item requires applying a rule, which is also fundamental but might require a moment of thought if the SVO structure isn't perfectly internalized. However, the simplicity of the words and the clear subject, verb phrase, and object make it very intuitive. The provided incorrect response for the 66% item ("Viser to epumat") suggests some students struggle with even simple recall/recognition in English.

**Synthesizing the Difficulty:**

The given words ('book', 'reading', 'a', 'is', 'he') are highly indicative of the correct SVO structure. 'He' is the obvious subject, 'is reading' is a clear verb phrase, and 'a book' is a clear object. The ambiguity is very low. This is a very basic, foundational grammar task. Given the average pass rate of 29% across items, and the fact that 50% can recall three specific plot points and 66% can name two fundamental rights, this grammatical task, being so basic, should yield a higher pass rate. Many students, even with limited English, will have encountered this exact type of exercise.

A common error might be getting the auxiliary 'is' in the wrong place or failing to capitalize 'He', but the rubric only requires the correct word order for the score of 1.
