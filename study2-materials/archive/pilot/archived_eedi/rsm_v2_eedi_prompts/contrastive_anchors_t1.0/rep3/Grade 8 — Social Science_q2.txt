Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimate:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Medium:** Students are expected to have studied ancient Indian history, specifically the Harappan Civilization (also known as the Indus Valley Civilization) in Class 8. This is a standard topic in Indian history curricula. They need to recall specific details about its urban planning.
    *   **Comparison to anchors:**
        *   Easier than "Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" (15%) because that requires understanding *and* comparing two concepts, which is more complex than recalling a feature of one.
        *   Similar to "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%) in that it requires specific recall from a text/lesson. However, "Harappan urban planning" is a broader concept than "three questions from a story," so there might be more variation in what students remember.

*   **Language Demands (limited English proficiency):**
    *   **Medium:** The question "Describe one key feature..." is straightforward. The terms "key feature" and "urban planning" are likely to have been encountered in context. Students don't need to write a lengthy paragraph or complex sentence structures; a simple, accurate description will suffice.
    *   **Comparison to anchors:**
        *   Easier than "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain'" (5%) which requires abstract thought and expressing a nuanced idea in English.
        *   Comparable to "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%), where specific recall is key, and the answer can be relatively short.
        *   Easier than "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season'" (30%), which demands more sustained English writing.
        *   Similar to "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66%), where naming specific items is sufficient. "Describe one key feature" is slightly more demanding than just "naming" but doesn't require complex explanation.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   **Primarily Recall:** This question is almost entirely recall. Students either remember a key feature of Harappan urban planning or they don't. There's no application of knowledge or complex reasoning involved.
    *   **Comparison to anchors:**
        *   Pure recall, like "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%) and "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66%).
        *   Less demanding than "Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" (15%), which involves comparison and understanding.
        *   Much less demanding than "Write a theme or central idea..." (5%), which requires higher-order thinking.

*   **Difficulty compared to typical textbook exercises:**
    *   **Medium-Easy:** This is a very common type of question found at the end of a chapter on the Harappan Civilization. "List features of Harappan cities" or "Describe the urban planning of Harappa" are standard textbook exercises. The phrasing "one key feature" makes it even more accessible.

**Synthesis:**

This question taps into core knowledge from a prominent Social Science topic. The language demand is low, and it primarily requires straightforward recall. While students from EWS backgrounds and Hindi-medium schools might struggle with English expression generally, the expected answer here is quite specific and can be short. The concept of Harappan urban planning (grid layout, drainage, bricks, citadel) is often visually reinforced in textbooks, aiding memory.

The "What were the three questions..." (50%) anchor is a good comparator for simple recall. This question is arguably slightly easier because there are multiple correct answers (grid, drainage, bricks, citadel), whereas the king's questions are fixed. It's also slightly more complex than just "naming" two fundamental rights (66%), as it requires a brief *description*.

Given the average pass rate of 29% for the exam, this question, being a relatively common and recall-based Social Science item with multiple acceptable answers and simple language, should perform above average.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 45%**
