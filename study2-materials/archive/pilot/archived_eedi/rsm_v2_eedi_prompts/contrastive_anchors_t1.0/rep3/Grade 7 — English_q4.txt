Here's an analysis of the question and my estimate:

## Contrastive Analysis of "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Minimal factual recall:** Students need to remember the *gist* of the king's questions from the preceding passage (which is likely "The Three Questions" by Tolstoy). They don't need to recall them verbatim, just their nature. This is less demanding than recalling specific historical facts or scientific concepts.
*   **Basic understanding of "important" and "real life":** These are common, foundational concepts.
*   **Ability to formulate a simple reason:** This requires basic logical thinking and expression.

**Language Demands:**
*   **Relatively simple vocabulary:** "Important," "real life," "reason" are all high-frequency words.
*   **Simple sentence structure:** The question uses a direct "Do you think...?" structure.
*   **Open-ended but focused response:** While it asks for an opinion, the prompt restricts it to "one reason" and connects it directly to the king's questions. This reduces the burden of extensive English writing compared to, say, summarizing a long passage or writing a descriptive paragraph.
*   **No complex grammatical structures or idiomatic expressions:** This makes it more accessible for students with limited English proficiency.

**Type of Cognitive Task:**
*   **Application/Reasoning (Opinion-based):** This is not pure recall. Students need to *apply* the king's questions to their own understanding of "real life" and *reason* why they might be important. It involves a personal judgment, but one that is likely to be easily justifiable.
*   **Low-stakes reasoning:** Because it's an opinion question, there isn't a single "right" answer for the reason, as long as it's coherent. This reduces the pressure compared to questions with definitive correct answers.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   **Easier than many recall-based questions:** Textbooks often ask for specific facts, definitions, or summaries. This question asks for a personal opinion and a simple justification.
*   **Similar to "think and discuss" questions:** Many textbooks include questions that encourage personal reflection, but this one requires a written response, which adds a layer of difficulty for English learners.
*   **Less demanding than the 30% pass rate "My favorite season" prompt:** That prompt required a *paragraph* (6-8 lines) with specific content points, demanding more sustained writing and organizational skills. This question asks for a single reason, likely a sentence or two.
*   **More demanding than the 66% pass rate "Name any two Fundamental Rights":** That was pure recall of two specific items, requiring minimal language production beyond the names themselves. This question requires understanding, forming an opinion, and articulating a reason.
*   **Potentially similar to the 50% pass rate "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?":** That question required recalling the specific questions. This question builds on that, assuming they know the questions, and asks for a personal judgment. The key difference is that the "three questions" question has a *single correct answer*, whereas this one allows for a range of valid reasons. This makes it slightly easier in terms of getting *something* right.

**Overall Assessment:**

The question is designed to be accessible.
*   The language is simple.
*   The cognitive task is opinion-based application, which often feels less intimidating than factual recall for students who might lack specific knowledge.
*   The "give one reason" structure provides a clear, concise scope for the answer, preventing students from feeling overwhelmed by the need for a lengthy explanation.
*   Many students, even with limited English, can likely grasp the idea that knowing the right time/people/action is generally beneficial.

Compared to the anchors:
*   It's significantly easier than the 5% and 15% items, which require deeper analysis, differentiation, or nuanced understanding.
*   It's easier than the 30% item ("My favorite season") due to less writing demand.
*   It's potentially slightly easier than the 50% item ("What were the three questions?") because there's more leeway in the "reason" part, and the core concept (importance of the questions) is fairly intuitive. A student might not recall the *exact* wording of the king's questions but can still grasp their *essence* and provide a valid reason for their importance.
*   It's harder than the 66% item, which is pure recall.

Given the average pass rate of 29% and the calibration anchors, this question sits comfortably in the middle-to-upper-middle range of difficulty
