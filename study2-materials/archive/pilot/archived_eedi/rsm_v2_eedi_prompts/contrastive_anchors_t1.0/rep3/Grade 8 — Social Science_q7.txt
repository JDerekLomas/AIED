## Analysis of "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"

Let's break down the question's difficulty for Class 8 Indian government school students.

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Specific Event Recall:** Students need to know about the Battle of Plassey (1757) as a historical event. This is typically covered in Class 8 history textbooks.
*   **Causality/Consequence:** They need to understand that historical events have consequences and be able to articulate the *impact* of Plassey.
*   **Basic Understanding of British East India Company (EIC):** They should have a general idea that the EIC was a powerful entity and was involved in expanding British influence.
*   **Political Terms:** Concepts like "political dominance," "control," "puppet nawab," or even "territory" are essential to answer correctly.

**2. Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**

*   **Vocabulary:** "Contribute to," "expansion," "power," "political dominance," "puppet nawab" – these terms might be challenging for students with limited English. While "contribute to" implies cause, some students might struggle to articulate it.
*   **Sentence Structure:** The question is relatively straightforward in its structure ("How did X contribute to Y?"). However, formulating a coherent answer explaining the causal link requires a certain level of English sentence construction.
*   **Keywords:** "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "British power," "India" are all key terms. If students recognize these, it can help them access the relevant knowledge.

**3. Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   **Recall (Moderate):** Recalling the basic facts of the Battle of Plassey is primarily recall.
*   **Application/Reasoning (Moderate-High):** The "how did it contribute" part requires more than just recall. Students need to *apply* their knowledge of the battle's outcome to explain its *significance* in the broader context of British expansion. This moves beyond simple factual recall to a more analytical understanding of cause and effect. It's not just "what happened?" but "why was it important?".

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Standard Textbook Question:** Questions about the significance or consequences of major historical events like the Battle of Plassey are very common in Class 8 history. Textbooks often have "Explain the impact of..." or "Discuss the significance of..." type questions.
*   **Beyond Simple Recall:** It's more demanding than a simple "When was the Battle of Plassey?" or "Who fought in the Battle of Plassey?" It requires synthesizing information and articulating a causal relationship.
*   **Specificity of Answer:** The rubric requires explaining the establishment of *political dominance/control over Bengal* or the *puppet nawab*. This requires a precise understanding of the immediate aftermath, not just a vague idea of "British power increasing."

**Contrastive Analysis with Anchors:**

*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" (5%):** This is highly interpretive and requires abstract thinking about literary themes, which is very difficult for this cohort. Our question is factual and analytical, not interpretive.
*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15%):** This is a differentiation task, requiring precise definitions and examples. It's more about classification and factual recall of definitions. Our question involves explaining a historical process.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... on 'My favorite season.'" (30%):** This is a creative writing task requiring personal expression and basic sentence construction. It tests general English writing skills, but not specific academic content knowledge or analytical ability. Many students struggle with basic paragraph structure and elaboration.
*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%):** This is direct recall from a story. If the story was read and understood, the answers are explicit. Our question requires more synthesis.
*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India." (66%):** This is direct recall of specific, likely memorized, social science facts. This is highly direct and less analytical than our target question.

**Conclusion:**

Our target question sits in the middle-to-lower end of analytical questions. It's standard curriculum content, but requires understanding historical causation rather than just isolated facts. The English demand is moderate, with key academic terms. Students need to move beyond simple recall to explain *why* the battle was significant. The requirement for explaining *political dominance over Bengal* specifically adds a layer of precision.

Comparing it to the anchors:
*   It's harder than direct recall (Fundamental Rights,
