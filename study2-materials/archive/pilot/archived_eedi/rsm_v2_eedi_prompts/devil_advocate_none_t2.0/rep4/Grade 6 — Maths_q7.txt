Let's break down the thinking process, keeping the stated biases in mind.

**Initial Gut Reaction (The biased one):**
"This is a pretty straightforward word problem. It involves basic time calculation and multiplication/addition. Most 6th graders *should* be able to do this. Maybe 60-70%."

**Challenging the Gut Reaction (Applying the 'expert bias' correction factors):**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "At `10` am in the morning..." - Fairly common phrasing.
    *   "...temperature of Jodhpur was `30^0 C`." - Clear.
    *   "...If the temperature increases by `2^0 C` per hour..." - "Increases by per hour" is crucial and can be tricky for limited English speakers. They might miss "per hour" or interpret "increases by" as simply "adds to" without considering the duration.
    *   "...what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?" - "in the evening" helps distinguish from AM, but "4:00" might be ambiguous (AM vs PM) for some if not explicitly "PM".
    *   *Self-correction:* The phrasing "increases by X per hour" is a common mathematical phrase, but for struggling readers, parsing it correctly can be a major hurdle.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   **Time Calculation (10 AM to 4 PM):**
        *   This requires understanding the 12-hour clock system and mentally bridging noon.
        *   10 -> 11 -> 12 (noon) -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.
        *   This is 6 hours. Many students, especially if they struggle with abstract thought or have less structured time at home, might count fingers or just struggle. A common error could be 4 - 10 (not possible), or simply thinking "4 hours" or "2 hours" (4pm minus 2pm difference, ignoring the AM/PM change). Or maybe 12 - 10 = 2 hours, then 4 more, 2 + 4 = 6. This process requires several steps of understanding.
        *   *Self-correction:* This specific time calculation isn't trivial for all 6th graders, especially those less exposed to formal problem-solving. It's multi-step.
    *   **Multiplication/Addition:** Once the 6 hours is determined, 6 * 2 = 12, then 30 + 12 = 42. This arithmetic is simple *if* they get to this stage.
    *   *Self-correction:* The biggest hurdle isn't the final arithmetic, but setting up the problem.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:**
    *   If they hit a wall on the time calculation or misinterpret the "per hour" part, they might just freeze and leave it blank, even if they could do simpler arithmetic.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   While they've likely seen time problems and simple "increase by" problems, the *combination* with the specific time frame spanning AM/PM and the rate of change might be novel. They might practice temperature readings *only* for single readings, or rate problems for things other than temperature.

**Re-evaluation:**

*   **English:** The "increases by X per hour" is a common stumbling block.
*   **Time Calculation:** 10 AM to 4 PM. This isn't just 4-10 or 10-4. It requires understanding noon, which adds a layer of complexity.
    *   Error scenario 1: Student assumes 4-10 = 6 but misunderstands AM/PM context (unlikely to get to -6 hours) or calculates simply 4 hours (e.g., just focusing on "4 pm").
    *   Error scenario 2: Counts: 10->11 (1hr), 11->12 (2hr), 12->1 (3hr), 1->2 (4hr), 2->3 (5hr), 3->4 (6hr). This is the correct, but somewhat manual, method, and prone to miscounting for weaker students.
*   **The "Rubric" is telling:** The rubric specifically highlights "Calculates the time elapsed from `10:00` am to `4:00` pm as `6` hours." This implicitly tells me that this step is considered a significant hurdle that many will fail. If students fail *this* specific calculation, they get
