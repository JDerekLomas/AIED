ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **9%**

Here's the reasoning behind this lower estimate, pushing past initial intuitions:

*   **Limited English Comprehension:** The question uses phrases like "contribute to the expansion" and "political dominance/control" which are not simple. Students with basic reading ability might struggle to understand the nuances required to link the battle to "expansion of British power." Many will only pick up on "Battle of Plassey" and "British power" but miss the causative link and mechanism.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:** While the Battle of Plassey is a landmark event in Indian history taught in Class 8, understanding its *contribution to the expansion of power* and the concept of *political dominance* or *puppet nawab* requires a level of analytical comprehension beyond rote memorization of facts (like who fought, who won).
*   **Absenteeism and Gaps in Learning:** Given the low average pass rate and the economic background, it's highly probable that many students have significant gaps in their learning, including having missed the specific lessons on the political aftermath of Plassey. Even if they've "covered" it, it might not have sunk in deeply enough to articulate a cause-and-effect relationship.
*   **Anxiety and Lack of Practice with Question Type:** Students in this demographic often lack practice with analytical questions that require more than a simple recall of names and dates. The prompt asks "How did X contribute to Y?" This type of inferential and explanatory question can be daunting, leading to blank responses even if they have some partial knowledge.
*   **Specificity of Rubric:** The rubric requires explaining that the victory led to "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)." This is a very specific understanding. Many might simply say "British won," or "British became powerful," which wouldn't quite hit the rubric's mark for political dominance/puppet ruler.
*   **Challenging First Instinct:** My initial instinct might be "Oh, everyone knows Plassey, it's famous." But then I remember the target group: economically weaker, limited English, low pass rates, patchy attendance, and less exposure to analytical question types. Simply knowing *of* the battle isn't enough; they need to explain its *consequences in a specific way*.

Considering these factors, 9% acknowledges that some students will grasp it due to strong teaching or individual aptitude, but the vast majority will likely miss the mark due to a combination of language barriers, incomplete understanding of concepts, and lack of practice with analytical questions.
