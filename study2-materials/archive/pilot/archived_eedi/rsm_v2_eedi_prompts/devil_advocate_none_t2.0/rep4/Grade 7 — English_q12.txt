Here's a breakdown of the thinking process, keeping the given constraints and biases in mind:

1.  **Initial Impression (and how to fight it):** My *first* thought as an educated English speaker is, "Oh, that's a straightforward active-to-passive transformation. Most students should get that." This is exactly the kind of expert overestimation the prompt warns about.

2.  **Applying the "Challenge Your Instinct" Lens:**

    *   **Limited English:**
        *   Do students understand "wind," "blew," "leaves," "away"? Likely, these are relatively common words.
        *   Do they understand "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice"? *This is a huge red flag.* Even if taught, the terminology itself can be a barrier. They might know *how* to change it but not understand the *instruction*.
        *   Can they correctly interpret "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice"? This relies on understanding abstract grammatical terms.

    *   **"Basic" Concepts Not Basic:**
        *   **Subject-verb-object identification:** "The wind" (subject), "blew" (verb), "the leaves" (object). This is fundamental to the transformation. Struggling learners might mix these up.
        *   **Forming "be" + past participle:** This is the core mechanic.
            *   "blew" -> past participle "blown." (Irregular verb – many students struggle with irregular past participles).
            *   Choosing the correct form of "to be": "were" (plural leaves) vs. "was." This requires subject-verb agreement *in the new sentence*.
        *   **Reordering:** Object becomes new subject, original subject becomes "by the agent."
        *   **Omitting "by the agent" (optional but common):** The rubric includes "by the wind," so students would ideally include it.

    *   **Exam Anxiety:** Even if they know it, anxiety can cause simple errors, like forgetting "by the wind," misrecalling "blown," or using "was" instead of "were."

    *   **Never practiced this *exact* question type:** While they might have practiced active/passive, they might not have practiced this specific sentence, or a sentence with an irregular verb, or a sentence where the object is plural.

    *   **Absent for this topic:** A significant number of students likely missed the lesson entirely, or it was rushed, or taught in a way that didn't stick.

    *   **Low overall pass rate (29%):** This is a strong indicator of the general academic level. If only 29% pass *exams*, a more complex grammatical transformation won't fare much better, and possibly worse.

3.  **Refining the "Who will struggle" group:**
    *   Students who don't understand the instructions ("Active/Passive Voice").
    *   Students who struggle with irregular verbs ("blew" -> "blown").
    *   Students who struggle with subject-verb agreement ("leaves" -> "were").
    *   Students who forget the "by the agent" part.
    *   Students who transpose parts incorrectly (e.g., "The leaves blowed away by the wind").
    *   Students who can identify subject/verb/object but get lost in the transformation mechanics.
    *   Students who confuse tenses.

4.  **Calibrating the Estimate:**

    *   Given the general pass rate of 29%, a grammatical transformation with multiple steps and abstract terminology will likely be *below* average.
    *   The irregular verb ("blew" -> "blown") is a significant hurdle.
    *   The need for correct form of "to be" ("were") is another.
    *   The term "Active/Passive Voice" itself.

    If 29% pass exams generally, then a question requiring multiple correct grammatical changes, understanding of specific terminology, and correct irregular verb form will certainly pull that number down.

    *   Would it be as low as 5-10%? Possibly, if instruction was very poor or students completely unexposed.
    *   Could it be near 20-25%? Only if the teaching was highly effective and repeated, which isn't generally the case for struggling learners.

    Considering all factors, especially the *irregular verb*, the *plural subject agreement*, and the *abstract terminology*, this isn't just a simple swap. It tests several distinct grammatical rules.

    Let's think of it in steps, with likely failure points:
    1.  Understanding the instruction "Change to Passive Voice": 70% might grasp it.
    2.  Identifying subject/verb/object: 6
