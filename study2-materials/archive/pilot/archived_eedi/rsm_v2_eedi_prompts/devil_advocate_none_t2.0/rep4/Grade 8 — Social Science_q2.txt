Here's a breakdown of the thinking process to arrive at the calibrated estimate:

1.  **Initial Instinct & Counter-Argument (The "Challenging" Phase):**

    *   **Initial Instinct:** Harappan Civilization is a core topic in Indian history for this age group. They definitely would have been taught about its urban planning. Concepts like "grid layout" and "drainage" are relatively straightforward. Maybe 40-50%?
    *   **Challenge 1: Limited English:** "Describe one key feature" is a simple enough instruction, but for a student with "limited English," recalling and *articulating* specific historical terms *in English* can be a major hurdle. Even if they know "jal nikasi" (drainage), converting that to "advanced drainage system" or "well-planned drainage" can be difficult. "Grid layout" might be completely lost if the Hindi equivalent wasn't perfectly translated and memorized.
    *   **Challenge 2: "Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:** While taught, the *nuance* of "urban planning" or "key feature" might not resonate for all. Some might just recall "Harappa had cities" without being able to extract a "key feature." If they were taught about 10 facts, singling out *one key feature* might be tricky.
    *   **Challenge 3: Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** Especially for weaker students, the pressure can cause them to forget even simple things. They might have studied it but simply draw a blank.
    *   **Challenge 4: Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** While "describe" is common, have they specifically practiced *singling out and describing one key feature of Harappan urban planning* using the English terms required? Or have they mainly done fill-in-the-blanks, multiple-choice, or simple recall in their local language? The transfer of knowledge to this specific question format in English is crucial.
    *   **Challenge 5: Absent for Topic/Poor Instruction:** The average pass rate is 29%. This implies a significant portion of students are not grasping the material. Absence during this specific topic, or instruction that was not clear/engaging enough, or simply the student being overwhelmed by many other topics, means many will have a weak or non-existent understanding.
    *   **Challenge 6: The "29% average pass rate" Anchor:** This is a crucial piece of information. If the overall pass rate is low, it means a substantial portion struggles with *most* things. While Harappan civ might be considered important, it's not uniquely "easy" compared to other topics they might be failing.

2.  **Recalibrating based on challenges:**

    *   A student needs to *understand the question* in English.
    *   A student needs to *recall a specific fact* about Harappan urban planning.
    *   A student needs to *articulate that fact* in grammatically acceptable English (e.g., "drainage system," not just "water out").
    *   They have to be able to do this *under exam conditions*.

    Considering all these factors, the proportion of students who can successfully tick all these boxes for a seemingly straightforward history question, especially given the demographics and general academic struggles (29% pass rate), is going to be significantly lower than what a confident English speaker might assume.

    *   The "well-planned grid layout" and "advanced drainage system" are the most prominent and frequently taught.
    *   "Use of baked bricks" is a feature, but less central to *urban planning* itself than the layout or drainage.
    *   "Division into citadel and lower town" is good, but again, perhaps less universally recalled as a *single key feature* compared to the others.

    Even if 50-60% vaguely know about Harappa having "good cities," how many can translate that into one of the *specific features* listed in the rubric *in English* and convey it clearly?

    Many will write fragmented answers, partial answers, or answers that show a vague understanding but don't quite hit one of the key points as required by the rubric for "Max score: 1." The rubric is specific about "correctly describes one key feature."

3.  **Final Estimate:**

    Pulling back from the initial high estimate, and severely discounting for English comprehension, poor recall, test anxiety, and the general academic performance level, I'd bring it down considerably. If the average pass rate is 29%, a question that requires recall and articulation in a second language for students struggling in general might not fare much better, even for a "core" topic.

    *   29% is the *average pass rate*, so some items might be
