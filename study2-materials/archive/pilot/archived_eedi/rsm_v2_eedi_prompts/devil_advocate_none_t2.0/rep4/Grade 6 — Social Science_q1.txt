Let's break down the difficulty.

**Factors for lower performance (and why a first instinct might be too high):**

*   **English Language Barrier:** "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."
    *   "Major" might be a nuance lost on some.
    *   "Mountain ranges" might be understood, but if their primary language is Hindi or a regional language, accessing the English term and linking it to their knowledge base could be difficult.
*   **Vocabulary/Concepts:**
    *   Do they understand what a "range" is as opposed to a single peak? Probably.
    *   Even "mountain" might be primarily understood in their local language.
*   **Prior Knowledge & Curriculum Coverage:**
    *   They are in Class 6. Indian geography, including major mountain ranges, *should* have been covered in Social Studies/EVS. However, "covered" doesn't mean "mastered" or "retained."
    *   Variability in teaching quality across government schools is huge. Some may have excellent teachers; others, absent or underperforming ones.
    *   Many students might only vaguely remember "Himalayas." Recalling a *second* one (Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, etc.) is a higher cognitive load.
*   **Recall vs. Recognition:** This is a recall question, which is harder than recognition (e.g., choosing from a list).
*   **Exam Anxiety:** Can easily lead to blanks or mixing up concepts.
*   **Limited Practice:** While they might have learned about it, have they practiced *this exact question type* of "name any two"?

**Considering "Max score: 0.5" for *one* correct answer:**

The rubric is quite generous, asking for just *one* correct name for 0.5 marks. This significantly increases the proportion of students who can score *something*. Many might remember only "Himalayas" or possibly "Aravalli" if they are in a relevant region or have heard of it culturally.

**Challenging the first instinct (which might have been 50-60% initially because it's "basic geography"):**

No, "basic geography" is basic for those who have a solid educational foundation. For students from EWS with limited English, frequent absences, and variable teaching quality, this isn't basic.

*   Could a student who barely reads English recall *any* English name for an Indian mountain range? *Possibly* "Himalayas" as it's very prominent.
*   Could a student who was absent for this topic? *Unlikely* they'd recall even one unless they learned it informally.
*   Could they correctly spell it? The rubric doesn't specify spelling, just "names one correct mountain range."

Given that the average pass rate for Class 6 in general is around 29% for *all* questions, a specific question that requires recall in a foreign language (English) about geography will likely not fare *significantly* better than the average for the whole test, especially since 0.5 marks means only half the full marks of the question.

If 29% is the *pass rate*, it means getting 33% marks (or whatever the threshold is). This single question is very low-stakes (0.5 marks).

**My revised estimate:**

*   Many students will *know* the Himalayas in some form. Recalling the English name correctly (or a close approximation) for 0.5 marks.
*   A smaller group might also recall Aravalli, Vindhya, or Satpura, either from specific lessons or regional knowledge.
*   A significant number will simply leave it blank due to English barrier, lack of recall, or anxiety.

I initially thought ~40-50% for 0.5 marks (i.e., naming one correctly). But remembering the consistent overestimation and the extreme limitations mentioned:

*   **Limited English:** Reduces ability to process the question and retrieve the English answer.
*   **"Basic" isn't basic:** While culturally significant, recalling a formal English name for two distinct ranges for 6th graders is not simple.
*   **Anxiety/Blank Responses:** Will reduce numbers significantly.
*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** Less confident in framing the answer.

If they could correctly name *one* for 0.5 marks:

I'm leaning towards the *lower end* of what one might initially assume for such a seemingly straightforward knowledge point, given the constraints. 29% is an *average pass rate*. This particular question asks for very specific recalled information in English.

For 0.5 marks (naming *one* correctly):
Let's consider that the most commonly known range would be
