Here's my thought process for calibrating the estimate:

1.  **Initial Gut Reaction (and why I'd distrust it):** My first thought might be, "Oh, selecting a line and explaining why is pretty straightforward. Most kids should be able to do that, even if their 'why' is simple." This is exactly the kind of expert overestimation the prompt warns against. I'm forgetting the real challenges.

2.  **Deconstructing the Prompt's Warnings:**

    *   **"Limited English":**
        *   "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" This sentence itself is several words. "Which," "line," "from," "poem," "do you," "like," "the most," "and," "why." A student with limited English might understand "like" and "poem" but struggle to stitch the whole instruction together, especially "the most" and "why."
        *   They might understand *what* a line is, but the concept of "liking" it and *articulating a reason why* in English could be a significant barrier.
        *   Even if they understand, their vocabulary to express a "why" might be severely limited. "Good," "nice," "I like it" might be the extent. The rubric expects "mentions why." Is "I like it" sufficient? (Assuming it would be, given the target audience and level).

    *   **"Basic concepts aren't basic for struggling learners":**
        *   "Liking a line" isn't inherently complex, but *reflecting* on why you like something is a meta-cognitive skill. For students primarily focused on decoding or literal comprehension, this step might be novel or difficult.
        *   They need to *identify* a line (easy enough if they can write it), but then *process* the instruction to explain *why*.

    *   **"Exam anxiety causes blank responses":** If a student immediately feels overwhelmed by the English or the task, they might just stare blankly or copy a random line without providing a "why."

    *   **"Many students have never practiced this exact question type":** This is crucial.
        *   Indian government schools, especially at lower grades, often focus on rote memorization, comprehension checks (literal questions), and grammar. Expressing a personal opinion and justifying it ("Why do you like X?") is less common in this specific educational context.
        *   Even if they have, doing it in English when their general proficiency is low makes it harder.

    *   **"Could a student who barely reads English?":** Unlikely to fully grasp the instruction "like the most and why." They might just write down a line.

    *   **"Could a student who was absent for this topic?":** This isn't really "topic-dependent" in terms of content from the poem itself (as the poem isn't given). It's more about understanding the instruction. If they were absent for basic instruction on expressing opinions or answering "why" questions in English, it would be difficult.

3.  **Applying the Rubric:**
    *   "Denotes a line from the poem": Relatively easy *if* they understand the instruction. They might copy the whole poem or a stanza if confused, but *selecting a line* still requires some understanding.
    *   "Mentions why": This is the real hurdle. What constitutes "mentions why"? If "I like this line because it's good" counts, then it's slightly easier. If it needs *any* kind of justification beyond mere liking, it's harder. Given "economically weaker sections," I'd lean towards *any* justification being sufficient, even if rudimentary.

4.  **Recalibrating based on average pass rate (29%):** The 29% pass rate implies that *most* students are struggling across the board. A question like this, which goes beyond mere factual recall or simple comprehension, is likely to be harder than a direct recall question.

5.  **Hypothetical Scenarios for Success:**
    *   **Full understanding and ability:** Writes a line, "I like this line because it makes me feel happy/it's about animals/it has nice words." (This is what the question wants).
    *   **Partial understanding - "line" but not "why":** Copies a line, leaves "why" blank. (Does not meet rubric).
    *   **Partial understanding - "why" in a general sense but not applied to a *line*:** Might just say "I like the poem" or "the poem is good." (Does not meet rubric - needs a specific line).
    *   **Limited English - "like" understood, but not "
