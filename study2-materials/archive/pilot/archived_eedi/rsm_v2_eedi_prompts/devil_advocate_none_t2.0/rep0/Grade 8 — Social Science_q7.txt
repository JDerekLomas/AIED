Let's break down the difficulty factors:

1.  **Language Barrier:**
    *   "How did... contribute to..." - This is fairly standard English but requires understanding causal relationships.
    *   "Expansion of British power" - Understandable.
    *   "Rubric": "establishment of British political dominance/control," "puppet nawab" - These are more complex concepts and vocabulary that might not be readily understood, even if explained in class. Students might remember parts without grasping the full meaning.

2.  **Content Knowledge - "Battle of Plassey 1757":**
    *   This is a core topic in Indian history for Class 8. It *should* be taught.
    *   However, "taught" does not mean "retained" or "understood in its full implication."
    *   Many students might know "Battle of Plassey" and "1757" as facts, but linking it directly to the *consequences* for British power expansion is a higher-order thinking skill than just recall.
    *   Specifically, knowing about Mir Jafar as a *puppet* is key to showing understanding of "political dominance/control." Without understanding the "puppet" aspect, they might just say "British won" or "British got more power," which wouldn't fully meet the rubric.

3.  **Rubric Specificity:**
    *   "establishing British political dominance/control over Bengal" is very precise. Simply saying "British became powerful" might not get the mark.
    *   "placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab" is an excellent example of a specific detail that would satisfy the rubric. Students would need to recall this specific consequence.

4.  **Factors that experts misjudge:**
    *   **Limited English:** While the question isn't overtly complex, the concepts (political dominance, puppet) can be difficult to express and understand in limited English, especially in an exam setting.
    *   **"Basic" Concepts:** While the Battle of Plassey is fundamental, the *implications* and *mechanisms* of political control it established are not "basic" for struggling learners. They might know the winner but not the sophisticated details of *how* that led to "political dominance."
    *   **Exam Anxiety:** Can easily lead to blanks or generalized answers ("British won," "British got stronger") that miss the rubric's specific requirements.
    *   **Never Practiced this Exact Question Type:** While "cause and effect" is common, many government school curricula might emphasize rote memorization of facts more than detailed analysis of consequences leading to political structures. Students might be able to list facts about Plassey but struggle to articulate its *contribution* to a larger trend of power expansion, specifically in terms of political control in Bengal via a puppet ruler.

**Challenging my first instinct:**
My first instinct might be around 40-50% because "Plassey is important." But then I consider:
*   A student who *barely reads English* will struggle to formulate the complex idea of "political dominance via a puppet" even if they somewhat recall the content. They might simply write "British won Bengal."
*   A student *absent for this topic* (or one of the many days where the nuance was explained) will certainly fail.
*   The **precision** required by the rubric is high. Simply stating "British won the battle" or "British got control" without specifying "political dominance *over Bengal*" and ideally referencing the *mechanism* (puppet nawab) might not secure the full mark.

Given the average pass rate of 29% for this group and the specific demands of the rubric, particularly needing to explain *how* it led to political dominance (e.g., via Mir Jafar), which is more nuanced than just "British got powerful":

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **18%**
