Let's break down the difficulties involved for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, especially given their background.

**Factors Reducing Correct Responses:**

*   **English Language Proficiency (Major Barrier):** "Write a short paragraph" itself requires a higher level of English comprehension than simply answering a multiple-choice question. Students need to understand:
    *   "Short paragraph" (structure, flow)
    *   "Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it" (these are distinct requirements to be fulfilled within the paragraph)
    *   "My Favourite Hobby" (possessive 'my', understanding 'hobby').
    *   Many will struggle with sentence construction, correct grammar, and vocabulary for expressing their thoughts in English, even if they have an idea in their native language.
*   **Writing Skills (Compositional Difficulty):**
    *   Forming 4-5 coherent sentences is a significant task for students with limited practice in formal writing in English.
    *   Ensuring the sentences flow and address all three parts of the prompt (what, when, why) can be hard. They might write three separate sentences instead of a paragraph, or miss one of the elements.
    *   Spelling errors, grammatical mistakes (tenses, subject-verb agreement, prepositions) will be very common.
*   **Concept of "Hobby":** While many will understand the general idea, some may struggle to articulate *their* favourite hobby specifically, or differentiate it from everyday activities.
*   **Exam Anxiety:** For a written response question, anxiety can easily lead to a "blank slate" or very rudimentary, incomplete answers, even if they know some English.
*   **Lack of Practice with "Paragraph Writing" in English:** While they might do paragraph writing in their local language, explicit instruction and practice for this type of free-response question in English, with specific elements to include, might be inconsistent.
*   **Absenteeism/Inconsistent Teaching:** The "average pass rate of 29%" suggests fundamental gaps in learning. Many would have missed critical English grammar or writing classes.
*   **Understanding the Rubric Implicitly:** They need to inherently understand what a "complete paragraph" means and that all three elements *must* be present to score 1 point. A partial answer (e.g., only mentioning what the hobby is) would likely score 0.

**Challenging Initial Instinct:** My initial instinct, based on general knowledge, might be "this is a basic writing task." However, factoring in the specific constraints (low pass rate, economically weaker sections, limited English, anxiety, inconsistent learning environment), the difficulty significantly increases. Simply having a "favourite hobby" and some basic English words is not enough. They need to string them together grammatically and structurally into a coherent paragraph fulfilling multiple criteria.

Given that only 29% pass overall, a more complex task like this, requiring independent writing and adherence to specific instructions, will likely have a lower success rate than multiple-choice or very short answer questions. The rubric is strict ("complete paragraph," "clearly mentions all three"). Many will write something, but fail to meet *all* criteria for a '1'.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

I would expect a very small percentage to successfully write a complete, coherent paragraph in English that ticks all three boxes as per the rubric. Many might try, but their attempts would likely be fragmented, grammatically incorrect to the point of unclear meaning, or miss one or more of the required elements.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **12%**
