Let's break down the challenge here.

**The Question:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"
**The Rubric:** "Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why." (Max score: 1.5 - This implies *any* reasonable line and *any* reasonable 'why' will get the point).

**Assessing the Cognitive Demands:**

1.  **Reading Comprehension (Poem):** Students need to read and understand the *gist* of the poem to select a line. If the poem itself is complex or uses unfamiliar vocabulary, this is the first hurdle.
2.  **Vocabulary/Concept ("line," "like the most," "why"):**
    *   "Line": Most Class 6 students should understand "line" in the context of a poem, especially if poetry has been taught at all.
    *   "Like the most": Straightforward, personal preference.
    *   "Why": This requires justification, even a simple one.
3.  **Expression/Writing (English):** This is the biggest hurdle for students with limited English.
    *   **Identifying the line:** They need to be able to transcribe or clearly refer to a line from the poem.
    *   **Explaining 'why':** This is where English proficiency becomes critical. Even a simple "because it is good" or "I like trees" requires basic sentence construction.

**Challenging First Instincts (Teacher/Expert Bias):**

My first instinct might be: "This is a simple question. It's about personal opinion. They just pick a line and say 'because I like it' or 'it's beautiful'."

Now, let's apply the given cautions:

*   **Limited English:**
    *   Can they *read* the poem sufficiently well to *have* a favorite line? What if the poem itself uses vocabulary they don't understand?
    *   Can they *write down* the line correctly, or at least clearly reference it (e.g., "the first line")? Copying itself can be error-prone.
    *   Can they articulate *any* reason, even a basic one, in English? "I like it" is one sentence. "Because it makes me happy" is a little more complex. "Because it reminds me of my village" is even more so. Many students might *feel* a reason but lack the English to express it.
*   **"Basic" concepts not basic:** While "liking" something is basic, articulating *why* is not always, especially when translating thoughts into a foreign language. The idea of offering a justification itself might be less emphasized in their learning environment compared to rote memorization.
*   **Exam Anxiety:** For many, the blank page and the demand to produce original English prose, however simple, can lead to a complete shutdown. They might simply leave it blank.
*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** They might have done comprehension, but "express your opinion and justify" might be less common than "answer factual questions."

**Revisiting the Rubric (and the "why"):**

The rubric is *generous*: "Denotes a line from the poem *and* mentions why." This implies even "Line 3. Because I like it" could suffice. The key is "mentions why."

**Crucial Considerations Specific to Indian Government School Class 6:**

*   **Exposure to poetry:** They might read poems, but are they regularly *analyzing* them or discussing *preferences*? Often, the focus is on comprehension and specific questions.
*   **Oral vs. Written:** They might be able to articulate a preference orally, but writing it down in English is a different skill.
*   **Copying Skills:** Copying a specific line from a poem accurately could still be a challenge for some.

**The Calibrated Estimate:**

Given the average pass rate of 29% for this group, a question requiring this level of *original production* in English, even with a generous rubric, is difficult.

*   Many will likely fail to articulate a "why" beyond perhaps just re-stating "I like it" (which *might* not even count depending on strictness of "mentions why" in practice).
*   Some won't understand the poem sufficiently to form a preference.
*   Some will suffer from anxiety and simply leave it blank.
*   The actual task of selecting and copying the line isn't trivial for all.

I would expect a significant drop from the average pass rate for questions demanding production rather than simple recall or selection.

If 29% pass overall, this question requires higher-order thinking (justification, even simple) and creative production in a foreign language.

Let's imagine:
