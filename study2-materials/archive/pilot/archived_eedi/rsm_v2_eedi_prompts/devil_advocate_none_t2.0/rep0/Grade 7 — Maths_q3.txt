Let's break down the question and the context carefully, applying the caveats provided.

**Understanding the student population:**
* **Economically weaker sections:** Implies less access to resources, tutors, potentially less focus on education due to other stressors.
* **Limited English:** This is a *huge* factor. "Find the area... base is... height is..." are fairly straightforward terms, but the cognitive load of processing them in a second language, even basic, is real.
* **Average pass rate ~29%:** This is a stark reminder of general academic struggles. If they're barely passing *all* subjects, complex or simple, their grasp of any *specific* concept might be fragile.
* **"Basic" concepts aren't basic:** The area of a triangle might be considered "basic" by a curriculum designer, but for students who struggle with foundational math, even this can be a hurdle.
* **Exam anxiety:** Can make students forget even known formulas.
* **Never practiced this exact question type:** While "find area given base and height" is common, variations in wording, or the numerical values themselves, can trip students up if they haven't seen that *exact* setup.

**Analyzing the specific question:**
* **Concept:** Area of a triangle.
* **Formula:** `Area = 1/2 * base * height`. This is not inherently complex, but involves a fraction and multiplication.
* **Numerical values:** `8` and `6` are simple integers, making calculation easy (`1/2 * 8 * 6 = 4 * 6 = 24`).
* **Keywords:** "Area," "triangle," "base," "height." These are fairly standard geometric terms.

**Initial instinct vs. Calibrated estimate:**
My *initial* instinct, thinking purely from a curriculum perspective, might be "this is a fundamental topic taught early, probably 60-70% would get it if they just know the formula."

**Challenging the instinct:**
1.  **Limited English:** While the words are relatively common, parsing "Find the area of a triangle whose base is X cm and height is Y cm" might take extra processing. If they miss just one key word (e.g., confuse "base" or "height" or even "area" itself), the whole problem becomes intractable.
2.  **"Basic" isn't basic:** Many students might know *a* formula for a triangle, but incorrectly apply one for perimeter or have a corrupted version (e.g., `base * height` without the `1/2`). For students struggling with number sense, even multiplying by `1/2` can be a problem if they haven't explicitly learned decimal equivalence or dividing by two.
3.  **Absence/Fragile learning:** A significant portion of these students could have been absent when this was taught, or simply not grasped it. They might recall "something about base and height" but not the precise relationship.
4.  **Formula recall:** The question is *only* about stating/using the correct formula. They don't need to get the final answer. This slightly increases the proportion as partial understanding (remembering the formula) counts. However, recalling *which* formula from several geometry formulas can be tough under pressure.
5.  **What if they write `base * height`?** This is a common error if `1/2` is forgotten, indicating a partial understanding, but according to the rubric, it would not be correct.

Considering the *low overall pass rate (29%)* for *all* questions, and the combined weight of limited English, struggling learners, and anxiety, this question, while appearing simple to an expert, presents multiple hurdles for a significant portion of this demographic. Even for those who can decode the English, recalling the precise formula (especially the `1/2`) is not guaranteed for a population with generally weak academic performance.

My revised estimate would place it significantly below the typical "easy" question assumption. The fact that the rubric focuses solely on the formula usage (not calculation errors) is a small boost, but still, *getting the formula completely right* will be difficult for many.

Let's imagine:
*   20-25% decode the English and correctly recall the full formula.
*   Another 10-15% might recall "base * height" but forget `1/2`.
*   Another 10% might confuse it with a perimeter formula or just write random numbers.
*   The rest (a large chunk) will struggle with English, basic concepts, or anxiety and leave it blank or make unrelated errors.

Given an *average* pass rate of 29% across *all* questions, and this being a moderately complex math concept for a struggling learner (albeit basic for others
