Let's break down the thought process to arrive at the estimate, considering the crucial warnings.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):**
* "Harappan Civilization" is a core topic in Indian history textbooks for Class 8. Students should have covered it.
* "Urban planning" is a key aspect discussed.
* "Key feature" seems straightforward.
* Common answers like grid layout or drainage system are emphasized.
* "One" feature makes it simpler.
* *Initial uncalibrated thought might lean towards 50-60%.*

**Applying the Warnings & Calibrating:**

1.  **Limited English:**
    * "Describe" – requires coherent sentence formation, not just a keyword.
    * "Key feature" – implies understanding *why* it's key, not just remembering a random detail.
    * "Urban planning" – this term itself might be a barrier for many who struggle with academic vocabulary. They might recognize "city layout" or "building houses" better.
    * Many might understand the general concept but struggle to articulate it in English correctly for a formal answer.
    * *Impact: Significant reduction.*

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    * While taught, the *understanding* of the significance of "grid layout" or "advanced drainage" might be superficial. They might just memorize a phrase without truly internalizing what it means.
    * They might know the *word* "drainage" but can't elaborate on *why* it's "advanced" or a "key feature."
    * The quality of teaching in many government schools (especially economically weaker areas) varies significantly. Rote memorization is common.
    * *Impact: Moderate to significant reduction.*

3.  **Exam Anxiety:**
    * A simple question can seem daunting under pressure, leading to blanking out even if they have some knowledge.
    * Fear of writing incorrectly in English.
    * *Impact: Moderate reduction.*

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    * While they might have answered MCQs or fill-in-the-blanks about Harappan features, a "Describe one key feature" question demanding their own prose construction might be new.
    * They might be able to *identify* the feature from options but not *recall and articulate* it.
    * *Impact: Moderate reduction.*

5.  **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is a *crucial* data point. It means a large majority of students are failing *overall*. For them to get this specific question correct requires more than just knowing the answer; it requires the English proficiency, articulation skills, and content mastery to convey it properly. If the average pass rate is so low, expecting a significantly higher rate on a comprehension and expression question seems unrealistic. Many questions contribute to that 29%. If this was an easier question than most, it might be a bit higher than 29%, but not by a huge margin given the other challenges.

**Re-evaluating based on calibration:**

* The core content (Harappan Civilization features) *is* taught. This gives a baseline.
* But the *demand* of the question (articulating a "key feature" using "describe" in English) is high for the target group.
* The typical Class 8 government school student struggling with basic literacy and numeracy is unlikely to craft a perfect answer even if they've heard the terms. They might write "road straight" or "water pipe" which might not fully meet "correctly describes one key feature."

Consider students who:
* Know "grid layout" and can write "Harappan cities had roads that were straight like a grid." (Correct)
* Know "drainage system" and write "They had good water pipes." (Potentially correct, depending on rubric interpretation, but might lack the "key feature" nuance)
* Know "baked bricks" and write "Houses were made of fire bricks." (Potentially correct)
* Know about the "citadel" and "lower town" and write "The city had two parts, a fort and the normal houses." (Correct)
* Those who know one of these in their regional language but cannot translate it to decent English. (Incorrect)
* Those who only remember a vague detail like "big cities" or "they were advanced." (Incorrect)
* Those who know nothing or are too anxious. (Incorrect)

Given the very low overall pass rate (29%), this question is certainly *not* a slam dunk for the majority. It demands a combination of recall, comprehension, and expression that many struggling students will lack. It's likely one of the questions that separates the struggling learners from those who manage to pass.
