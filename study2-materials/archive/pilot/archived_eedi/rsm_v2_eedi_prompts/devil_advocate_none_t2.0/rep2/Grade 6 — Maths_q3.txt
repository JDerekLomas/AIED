Let's break this down with the challenges in mind:

1.  **Limited English:** While "ascending order" might be taught, it's still two non-cognate words. Even if they know it, recalling it under pressure is hard.
2.  **"Basic" isn't basic:** Arranging numbers by magnitude is a fundamental skill. However, for struggling learners, especially those with interrupted schooling or limited foundational practice, it's not automatic. They might mix up hundreds, thousands, etc.
3.  **Exam anxiety:** Seeing four large numbers and an English instruction can immediately trigger a "blank" response, especially for students already low on confidence.
4.  **Novelty of question type:** While "ordering numbers" might have been taught, this *exact* presentation (four large numbers, a specific instruction, maybe on a test sheet) might feel unfamiliar or daunting. They might have practiced with smaller numbers, or visually.
5.  **Focus of the rubric:** The rubric only requires identifying *the smallest number (736) and placing it first* for 0.5 marks. This is a crucial distinction. They don't need to arrange all four perfectly, just get the first one right.

**Challenging the first instinct:**

My initial instinct might be: "This is a pretty straightforward number comparison task, maybe 40-50%."

*   But wait: "ascending order" is still a hurdle. What if they get "descending" confused?
*   What if they can't confidently compare `736` (three digits) with `3367` (four digits) instantly and think it's trickier than it is?
*   The fact that they *only* need the first one makes it a bit easier. If they can correctly identify 736 as the smallest and write it down first, they get the mark. They don't even need to write the other three.

Considering a 29% average pass rate for Class 6 students in general for the entire test, this specific sub-task (just getting the first number right) is arguably easier than many others that involve more complex operations or understanding of English.

However, the obstacles are still very real for a significant portion of the cohort. Many might stop after reading "Arrange in ascending order" because they are not confident in that specific English phrase or their number comparison skills. Others might simply pick the first number `3367` by default.

Given the constraints, especially the *limited English* and the fact that "basic" concepts aren't for all, I need to bring down the estimate significantly from an "ideal" classroom. The average pass rate is very low.

I think the key mitigating factor is that only the *first* number needs to be correct. Students who can distinguish between 3-digit and 4-digit numbers would likely get this right, and many would have some grasp of number value. The English phrasing remains a barrier, but it's a commonly taught phrase.

Still, considering students who:
*   Misunderstand "ascending order."
*   Are tripped by the large numbers.
*   Are anxious and just guess.
*   Are genuinely weak in basic number sense.

I can't put it too high. The 29% overall pass rate strongly suggests a large proportion struggle with foundational skills. If the average pass rate is 29%, a question that hinges on a simple concept but has linguistic barriers shouldn't be much higher than average for a half-mark, even if it's perceived as "easy" by an adult. The specific requirement for only the *first* number slightly bumps it from what it would be for the whole sequence.

If the *entire* sequence needed to be correct, I'd say maybe 15-20%. For *just the first number correctly placed*:

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%**
