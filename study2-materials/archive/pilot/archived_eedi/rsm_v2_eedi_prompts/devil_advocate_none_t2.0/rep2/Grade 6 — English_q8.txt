ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **40%**

Here's my reasoning after challenging assumptions:

**Initial Instinct (too high):** My initial instinct, based on it being a fairly simple sentence structure in English, might have been around 60-70%. I'd think "it's basic present continuous, SVO, they must have learned this."

**Challenging Assumptions and Downward Adjustment:**

*   **Limited English:** "book/reading/a/is/he". While "he," "is," "a," "book" are common words, "reading" might be less common than expected for students with *very* limited English, especially if they haven't frequently encountered the "-ing" form in context. They might understand "read" but struggle with "reading" as part of a continuous verb.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** Subject-verb-object order *is* basic, but it's not inherent. It's learned. Students who struggle with reading comprehension in English will definitely struggle with sentence formation, even with a clear list of words. They might recognize words but not their grammatical roles.
*   **Absenteeism/Lack of Practice:** If a student was absent when present continuous was taught, or if they rarely get to practice sentence construction questions, they will struggle significantly. Given the context of government schools in India, these are highly probable.
*   **Anxiety/Unfamiliar Question Type:** Rearranging jumbled words is a specific question type. If students haven't practiced it before, even with simple words, the novelty and the "jumbled" nature can induce anxiety and confusion. They might try to create any valid-sounding string rather than the grammatically correct one.
*   **Common Mistakes:** I've seen students try variations like "Reading a book he is," "He a book is reading," "A book he is reading." They might understand parts but struggle with the precise order for a "meaningful sentence" as defined by standard English grammar. The placement of "a" before "book" is key but not obvious to a struggling student who might see "book" and "a" as separate, unattached words.
*   **Low Average Pass Rate (29%):** This is a critical piece of information. If the *average* pass rate is 29% for a whole exam, then a single, relatively simple English grammar question might score higher than the average, but not by a massive amount, especially given the aforementioned difficulties. It's *one of the easier* questions they might face, but not necessarily "easy" for the target demographic.

**Re-calibration:**

While "He is reading a book" is simple for a native speaker or a strong English learner, the cumulative challenges facing a Class 6 student in an Indian government school from economically weaker sections significantly reduce the success rate. The words themselves are largely familiar, which prevents it from dropping below 30-35%. However, the grammar, the "continuous" aspect, and the specific task of rearrangement will catch out many. I estimate a decent chunk of students (40-50%) *will* get it right because they've likely encountered this or similar structures. But an equally large chunk will falter due to vocabulary gaps (like "reading" in that form), grammatical uncertainty, or simply not understanding the task.

**Conclusion:** 40% feels like a reasonable balance. It's above the overall pass rate (suggesting it's relatively easier than many questions on the exam) but acknowledges the very real, practical difficulties faced by these students. It's significantly lower than what one might instinctively guess if projecting from a more privileged student background.
