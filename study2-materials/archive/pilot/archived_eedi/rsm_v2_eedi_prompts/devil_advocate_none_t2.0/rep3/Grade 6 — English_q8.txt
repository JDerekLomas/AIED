Let's break down the challenge for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering the provided context.

**Initial instinct (to challenge):** My first thought might be, "This is a pretty straightforward SVO (subject-verb-object) sentence. Most Class 6 students should get this, maybe 60-70%."

**Challenging the instinct, remembering the constraints:**

*   **Limited English:** "Book," "reading," "is," "he," "a" are common words. However, *rearranging* them correctly requires understanding basic English sentence structure. Many students might recognize the individual words but struggle with their proper order.
*   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic:** While SVO is basic to a fluent English speaker, for someone learning English in a non-immersive environment, the rules are not inherent. They might know "He," "is," "reading," but might put "a book" in the wrong place or reverse "is he."
*   **Exam anxiety:** This is a low-stakes exercise, but for many students, *any* question presented in an exam format can cause mental block.
*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** Even if they've learned about "he," "is," "reading," etc., they might not have had dedicated practice on *scrambled sentence* exercises. The act of decoding the prompt "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence" itself requires a certain level of English comprehension. Some might try to form two shorter sentences.
*   **Absent for the topic:** If the topic of basic sentence formation (SVO) was covered on a day they were absent, or if the instruction was not clear, they will struggle immensely.
*   **Confusion with interrogative:** Some might get confused with question forms like "Is he reading a book?" (less likely given the prompt, but possible for extremely weak learners).
*   **Simple inversion errors:** A common error even for slightly stronger students might be "Reading he is a book" or "A book he is reading."

**Refined Analysis:**

The words are common, which is a plus. The structure itself is simple SVO. However, the *task* of rearranging, combined with the other factors, significantly reduces the likelihood of success for the "average pass rate about 29%" student.

*   **Strongest students (top 15-20%):** They will likely get this. They understand SVO and the instruction.
*   **Mid-range students (the next 30-40%):** Some might get it, others will make common errors like "He reading is a book" or "A book he is reading." Their understanding of the *flow* of a sentence might not be solid enough.
*   **Weakest students (the remaining 40-50%):** Many will be completely lost. They might string words together randomly, perhaps "Reading a book he is" or "Is he reading a book" (misunderstanding it as a question). Some might simply leave it blank, or only write down a few words they recognize.

Given the overall pass rate of 29% for the cohort, and recognizing that even "simple" tasks become challenging under these conditions, I must err on the side of underestimation. If the average pass rate is 29% *overall*, a task requiring a specific structural understanding, even with common words, is not a slam dunk for the majority.

The ability to successfully decode the prompt *and* apply the grammatical rules, however basic, will separate a significant portion of the class. This isn't just about knowing words, it's about syntactical comprehension.

Considering the common pitfalls: confusion with instructions, weak grasp of SVO beyond memorized sentences, anxiety, and prior absence for lessons on structure...

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **45%**
