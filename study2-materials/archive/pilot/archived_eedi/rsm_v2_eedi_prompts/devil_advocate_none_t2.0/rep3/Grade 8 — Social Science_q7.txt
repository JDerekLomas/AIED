Let's break down the difficulty.

**Against High Pass Rate:**

*   **English Language:** "Contribute to," "expansion of," "political dominance," "puppet nawab" - these are all multi-syllabic, abstract concepts that are not part of basic conversational English. A student who barely reads English will struggle significantly with the *meaning* of the question itself, let alone the answer.
*   **Historical Context & Specificity:** While "Battle of Plassey" might be familiar, connecting it directly to "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal" and even mentioning "Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab" requires specific recall and understanding of cause-and-effect in history, not just memorizing a date.
*   **Abstract Concepts:** "Political dominance" and "expansion of power" are abstract. Many students learn history by memorizing events and dates, not necessarily by grasping the socio-political implications.
*   **"Economically weaker sections":** Often implies less exposure to resources like diverse reading material, which could make academic English even harder to grasp. Less likely to have external tutoring or a supportive learning environment that reinforces complex historical concepts.
*   **Exam Anxiety:** Complex questions like this, even if partially understood, can trigger blank responses.
*   **Topic Coverage/Attendance:** If a student was absent when this specific link (Plassey -> Bengal control) was taught, or if the teacher rushed through it, they might only remember the battle name but not its critical consequence.
*   **Question Type:** Explaining a "contribution" rather than just stating facts.

**Arguments for some success:**

*   **Key Event:** The Battle of Plassey is a *very* significant event in Indian history. It's almost guaranteed to be covered in Class 8.
*   **Rote Learning:** Many students in government schools excel at rote learning. They might have memorized a stock answer for "What was the significance of the Battle of Plassey?" and try to fit it here. The rubric asks for the core idea: "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal." This phrase or a close variant might be a common memorized takeaway.
*   **"Bengal" and "Nawab" might be mentioned in context of Plassey.**

**Recalibrating:**

My first instinct might have been closer to 20-25% because it's a key event. However, after considering the limitations, especially English comprehension and the *precision* required by the rubric ("political dominance/control over Bengal" - not just "British won"), that percentage feels too high.

The average pass rate for Class 8 is 29%, but that's for *all* questions. This specific question is complex.

Let's assume a student can barely read English, and their historical understanding is mostly rote. They might remember Plassey, the British winning, and maybe Bengal. But making the explicit link to "political dominance/control" and articulating it even simply, while navigating the "contribute to expansion of power" phrasing, is a major hurdle.

If even 1 in 10 can articulate the core political shift over Bengal in recognizable English, that might be stretching it for a struggling cohort. A few more might know bits and pieces but not enough to meet the rubric.

Let's factor in those who might have memorized a precise sentence or two for the significance of Plassey. Even for them, translating that into an answer to *this specific phrasing* is tricky.

Considering the "average pass rate is 29%" overall, a more complex, language-heavy history question would likely fall below that average.

I'm going to challenge my first instinct further. The combination of language barrier, the specific level of historical detail (political dominance, specific region), and exam pressure for a student from an economically weaker section means this question would stump a very large majority.

Perhaps a very small percentage who excel in history or have better language skills will get it. A few might get partial marks (if allowed), but for the full "1" mark meeting the explicit rubric, it's very tough.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 9%**
