This is a classic example where experts (like myself, when not properly self-calibrating) tend to overestimate. My first instinct *was* higher, but then applying the specific criteria helps.

Let's break it down using the given factors:

*   **Economically weaker sections, limited English:** Even "major mountain ranges" might be taught in local languages. Recalling the specific English terms, especially for students with limited English, adds a significant hurdle. They might know them in Hindi/Marathi/etc. but struggle to translate on the spot, or only recognize them if given a multiple-choice option.
*   **Average pass rate 29%:** This is a crucial anchor. If the overall pass rate is so low, this question needs to be considerably easier than the *average* question to get a higher score. Is it "considerably easier"?
*   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic:** While "Himalayas" might seem basic, remembering *two* and the correct spelling, especially for someone who struggles, is not trivial. Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western/Eastern Ghats are definitely less "basic" for many, and often not emphasized as strongly as the Himalayas.
*   **Exam anxiety:** Could easily lead to students remembering only one, or misremembering.
*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** "Name any two..." This is recall, not recognition.

**Challenging initial assumptions:**

My initial thought: "Himalayas is common knowledge. They probably know at least one other." This is where the self-correction comes in.

1.  **Limited English:** If they struggle with basic English, writing "Himalayas" correctly could be hard. Writing a second one, even if they vaguely remember it, becomes harder. They might write the local name, or an unintelligible phonetic approximation.
2.  **Recall vs. Recognition:** This isn't "Circle the mountains." It's "WRITE them down."
3.  **Knowing vs. Retrieving under pressure:** They might have *heard* of Vindhya, but can they *recall* it and spell it even partially correctly?
4.  **"Major":** While technically all listed are major, some are far more emphasized than others in teaching materials (Himalayas vs. Satpura). If they only remember Himalayas, they score zero for "two correct," but the rubric says "names one correct" for 0.5 points. So, getting *one* correctly spelled name gets them half credit. This is important.

**Re-evaluating based on the 0.5 point for one correct name:**

This drastically changes the landscape. How many students can correctly recall *one* major mountain range in India and write its English name semi-correctly (e.g., Himalayas, Himalya)? That seems much more attainable.

*   Himalayas is almost universally taught.
*   Even students with very weak English might be able to phonetically spell "Himalayas" to a recognizable degree, or simply know it from being visually distinct on maps they might have seen.
*   For the students hovering around the 29% average, knowing at least "Himalayas" for partial credit is a reasonably common outcome for an "easier" recall question.

Given the average pass rate is 29%, this question (getting 0.5 points for one correct range) should be significantly easier than the average to push its proportion higher. Remembering "Himalayas" seems like one of the most basic geographic recall items for India.

I think the key insight is the "Names one correct mountain range" and *not* two.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **35%**

*(Initial thought without strict calibration: 50-60%. Recalibration down due to English, recall difficulty, anxiety, and the general low pass rate, but not *too* far down because remembering "Himalayas" and getting partial credit seems quite accessible for at least *some* students in that struggling band.)*
