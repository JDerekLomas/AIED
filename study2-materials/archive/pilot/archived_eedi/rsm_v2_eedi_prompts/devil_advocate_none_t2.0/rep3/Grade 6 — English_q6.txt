Here's a breakdown of why this question is harder than it looks, especially for the target demographic, and how it leads to a lower estimate.

**Reasons for Overestimation by Teachers/Experts:**

*   **Forgetting English Limitations:**
    *   "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" This sentence structure is complex. "Which... do you like the most" is common for a native speaker but might be difficult for an emergent English learner.
    *   "Denotes" in the rubric: while students don't see this, it implies a specificity that they might struggle to meet. They need to *reproduce* a line, not just describe it.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   **Literary Analysis:** Liking a line "the most" and then *explaining why* is an entry-level literary analysis skill. For many struggling learners, poetry comprehension itself is a major hurdle. Even if they understand individual words, understanding the poem's overall meaning or emotional impact to then *choose a favorite line* is advanced.
    *   **Justification:** "Why?" is the killer here. It requires abstract thought, expression of personal opinion, and the vocabulary to articulate that opinion in English. This is much harder than simply answering a factual recall question.
*   **Exam Anxiety:** When faced with a complex question like this in English, combined with the difficulty of understanding the poem itself, many students might freeze or leave it blank. They might genuinely *not* know why they like a line, or struggle to put it into English words.
*   **Novel Question Type:** "Choose your favorite and explain why" might not be a common question type in their regular English classes, which often focus on grammar, vocabulary, or direct comprehension (e.g., "What is the boy doing?").
*   **Lack of Prior Engagement:** Students might not be encouraged to *engage personally* with texts in this way, rather just to extract information.

**Specific Challenges for This Question:**

1.  **Reading and Understanding the Poem:** The student first needs to read and comprehend the *entire poem*. This is the prerequisite, and given the low average pass rate, a significant number likely struggle here.
2.  **Identifying "A Line":** They need to accurately identify and perhaps transcribe a single line from the poem.
3.  **Understanding "Like the Most":** This requires personal judgment and an emotional response to the poem, which many might not have developed or feel comfortable expressing.
4.  **Articulating "Why" (The Biggest Hurdle):**
    *   Even if they like a line, verbally expressing *why* in English is a higher-order thinking skill.
    *   Vocabulary for emotional reasons (e.g., "it feels happy," "it sounds beautiful," "it makes me think of freedom") might be lacking.
    *   Grammar for constructing a sentence that links the line to the reason (e.g., "I like this line because...") will be a challenge.
    *   Students might give simplistic or generic answers if they can answer at all ("because it is good"). The rubric's "mentions why" is broad, but poor justification might still lead to partial credit or misinterpretation.
5.  **Partial Credit Scenario (Rubric):** Even if a student picks a line but fails on the "why," they get partial credit. However, given the compounding difficulties, the number who can fully meet the "denotes a line *and* mentions why" could be quite low.

**Re-calibrating the Estimate:**

Considering all the factors:

*   Many won't understand the poem well enough to pick a line meaningfully.
*   Even fewer will be able to articulate *why* they like it in coherent English.
*   The "average pass rate about 29%" suggests a general struggle with English literacy. This question is several steps *beyond* basic comprehension.

If a typical comprehension question (like "What is the boy's name?") might get 30-40% correct, a question requiring analysis, opinion, and justification in English for this demographic would be significantly lower. I suspect many might simply pick a line without giving a sensible reason, or struggle so much with the "why" that their answer is insufficient even for partial credit.

I am challenging my first thought that maybe 30% could get partial credit. The "why" is truly a major barrier. Many will likely leave it blank or write something completely unintelligible for the "why."

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:** **15%**
