Let's break down why this question is harder than it appears for Class 8 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections.

1.  **"Define":** This immediately requires a formal, structured response. It's not "What is a fable?" which might elicit a simpler, more intuitive answer. "Define" requires recall of a specific definition, often learned through rote.
2.  **"Fable":**
    *   **Vocabulary:** While "fable" is a common literary term in English, its presence and understanding depend entirely on consistent exposure in the curriculum and effective teaching. If the school largely operates in a local language for most subjects and English is a second/third language taught, the nuance of such terms might be missed or quickly forgotten.
    *   **Exposure:** Have they read fables consistently? Not just heard stories *like* fables, but specifically learned the term "fable" and discussed its characteristics in an English-medium classroom? Given limited English exposure, "story" or "moral story" might be more commonly understood terms they use, without necessarily associating them with the specific word "fable."
3.  **Rubric Requirements:**
    *   "short story": Relatively straightforward.
    *   "typically uses animals as characters": This is key. If they don't explicitly recall this part of the definition, they'll miss a core component.
    *   "imparts a moral lesson": This is also crucial.
    *   They need *all three* key elements for a "Max score: 1". Partial answers, even if they get one or two right, would likely score 0.

**Challenging Initial Instincts:**

*   **"Most students could do this":** No, they likely could not. The term "fable" itself, while common in affluent English-speaking contexts, is specialized vocabulary for many Class 8 government school students.
*   **"Basic concept":** It might seem basic, but formal literary definitions are not "basic" if language proficiency is low, and teaching might focus more on comprehension of a story rather than the precise definition of its genre.
*   **Limited English:** Many will struggle to articulate the definition formally even if they have an intuitive understanding. They might know "Lion and Mouse" is a fable, but writing "it is a short story where animals talk and teach a lesson" requires more advanced sentence structure and specific vocabulary recall than just recognizing an example.
*   **Absenteeism/Weak Teaching:** A significant number of students will have missed this lesson or it wasn't taught effectively in a way they retained the specific English terminology.
*   **Anxiety:** A student struggling with English might simply leave it blank, fearing they can't phrase it correctly, even if they have some idea.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Considering the language barrier, the need for a precise definition, and the context of economically weaker sections with low average pass rates, the proportion correct will be quite low. Many might recognize a fable but fail to *define* it correctly using the required elements in English. The need to hit all three points (short, animals, moral) is a high bar for this demographic.

My first instinct might have been 15-20% knowing it's difficult. However, after *challenging* that further based on the "all three elements needed" and "low English proficiency," it drives the number even lower. Students might get "moral story," but miss "animals," or vice versa, resulting in 0 marks.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **9%**
