Let's break down the thinking process, challenging assumptions at each step:

**Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):**
My first thought might be, "It's a straightforward word problem with basic arithmetic. Find the hours, multiply by the change, add to the start. Many Class 6 students should get this." If I stop here, I'm likely falling into the "expert bias" trap.

**Challenging the Initial Instinct (Applying the Given Constraints):**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "`10` am in the morning, `30^0 C`": This part is usually manageable, as numbers and 'am'/'C' are relatively universal symbols or familiar terms.
    *   "`temperature increases by `2^0 C` per hour`": "Increases by," "per hour" - these phrases are crucial. A student with very limited English might miss the *meaning* of "increases" and "per," especially if "per" isn't a frequently encountered preposition in their math context. They might only pick up on "2 degrees" and "hour."
    *   "`what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?`": "What will be" (future tense), "at 4:00 in the evening" (requires understanding AM/PM and time transitions).

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   **Time Calculation (10 AM to 4 PM):** This requires understanding a 12-hour clock and bridging AM to PM.
        *   10 am to 12 pm = 2 hours
        *   12 pm to 4 pm = 4 hours
        *   Total = 6 hours
        For many struggling students, especially those not regularly using clocks for precise time-telling or not having this type of problem practiced explicitly, this mental calculation (crossing noon) is a hurdle. They might just subtract 10 from 4 (incorrectly) or 4 from 10 (incorrectly), or miscount by using their fingers from 10 to 4 directly (e.g., 10-11-12-1-2-3-4 counts as 7 hours if not careful). This is a *major* point of failure even if they understand the rest.
    *   **Multiplication and Addition:** Assuming they get the 6 hours and the 2 degrees/hour, then 6 * 2 = 12. And 30 + 12 = 42. The arithmetic itself is simple, *if* they correctly extract the numbers and operations.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Never Practiced:**
    *   If a student hasn't seen *this exact combination* of time calculation (crossing noon) and temperature change, the anxiety can cause them to freeze or misinterpret.
    *   Lack of specific instruction or practice on "elapsed time over noon" for calculations like this is a very common gap.

**Re-evaluating based on challenged assumptions:**

*   **Time Calculation (10 AM to 4 PM = 6 hours):** This is the core of the rubric.
    *   Many will fail here due to:
        *   Misunderstanding AM/PM and crossing noon.
        *   Simple arithmetic errors in counting hours.
        *   Difficulty interpreting "10 am... 4:00 in the evening."
*   **English Comprehension:** Even if the arithmetic for hours is correct, comprehending "increases by... per hour" might be a challenge, but less central to the *rubric* specified (which focuses on elapsed time). However, misinterpreting the overall problem could still lead to incorrect time calculation because they're lost.

Given that the rubric is specifically "Calculates the time elapsed from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm as 6 hours," let's focus *just* on that part for the percentage estimate.

Considering:
*   Average pass rate is 29% overall for these students. This implies a significant portion struggle with basic academics.
*   The "crossing noon" calculation is trickier than it seems.
*   Limited English makes any word problem more challenging to parse, even if numbers are familiar.
*   Anxiety and lack of exposure to this *specific* time-related question type.

A significant portion of students will either:
1.  Guess or write a random number.
2.  Make an arithmetic error calculating hours (e.g., 10 to 4 = 5 hours or 7 hours).
3.  Be completely confused by the time element ("am" to "evening").
