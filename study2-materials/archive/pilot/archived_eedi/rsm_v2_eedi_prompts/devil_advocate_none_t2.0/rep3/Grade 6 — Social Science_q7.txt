Let's break down the question and the context carefully, keeping the caveats in mind.

**Question:** "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."

**Breakdown of requirements for a correct answer (1 point):**
1.  **Mention two natural resources:** This requires factual recall. Many students, even if present for lessons, might not *remember* two specific ones or confuse them. Common resources like 'water' might come to mind, but identifying a *second specific natural resource found in Rajasthan* could be a hurdle.
2.  **Explain influence of *one*:** This requires a basic understanding of cause and effect and the ability to articulate it in English. Even simple connections like "lack of water means less farming" need to be put into words.

**Considering the student demographic and pitfalls:**

*   **Limited English:**
    *   "Mention" and "explain" are relatively common command words, but constructing a coherent sentence in English for the explanation part will be difficult for many.
    *   Recalling *names* of resources in English could be an issue (e.g., remembering "marble" or "copper" if taught in Hindi).
    *   Even if they know the Hindi terms, translating them correctly on the spot under exam pressure might fail.
*   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic:**
    *   What constitutes a "natural resource" might not be fully internalised by all.
    *   The concept of how a resource "influences" daily life might seem obvious to an adult but could be abstract or difficult to articulate for a struggling learner. Many might state *what* the resource is, but struggle to elaborate on its *influence*.
*   **Exam anxiety:** Can easily cause a student who knows the answer to freeze or fumble their words.
*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** Students might have learned about Rajasthan's resources, but perhaps not specifically *linking two* and then *explaining an influence* in a single question. If they've mostly done multiple-choice or direct recall, synthesis and explanation are harder.
*   **Absent for the topic:** Given attendance rates, a significant portion likely missed parts or all of the lessons on this topic. They will certainly fail.
*   **Syllabus depth:** How deeply are natural resources in Rajasthan taught in Class 6? Is it a key focus or a brief mention? If it's brief, recall will be lower.

**Challenging the initial instinct:**

My first instinct might be: "Most students would know water and something else like marble/sand, and can probably say something simple about water."

**Re-evaluation:**
*   **Two resources:** Getting *two correct* specific ones (beyond generic "land" or "animals" which might not count depending on exact context) is tougher than it seems. "Water" is likely the most common correct answer for one. For the second, some might get marble, sand, or maybe copper/zinc if it's explicitly taught. But many will likely struggle for a *second specific one for Rajasthan*.
*   **Explanation:** This is where many will fail. Even if they know "Rajasthan is dry," articulating "Scarcity of water makes agriculture difficult and daily life revolves around fetching water" in a single English sentence will be a stretch for many, let alone the full detail of influence. They might just say "Water is important." or "Water helps people," which isn't a detailed explanation of influence.
*   **Partial Credit (Implicit):** The rubric is "Max score: 1". This implies an all-or-nothing approach for the full point, making it harder to get full credit. If it's a "mentions two and explains influence for one", then partial responses don't score.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for this demographic on general questions, this question involves recall *and* articulation/explanation. The dual nature of the task makes it significantly harder.

Let's imagine the student population:
*   Those who were absent / paid no attention: 30-40% fail immediately.
*   Those with extremely limited English who cannot formulate sentences: Another 20-30% fail or get 0 because their explanation is too brief/broken.
*   Those who might know one resource, but not two, or can't explain: Another 10-15%.

This quickly brings us down. For the 1 point, both conditions must be met clearly.

I'm pushing away from even 20%. I think the *combination* of needing two correct resources and then an actual *explanation* (not just a mention of importance) for 1 mark is a high bar for a Class 6 student with limited English.
