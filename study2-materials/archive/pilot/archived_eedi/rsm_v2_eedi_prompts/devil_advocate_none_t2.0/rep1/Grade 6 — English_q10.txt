Here's my thinking process to arrive at the estimate:

1.  **Analyze the Question and Rubric:**
    *   **Question:** "Choose the correct word. There are (some/any) apples in the basket."
    *   **Rubric:** Selects 'some'.
    *   **Concept:** Basic English quantifier usage ('some' for affirmative statements, 'any' for questions/negatives). This is fundamental grammar.

2.  **Initial Instinct (and why I challenge it):**
    *   My first thought, as an English speaker/teacher, is "This is incredibly easy. Most students would get this. Maybe 70-80%."
    *   **Challenge 1: Limited English:** "some/any" can be tricky. While taught, the *nuance* between them in different sentence structures (affirmative vs. negative/interrogative) is exactly where low-proficiency learners struggle. They might know "some" and "any" as words, but applying the grammatical rule correctly is a different beast. "Are there *any* apples?" vs. "There are *some* apples." The rule isn't intuitive if you haven't mastered it.
    *   **Challenge 2: "Basic" concepts not basic:** For someone whose primary language isn't English, understanding grammatical rules like this, which differ significantly from Indian languages, requires explicit instruction and practice. If that instruction wasn't thorough or if they didn't internalize it, it's not "basic."
    *   **Challenge 3: Exam anxiety:** A fill-in-the-blank choice format like this can feel high-stakes. If they're unsure, anxiety can lead to a random guess or a blank.
    *   **Challenge 4: Never practiced this exact question type:** Even if they learned "some" and "any," they might not have done *this specific type* of choose-the-word question in an exam context. They might have been asked to *use* 'some' or 'any' in a sentence, which is slightly different.

3.  **Consider the Context (Class 6, Indian Gov't Schools, EWS, 29% average pass rate):**
    *   **Class 6:** Students are typically 10-12 years old. They've had several years of English, but quality of instruction varies widely.
    *   **Indian Gov't Schools, EWS:** Implies less exposure to English outside the classroom, potentially less qualified teachers, larger class sizes, and fewer resources.
    *   **29% average pass rate:** This is the *critical anchor*. If the overall average pass rate is 29% for *all subjects*, then this particular question cannot be wildly different *unless it's an outlier of extreme difficulty or ease*. While this question is *grammatically simple* for a native speaker, it's likely more challenging for the target demographic than my initial instinct suggests. A 29% average indicates significant academic struggle across the board.

4.  **Recalibrating based on challenges and context:**
    *   The rule for 'some' (affirmative) and 'any' (negative/interrogative) is often introduced in Class 4 or 5 and reinforced. However, 'reinforcement' can be weak.
    *   While it's a closed choice question (50/50 chance if guessing), expecting everyone to know the rule is unrealistic given the general academic performance.
    *   Students might pick 'any' because it's a commonly used word in questions and might *sound* plausible without knowing the precise rule. "There are any apples?" -> No, but the ear isn't trained.
    *   Given the 29% average, this question, while fundamental, is *not* easy enough to push the score up into the 70s or 80s for *this specific cohort*.
    *   How many students *consistently* get fundamental grammar correct under pressure, with limited exposure and a weak foundation? Perhaps those who consistently pass or are in the upper quartile of the 29% average.
    *   If 29% is the *average*, and some questions would be harder, then some would be easier. This specific 'some/any' question is likely on the *easier side* of the average.

5.  **Refined Estimate:**
    *   It's better than random guessing (50%), but not by much given the weak foundation.
    *   If the average is 29%, a "relatively easier" question for them might push it into the 40-50% range, but I need to factor in the common errors and anxiety.
    *   Consider
