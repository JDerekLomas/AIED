Let's break this down.

**Initial instinct (the one to challenge):** Many students know "style" and can probably identify some basic descriptors. They might guess words like "good," "nice," or even more appropriate ones like "easy" or "sad." This feels like a 50%+ item.

**Challenging the instinct based on your criteria:**

*   **Limited English:** "Writing style" is a specific academic phrase. While "style" might be somewhat understood, connecting it to "writing" in this context might be difficult for many, especially if their exposure to English is primarily functional. Describing it in *another English word* adds another layer of complexity. They might understand "style" as fashion style.
*   **"Basic" concepts not basic:** What constitutes a "writing style descriptor" isn't a universally obvious concept for someone with limited literary exposure. Many wouldn't have the vocabulary (descriptive, informal, direct, simple). Their frame of reference for describing writing might be limited to how *they felt* reading it ("interesting," "boring").
*   **Exam anxiety:** The open-ended nature of this question can be daunting. Without clear options, anxiety can lead to blank responses or very generic, non-scoring answers.
*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** Identifying a specific *descriptor* for writing style isn't a common drill for students with basic English skills. They might be used to identifying themes or characters, but not literary techniques or style descriptions.
*   **Absence/struggling learners:** If a student missed the lesson on analyzing text or even just the basic vocabulary for literary description, they're lost. And for struggling learners, "writing style" could easily blend into other literary concepts.

**Re-evaluation:**

Even if a student understands the question's core idea (describe how the poet writes), the *constraint* is the most critical factor: "Identifies a suitable and relevant *word* describing the writing style." This isn't asking for an opinion ("I liked it") but an analytical descriptor.

Consider the vocabulary:
*   "Simple" - possible, if they know "simple" and apply it here.
*   "Descriptive" - less likely for a struggling student to possess and correctly apply this word in this context.
*   "Informal" - even less likely.
*   "Direct" - highly unlikely.

Many responses would likely be:
*   Blank
*   Generic: "good," "bad," "nice," "beautiful" (non-scoring)
*   Confused: "sad," "happy" (describing tone/content, not style)
*   Slightly off: "easy to read" (gets close to simple, but may not be recognized as a suitable descriptor by evaluators depending on strictness)

The "average pass rate is about 29%" gives us a good anchor for the *overall* difficulty of assessments for these students. This specific question, while short, demands both comprehension of a somewhat abstract English concept and the recall of a precise English vocabulary word.

I believe this question is tougher than it looks. While "simple" might be known, applying it correctly and getting the point depends on the evaluator's latitude for basic words. Given the severe limitations, a large chunk of students simply won't have the tools.
