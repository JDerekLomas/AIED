Let's break down the thinking process, keeping the challenges in mind:

**Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):**
My first instinct, coming from a Western-educated background, is "Oh, this is a very basic algebra problem. Most students in Class 8 should get this. Maybe 60-70%."

**Challenging the Assumptions (Applying the provided constraints):**

*   **Economically Weaker Sections, Limited English:** This is a *huge* red flag.
    *   **"Find the value of 'y' in the equation..."**: Even this phrasing can be complex. "Value," "equation" are mathematical terms that might not be fully grasped if English proficiency is low. Some students might only recognize numbers and the `+` and `=` signs.
    *   **Lack of direct translation/instruction:** If they're primarily taught in a local language, seeing it only in English for the exam could cause confusion or blank responses, even if they know the math concept.

*   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic for struggling learners:**
    *   **Integer operations:** `4 - 9 = -5` involves understanding negative numbers and subtraction of a larger number from a smaller one. While taught in earlier classes (often Class 6/7), mastery is often not universal. Students who struggle with basic arithmetic often make errors here, for example, saying `9 - 4 = 5` and then getting `y=5`. Or simply struggling with the idea of a negative answer in a context that isn't everyday.
    *   **Algebraic manipulation (transposing):** Moving the `+9` to the other side as `-9`. This is a core concept but can be a rote learning exercise for many, easily forgotten or misapplied under pressure. Some might try to subtract 4 from 9 or simply add 9 to 4.

*   **Exam anxiety causes blank responses:** The student sees English words they're unsure of, a number problem that might involve integers they're not fully comfortable with, and then just freezes. A blank is not an incorrect answer, but it's not correct either.

*   **Many students have never practiced this exact question type:** While they might have done `x + 3 = 7` (leading to a positive answer), they might not have practiced enough examples leading to a *negative* integer. The "newness" of the negative answer might cause doubt, even if their calculation is correct. Some might automatically assume answers *must* be positive.

*   **Average pass rate ~29%:** This is a very strong indicator of overall academic struggling. If only 29% pass *the whole exam*, then even seemingly "easy" items will have a low success rate. An average pass rate that low means most students are performing significantly below grade level expectations.

**Re-calibrating:**

1.  **Lower English proficiency impact:** A significant chunk will simply not fully understand the question, despite recognizing the numbers. Let's say 20-30% might struggle just with the language.
2.  **Integer operation error:** Of those who understand the language, a good portion will struggle with `4 - 9 = -5`. Many will get `y=5` or another incorrect positive answer. Maybe another 20-30% fall here.
3.  **Algebraic concept error/transposition:** Even before integers, some might add 9 to 4 or struggle with the concept of isolating `y`. This overlaps with the above, but adds another layer.
4.  **Anxiety/Blank:** A smaller, but still present, group will just skip it or leave it blank due to general struggle or confusion.
5.  **Competent students:** How many are truly strong in both basic English and basic algebra with negative integers? Given the 29% overall pass rate, this will be a small subset.

Considering all these factors, a typical Class 8 student from an EWS background, with low English proficiency, and attending a government school with an average 29% pass rate, would find this surprisingly challenging.

*   If the overall pass rate is 29%, it means *most* students are struggling. This question is arguably one of the easier *math* questions but the context makes it hard.
*   "Basic" means it was taught, not that it was mastered.

Let's imagine:
*   20% might genuinely not understand "Find the value of y in the equation."
*   Another 30% might understand the objective but make the integer error (`4-9=5`).
*   Another 15% might make other procedural errors or skip it.
*   This leaves about 35% who *might* get it right.
