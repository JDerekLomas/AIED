Let's break this down.

**Initial instinct (the "expert bias"):** Many teachers/experts would think this is a straightforward application of a common formula. "They learned this in Class 6/7," they might say. "It's a direct recall and substitution." My first gut might even be around 50-60%.

**Challenging the instinct based on the given context:**

*   **"Economically weaker sections with limited English."** This is HUGE. The word "base" and "height" might be understood in context if explicitly taught in math class, but the entire sentence structure can be confusing. Even translating "find the area" could be an issue for those struggling with English. They might just pick out the numbers '8' and '6'.
*   **"Average pass rate is about 29%."** This general data point already tells us most students are struggling across the board. A question has to be *very* easy to significantly exceed this.
*   **"Basic concepts aren't basic for struggling learners."** The concept of area, and specifically the area of a triangle, relies on understanding geometry, multiplication, and fractions (the 1/2). Each of these steps can be a hurdle.
*   **"Exam anxiety causes blank responses."** A slightly unfamiliar phrasing or a quick look at the question could lead to a freeze.
*   **"Never practiced this exact question type."** While the formula is common, the precise phrasing or even the diagram (if there was one) might differ from what they've seen. Some schools might emphasize memorizing *how* to solve a specific problem type over understanding the underlying formula.
*   **Absence/Lack of consistent teaching:** In government schools, student and teacher attendance can be erratic, and resources (like consistent textbooks) vary. Many students might genuinely have missed this topic or not had it reinforced adequately.

**Specific Difficulties for *this* question:**

1.  **English Comprehension:** "Find the area of a triangle whose base is... and height is..." is not the simplest sentence for a limited English speaker. They might latch onto "triangle," "base," "height," "8," "6" but miss "area" or "find the."
2.  **Formula Recall:** Remembering `Area = 1/2 × base × height` is a specific memory task. Many students might confuse it with rectangle area (b x h) or even perimeter formulas. The "1/2" is a critical part often forgotten.
3.  **Application:** Even if they recall parts of the formula, substituting correctly and performing the calculation (1/2 * 8 * 6) without errors. Some might multiply 8x6 and forget the 1/2, or vice versa.
4.  **No Visual:** The lack of a diagram makes it slightly harder than if a labeled triangle was provided.

Considering all these factors, this question, while considered "basic" by experts, is actually quite challenging for the target demographic. If a significant proportion could consistently recall and apply this specific formula given the English barrier and general academic struggles, the average pass rate wouldn't be 29%.

It's tempting to think that since it's a common formula, a decent number would get it. However, the constraints (limited English, overall low pass rate, basic concepts not being basic) drastically lower that likelihood. A student who can *just barely read English* will likely struggle with the prompt itself, let alone remembering a specific mathematical formula and performing calculations. Many would just pick up 8 and 6 and try to do something with them (add, multiply, etc.).

**Recalibrating:**
If the average pass rate is 29%, a question that requires multi-step comprehension (reading the English, recalling the specific formula, substituting, calculating) with potential confusion from similar shapes (rectangles) is unlikely to be significantly *above* that average, especially for the "states or uses the correct formula" rubric. It's not a direct observation question.

I think the proportion will be closer to the general average or slightly below it for full credit because of the formula recall specific to triangles and the fraction part. Many might do `8*6 = 48` but miss the 1/2. If the rubric strictly demands `1/2 * b * h`, then even that partial understanding fails.

Therefore, after challenging my assumptions:

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **22%**
