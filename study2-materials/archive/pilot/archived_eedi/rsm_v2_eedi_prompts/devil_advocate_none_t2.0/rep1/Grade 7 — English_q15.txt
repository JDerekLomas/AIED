Here's my calibrated estimate after challenging assumptions:

**Initial Instinct (before challenging):** "This is quite an open-ended, personal question. Even with limited English, students can use simple words. Most would manage to write a few sentences, perhaps even get full marks for just putting something down that vaguely fits." My initial gut might have been 40-50%.

**Challenging Assumptions:**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "My Favourite Hobby" might be too advanced a phrase for many to immediately grasp or remember how to write correctly. "Favorite" is also the American spelling; Indian English often uses "Favourite." This might cause confusion or spelling errors.
    *   *Writing* 4-5 *sentences* is a significant step beyond simply answering short questions. They might struggle with sentence structure, tenses, or connecting ideas into a cohesive "paragraph."
    *   Many will resort to rote-learned sentences if they exist, or extremely simple, disjointed phrases.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts aren't Basic:**
    *   The concept of a "hobby" itself might not be deeply understood by all students in this demographic. Some might struggle to identify something specific and label it a hobby. It might just be "what I do after school."
    *   Formulating a *reason* why they enjoy it requires reflective thought and a vocabulary for expressing feelings, which many might lack in English. Simply "I like it" might be the extent.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:**
    *   An open-ended writing task can be extremely daunting for struggling learners. Many might stare at it blankly, afraid to start, or simply write 1-2 fragmented sentences due to time pressure and fear of making mistakes.
    *   Even if they *know* their hobby, translating it into *written English* within the given structure (4-5 sentences, paragraph form) will be a major hurdle.

4.  **Lack of Practice with Exact Question Type:**
    *   They might practice simple sentence formation or answering questions like "What is your hobby?" but composing a coherent *paragraph* with specific inclusions ("when," "why") might be less frequently practiced for struggling learners. The structure requirement ("paragraph") itself is a skill.
    *   Often, their practice involves copying, filling in blanks, or short answers, not original composition.

5.  **Focus on Rubric:** The rubric requires a "complete paragraph" that *clearly mentions* all three elements. This is key. Even if they write 3-4 sentences, if it's not a paragraph (i.e., disjointed) or if one element is missing/unclear, they wouldn't get the score.

**Recalibrated Thought Process:**

*   Many students might be able to write "My hobby is cricket." and "I play everyday."
*   Fewer will manage "I like it because..." or "I enjoy it because..."
*   Even fewer will stitch these into 4-5 *connected* sentences in paragraph form.
*   Spelling and grammatical errors are almost guaranteed, but the rubric doesn't mention them directly, focusing on completeness and clarity. However, egregious errors can obscure clarity.
*   The "average pass rate about 29%" suggests that *most* students are struggling even with more structured, perhaps multiple-choice or simpler fill-in-the-blanks. This is a higher-order thinking and writing task.

Considering all these factors, I believe a significant number will fail to meet all criteria of the rubric, particularly the "complete paragraph" and "clearly mentions" aspects for all three points. They might manage one or two criteria, or write very fragmented sentences that don't constitute a paragraph.
