Let's break this down from the perspective of a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the factors you've highlighted.

**Analysis of Potential Difficulties:**

1.  **English Comprehension:**
    *   "`10` am in the morning, the temperature of Jodhpur was `30^0 C`": This initial setup is relatively straightforward numerically. "temperature of Jodhpur" is likely familiar from local news/general knowledge.
    *   "If the temperature increases by `2^0 C` per hour": "increases by" is key. "per hour" is critical for multiplication.
    *   "then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?": This requires connecting the time frame.
    *   **Concern:** Students with limited English might struggle with "increases by," "per hour," and discerning "am" vs. "evening" as time indicators. They might misinterpret "per hour" as adding 2 once, or adding 2 *to* 4 pm, or getting confused by the C units.

2.  **Mathematical Concepts:**
    *   **Time Calculation (Rubric's focus):**
        *   `10` am to `12` pm: `2` hours.
        *   `12` pm to `4` pm: `4` hours.
        *   Total: `2 + 4 = 6` hours.
        *   **Concern:** This is often a significant hurdle for students. The transition from AM to PM, crossing noon, is a common error point. Many will calculate `4 - 10 = -6` (which they'll likely ignore the negative and say 6, but it shows a lack of understanding), or `14 - 10 = 4` (if they convert 4 pm to 24-hour clock correctly but then make a subtraction error), or `10 to 4` by counting fingers, which is prone to off-by-one errors (e.g., counting 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 = 7 hours). Simply converting 4 pm to 16:00 and then doing 16 - 10 = 6 hours is the most reliable way, but that conversion itself can be an issue.
    *   **Multiplication:** Once the time elapsed (6 hours) is found, multiplying `6 * 2^0 C` (`12^0 C`).
    *   **Addition:** Adding `30^0 C + 12^0 C` (`42^0 C`).
    *   **Concern:** While `6 x 2` and `30 + 12` are arithmetically simple, reaching these steps accurately depends heavily on the time calculation.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Question Type Novelty:**
    *   Even if they understand the concepts individually, stringing them together in a word problem of this nature, with time and temperature units, can be overwhelming.
    *   "Never practiced this exact question type" is very important. Many practice isolated skills but not complex multi-step problems that cross different mathematical domains (time, arithmetic).

4.  **Absence for topic:** Time calculation methods vary greatly, and if a student missed the specific lesson on calculating elapsed time across AM/PM, they will struggle significantly.

**Re-calibrating First Instinct:**

My *initial* instinct, looking purely at the arithmetic, might be "this isn't too hard." However, when applying the specific filters:

*   **Limited English:** "increases by," "per hour," and even separating "am" from "evening" in the context of calculations, can trip them up.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** Calculating elapsed time from AM to PM *across noon* is a classic "gotcha" point for weaker learners. Many will simply do 4-10 or 10-4 or get one hour off.
*   **Anxiety/Novelty:** A multi-step word problem combining time and rate is advanced for a Class 6 student who hasn't practiced similar ones extensively.

**The rubric only asks for calculating time elapsed correctly (6 hours).** This significantly narrows the focus and removes the subsequent arithmetic steps (multiplication and final addition) as failure points for *this specific rubric item*. However, if they fail to calculate 6 hours correctly, they automatically fail this rubric item.

Given the difficulty of AM/PM time calculations for struggling students, and the English comprehension needed to even understand that time calculation is required in the first place, I expect this to be a major hurdle. Even if a student generally gets other simple math,
