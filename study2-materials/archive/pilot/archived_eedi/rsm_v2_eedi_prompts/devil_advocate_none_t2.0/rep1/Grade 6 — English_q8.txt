I will use the framework provided to calibrate my estimate.

**Initial Instinct (before calibration):** Many students, even struggling ones, will recognize these common words. The sentence structure (subject-verb-object) is fundamental. I'd initially guess around 60-70%.

**Challenging Assumptions / Applying the Expert Feedback:**

1.  **Limited English:** While these words are common, constructing a *grammatically correct* sentence might be challenging. "He is reading a book" is simple, but "Is he reading a book?" or even "Reading he is a book" are plausible incorrect arrangements for someone with weak English. "Reading" might be mistaken as the subject.
2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** Sentence formation, even simple SVO, relies on understanding word classes (pronoun, verb, article, noun). For struggling learners, these implicit rules are not basic. They might arrange words based on recognition rather than grammatical function.
3.  **Exam Anxiety:** Anxiety can definitely lead to students getting jumbled on even simple tasks. A student might *know* it but panic and produce "a book reading he is."
4.  **Never Practiced this Exact Question Type:** This is a crucial point. If they haven't explicitly practiced rearranging jumbled words into *meaningful* sentences, especially without explicit instruction on SVO, they might struggle to find the one *meaningful* arrangement out of several possibilities that just 'sound okay' to them.

**Re-evaluation considering the above:**

*   **Words are simple:** Yes, this is an advantage.
*   **Concept is simple *for a fluent speaker*:** This is where the gap is. For someone barely reading English, identifying "he" as the subject, "is reading" as the verb phrase, and "a book" as the object is not necessarily intuitive. They might see "reading" and try to put it at the beginning.
*   **The specific error to watch for:** Many might struggle with word order. While "He is reading a book" is the only truly "meaningful" one, for someone whose English exposure is minimal, other arrangements might seem plausible enough (e.g., "Reading he is a book" or "A book he is reading").
*   **Comparison to 29% average pass rate:** This question is likely on the *easier* end of what would typically be found on a full test, as it uses very basic vocabulary and a fundamental grammar structure. However, the caveat about misjudging difficulty for struggling learners is paramount.

If only 29% pass *average* tests, a question like this, while seemingly easy, would need a significantly higher correct rate than 29% to balance out harder questions. However, the risk of misjudgment here is still very high. Students often fail on seemingly simple "sentence formation" because of the cognitive load for non-native speakers. They have to identify the words, understand their meaning, then understand their function, then string them together in a specific, grammatically correct order, all while navigating unfamiliarity with the *task type* itself.

Given the strong emphasis on *misjudging* and *challenging first instinct*, especially regarding limited English and non-basic concepts for struggling learners, I need to significantly reduce my initial estimate. The average pass rate of 29% strongly suggests that even fundamental English questions pose a significant hurdle. While this is likely above average difficulty, "most students could do this" (my initial thought) is exactly the type of overestimation warned against.

I think the key point here is "meaningful sentence." Many might produce something that is a string of words, but not a *meaningful* sentence as a native speaker would understand it.

Considering all these factors, particularly the warning about overestimation and the fact that basic concepts are not basic for struggling learners, even this simple question will catch a lot of students.

I will calibrate my estimate to be higher than the 29% average but significantly lower than a fluent speaker's intuition. I will focus on the fact that identifying the *correct* grammatical structure will be hard for students who haven't explicitly practiced it or lack foundational understanding.

My calibrated estimate takes into account the simplicity of words vs. the complexity of the grammatical task for struggling learners.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **45%**
