Let's break down the thinking process, keeping the given cautions in mind:

**Initial Instinct:** My first thought, based on general knowledge and experience with this age group in other contexts, might be "fable is a fairly common word, they should know it." Perhaps 30-40%.

**Challenging the Instinct (Applying the Cautions):**

*   **Limited English:** This is HUGE. "Define" itself might be challenging for many. "Fable" is an English word. While the concept might exist in local languages, the *word* "fable" and its precise English definition might not be universal knowledge, especially for students with a pass rate of only 29%.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** Is "fable" a consistently taught, emphasized, and frequently tested concept for Class 8 in Indian government schools, especially considering the curriculum breadth and other challenges? While literature exists, the formal *definition* might not be deeply embedded. Many might have heard stories *that are fables*, but not the word itself or its formal components.
*   **Never Practiced this Exact Question Type (Definition):** While they might write essays or short answers, a direct "define X" question, especially for a literary term, might be less common than, say, answering questions about a specific story.
*   **Components of the Rubric:**
    *   "Short story": Okay, many might get this part.
    *   "Typically uses animals as characters": This is a key distinguishing feature. Some might mention it, some might forget. They might recall *Aesop's Fables* and intuitively get it, but articulating it is harder.
    *   "Imparts a moral lesson": This is the *most crucial* part of a fable's definition. This requires understanding the purpose beyond just characters and plot. This is where many might struggle, especially those who struggle with inferring purpose or deeper meaning in texts.

**Refinement based on the Challenge:**

*   A student who barely reads English might struggle with the question "Define fable" itself.
*   They might recall specific fable stories (like the thirsty crow, the fox and grapes) but struggle to generalize the definition.
*   The "moral lesson" aspect is often abstract.
*   The average pass rate of 29% for general subjects suggests a very significant proportion of students are struggling with core curriculum. Literary terms and precise definitions often fall into areas mastered by stronger students.
*   Many might confuse "fable" with "story," "folk tale," or "legend." They might give an example rather than a definition.

Considering all these factors, my initial instinct of 30-40% feels *too high*. Only a fraction of the *already struggling* student population will have the vocabulary, conceptual clarity, and ability to articulate *all three* key components of the rubric in English.

*   Maybe 5% get all three perfectly.
*   Another 5-7% might get two out of three (e.g., animals + story, but miss moral, or moral + story but miss animals). While that wouldn't get a perfect score by the rubric, it shows some understanding. However, the prompt asks for *correctly answering by the rubric*.

Therefore, a very low percentage is more realistic for the full, rubric-aligned correct answer.

**Calibrated Estimate:** 10%

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 10%
