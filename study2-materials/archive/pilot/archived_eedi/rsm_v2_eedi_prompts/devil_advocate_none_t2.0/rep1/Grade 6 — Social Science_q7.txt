ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **15%**

Here's my reasoning after challenging assumptions:

1.  **Limited English Comprehension:** The question uses "mention," "explain," and "influences." While "mention" might be graspable, "explain" and "influences" require a slightly deeper understanding of English vocabulary and syntax to correctly interpret the task. Many students might pick up on keywords like "natural resources" and "Rajasthan" but struggle with the "how it influences lives" part.

2.  **Recall vs. Application/Explanation:** Simply listing two resources (e.g., "water, marble") is easier. However, the second part demands an *explanation* of influence. This requires connecting a resource to a socio-economic impact. For example, knowing "water" is a resource is one thing; explaining how its scarcity impacts farming, daily life, or migration is a higher-order thinking skill, especially in a second language and under pressure.

3.  **Basic Concepts - Not Always Basic:** While "natural resources" might be a topic covered, the specific examples and the concept of *influence* might not be deeply embedded or explicitly practiced in a way that poor English learners can reproduce. Teachers often assume that once a concept is taught, it's understood and applicable.

4.  **Specific Rajasthan Knowledge:** Students need to specifically recall natural resources *from Rajasthan*. While common ones like "water" are universally known, more specific geological resources like "Marble," "Copper," or "Gypsum" might be less salient, especially if the topic wasn't recently or thoroughly covered. Solar/wind energy as natural resources for Rajasthan is a good answer, but might require a more abstract understanding.

5.  **Anxiety and Question Type:** This is not a simple recall question (e.g., "What is water?"). It's a two-part question with an explanation requirement. Many students, when faced with such a multi-faceted question in an exam, might either answer only the first part (listing) or simply leave the explanation blank if unsure, losing the entire mark. They may have never practiced explaining *influence* in a written English format.

6.  **"One Mark" Rubric:** While only "Max score: 1" suggests partial credit isn't built into the rubric for separating correct resource mention from correct explanation, the problem states "Mentions two correct natural resources... explain how one of them influences the lives..." which indicates *both* components are implicitly required to get that 1 mark fully. If a student only lists resources, they are unlikely to get the mark according to the implicit requirement.

**Why 15% and not higher/lower?**

*   **Higher than 0%:** Some students will likely have grasped the concepts and the English. Rajasthan is a prominent state, so some basic knowledge of its resources (especially water scarcity, sand, or marble) is not completely unheard of. A few high-performing students or those who happened to review this specific topic will get it right.
*   **Lower than 29% (average pass rate):** This question is harder than average. The "explain how one influences" part significantly ups the difficulty, especially for students struggling with English and higher-order thinking skills. Many will correctly list two resources but fail the explanation part, or fail to understand the prompt entirely. This type of question often causes more "blank" or incomplete responses than simple recall questions.

Given the layers of difficulty (English comprehension, specific knowledge recall, explanatory writing, and the "influence" concept), a substantial drop from the average pass rate is warranted. 15% reflects that only a small fraction of the class would confidently and correctly tackle both parts of this question to secure the full mark.
