Let's break down the question and rubric against the student profile:

**Student Profile:**
*   Class 6 students in Indian government schools.
*   Mostly from economically weaker sections.
*   **Limited English.** (This is key)
*   Average pass rate for tests is 29%.
*   Teachers consistently *overestimate* student performance.

**Question:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"

**Rubric (for Max score 1.5):** "Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why."

**Analysis (challenging first instincts):**

1.  **"Which line from the poem..."**:
    *   **Access to poem:** This question assumes they *have* a poem to reference. If it's a standalone question or part of a larger assessment where they've just read a poem, that's one thing. But even then, they need to comprehend the poem.
    *   **Understanding "line":** Do they understand "line" in the poetic sense? (Not just a drawn line).
    *   **Identifying and extracting:** Can they identify a specific line and write it down or quote it accurately? This requires attention to detail and ability to copy English text.
    *   **Limited English impact:** Students with limited English might struggle to understand the poem itself, let alone pick out a "favorite" line if the lines' meanings are hazy. They might just pick the first or last line, or a random one.

2.  **"...do you like the most..."**:
    *   **Comprehension of "like" and "most":** These are basic English words, but in the context of personal preference about poetry, it adds a layer.
    *   **Personal Opinion:** Are they comfortable expressing a personal opinion in written English? This is a more subjective task than simply answering factual recall. Some may find it easier to provide a factual answer.

3.  **"...and why?"**:
    *   **Reasoning and articulation:** This is the biggest hurdle. Even if they can pick a line, explaining *why* they like it requires:
        *   Understanding their own reason for liking it.
        *   Translating that reason from their mother tongue into appropriate, coherent English.
        *   Using connecting words (e.g., "because," "as it shows," "it makes me feel").
    *   **Limited English impact:** This is where limited English severely cripples performance. They might have a "why" in their head, but struggle immensely to phrase it in English that meets the rubric's "mentions why" standard beyond a single, possibly inadequate word.
    *   **Exam anxiety:** The pressure of formulating a grammatically correct sentence with reasoning could lead to blank responses, especially if they are insecure about their English writing.
    *   **Never practiced:** They might not have practiced expressing personal opinions about literature in this specific format or level of detail. "Why do you like this line?" isn't a simple factual question.

**Re-evaluating based on constraints:**

*   **Average pass rate 29%:** This is a strong indicator of overall difficulty. A question that requires subjective reasoning and basic English sentence construction beyond simple fill-in-the-blanks or multiple choice will likely be harder than the average pass rate, unless "pass rate" means *any* point score.
*   **Teachers overestimate:** My initial instinct might be, "Oh, they just need to pick a line and give a simple reason, like 'I like this line because it is beautiful.'" But then I remember "limited English." "Beautiful" might be accessible, but linking it cohesively could be tough.
*   **"Basic concepts aren't basic":** Explaining *why* for many children in this demographic is an advanced language skill, even if the "concept" of liking something isn't complex.
*   **"Exam anxiety causes blank responses":** The "and why" part is particularly prone to this. Students might write the line and then stop, unable to formulate a reason.
*   **"Never practiced this exact question type":** Writing subjective reasons in English might be unfamiliar.

Considering all these factors, particularly the severe limitation in English writing skills for *explanation*, the number of students who can successfully "denote a line from the poem AND mention why" coherently enough to get even partial credit will be quite low. Many might get the line but fail on the "why," or provide a one-word answer for "why" that isn't sufficiently clear. The rubric states "mentions why," implying *some* understandable reason, not just "good."

I would estimate it significantly below the average pass rate for general questions, as this specific question component (the "why") is more demanding.
