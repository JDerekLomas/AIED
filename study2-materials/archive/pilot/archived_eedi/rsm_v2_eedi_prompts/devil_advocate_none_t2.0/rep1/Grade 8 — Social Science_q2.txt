Let's break this down with the given caveats in mind.

1.  **Limited English:** The question itself uses "describe," "key feature," and "urban planning." "Urban planning" is a somewhat academic term. Students who barely read English might struggle with the combined meaning of these words. They might pick up "Harappan" and look for something related to the Harappans, but "urban planning" specifically narrows it down.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While the Harappan civilization is a staple of Indian history curricula, the *specific* focus on "urban planning" features might not be consistently reinforced as a separate, distinct topic in the minds of struggling students. They might recall facts about Harappans (like seals, dancing girl), but not necessarily categorize them under "urban planning" effectively. Concepts like "grid layout" or "citadel" can be complex for those unfamiliar with urban design terminology.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** When confronted with slightly unfamiliar phrasing or a concept they haven't explicitly memorized in this format, many struggling students will draw a blank rather than attempt to infer.

4.  **No Practice with Exact Question Type:** While they might have studied Harappan civilization, explicitly *describing a key feature of urban planning* might not be a question type they've practiced often, leading to difficulty structuring an answer even if they possess some relevant knowledge.

**Common Mistakes/Challenges:**

*   Confusing "urban planning" with general Harappan characteristics (e.g., "they used seals," "they traded with Mesopotamia").
*   Using imprecise language even if they know some details (e.g., "their houses were good" instead of "used baked bricks and had good drainage").
*   Struggling to translate what they *know* into a clear, concise *description* that fits the rubric's expectations (e.g., knowing about drainage but not framing it as an "advanced drainage system").
*   Misunderstanding "key feature" – focusing on a minor detail or a general characteristic not specific to *urban planning*.

**Considering the Pass Rate (29%):** If the average pass rate for *all* questions is 29%, a specific, slightly more nuanced question like this might actually perform *lower* than the average, or at best, around it. The subject matter itself (Harappan civilization) is usually covered, but the specificity of the question is the hurdle.

**Initial Instinct vs. Calibrated Estimate:** My initial instinct might be "Most students would know about the drains or grid." But then I re-read the caveats. "Limited English," "struggling learners," "no practice." A student who barely reads English would find "describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning" quite dense. Even if they knew about "drains," expressing it as an "advanced drainage system" requires a certain level of vocabulary and conceptual understanding.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

I expect that perhaps a quarter to a third of students might successfully identify one of the specific features with enough clarity to satisfy the rubric. The key word "urban planning" is the filter here. Many might give general facts about the Harappans that don't directly address planning.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 22%**
