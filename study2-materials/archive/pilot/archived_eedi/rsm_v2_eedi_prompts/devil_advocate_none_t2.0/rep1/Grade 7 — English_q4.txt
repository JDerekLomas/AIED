This question requires students to understand the premise of the story (the king's three questions), relate them to the concept of "real life," and then articulate a "valid reason" in English.

Here's why I think the actual correct response rate will be low, despite the apparent simplicity:

*   **"Importance" is Abstract:** For struggling learners, "importance" can be an abstract concept, especially when applied to a fictional king's philosophical questions. They might understand the *king wanted* answers but struggle to connect it to *their own* "real life" or explain *why* it's important.
*   **Connecting to Real Life:** Many students will likely recall the questions themselves but fail to make the explicit connection to "real life." They might describe what the king *did* rather than *why* his questions matter generally.
*   **"Valid Reason" - Articulation:** Even if a student intuitively feels the questions are important, articulating a *clear, concise, and valid reason* in English under exam conditions is challenging. Many might give vague answers or just restate the questions.
    *   Examples of struggling answers: "Yes, it is important because he wanted to know everything." (Not really a reason). "Yes, for his kingdom." (Better, but might not be considered a *reason why the questions themselves* are important in *real life*).
*   **English Language Barrier:** "Do you think... important in real life? Give one reason." This structure requires not just understanding the words, but also the argumentative/justificatory function of the request.
*   **Exam Anxiety/Novelty:** Even if they've discussed the story, this *exact* framing ("Do *you* think... in real life?") might be new.
*   **Passage Dependency (Subtle):** While the answer isn't *in* the passage directly, a student who struggles to comprehend the passage's main points (i.e., *what* the king wanted) will struggle here.

My first instinct *would* be higher, thinking "of course, everyone knows those questions are important." However, considering the context of Class 7 Indian government school students from EWS backgrounds, with limited English and an average pass rate of 29% for the *entire* paper:

*   Many will simply answer "Yes" and fail to provide a reason.
*   Many will provide a reason that is too vague, simply re-states the questions, or focuses on the king's actions rather than the questions' universal relevance.
*   The "valid reason" bar, even if lenient, is still a cognitive step.

**Revised thought process:** This question requires a higher level of analytical and expressive capability than many basic recall questions. A student needs to grasp the core of the story, generalize its meaning to a personal/real-world context, and then articulate that understanding. Given the extremely low average pass rate and the specified limitations, only a fraction will be able to perform this specific cognitive and linguistic task correctly according to the rubric.
