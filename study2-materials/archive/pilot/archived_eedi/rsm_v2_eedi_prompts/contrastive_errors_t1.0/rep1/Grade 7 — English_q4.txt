Let's break down the question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason." using the provided context and error analysis.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Passage Comprehension:** Students need to have understood the story (presumably "The Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy, or a similar narrative where a king seeks answers to fundamental life questions). They need to recall what the king's questions *were* (the right time, the right people, the right thing to do).
    *   **General World Knowledge:** The concept of "real life" and the importance of making good decisions, acting at the right time, and choosing the right companions or advisors. This is generally within the scope of a Class 7 student's understanding.
    *   **Moral/Ethical Understanding:** The ability to connect abstract philosophical questions to practical implications.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Do you think": Relatively common and basic.
        *   "king's questions": Straightforward if they understood the passage.
        *   "important": High-frequency word.
        *   "real life": Common phrase.
        *   "Give one reason": Clear instruction, "reason" is a common demand in English exams.
    *   **Sentence Structure:**
        *   The question itself is a simple "yes/no" followed by a "wh-word" command.
        *   The expected answer requires a simple declarative sentence for the "yes/no" part and then another simple sentence or phrase for the "reason."
    *   **Cognitive Load:**
        *   This isn't a complex grammar task or a creative writing prompt. It's a direct opinion question with a justification.
    *   **Comparison to Common Errors:**
        *   The common errors (e.g., "Describes the poet's writing style" leading to "I am reading") suggest a profound lack of comprehension for abstract or literary analysis questions.
        *   "Write a theme or central idea..." also shows difficulty with abstract concepts and summarizing.
        *   "My Favourite Hobby" errors are mostly about poor sentence structure, lack of detail, or not adhering to length requirements.
        *   This *current* question is less abstract than "writing style" or "theme." It asks for a personal opinion ("Do *you* think...") and a direct justification.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Students need to recall the king's questions from the passage.
    *   **Reasoning/Application:** The core of the question is reasoning. They need to *apply* the king's questions to the concept of "real life" and explain *why* they are important. It's not just recalling facts; it's making a judgment and providing support for it.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   Many textbook exercises for comprehension ask for opinions or personal connections after reading a story. This is a fairly standard post-reading question type.
    *   It's less demanding than synthesizing a theme or analyzing a writing style.
    *   It's more demanding than simple factual recall (e.g., "Who was the king?").
    *   The "Give one reason" part is key. Many students might be able to say "yes" but struggle to articulate a coherent reason in English. However, even a simple, slightly broken English reason (e.g., "Because good time is important") might be acceptable given the low bar implied by the other common errors.

**Factors making it easier:**
*   Personal opinion (less pressure to be "right" in a factual sense).
*   High-frequency vocabulary.
*   Direct question structure.
*   The "importance" of the questions is a relatively straightforward concept to grasp intuitively.

**Factors making it harder:**
*   Requires comprehension of the original passage.
*   Requires articulating a *reason* in English, which can be challenging for students with limited proficiency, even if the thought is clear in their minds.
*   It's not just a "yes/no" but demands a follow-up.

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

Given the common errors observed (especially the high number of "Empty Response" and deep misunderstandings of questions asking for abstract concepts or detailed writing), and the average pass rate of 29% across items:

While the vocabulary is simpler than the "writing style" or "theme" questions, the demand for *reasoning* and expressing it in English is still a hurdle. Many might understand the story and even feel the questions are
