Let's break down the question and estimate the proportion correct.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior knowledge assumed:**
    *   **Geometric shapes:** Students need to know what a triangle is and recognize its base and height. This is fundamental and usually covered well before Class 7.
    *   **Area concept:** Understanding what "area" means (the space enclosed by a 2D shape). Again, this is foundational and typically introduced in earlier grades with simpler shapes like rectangles and squares.
    *   **Formula for area of a triangle:** `Area = 1/2 × base × height`. This is the core piece of knowledge directly relevant to Class 7 curriculum. It's a standard formula students are expected to learn and apply.
    *   **Basic multiplication:** `1/2 * 8 * 6`. This involves multiplication of integers and fractions, which should be well within Class 7 math skills.
    *   **Units:** Understanding that area is measured in square units (cm²). While not explicitly asked for in the "rubric" for *scoring*, it's part of a complete understanding.

*   **Language demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **"Find"**: Very common verb in math, usually understood.
    *   **"Area"**: This is a key mathematical term. While potentially challenging for very low English proficiency, it's so central to geometry that it's often taught in bilingual contexts or its meaning is reinforced through examples.
    *   **"Triangle"**: A basic geometric term, visually reinforced.
    *   **"Whose"**: Relatively simple linking word.
    *   **"Base"**: Key mathematical term, often taught with visual aids.
    *   **"Height"**: Key mathematical term, often taught with visual aids.
    *   **"cm"**: Standard abbreviation for centimeter.
    *   **Overall:** The language is quite straightforward and uses standard mathematical vocabulary. There are no complex sentence structures or abstract concepts reliant on nuanced English. For students attending Hindi-medium schools, these terms would likely be introduced and reinforced in Hindi (आधार, ऊँचाई, क्षेत्रफल, त्रिभुज), making the English relatively transparent if they've been taught the concepts.

*   **Recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily an **application** problem. Students need to **recall** the formula and then **apply** it to given values.
    *   It requires minimal **reasoning** beyond identifying the correct formula and plugging in the numbers. There's no complex problem-solving or multi-step analysis involved.

*   **Difficulty compared to typical textbook exercises:**
    *   This is a **very basic, direct application** problem. It's the kind of question often found as the *first* or *second* example after a new formula is introduced in a textbook.
    *   Typical textbook exercises might involve:
        *   Finding missing base/height when area is given.
        *   Problems involving composite shapes where a triangle is part of it.
        *   Word problems that require identifying base and height from a diagram or description.
    *   This question is simpler than most of those variations.

**Factors making it easier:**

*   **Direct application:** No need to derive anything or solve for a missing variable other than the area itself.
*   **Simple numbers:** `8` and `6` are easy to work with. `1/2` also simplifies nicely with `8`.
*   **Clear identification:** Base and height are explicitly given, not hidden within a diagram or a more complex word problem.
*   **Core curriculum:** The area of a triangle is a fundamental topic in Class 7 geometry.
*   **Language is standard mathematical English:** Key terms are almost cognates in concept if not sound, and are reinforced in Hindi.

**Factors making it harder (relative to this specific question):**

*   **Limited English proficiency:** While the language is simple, *any* English poses a barrier for some.
*   **Recall of formula:** If a student hasn't learned or forgotten the formula, they cannot answer correctly.
*   **Conceptual misunderstanding:** A student might confuse the area of a triangle with that of a rectangle, or use perimeter instead of area.
*   **Arithmetic errors:** Minor errors in multiplication.

**Considering the context:**

*   "Mostly from economically weaker sections": This often correlates with less access to supplementary learning materials, private tutoring, and potentially less exposure to English outside school.
*   "Hindi-medium schools": Reinforces the English language barrier.
*   "Average pass rate across items on this exam is about 29%": This is a very important baseline. It suggests that the *overall* difficulty of the
