Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimate:

## Contrastive Analysis of the Question:

**Question:** A gardener has collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit. Does gardener notice any change after some days? Give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health.

**What makes this SPECIFIC question easy or hard compared to similar Science content at the Class 8 level:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Ease:** Basic understanding that organic matter decomposes. This is a common observation in everyday life, even without formal scientific terms. They might have seen food rot or leaves decay.
    *   **Difficulty:** Understanding the *mechanism* of decomposition (microorganisms) and its specific benefits for soil (nutrients, humus, water retention). While "compost" might be mentioned in textbooks, the depth of understanding needed for "reasons" and "evaluate" goes beyond simple recall of the term.
    *   **Connection to other common errors:** The "manure" question (6% pass rate) suggests that even basic understanding of organic matter and its use is very low. This question is similar in concept but broader.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Ease:** The vocabulary ("gardener," "waste," "plants," "vegetables," "fruits," "pit," "change," "some days," "beneficial," "soil health") is relatively common. "Decomposition" isn't explicitly required, but describing the process would be hard without it.
    *   **Difficulty:** "Evaluate" and "Give reasons" require more sophisticated English than simply identifying something. Students need to articulate cause and effect. The common errors show a severe struggle with expressing even basic thoughts in English, often resorting to phonetic spellings or non-sensical phrases. The examples provided (e.g., "gobaer," "letrad") indicate very weak written English skills.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Simply stating "yes, it will change" is recall of a general principle.
    *   **Application:** Identifying *what kind* of change (decay, smell, reduction in volume) is application of observation.
    *   **Reasoning:** Explaining *why* it changes (decomposition by microorganisms) and *how* it's beneficial for soil health (adding nutrients, improving texture) requires reasoning and synthesis of knowledge. The rubric's focus on "significant changes," "reasons," and "beneficial for soil health" pushes it heavily into reasoning.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   Typical textbook exercises at this level might ask: "What is compost?" or "List two benefits of manure." This question is more open-ended and demands a deeper explanation and evaluation. It's less about defining terms and more about explaining a process and its implications.
    *   The "manure" question (6% pass rate) directly relates to this concept. The extremely low pass rate there suggests that even a simpler question about organic soil additives is beyond most students' current grasp. This question builds on that, asking for *reasons* and *evaluation*.

**Conclusion from Analysis:**

This question is significantly harder than it might appear at first glance. While the initial observation of "change" might be accessible, the "reasons" and "evaluate if beneficial for soil health" components demand scientific understanding of decomposition and its ecological role, which is likely weak. The extremely low pass rates on similar, even simpler science questions (6-11%) highlight a pervasive lack of content knowledge and, critically, the inability to articulate scientific concepts in English. The common errors indicate a struggle with basic vocabulary, grammar, and even forming coherent sentences, making it very difficult to score on a question that requires reasoned explanation. The rubric requires "significant changes" and implies a correct understanding of *why* it's beneficial.

Given the common errors provided, particularly the "Empty Response" and the struggle with even basic words like "manure" ("gobaer"), providing a coherent, reasoned explanation about decomposition and its benefits in English will be a significant hurdle for the vast majority.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:** 8%

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

*   **Low Baseline:** The average pass rate is 29%, but for science questions that require more than simple recall, it drops significantly (6-11% for the examples). This question falls into the latter category.
*   **High Language Barrier:** The need to "give reasons" and "evaluate" in English will be a major obstacle, as evidenced by the common errors.
*   **Conceptual Depth:** While basic observation of decay is common, explaining *why* it happens and its specific *benefits* to soil health (beyond "it'
