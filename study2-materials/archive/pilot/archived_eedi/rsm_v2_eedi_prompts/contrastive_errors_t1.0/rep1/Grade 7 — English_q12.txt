Let's break down the question "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away" using the provided context and error analysis.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Grammatical Concepts:** A fundamental understanding of "voice" (active vs. passive), subject, verb, and object. Students need to know that in passive voice, the object of the active sentence becomes the subject, the verb changes to a "to be" verb + past participle, and the original subject becomes an optional "by" phrase.
    *   **Verb Conjugation:** Specifically, knowing the past participle of irregular verbs. Here, "blew" (simple past) needs to become "blown" (past participle). This is a common hurdle for ESL learners.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Ability to identify the subject ("the wind"), verb ("blew"), and object ("the leaves").

2.  **Language Demands for Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** The vocabulary in the sentence "The wind blew the leaves away" is relatively simple and common. "Wind," "blew," "leaves," "away" are likely familiar words. This is a strength compared to questions with abstract or less common vocabulary.
    *   **Grammar Terminology:** The instructions "Change... from Active Voice to Passive Voice" require understanding these grammatical terms. This can be a significant barrier. If a student doesn't understand what "active voice" or "passive voice" means, they won't even know what to attempt, regardless of their grasp of the sentence's meaning.
    *   **Syntactic Transformation:** The core task involves restructuring a sentence, which is a complex grammatical operation. It's not just about understanding words, but manipulating their order and form.
    *   **Irregular Verb Forms:** As mentioned, changing "blew" to "blown" is a specific challenge. Many students might default to adding "-ed" or struggle with common irregular verbs.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Application:** This is primarily an application question. Students are applying a grammatical rule (active-to-passive transformation) to a given sentence.
    *   **Recall (of rules):** They need to recall the rules for forming passive voice.
    *   **Recall (of verb forms):** They need to recall the past participle of "blow."
    *   It requires less abstract reasoning than analyzing a poem's theme or describing a writing style.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Common Exercise Type:** Changing voice is a very common grammar exercise in English language textbooks, especially at the Class 7 level in India. Students would have encountered this numerous times.
    *   **Sentence Simplicity:** The given sentence is simple, direct, and doesn't contain multiple clauses, complex tenses, or unusual structures. This makes it a standard example for such an exercise.
    *   **Specific Challenges:**
        *   **Irregular Verb:** While a standard exercise, the irregular verb "blow/blew/blown" adds a layer of difficulty compared to sentences with regular verbs (e.g., "The boy kicked the ball" -> "The ball was kicked by the boy").
        *   **"Away":** The adverb "away" might slightly complicate the phrasing for some, although it generally integrates smoothly into the passive structure.
        *   **Grammar Terminology Barrier:** The biggest hurdle is likely understanding the terms "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice." If these terms are not well-understood, the task is impossible. The low pass rates on "Describes the poet's writing style" and "Write a theme..." suggest a significant struggle with meta-linguistic tasks and understanding academic English instructions.

**Comparison to Common Errors and Pass Rates:**

*   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass rate):** This question is extremely abstract, requires analytical skills, and sophisticated vocabulary, plus understanding "writing style." "I am reading" indicates a complete misinterpretation of the task. Our target question is much more concrete and rule-based.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate):** Again, highly abstract, requiring interpretation, synthesis, and expressing complex ideas in English. "The last bargin they about a child and labour. many people tried to force the la" shows an attempt to grasp content but poor grammatical execution and conceptual understanding. Our target question is not about conceptual understanding, but rule application.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'" (10% pass rate):** This is a production task, requiring generative writing. Errors like "My hobby is cricket play" show basic grammatical errors in sentence construction,
