Let's break down the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" for Class 6 Indian government school students with limited English proficiency.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Poem Comprehension:** Students need to have understood the poem *to some extent* to identify a line they "like." This is a significant hurdle given the low pass rates on other comprehension questions. If they didn't understand the poem, selecting a line and explaining a preference will be impossible.
    *   **Vocabulary:** They need to understand "line," "poem," "like," "most," and "why." "Line" in the context of poetry is usually clear. "Like" is a common verb. "Most" and "why" are also fundamental.
    *   **Basic Opinion Expression:** The concept of expressing a personal preference ("which one do *you* like") is not inherently difficult, but articulating it in English is.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English):**
    *   **"Which line... do you like the most?"**: This part of the question is relatively straightforward. "Which" and "like" are common, and the superlative "most" is often introduced early.
    *   **"...and why?"**: This is the more challenging part.
        *   **Causal language:** Explaining "why" requires using conjunctions like "because" or phrases that indicate reason. This is an immediate step up from simple recall.
        *   **Elaboration:** Students need to generate their own reason, not just copy from the poem. This demands productive language skills rather than just receptive ones.
        *   **Grammar:** Constructing a grammatically coherent sentence to explain a preference (e.g., "I like this line because it makes me feel happy," or "This line is good because it tells about X") will be a major challenge.
    *   **Rubric "Denotes a line from the poem":** This requires accurate transcription or recall of a specific line. This is relatively easier than the "why" part, assuming they identified one.
    *   **Rubric "mentions why":** This is where the severe language limitations will kick in. Many students might be able to pick a line, but struggle immensely to articulate a reason beyond very simple, potentially incorrect, or incomplete phrases. The common errors show difficulties with even basic sentence construction ("My hobby is cricket play").

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall (of a line):** Yes, they need to recall/identify a line. This is the simplest part.
    *   **Application (of preference):** They apply their personal preference to the poem.
    *   **Reasoning (why):** This is the most demanding aspect. They need to articulate a reason, which involves a degree of basic analysis or emotional response. It moves beyond simple factual recall.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 6 exercises might ask for direct comprehension ("Who is the poet?"), simple definitions, or filling in blanks.
    *   Questions like "Write a theme or central idea" (5% pass rate) are analytical and abstract, making them very hard.
    *   Questions like "Describes the poet's writing style" (4% pass rate) are even more abstract and require advanced vocabulary and analytical skills.
    *   "Write a short paragraph...about 'My Favourite Hobby'" (10% pass rate) is a productive writing task, but it's about a familiar topic, and still has very low pass rates due to the demands of coherent sentence formation and paragraph structure.

**Comparison with the given examples:**

*   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass rate):** Far harder. Requires abstract understanding and specialized vocabulary.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate):** Harder. Requires abstract interpretation of the entire poem.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'" (10% pass rate):** This is the closest comparison in terms of demanding productive English writing. However, "My Favourite Hobby" is a topic students *should* have personal vocabulary for and be able to draw upon easily. The current question requires processing the *poem's content* first, then formulating an opinion based on that content, and *then* articulating the reason. This adds an extra layer of complexity.

**Specific Challenges for "Which line... and why?":**

*   **"Why" as a barrier:** Students might point to a line but then fail completely on "why." Given the "Empty Response" common for productive tasks, this will likely be a major point of failure.
