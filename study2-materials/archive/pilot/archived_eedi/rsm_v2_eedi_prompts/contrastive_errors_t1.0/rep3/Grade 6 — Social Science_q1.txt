Here's a breakdown of the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" and a contrastive analysis:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Low Difficulty:** This question assumes basic geographical knowledge of India, specifically identifying prominent physical features. Mountain ranges are typically introduced early in geography curricula (Class 5 or 6) as fundamental aspects of India's physical map.
    *   **Compared to other questions:** The "colonial rule" question requires understanding complex historical processes and their socio-economic impact. The "lions on currency" question requires knowledge of symbols and their historical/cultural significance (Ashoka). The "Ashoka's reign" question requires a broader understanding of a significant historical period and its contributions. "Mountain ranges" is much more direct and factual recall.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Low Difficulty:** The question uses very simple and direct English: "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."
        *   "Name" is a common directive.
        *   "Two" is a basic number.
        *   "Major" indicates prominence, which is often learned alongside "mountain ranges."
        *   "Mountain ranges" is a core geographical term.
        *   "Located in India" clearly defines the scope.
    *   **Compared to other questions:** The "colonial rule" question uses abstract terms like "affected," "lives," "tribal communities," and "colonial rule" itself, which are high-level vocabulary. Even "significance" and "reign" in the Ashoka question are more demanding than "mountain ranges." The common error of "Empty Response" in those questions suggests a complete lack of comprehension or ability to formulate an answer in English. For this question, even if they struggle with English, the names of the mountain ranges (e.g., Himalaya, Aravalli) are proper nouns and often taught in English and Hindi mediums.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Recall (Very Direct):** This is almost purely a recall question. Students are expected to have memorized the names of a few major mountain ranges in India. There's no application of concepts or reasoning required.
    *   **Compared to other questions:** The "colonial rule" question demands analysis and explanation (reasoning/application of historical understanding). "Why are lions shown..." requires reasoning about symbolism. "Explain the significance..." requires both recall and synthesis (reasoning). This question is much simpler, asking for a direct fact.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Low Difficulty:** Naming major geographical features (mountains, rivers, plains) is a very common and fundamental exercise in Class 6 geography textbooks, often appearing as "fill in the blanks," "match the following," or "name two/three..." questions. It's usually among the easiest questions in a chapter.
    *   **Compared to other questions:** The "explain how..." and "explain the significance..." questions are typically considered higher-order thinking questions in textbooks, requiring more detailed answers and understanding than simple recall.

**Why this question is easier than the "Common Errors" examples:**

*   **Concrete vs. Abstract:** Mountain ranges are concrete physical features. "Colonial rule," "significance," and "symbolism" are abstract concepts.
*   **Direct Factual Recall vs. Explanation/Analysis:** This question asks for direct facts. The others ask for explanations, causes, or significance, requiring a deeper level of understanding and articulation.
*   **Vocabulary:** The vocabulary is extremely basic and core to Class 6 geography.
*   **Likelihood of Partial Credit:** The rubric allows for 0.5 points for just *one* correct range. This significantly increases the chance of scoring at least partial credit compared to open-ended explanation questions where a partial or incomplete explanation might not meet the bar for any credit. Many students might know *at least one* major range like the Himalayas.
*   **Proper Nouns:** The answers are proper nouns (Himalayas, Aravalli, etc.) which are often learned verbatim in both English and vernacular mediums, potentially bypassing some language comprehension issues.

**Potential Difficulties (Still present, but less severe):**

*   **Sheer volume of information:** Students might confuse mountain ranges with plateaus, rivers, or other features if their basic map work is weak.
*   **Spelling:** While names are proper nouns, poor spelling could still lead to incorrect recognition, though likely less of an issue than constructing full sentences for other questions.
*   **Lack of exposure:** If a student has genuinely not been taught basic physical geography of India, even this simple question would be impossible. However, this is a
