Let's break down the question "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?" for Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students should know *what* the Battle of Plassey was (a conflict involving the British and a local ruler). They should also know *when* it happened (1757). They need to understand the concept of "British power in India" and "expansion."
    *   **Likely Gap:** While the Battle of Plassey is a foundational topic in Class 8 history (often covered in chapters on the rise of British rule), the *causal link* ("contribute to") might be understood superficially. Many might remember *that* it happened and *that* the British won, but not necessarily *how* that victory specifically led to political dominance beyond just "winning land."
    *   **Comparison to Common Errors:** The "Empty Response" errors in other questions suggest a lack of substantive knowledge or inability to articulate it. For Plassey, they might know the name but struggle with the *consequence*. The question on Ashoka's reign (12% pass rate) also requires explaining significance, which is similar in cognitive demand to explaining "contribution."

2.  **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   **Key terms:** "How," "contribute," "expansion," "British power." These are relatively straightforward historical terms. "Contribute" is more complex than "What was..." or "When was...", requiring an understanding of cause and effect.
    *   **Sentence structure:** A direct question, but the expectation is a coherent explanatory answer.
    *   **Comparison to Common Errors:** The *content* of the common errors (e.g., "Asher' stand," "Ashok seamb") suggests very weak English comprehension and expression, even for simpler recall questions. "Empty Response" could be due to not understanding the question, not knowing the answer, or inability to form an answer in English. For this Plassey question, while the specific terms are not extremely esoteric, combining them into a meaningful explanation will be a challenge for students with limited English. They might struggle to articulate "political dominance" or "puppet nawab" even if they grasp the concept.

3.  **Cognitive Demand (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   This is primarily **reasoning/explanation** based on **recall** of historical facts. It's not just "What was the Battle of Plassey?" (recall) but "How did it *contribute*?" (explaining cause-and-effect, which requires a deeper understanding than mere recall).
    *   Students need to connect the dots: British victory -> Mir Jafar as a puppet -> British control over Bengal's resources/administration -> expansion of British power.
    *   **Comparison to Common Errors:** The question "Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi" (9% pass rate) is similar in requiring an explanation of *how* something contributed to an outcome. The Ashoka question (12% pass rate) also demands explaining *significance*. This suggests that questions requiring an explanation of impact or significance are particularly difficult.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Textbooks will certainly cover the Battle of Plassey and its immediate aftermath. They will likely state that it marked the beginning of British political dominance.
    *   Typical textbook questions might be:
        *   "When was the Battle of Plassey fought?" (Recall - easier)
        *   "Who were the key figures in the Battle of Plassey?" (Recall - easier)
        *   "What was the immediate outcome of the Battle of Plassey?" (Recall/summary - slightly easier than "how did it contribute")
    *   This question, by asking "how it contributed," moves beyond simple recall to requiring a synthesis and explanation of the *mechanism* of contribution. It requires students to articulate the chain of events that led to increased British power, rather than just stating the outcome. This makes it more challenging than typical recall exercises.

**Synthesis of Difficulty:**

*   **Positive:** The Battle of Plassey is a core topic, so the event itself will be familiar.
*   **Negative:**
    *   The "how it contributed" aspect requires a deeper, explanatory understanding rather than just factual recall. This is a significant hurdle, as evidenced by the low pass rates on other "explain how/why" questions.
    *   Articulating this explanation coherently in English, given known limitations, will be very difficult. Students might know the facts in their native language but struggle to translate them into a nuanced English explanation.
