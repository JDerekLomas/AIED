Let's break down the question "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there" using the provided context and common errors.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geographical Knowledge:** Basic knowledge of the geography of Rajasthan (a desert state) is helpful, as it immediately brings to mind resources like sand, limited water, and sunlight.
    *   **Definition of Natural Resources:** Students need to understand what "natural resources" are. This is a fundamental concept in geography/social studies at this level.
    *   **Basic Economic/Social Understanding:** They need to be able to connect a resource to its influence on people's lives (e.g., water scarcity leads to specific agricultural practices or challenges).
    *   **Contrast to Other Questions:** The prior knowledge required here is less abstract than "colonial rule" or "Ashoka's reign" and more concrete/observable than explaining *why* lions are on currency notes (which has historical/symbolic reasoning).

*   **Language Demands (limited English proficiency):**
    *   **Keywords:** "Natural resources," "Rajasthan," "influences the lives."
    *   "Natural resources" is a core vocabulary term often introduced early.
    *   "Rajasthan" is a proper noun, straightforward.
    *   "Influences the lives" might be slightly more complex than just "how it affects," but "affect" is often used interchangeably in textbooks.
    *   **Task:** "Mention any two" is simple recall. "Explain how one of them influences" requires a short explanatory sentence.
    *   **Contrast to Other Questions:** The language is relatively straightforward. "Explain how colonial rule under the British affected..." is much longer and more complex, both in vocabulary and sentence structure. "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign..." also uses more academic language ("significance," "reign"). This question's language feels more direct and less prone to misinterpretation due to poor English.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Identifying two natural resources is purely recall-based.
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** Explaining the influence requires a very basic level of application or reasoning. For example, "Water scarcity means people have to conserve water and rely on wells" or "Sand is used for building." This isn't deep analysis but a direct consequence.
    *   **Contrast to Other Questions:** Less abstract reasoning than "significance of Ashoka" or "why lions." It's more direct cause-and-effect than explaining complex historical processes like colonial rule.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question format (identify X and explain Y about one of them) is very common in Indian social science textbooks for Class 6. Identifying natural resources of a state and their uses/impacts is standard content.
    *   The rubric is fairly generous, allowing for a wide range of correct resources.
    *   The "explain how" part can be very brief and still score.

**Factors Making it Easier:**

1.  **Concrete and Familiar:** Natural resources (especially sand, water, sun) in a well-known Indian state like Rajasthan are very concrete and often part of general knowledge, even outside formal schooling.
2.  **Simple Recall for First Part:** Naming two resources is a low cognitive load task.
3.  **Direct Cause-Effect for Explanation:** The explanation can be very basic ("less water means people save it," "sand is used for buildings").
4.  **Common Textbook Format:** Students are likely familiar with answering questions in this structure.
5.  **Generous Rubric:** Many correct answers are possible for the resources, increasing the chances of students getting at least two right.
6.  **Less Abstract/Historical:** Unlike colonial rule or Ashoka's reign, this is more contemporary geography/environment, which can sometimes be more relatable.

**Factors Making it Harder (relative to the ease described above):**

1.  **"Empty Response" Issue:** Even for easier questions, a significant number of "Empty Responses" occur, suggesting lack of confidence, time, or basic understanding even of simpler concepts.
2.  **Articulation in English:** While the concepts are simple, articulating the "influence" in a grammatically coherent English sentence might still be a hurdle for some students, even if they understand the Hindi equivalent. They might know "pani kam hai toh log bachate hain" but struggle with "Water is scarce, so people conserve it."
3.  **Specificity:** Some might just write "minerals" without naming two specific ones, or name one but struggle with the second.
4.  **Average Pass Rate:** The overall average
