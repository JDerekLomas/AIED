Let's break down the question "Who lived inside the book?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their common challenges.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Direct Recall of a Specific Story:** This question *heavily* assumes students have read a particular story or passage from which this question is drawn. Without the source text, it's impossible to answer. This is a crucial point. If it's a general knowledge question about "books," the answer would be different (authors, characters, stories), but "Who *lived* inside the book?" points to a specific narrative.
    *   **Basic Understanding of "Who," "Lived," "Inside," "Book":** These are fundamental vocabulary words, likely introduced in earlier grades. "Who" for person/entity, "lived" for past tense habitation, "inside" for location, "book" for the object.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Simplicity of Sentence Structure:** The sentence "Who lived inside the book?" is a very simple Wh-question in past tense. There are no complex clauses, idioms, or difficult grammatical constructions.
    *   **Vocabulary:** The words themselves are common and likely within the receptive vocabulary of a Class 6 student, even with limited English. "Who," "lived," "inside," "book" are foundational.
    *   **Answering Format:** The expected answer is a simple noun phrase ("a magical fairy," "fairy"). This avoids the need for complex sentence construction from the student, which is a major hurdle as seen in "I am reading" for writing style.
    *   **Contrast with Common Errors:**
        *   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (Pass rate 4%): This question uses "describes," "poet's," "writing style" – much more abstract and advanced vocabulary. The expected answer requires analytical thinking and descriptive language.
        *   "Write a theme or central idea..." (Pass rate 5%): "Theme," "central idea" are abstract concepts. "Write a theme" is a complex instruction for writing a sentence or two explaining an abstract concept.
        *   "Write a short paragraph..." (Pass rate 10%): This requires sustained writing, sentence formation, and coherent thought, which is very difficult for students who struggle with basic sentence construction.

    *   **"Who lived inside the book?" is significantly less demanding grammatically and lexically than the examples provided for common errors.** It is a direct recall question, not requiring synthesis, analysis, or extended writing.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is almost purely **recall**. If they read the story, they recall the character. There's no application of a concept to a new situation, nor is there reasoning about implications or interpretations.

4.  **How Does It Compare in Difficulty to Typical Textbook Exercises?**
    *   This question style ("Who did X?") is very common in early reading comprehension exercises. It's often the most straightforward type of question following a passage. It's usually the *easiest* type of question within a comprehension set, testing basic understanding of characters and plot points.
    *   It's far easier than questions asking for analysis, summary, or creative writing.

**Critical Factor: The Source Text**

The *absolute biggest factor* here is whether the students have *read the specific story* from which this question is drawn.

*   If this question is posed immediately after they have read a story titled or featuring a book where a magical fairy lived, it's very easy.
*   If this question is given out of context, or from a story they vaguely remember, or from a story they never read, then it becomes impossible or a guessing game. Given the challenges with "Empty Response," this is a real possibility if the context is missing or too far removed.

Assuming this question is part of a standard comprehension exercise *immediately following* the relevant text:

*   The vocabulary ("who," "lived," "inside," "book") is very basic.
*   The sentence structure is simple.
*   The answer is a direct recall of a character.
*   It requires minimal production (just a noun phrase).

The average pass rate of 29% across items suggests a wide range of difficulty. The examples given ("writing style," "theme," "paragraph") are much harder, bringing down the average. This specific question is much closer to the *easier end* of the spectrum.

However, the "Empty Response" common error for even simple questions suggests that if students don't know, they often don't guess, or simply give up. If they didn't understand the story, or
