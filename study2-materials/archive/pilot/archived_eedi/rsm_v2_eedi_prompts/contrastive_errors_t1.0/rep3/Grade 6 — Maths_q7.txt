Let's break down this question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Time Calculation:** Students need to be able to calculate the duration between two given times (10 am and 4 pm). This involves understanding AM/PM and potentially crossing the 12 o'clock noon mark. This is typically covered by Class 6, but might be challenging for some who struggle with analog clocks or mental time arithmetic.
    *   **Basic Arithmetic (Addition & Multiplication):** They need to add the initial temperature to the total temperature increase. Calculating the total increase requires multiplication (hourly increase x number of hours). These are fundamental operations taught early.
    *   **Understanding Temperature Units:** Recognizing $30^0 C$ as a temperature and $2^0 C$ as a change in temperature. The concept of "degrees Celsius" and its use in temperature is generally familiar by this age.
    *   **"Per hour" concept:** Understanding that "per hour" means the increase happens for each hour that passes. This implies multiplication.

*   **Language Demands:** This is where the question poses significant challenges for students with limited English proficiency.
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Temperature": Common word, but might be less frequently encountered in English than in their vernacular.
        *   "Increases by": Crucial for understanding the operation (addition). This phrase can be tricky.
        *   "Per hour": Another critical phrase indicating repeated addition or multiplication.
        *   "Morning" / "Evening": Essential for time calculation, but could be confused if they rely on literal translation without understanding AM/PM context.
        *   "Then what will be": Standard question phrasing, usually understood.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The question has a relatively straightforward structure. However, extracting the numerical values and understanding the relationships between them (initial temp, rate of change, duration) requires careful reading and comprehension. The sequence of information given needs to be processed to identify the necessary steps.
    *   **Context:** The context of "Jodhpur" and "temperature" is relatable to their daily lives, which helps somewhat.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily an **application** problem. It's not a direct recall of a fact or formula. Students need to apply their knowledge of time calculation, multiplication, and addition to a real-world scenario.
    *   There is an element of **reasoning** in breaking down the problem into steps:
        1.  Calculate time elapsed.
        2.  Calculate total temperature increase.
        3.  Calculate final temperature.
    *   It's a multi-step problem, which increases complexity compared to single-step problems.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Time Calculation:** Calculating duration across AM/PM can be a dedicated section in Class 5 or 6 textbooks.
    *   **Word Problems with Rates:** Problems involving "per hour," "per day," etc., are common in Class 5-6 mathematics, often involving distance/speed, or work rates. However, temperature change might be a slightly less common context than, say, train travel or filling buckets.
    *   **Multi-step nature:** Typical textbook exercises at this level often start with simpler, single-step problems and gradually introduce multi-step ones. This question, requiring three distinct steps, would be considered on the harder side for a *typical* Class 6 exercise, especially one presented in a second language.
    *   **Lack of scaffolding:** No hints or intermediate questions are provided.

**Specific Challenges for This Question:**

1.  **"Increases by $2^0 C$ per hour":** This is a key phrase. Students might miss "per hour" and simply add $2^0 C$ to $30^0 C$, or struggle to multiply.
2.  **Time Calculation (10 am to 4 pm):** While a common skill, errors can occur, especially if a student just subtracts 10 from 4 directly without understanding the 12-hour cycle (leading to an incorrect 6 hours if they interpret 4 pm as 16:00, or getting 2 hours if they subtract 4 from 10). The correct way is usually counting hours: 10-11 (1), 11-12 (2), 12-1 (3), 1-2 (4), 2-3 (5), 3-4 (6 hours). This counting method is frequently taught.
3.  **Language Barrier:** The English phrasing for "increases by" and "per hour" is likely the biggest hurdle.
