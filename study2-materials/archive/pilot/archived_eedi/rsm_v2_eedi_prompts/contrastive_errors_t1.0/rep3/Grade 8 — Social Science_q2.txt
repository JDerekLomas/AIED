## Contrastive Analysis of "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

Let's break down the question's difficulty for Class 8 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency, considering the common error patterns observed.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Introduction to Ancient Civilizations:** Students are expected to have been introduced to the Harappan Civilization (also known as the Indus Valley Civilization) in their Social Science curriculum. This is a standard topic for Class 6-8 history in India.
*   **Basic Understanding of Urban Planning Concepts:** While they might not use the term "urban planning" explicitly, they should have learned about the physical layout and infrastructure of Harappan cities.

**Language Demands:**

*   **"Describe one key feature":** This is a relatively straightforward directive. "Describe" is a common task verb, and "key feature" points towards identifying a prominent characteristic.
*   **"Harappan Civilization's urban planning":** "Harappan Civilization" is a proper noun they should recognize. "Urban planning" might be slightly more technical, but the context of "Harappan cities" usually clarifies it.
*   **Simplicity of required output:** The expected answer is a single, concise description, not a multi-faceted explanation or analysis. This significantly reduces the linguistic burden compared to questions requiring elaborate explanations.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   **Recall:** This question is primarily a **recall** question. Students need to remember specific details about Harappan cities that they would have learned from their textbooks. They are not asked to apply a concept or reason through a complex scenario.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Typical Textbook Exercise:** This question is very similar to a standard "define" or "list" type of question found at the end of a chapter on the Harappan Civilization.
*   **Compared to "Explain how colonial rule..." (9% pass rate):**
    *   **Less Abstract:** "Colonial rule" is a more abstract concept requiring understanding of political and economic systems. "Urban planning" in Harappa is about concrete physical structures.
    *   **Requires Deeper Explanation:** "Explain how... affected" demands a cause-and-effect analysis and a more detailed, multi-point answer, increasing both cognitive load and language demands. "Describe one key feature" is much simpler.
*   **Compared to "Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes?" (10% pass rate):**
    *   **Directly Taught:** Harappan urban planning features are directly taught in history chapters. The symbolism of lions on currency notes might be taught, but it can also involve a degree of inference or cultural understanding that might not be explicitly detailed for all students.
    *   **Less Ambiguous:** The answer options for Harappan planning are quite specific (grid, drainage, bricks). The lion question has a specific historical link (Ashoka) that needs to be recalled correctly, and the errors suggest a poor recall of that specific connection.
*   **Compared to "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign..." (12% pass rate):**
    *   **Requires "Significance":** "Significance" requires students to understand the *importance* and *impact* of events, which is a higher-order thinking skill than simple description. They need to analyze and synthesize information, not just recall facts.
    *   **More Complex Answer:** Explaining significance typically involves multiple points and a more structured response, increasing linguistic and cognitive demands.

**Factors making this question easier:**

1.  **Direct Recall:** The answer is a factual recall of information directly taught in textbooks.
2.  **Specific and Concrete:** Harappan urban features (grid, drainage, bricks) are concrete and easily visualized, making them easier to remember.
3.  **Low Language Demand:** "Describe one key feature" is a simple directive. Students only need to provide a single, short phrase or sentence.
4.  **Common Topic:** Harappan Civilization is a foundational topic in Indian history for this age group, so most students would have been exposed to it.
5.  **Multiple Correct Answers:** The rubric allows for several correct features, increasing the chances a student recalls at least one.

**Factors making this question harder:**

1.  **English Medium:** While simple, conveying the feature accurately in English can still be a hurdle for students with limited proficiency. They might know the concept in Hindi but struggle with the precise English vocabulary (e.g., "drainage system," "grid pattern," "baked bricks").
2.  **Vocabulary:** Even simple terms like "urban planning" or "citadel" might be challenging for some.
3.  **"Empty Response" Trend:** The common error of "Empty Response" suggests a general lack of
