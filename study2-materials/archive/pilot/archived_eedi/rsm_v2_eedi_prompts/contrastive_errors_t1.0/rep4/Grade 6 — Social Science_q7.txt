Let's break down the question and its potential impact on Class 6 students in Indian government schools.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **What prior knowledge is assumed?**
    *   **Geographical knowledge:** Students need to know that Rajasthan is a state in India. This is fundamental Class 6 geography.
    *   **Concept of "natural resources":** They need to understand what a natural resource is (things from nature that people use). This is a core concept in geography and environmental studies, typically introduced by Class 6.
    *   **Specific resources of Rajasthan:** This is the most specific knowledge required. While some resources like "water" (especially in a desert state) and "sand" are very intuitive, others like "Marble," "Copper," "Gypsum," "mica," "limestone," or "zinc" require more specific regional knowledge. However, even if they only know *one* specific resource (e.g., marble for building, salt from lakes), they can still get partial credit if they also mention "water" or "sunlight."

2.  **What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
    *   "Mention any two natural resources": "Mention" is a fairly common verb. "Natural resources" is a key term, but if taught, students might recognize it.
    *   "found in Rajasthan": "found" is common, "Rajasthan" is the state name.
    *   "explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":
        *   "explain how... influences": This is the most complex part linguistically. "Influences" might be a challenging vocabulary word for some. They need to articulate a cause-and-effect relationship.
        *   "lives of the people there": Fairly straightforward.
    *   **Overall:** The language is not overly academic or abstract, but the "explain how... influences" part requires more than just naming. Students might struggle to form a coherent sentence in English to explain the impact, even if they understand the concept in Hindi. They might resort to very simple, fragmented sentences.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Recall (for resources):** Naming two resources is primarily recall.
    *   **Reasoning/Application (for influence):** Explaining the influence requires a basic level of reasoning or application of knowledge. For example, knowing Rajasthan is dry, and water is a resource, then reasoning that it's used for drinking, agriculture, etc. Or knowing marble is a resource, then reasoning it's used for buildings, livelihoods. This isn't high-level critical thinking, but rather connecting a resource to its practical use.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Typical:** Questions asking to "name natural resources" or "list resources of a region" are common.
    *   **Slightly more challenging:** The "explain how one of them influences" part adds a layer of difficulty beyond simple recall. Textbooks often have "short answer" questions like this, but a student with limited English might find it harder to articulate the explanation than to simply state the facts.
    *   **Less abstract:** Compared to questions about "colonial rule" or "significance of Ashoka's reign," this question is much more concrete and relates to tangible aspects of the environment and daily life. The connection between "water" and "daily life" is far more immediate and intuitive than explaining complex historical impacts.

**Why this question might perform *better* than the examples given:**

*   **Concrete Nature:** Natural resources and their uses are very concrete. Water, sand, sun, even marble or salt, are part of the students' observable world, unlike abstract historical concepts or political structures.
*   **Intuitive Connections:** The link between a resource (like water or sun) and its influence on people's lives (drinking, farming, generating power) is often quite intuitive, especially for students living in a region like Rajasthan.
*   **Potential for Partial Credit:** The rubric allows for mentioning two resources, and then explaining one. A student might correctly name two resources (e.g., water, sand) but struggle to explain the influence in good English, still getting some credit.
*   **Lower English Demand for the "What":** Naming resources (e.g., "water," "sand," "marble") requires less complex English than explaining abstract historical impacts.

**Why it might still be challenging:**

*   **"Influences" explanation:** As noted, articulating the influence clearly in English can be a hurdle. Simple, fragmented explanations might be common.
*   **Specific Resource Knowledge:** While "water" is universal, knowing specific mineral resources for Rajasthan might vary. However, "sand" or
