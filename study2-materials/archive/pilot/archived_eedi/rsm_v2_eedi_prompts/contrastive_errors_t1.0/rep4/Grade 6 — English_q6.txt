Let's break down the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and common errors.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Poem Comprehension:** Students need to have understood the poem well enough to identify specific lines and grasp their meaning. This is a significant hurdle, as evidenced by the "theme or central idea" question's 5% pass rate. If they don't understand the poem, selecting a line and explaining *why* they like it becomes impossible.
    *   **Vocabulary:** They need to understand the vocabulary within the poem itself.
    *   **Basic Opinion Expression:** They need to understand what "like the most" means and the concept of expressing a personal preference.

*   **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **Identifying "Line from the poem":** While "line" is a common word, combining it with "from the poem" might still be a small cognitive load.
    *   **"Do you like the most":** This phrase is relatively common and might be understood, especially "like." "Most" adds a comparative element.
    *   **"and why?":** This is the biggest linguistic demand. It requires formulating a *reason* using appropriate English vocabulary and sentence structures (e.g., "because...", "it shows...", "I feel..."). This moves beyond simple recall or recognition into explanatory prose.
    *   **Quoting/Referencing:** They need to be able to accurately reproduce a line from the poem. This might involve copying, which is simpler than generating original text, but still requires attention to detail.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Constructing a coherent sentence that links the chosen line to the reason for liking it (e.g., "I like the line '...' because it reminds me of...") is challenging for students whose typical output might be fragmented or grammatically incorrect (e.g., "My hobby is cricket play").

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Quoting the line is primarily recall (or copying).
    *   **Reasoning/Application:** Explaining *why* they like it is reasoning and applying their understanding of the poem to their personal feelings. This is a higher-order thinking skill.
    *   The "why" aspect elevates it significantly from simple recall.

*   **How it compares in difficulty to typical textbook exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 6 textbook exercises often involve:
        *   Answering factual questions about the text (who, what, when, where).
        *   Filling in the blanks.
        *   Matching words/phrases.
        *   Sometimes, simple "why" questions, but often with very direct answers found in the text.
    *   This question, asking for a *personal opinion* supported by reasoning, is generally *harder* than most typical textbook exercises at this level. Textbooks might ask "What is the poet's message?" (application/interpretation), but rarely "Which line *do you like* and *why*?" which requires more personal engagement and expressive English.

**Comparison with Common Errors:**

*   **"Describes the poet's writing style" (4% pass rate):** This question requires abstract reasoning and specialized vocabulary ("writing style"). The target question is slightly less abstract, focusing on personal preference, but still requires reasoning ("why"). The low pass rate here shows the difficulty with analytical and abstract English.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea" (5% pass rate):** This is a comprehension and synthesis task. If students struggle to identify the *theme*, they will struggle even more to articulate a nuanced reason for liking a *specific line* from that theme. The "Empty Response" error is highly relevant, suggesting a lack of comprehension or inability to form an answer.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... about 'My Favourite Hobby'" (10% pass rate):** This is closer in type – expressing a personal preference and elaborating. However, the common errors ("My hobby is cricket play," fragmented sentences) highlight the difficulty students have with sentence construction, grammar, and developing ideas into coherent English, even for a familiar topic. The poem question adds the layer of needing to understand the poem first.

**Specific Challenges for "Which line... and why?":**

1.  **Poem Comprehension:** The foundational hurdle. If they don't understand the poem, they can't genuinely pick a line and explain why.
2.  **Vocabulary for Reasons:** Explaining "why" requires a vocabulary beyond just factual recall. They need words like "beautiful," "sad," "strong," "inspiration," "reminds me of,"
