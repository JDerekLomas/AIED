Let's break down the question "Who lived inside the book?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering the provided context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Low Assumption:** This question assumes very little general knowledge outside the immediate context of a story. It's not asking for factual information about the world, but rather a detail from a narrative.
    *   **Specific Story Knowledge:** Crucially, it assumes the student has *just read or heard* the story from which this question is drawn. Without the preceding text, this question is unanswerable. Given it's an exam item, we must assume the story was provided.
    *   **Basic Vocabulary:** "Who," "lived," "inside," "book" are very fundamental English words typically introduced early in primary education.

*   **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Direct Question Structure:** "Who lived inside the book?" is a straightforward *wh*-question. This is one of the most common and basic question types. It doesn't use complex grammatical structures (e.g., passive voice, conditional tenses, embedded clauses).
    *   **Simple Vocabulary:** As mentioned, the words are basic. There are no idiomatic expressions, phrasal verbs, or abstract nouns.
    *   **No Complex Instructions:** Unlike "Describes the poet's writing style" or "Write a theme or central idea," there's no need to understand nuanced instructions or literary terms. It's a direct factual recall.
    *   **Short Answer Expected:** The rubric allows for a very concise answer ("a magical fairy," "fairy"). This reduces the burden of constructing full sentences, which is a major challenge for these students (as seen in the "My Favourite Hobby" examples).
    *   **No Inference Required:** The answer is likely stated explicitly in the text. Students don't need to infer character traits, motivations, or deeper meanings.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** This is primarily a recall question. Students need to find the specific detail (who lived there) from the text they have just read. It's a "locate information" task.
    *   **No Application/Reasoning:** There's no application of concepts or abstract reasoning required.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Easier:** This question is significantly easier than many of the examples provided.
        *   "Describes the poet's writing style" (pass rate 4%) requires understanding "describes," "poet's," "writing style," and then formulating a descriptive answer. This is highly abstract and grammatically complex.
        *   "Write a theme or central idea..." (pass rate 5%) requires understanding "theme," "central idea," and then synthesizing information from the poem into an abstract concept. This is a higher-order thinking skill.
        *   "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'..." (pass rate 10%) demands sustained writing, grammatical correctness over multiple sentences, and creative expression. The common errors show the struggle with sentence construction and topic adherence.
    *   **Likely found in basic comprehension sections:** Questions like "Who lived in the house?" or "What did the character do next?" are very common in early reading comprehension exercises, designed to check if students understood basic plot points.

**Why this question is easier than the examples:**

*   **Directness:** The question directly asks for a specific piece of information.
*   **Simple Vocabulary:** All words are common and basic.
*   **Minimal Writing Output:** A one or two-word answer is acceptable. This completely bypasses the sentence construction and grammatical challenges seen in other items.
*   **Factual Recall:** It doesn't require interpretation, analysis, or creative writing. The answer should be explicitly present in the preceding text.

Given the average pass rate is 29% and the common errors highlight major struggles with vocabulary, abstract concepts, and sentence formation, this question avoids almost all of those pitfalls. The primary barrier would be if the student didn't understand the story at all or simply couldn't locate the specific detail. However, "who" questions about characters are usually the easiest to answer from a text.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:** 60%

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

*   **Higher than Average:** It's significantly easier than the 29% average, which includes very challenging items.
*   **Simple Language and Structure:** The question itself is very accessible.
*   **Minimal Output:** The accepted answers ("a magical fairy," "fairy") remove the burden of complex sentence formation, which is a
