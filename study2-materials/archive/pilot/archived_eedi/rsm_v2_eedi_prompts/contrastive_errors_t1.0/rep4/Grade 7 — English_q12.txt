Let's break down the question "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away." for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering the provided context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Core Concept:** Understanding of active and passive voice. This is typically introduced in Class 6 or 7 English grammar curricula in India. Students would have been exposed to the basic rules: subject-verb-object in active becomes object-verb(be + past participle)-by-subject in passive.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "wind," "blew" (past tense of blow), "leaves," "away." These are very common, basic words that even students with limited English should know. "Blew" as the past tense of "blow" is also fundamental.
    *   **Grammar:** Understanding of past tense, subject-verb agreement, and prepositions ("by").

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Instruction Clarity:** "Change... from Active Voice to Passive Voice." This is the main potential hurdle. While "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" are technical terms, if they have been taught in class, students should recognize them. If they only know the *concept* but not the *technical English terms*, they might struggle. However, given it's a direct instruction for a grammar transformation, it's likely they would have encountered these terms.
    *   **Sentence Complexity:** "The wind blew the leaves away." This is a simple SVO sentence with a phrasal verb "blew away." The "away" might make it *slightly* trickier than a very basic SVO, but it doesn't change the core transformation.
    *   **Vocabulary:** As mentioned, the words are simple and common.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application** of learned grammatical rules. Students need to recall the rules for active-to-passive transformation and then apply them to the given sentence.
    *   There's minimal "reasoning" beyond identifying the subject, verb, and object and then restructuring. It's a formulaic application.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical:** This *is* a typical textbook exercise for active-passive voice. It's a straightforward sentence, not overly long or complex. Many exercises start with sentences just like this one.
    *   **Easier Aspects:**
        *   The sentence is short and uses common vocabulary.
        *   The verb "blew" is a common irregular verb whose past participle ("blown") is often taught early.
        *   There are no complex clauses, multiple objects, or tricky verb forms (e.g., modals, perfect tenses, infinitives) that could confuse students.
    *   **Harder Aspects (compared to the very easiest):**
        *   The phrasal verb "blew away" adds a tiny bit of complexity compared to just "The wind blew the leaves." Students need to ensure "away" is carried over correctly.
        *   The instruction itself uses technical grammar terms. If the teacher primarily taught in Hindi with English examples, the *terms* themselves might be a barrier for some.

**Comparison to Common Errors and Pass Rates:**

*   The example questions with very low pass rates (4-10%) are significantly harder:
    *   "Describes the poet's writing style": Requires abstract thinking, analytical skills, and sophisticated English vocabulary/grammar to articulate. "I am reading" shows a complete misunderstanding of the question's intent and language.
    *   "Write a theme or central idea...": Requires comprehension, interpretation, and synthesis of a poem, then expressing it coherently. The "The last bargin they about a child and labour..." shows an attempt at expressing an idea but with severe grammatical breakdown, suggesting a struggle with expressing complex thoughts in English.
    *   "Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby": Requires sustained writing, sentence construction, and idea generation. The errors show inability to form complete sentences or paragraphs, and a focus on listing rather than describing.

*   The active/passive voice question is a *direct grammar transformation*. It doesn't require abstract thinking, interpretation, or extended creative writing. It's a rule-based exercise. Students either know the rule and can apply it, or they don't.

*   **Crucial Point:** If active/passive voice has been taught even minimally, students are likely to attempt the transformation. The primary error would be incorrect past participle (e.g., "blowed"), incorrect form of "to be" (e.g., "are blown" instead of "were blown"), or
