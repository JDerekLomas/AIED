Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis: "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."

### What prior knowledge is assumed?
*   **Basic geographical knowledge of India:** Students are expected to know that India has mountains and to have learned the names of at least two prominent ranges. This is fundamental geography taught in Class 6.
*   **Concept of "mountain ranges":** Students should understand what a mountain range is. This is typically introduced in early geography lessons.

### What language demands does it place on students with limited English?
*   **Simple vocabulary:** "Name," "two," "major," "mountain ranges," "located in India" are all relatively common and straightforward terms. "Major" is the only word that might be slightly less common than others, but its meaning in context should be clear.
*   **Direct command:** The question is a direct command, "Name any two," which is easy to understand.
*   **No complex sentence structure:** It avoids passive voice, conditional clauses, or long, elaborate sentences.
*   **No explanation required:** Unlike the "Explain how colonial rule..." or "Why are lions shown..." questions, this simply asks for names, not explanations or justifications. This significantly reduces the linguistic burden.

### Is this recall, application, or reasoning?
*   **Pure Recall:** This is a direct recall question. Students either know the names of Indian mountain ranges or they don't. There's no application of concepts or reasoning required beyond retrieving factual information.

### How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?
*   **Easier than typical explanation questions:** Textbook exercises often involve explaining concepts, processes, or historical events. This question is much simpler, akin to a "fill-in-the-blanks" or "list two examples" type of exercise, which are usually among the easiest.
*   **Core content:** Identifying major geographical features like mountain ranges is core, foundational content for Indian geography in Class 6. It's likely to be explicitly covered and emphasized.
*   **High salience:** Mountains like the Himalayas are iconic and frequently mentioned in relation to India. Other ranges like the Aravallis, Vindhyas, and Western Ghats are also very common points of reference.

### Comparison to Common Errors and Difficult Questions:

*   **"Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi" (pass rate: 9%)**
    *   **Much harder:** Requires understanding complex historical concepts (colonialism, its impact), specific knowledge about tribal communities, and the ability to articulate an explanation in English. The open-ended nature and historical depth make it extremely difficult for this demographic. "Empty Response" is a common error, indicating a lack of comprehension or inability to formulate an answer.
*   **"Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes? Explain" (pass rate: 10%)**
    *   **Much harder:** Requires specific cultural/historical knowledge (Ashoka's pillar, symbolism of lions), and an explanation. "Asher' stand," "ashok a second," "Ashok seamb" show partial, fragmented recall, often misinterpreted or poorly expressed. This question demands synthesis and explanation, not just recall.
*   **"Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign in Indian history, mentioning at leas" (pass rate: 12%)**
    *   **Much harder:** Requires knowledge of a specific historical figure and their reign's *significance*, which is an analytical concept. It also requires mentioning "at least" two points, demanding more extensive recall and articulation. Again, "Empty Response" highlights the difficulty.

### Why the target question is easier:
*   **No "Why" or "How":** It doesn't ask for reasons, processes, or effects.
*   **No "Explain" or "Significance":** It doesn't demand analytical thought or detailed elaboration.
*   **Simple "Name":** The task is purely informational recall.
*   **Core, visible features:** Mountain ranges are concrete geographical features that students would encounter repeatedly in maps and textbooks.
*   **High probability of partial credit:** The rubric gives 0.5 points for naming *one* correct range, which is very generous for students who might only remember one. This significantly boosts the potential pass rate compared to all-or-nothing questions.

Given that the average pass rate across items is 29%, and the other social science examples provided are particularly difficult explanation-based questions, this recall-based geography question should perform significantly better. Students from economically weaker sections often excel at rote memorization if the content is consistently taught.

My primary concern would be limited English proficiency. However, the names of mountain ranges (e.g., Himalayas, A
