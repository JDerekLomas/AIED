Here's a contrastive analysis of the question, followed by the estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis of the Question:

**Question:** At `10` am in the morning, the temperature of Jodhpur was `30^0 C`. If the temperature increases by `2^0 C` per hour, then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Time:** Understanding of AM/PM, the concept of hours, and how to calculate elapsed time across AM/PM boundaries. This is fundamental for Class 6.
*   **Numbers/Operations:** Basic addition, multiplication. Understanding of temperature in degrees Celsius.
*   **Problem Solving:** Ability to read a multi-step word problem, identify relevant information, and formulate a plan.
*   **Rate:** Implicit understanding of a "rate of change" (temperature increasing by 2 degrees *per hour*), even if the term "rate" isn't formally known.

**2. Language Demands (for students with limited English):**

*   **Vocabulary:**
    *   `temperature`: While commonly used, might be a slightly more complex word than everyday objects.
    *   `increases by`: Crucial phrase indicating addition.
    *   `per hour`: Key phrase for multiplication or repeated addition.
    *   `morning`, `evening`: Basic time indicators.
    *   `at 10 am`, `at 4:00`: Prepositional phrases indicating specific times.
    *   `then what will be`: Standard question phrasing.
*   **Sentence Structure:** The problem is a multi-clause sentence that requires parsing two pieces of initial information and then the question. It's not overly complex but requires careful reading.
*   **Numerical Representation:** `30^0 C`, `2^0 C`, `10 am`, `4:00 pm`. Students need to correctly identify these numbers and their units/context.

**Potential Language Hurdles:**
*   "Increases by" could be misinterpreted if "increases" isn't clear.
*   The transition from "10 am" to "4:00 in the evening" might be a slight conceptual jump for those less familiar with AM/PM notation and the 12-hour clock. "Evening" instead of "pm" might add a tiny bit of cognitive load for translation if "pm" is more commonly taught.

**3. Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   This is primarily an **Application** problem. Students need to apply their knowledge of time calculation, rates, and basic arithmetic to a specific scenario.
*   There's a mild element of **reasoning** in breaking down the problem into steps:
    1.  Find elapsed time.
    2.  Calculate total temperature increase.
    3.  Add increase to initial temperature.
*   It's not pure recall, as it's not asking for a definition or a direct fact.

**4. Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises (Class 6 Mathematics):**

*   **Arithmetic Operations with Word Problems:** This is very typical. Class 6 textbooks are full of word problems requiring addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in various contexts (money, measurement, time, etc.).
*   **Time Calculation:** Calculating elapsed time across AM/PM boundaries is a standard Class 5/6 topic.
*   **Rates:** While the *term* "rate" might not be introduced formally, problems involving "X per Y" (e.g., cost per item, distance per hour) are common for multiplication.
*   **Difficulty Level:** This problem is **medium difficulty** for Class 6.
    *   It's not a single-step problem.
    *   It involves two distinct steps (time calculation, then temperature calculation).
    *   The numbers are simple (2, 30).
    *   The context (temperature) is relatable.
    *   It's comparable to many "solve the following word problems" sections that often appear at the end of a chapter or as mixed practice. It's harder than a direct calculation (e.g., 30 + (6*2)) but easier than complex multi-variable or multi-unit problems.

## Estimated Proportion Correct:

Considering the analysis:

*   **Strengths:** Simple numbers, relatable context (weather), core arithmetic operations, and time calculation are foundational for Class 6. The "2 degrees per hour" is a very straightforward rate.
*   **Weaknesses:** Language barrier for "increases by" and "per hour" can be significant. The multi-step nature (first calculate time, then total increase, then final temperature) can trip up students who
