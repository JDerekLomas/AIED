Let's break down the question "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?" based on the given context of Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Specific event:** Students are expected to know *of* the Battle of Plassey (1757). This is a foundational event in Class 8 history textbooks when discussing the British Raj.
    *   **Causality:** They need to understand the concept of cause and effect in historical events.
    *   **Basic understanding of "British power" and "expansion":** This is generally covered.
    *   **Political dominance/control:** This is the core concept they need to link to the battle.
    *   **Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab:** This detail is crucial for a full explanation but might be a deeper recall point. The rubric allows for a broader explanation of "political dominance/control over Bengal."

2.  **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   **"How did... contribute to... expansion of... power...?"**: This is a fairly straightforward question structure. "Contribute to" and "expansion of power" are common phrases in historical contexts.
    *   The vocabulary is not overly complex. Words like "Battle," "Plassey," "1757," "British," "India" are likely familiar. "Contribute" might be slightly challenging for some but should be decipherable in context.
    *   **Compared to the common errors:** The question itself is grammatically simpler than some of the "explain how" or "why are lions shown" questions that seem to trip students up with their nuance or require deeper analysis. The common errors show issues with complex sentence structures and abstract concepts ("significance," "affected the lives"). This question is more direct.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Predominantly Recall:** Students need to recall the outcome and immediate consequences of the Battle of Plassey.
    *   **Some basic Reasoning/Causality:** They need to connect the *victory* to the *expansion of power*. It's not just stating facts but linking them causally. This is a basic level of historical reasoning.
    *   It is not an "application" question in the sense of applying a concept to a new scenario.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   This is a very common type of question found at the end of a chapter on the British East India Company's rise.
    *   It's a foundational event, not a nuanced interpretation.
    *   **Compared to the common errors:**
        *   "Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi": This requires understanding a complex social impact over time, which is much harder than a specific battle's immediate political outcome. The "Empty Response" suggests students don't know *what* to say, not just *how* to say it in English.
        *   "Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes? Explain": This requires knowledge of symbolism and historical context (Ashoka's pillars) which might not be directly linked to their history syllabus as a core event, and the "Ashok" answers show a partial, but incomplete/misunderstood, connection.
        *   "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign...": "Significance" is an abstract concept, requiring students to synthesize multiple facts into a broader historical meaning. This is harder than simply stating what happened after Plassey. The "Empty Response" again suggests lack of content knowledge or inability to articulate significance.

    *   The Battle of Plassey is a discrete, impactful event with a clear, direct consequence. The expected answer (British political dominance over Bengal/puppet nawab) is relatively straightforward.

**Factors making it easier:**
*   It's a key, often-emphasized event in Class 8 history.
*   The causality is direct and unambiguous.
*   The language is relatively simple and direct for an English medium history question.
*   The rubric allows for a slightly broader answer ("political dominance/control over Bengal"), not necessarily requiring the specific "Mir Jafar" detail, making it more accessible.

**Factors making it harder:**
*   Still requires recall of a specific historical event and its immediate aftermath.
*   "Contribute to" requires understanding a causal link, not just factual recall.
*   English proficiency is always a hurdle for these students.

**Considering the average pass rate of 29% and the difficulty of other Social Science questions:**
The other questions show:
*   Significant difficulty with open-ended "explain how" and "
