Let's break down the question "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning" using the provided context and examples.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Direct Knowledge:** Students are expected to have studied the Harappan Civilization (also known as Indus Valley Civilization) in their Social Science curriculum. This is a fundamental topic in ancient Indian history, typically covered in Class 6-8.
    *   **Specific Concept:** They need to recall details about its *urban planning*. This isn't just "what was Harappa?" but focuses on a specific aspect.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Harappan Civilization," "urban planning," "key feature."

2.  **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **Verbs:** "Describe." This is a straightforward command, not asking for complex analysis or comparison.
    *   **Nouns/Concepts:** "key feature," "urban planning." While "urban" might be less common than "city," "planning" is understandable.
    *   **Simplicity:** The question is relatively short and direct. There are no complex sentence structures or abstract phrasing.
    *   **Rubric Examples:** "well-planned grid layout," "advanced drainage system," "baked bricks," "citadel and lower town." These are specific, concrete concepts that can often be learned visually (from diagrams) or through rote memorization, even if the English terms are a bit challenging. The core idea (e.g., "naliya acchi thi" - drainage was good) might be present in Hindi.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Predominantly Recall:** This is a direct recall question. Students are asked to remember a specific piece of information they would have learned in class. There's no application to a new scenario or complex reasoning required.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical:** This *is* a very typical textbook exercise question. Textbooks often list "features of Harappan cities" or "characteristics of Harappan urban planning." It's a foundational "who, what, when, where" type of question, rather than a "why" or "how" that requires deeper understanding.
    *   **Comparison to Common Errors:**
        *   "Explain how colonial rule... affected tribal communities": This requires understanding cause-and-effect, analyzing societal impact, and likely involves more complex vocabulary and nuanced explanations. (Pass rate 9%)
        *   "Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes?": This goes beyond simple recall and asks for reasoning/symbolism, which can be harder to articulate. (Pass rate 10%)
        *   "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign...": Similar to the colonial rule question, "significance" implies cause-and-effect, impact, and a broader historical understanding, not just facts. (Pass rate 12%)

    *   **Key Differences:**
        *   **"Describe" vs. "Explain/Why":** "Describe" is generally easier for recall-based questions. "Explain" and "Why" demand deeper comprehension and often more elaborate, articulate answers.
        *   **Specific Fact vs. Broad Impact:** "One key feature of urban planning" is a specific factual recall. "Significance" or "how it affected" requires synthesizing multiple facts and understanding their broader implications.
        *   **Availability of Simple Answers:** For Harappan planning, a student can get it right by just stating "drainage system" or "grid streets." For the "significance of Ashoka," a single word isn't usually enough; it requires a phrase or sentence explaining *why* it was significant.

**Considering the overall context:**
*   Average pass rate for items: 29%.
*   Students from EWS, Hindi-medium, limited English.
*   "Empty Response" is a common issue for difficult questions, suggesting either lack of knowledge or inability to formulate an answer in English.

For *this specific question*, a student only needs to recall *one* feature. If they remember anything like "pakki eent" (baked bricks), "naliya" (drains), or "sadke seedhi thi" (streets were straight), they have a good chance of getting it right, even if the English isn't perfect, as long as the core concept is conveyed. The question is less demanding in terms of language articulation or complex reasoning compared to the low-pass-rate examples.

**Estimating:**

*   The topic (Harappan Civilization) is foundational.
*   The question type ("Describe one key feature") is simple recall.
*   The expected answers (drainage, bricks, grid) are concrete and
