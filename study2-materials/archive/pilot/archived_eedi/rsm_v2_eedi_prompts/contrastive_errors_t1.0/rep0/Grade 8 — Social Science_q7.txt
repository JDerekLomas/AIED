Let's break down the question "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?" based on the given context of Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Specific event:** The Battle of Plassey (1757). This is a foundational event in Class 8 history textbooks covering the British colonial period. Students would typically have studied it.
    *   **Key actors:** British East India Company, Nawab of Bengal (Siraj-ud-Daulah), Mir Jafar.
    *   **Basic concept:** Understanding of "expansion of power" in a political/territorial sense.
    *   **Causality:** The ability to link an event (Plassey) to its consequence (expansion of British power).
    *   **Comparison to other difficult questions:** The questions about "colonial rule affecting tribal communities," "lions on currency notes," and "Ashoka's reign" are all also core historical/civic topics. However, the Plassey question is more directly about a cause-and-effect relationship of a specific, well-defined historical event, which might make it slightly more straightforward than broader conceptual questions or those requiring deeper interpretation.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Keywords:** "How did... contribute to," "expansion," "British power." These are common terms in Social Science and should be somewhat familiar.
    *   **Sentence structure:** A direct "How did X contribute to Y?" question is fairly standard and not overly complex grammatically.
    *   **Required output:** Explaining a consequence. This requires a narrative or descriptive answer, which can be challenging for students with limited English to articulate precisely.
    *   **Comparison:** The language demand is similar to the "Explain how colonial rule..." or "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign..." questions. It's not a simple recall of a single fact, but requires constructing a coherent sentence or two. The sample wrong answers for other questions ("Asher' stand," "ashok a second") clearly show severe English proficiency issues, leading to nonsensical responses even when some keywords might be recognized.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Primarily Recall:** Students are expected to recall the immediate consequences of the Battle of Plassey as taught in their textbooks.
    *   **Some Reasoning/Application:** While primarily recall, it requires a slight level of reasoning to connect the *victory* at Plassey specifically to the *expansion of British power*. It's not just "What was the outcome?" but "How did it *contribute*?" This requires understanding the mechanism (e.g., control over Bengal, puppet nawab).
    *   **Comparison:** It's more direct recall/explanation than "Why are lions shown...?" which might require some application of symbolic understanding, or "Explain how colonial rule affected tribal communities" which is a broader, more analytical question.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Standard:** This is a very common type of question found at the end of chapters or as short-answer exercises in Class 8 history textbooks. It tests understanding of a pivotal event and its immediate impact.
    *   **Rubric:** The rubric ("establishing British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)") is a core understanding expected from textbook study.
    *   **Comparison:** It's likely slightly *easier* than the "Explain how colonial rule..." question, which requires synthesizing information across different aspects of tribal life under colonial rule. It's also more direct than the Ashoka question, which might invite broader answers about his moral principles rather than just political significance. The "lions" question is quite distinct, testing civic knowledge and symbolism, often proving very difficult.

**Considering the Common Errors:**
The prevalence of "Empty Response" (9-12% pass rate for other questions) is a huge factor. This suggests either a complete lack of knowledge, or a complete inability to articulate *anything* in English, or both. The nonsensical English responses like "Asher' stand" further highlight the severe language barrier for many.

However, the Battle of Plassey is *such* a central event that students are very likely to have encountered it. The directness of the cause-and-effect relationship, if understood in their native language, makes it somewhat more approachable than broader conceptual questions.

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

Given:
*   Average pass rate for Social Science items is 29%.
*   This question is a core, specific historical event.
*   The required answer (control over Bengal/puppet
