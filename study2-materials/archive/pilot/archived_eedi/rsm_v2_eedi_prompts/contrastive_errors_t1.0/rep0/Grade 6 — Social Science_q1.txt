Let's break down the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   This question assumes basic geographical knowledge of India. Class 6 Social Science textbooks in India typically introduce major physical features like mountains, rivers, plains, etc. Students would have encountered "Himalayas" and likely "Aravalli" or "Vindhya" in their geography lessons.
    *   It doesn't require deep conceptual understanding or historical analysis, unlike the "colonial rule" or "Ashoka's reign" questions. It's a direct recall of factual information.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   The language is very straightforward: "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."
    *   "Name," "two," "major," "mountain ranges," "located," "India" are all relatively common and accessible terms, even for students with limited English proficiency, especially since "mountain" and "India" are cognates or very similar in Hindi (पहाड़, भारत). "Ranges" might be slightly less common but understandable in context.
    *   There are no complex sentence structures or abstract vocabulary, unlike "Explain the significance of..." or "Explain how colonial rule affected...".
    *   This is a significant advantage compared to the other common error questions, which demand more sophisticated English comprehension and expression.

*   **Cognitive Demand (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   This is purely **recall**. Students either know the names of mountain ranges or they don't.
    *   It does not require application of concepts, analysis of events, or complex reasoning.
    *   This is much simpler than explaining cause-and-effect ("how colonial rule affected...") or historical significance ("significance of Ashoka's reign...").

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very common type of question found in end-of-chapter exercises or quick recall sections in Class 6 geography textbooks. It's a foundational knowledge check.
    *   The rubric requiring only *one* correct mountain range for a score makes it even easier, as students only need to recall one out of several possibilities (Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats). "Himalayas" is almost universally taught and remembered.

**Why this question is likely easier than the common error examples:**

*   **Direct Factual Recall vs. Explanation/Analysis:** The common error questions all demand "explain" or "why," requiring not just recall but also the ability to articulate connections, causes, and effects, often in English. This question simply asks to "name."
*   **Simple Vocabulary vs. Complex Concepts:** "Mountain ranges" is a concrete, easily visualised concept. "Colonial rule," "tribal communities," "significance," "reign" are more abstract and require understanding of historical and political contexts.
*   **Reduced English Expression Demand:** Students don't need to construct a sentence or paragraph; they just need to write down one or two names. Even if they spell it imperfectly, if recognizable, it would likely be marked correct under a lenient rubric.
*   **"Himalayas" as a High-Recall Item:** "Himalayas" is perhaps the most prominent geographical feature of India and is almost certainly taught and reinforced.

Given the average pass rate across items is 29% and the cited Social Science questions have pass rates of 9-12% (indicating they are *very* difficult), this question should perform significantly better.

**Factors pushing the estimate up:**
*   Pure recall.
*   Simple, concrete vocabulary.
*   High salience of "Himalayas."
*   Rubric only requires one correct answer.
*   Geography is a visually taught subject, aiding memory.

**Factors pushing the estimate down (but less so here):**
*   General low English proficiency.
*   Economically weaker sections (might have less exposure to resources, but basic geography is core curriculum).

Considering that students only need to name *one* and "Himalayas" is so prominent, a significant portion should be able to recall at least that.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **45%**
