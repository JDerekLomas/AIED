Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis of the Question

**Question:** A gardener has collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit. Does gardener notice any change after some days? Give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health.

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Decomposition/Composting:** Students need to understand that organic matter breaks down over time. This is a fundamental concept in Class 8 science, often covered in chapters on microorganisms, waste management, or agriculture.
*   **Role of Microorganisms:** While not explicitly asked to name them, understanding that living organisms cause the breakdown is crucial for explaining *why* changes occur.
*   **Nutrient Cycling/Soil Health:** Knowledge that decomposed organic matter enriches soil and provides nutrients (manure/compost) is essential for the "beneficial for soil health" part.
*   **Basic Observation Skills:** Recognizing that things rot or change form over time.

**2. Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**

*   **Vocabulary:** "Gardener," "collected," "waste," "plants," "vegetables," "fruits," "pit," "notice," "change," "reasons," "evaluate," "beneficial," "soil health."
    *   Most of these words are relatively common and likely encountered in daily life or basic science texts. "Evaluate" might be slightly more challenging than a simple "explain."
    *   The phrase "waste of plants, vegetables and fruits" is straightforward.
*   **Sentence Structure:** The question has two parts:
    1.  "Does gardener notice any change after some days?" (Simple yes/no with reasoning)
    2.  "Give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health." (Requires a more elaborate explanation and judgment).
*   **Overall:** The language is quite accessible compared to some of the very dense or technically specific questions that showed low pass rates (e.g., the turmeric/hibiscus experiment or pitcher plant's specific structure). There are no complex scientific terms that are likely to trip them up just by their English form.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

*   **Recall:** Students need to recall the concept of decomposition and the benefits of compost/manure.
*   **Application:** They need to apply this knowledge to a practical, real-world scenario (a gardener's pit).
*   **Reasoning:** They need to provide reasons for the observed changes and *evaluate* the benefits. This moves beyond mere recall to a slightly higher-order thinking skill, but it's still a fairly direct application of learned concepts.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Typical Textbook Exercise:** This question is very similar to common textbook exercises or practical activity discussions related to composting, waste management, or soil fertility. It's a classic example of applying science to everyday life.
*   **Contrast with Low Pass Rate Questions:**
    *   **"Pot 'A' has soil mixed with manure":** This question, despite seeming simple, might be looking for very specific details about the *effects* of manure, or perhaps the wording "manur" (typo) confused students. The given wrong answers suggest a misunderstanding of what manure *is* or its purpose, or a struggle to articulate the effect. The low pass rate here (6%) is alarming and suggests a significant gap in understanding or expression.
    *   **"Turmeric powder and hibiscus flower extract":** This is an experiment-based question on indicators (acids/bases). It requires specific recall of color changes, which can be difficult, and the setup descriptions can be dense. The wrong answers show wild guesses or misinterpretation.
    *   **"Pitcher plant":** This requires specific biological knowledge about carnivorous plants (mode of nutrition, why they trap insects despite photosynthesis). It's more specialized recall.
*   **This Question's Advantage:**
    *   **Relatability:** The scenario of a "gardener collecting waste" is extremely common and relatable in an agrarian society. Many students will have seen or participated in such activities.
    *   **Conceptual Depth:** The concept of decomposition is fairly intuitive and easily observable even without formal science education to some extent (rotting food). Formal education then provides the "why."
    *   **Open-endedness (to a degree):** While a correct answer needs specific points, there's less pressure for highly technical vocabulary than, say, naming a specific type of plant or chemical reaction. Students can describe "becomes smaller," "smelly," "darker," "good for plants," etc.
