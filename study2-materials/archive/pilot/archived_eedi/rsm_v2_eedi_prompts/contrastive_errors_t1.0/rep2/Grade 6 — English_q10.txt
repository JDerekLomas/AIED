Here's a breakdown of the question "Choose the correct word. There are (some/any) apples in the basket." in the context of Class 6 Indian government school students:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Concept of Countable Nouns:** Students need to understand that "apples" is a countable plural noun. (This is generally taught early on).
    *   **Basic Sentence Structure:** Subject-verb agreement ("There are"), prepositions ("in the basket"). These are fundamental.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "apples," "basket." These are very common and likely known.
    *   **Grammar Rule for "some" vs. "any":** This is the core knowledge required. Specifically, "some" for affirmative sentences and "any" for negative sentences or questions.

*   **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Low Lexical Demand:** All words are simple, high-frequency, and concrete. No abstract concepts or complex vocabulary.
    *   **Low Syntactic Demand:** The sentence structure is a basic declarative statement.
    *   **Focus on a Specific Grammatical Rule:** The question directly tests a common and relatively straightforward grammatical distinction. This is an advantage compared to open-ended writing tasks.
    *   **No Reading Comprehension of a Passage:** Unlike the poem questions, there's no need to infer meaning or understand literary devices.
    *   **Minimal Writing Required:** It's a multiple-choice/selection task, not an extended writing response. This significantly reduces the cognitive load and potential for "Empty Response" or off-topic answers due to writing difficulties.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall & Application:** It primarily requires students to *recall* the rule for "some" vs. "any" and then *apply* it to a simple, unambiguous sentence. There's very little "reasoning" beyond identifying the sentence type (affirmative).

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Very Common Exercise Type:** This exact type of fill-in-the-blanks or "choose the correct word" for "some/any" is extremely common in elementary English grammar textbooks. It's foundational.
    *   **Simpler than Open-Ended Questions:** Much simpler than "Describe the poet's writing style" (which requires understanding complex vocabulary like "describes," "poet's," "writing style," and abstract thinking) or "Write a theme..." (requires abstract conceptualization and coherent paragraph writing).
    *   **Less Ambiguous:** The sentence "There are ____ apples in the basket" is a clear affirmative statement, making the choice between "some" and "any" quite clear for someone who knows the rule. There's no nuance or trickery.

**Why this question is likely easier than the examples provided:**

The "COMMON ERRORS" examples highlight issues with:
1.  **Complex Vocabulary/Abstract Concepts:** "describes," "poet's writing style," "theme," "central idea."
2.  **Open-Ended Writing Tasks:** "Write a short paragraph..." leads to issues with sentence construction, grammar, and staying on topic even if the general idea is understood.
3.  **Lack of Specific Prior Knowledge for Complex Tasks:** Many students simply don't have the conceptual understanding or language skills to fulfill the demands of these tasks.

In contrast, "Choose the correct word. There are (some/any) apples in the basket." is:
*   **Highly Specific and Targeted:** Tests one single grammar rule.
*   **Simple Vocabulary and Sentence Structure:** No abstract concepts.
*   **Selection Task:** Reduces writing burden.
*   **Commonly Practiced:** This rule is drilled extensively in basic grammar.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%):**

The 29% average pass rate is for *all items*, including the very difficult ones mentioned. This question is significantly easier than those.

**Potential Pitfalls (but less severe):**
*   **Guessing:** If a student has no idea, they have a 50% chance of being correct by guessing.
*   **Rote Learning Failure:** If the "some/any" rule was taught purely by rote and not fully understood, or if it was forgotten.

Given its simplicity, directness, and commonality in basic English instruction, this question should perform considerably better than the 29% average. It requires a very basic and frequently taught grammar point.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 60%**
