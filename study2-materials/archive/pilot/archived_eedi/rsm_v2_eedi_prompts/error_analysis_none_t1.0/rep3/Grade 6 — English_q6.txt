Let's break down the likely errors for Class 6 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections with limited English.

**I. Analyzing Likely Errors:**

This question, while seemingly simple for a native English speaker, presents multiple layers of complexity for the target demographic.

**A. Misconceptions about English / Language Misunderstandings:**

1.  **"Which line...?" - Understanding "Which":**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might interpret "which" as "what" in a broader sense, leading them to describe the *whole poem* or *a general feeling* rather than a specific line. They might not grasp the requirement of *selection*.
    *   **Misunderstanding:** The concept of "line" itself might be tricky. Is it a sentence? A phrase? A visual line break? Given the prevalence of rote learning, they might just pick *any* sentence they remember.

2.  **"...from the poem..." - Identifying the Source:**
    *   **Misconception:** While they would likely know the poem was just read/studied, they might struggle to *quote* accurately. They might paraphrase poorly or mix lines.
    *   **Misunderstanding:** Some might not even connect the question directly to *the poem* they just heard/read, especially if it's a general comprehension question in a test paper with multiple sections.

3.  **"...do you like the most..." - Expressing Personal Preference:**
    *   **Misconception:** In many traditional Indian educational settings, expressing personal preference or subjective opinions is less common than factual recall. Students might be uncomfortable or unfamiliar with this type of question. They might default to what they *think* the teacher wants to hear, or a socially acceptable "good" answer.
    *   **Misunderstanding:** "Like the most" might be simplified to just "like." The nuance of "most" (implying comparison and selection) could be lost.

4.  **"...and why?" - Providing Justification:**
    *   **Misconception:** This is arguably the biggest hurdle. Explaining "why" requires higher-order thinking, analytical skills, and crucially, the *vocabulary* to articulate abstract reasons (e.g., "it made me feel happy," "it was about courage," "the words were beautiful").
    *   **Misunderstanding:** Students might confuse "why" with "what happened" in that line. They might simply rephrase the line, or offer a very simplistic, one-word answer (e.g., "good," "nice"). They might not understand that the "why" needs to *justify* their liking.

**B. Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**

*   **Attempt but fail:** This is the most likely scenario. Very few students would completely leave it blank unless they understood absolutely nothing. The keywords "like" and "poem" might trigger some attempt.
*   **Not attempt at all:** Possibly for students with extremely low English proficiency or those who panic and don't recognize any familiar words. However, the question structure is relatively straightforward compared to complex analytical tasks.

**C. Most Common Wrong Answer Look-Alikes:**

1.  **Just the line, no "why":** Students identify a line but fail to provide any justification, or provide a very weak, irrelevant one.
    *   *Example:* "I like the line 'The little bird flew high.'" (No 'why')
    *   *Example:* "I like the line 'The little bird flew high.' Good." (Minimal 'why')

2.  **General statement about the poem, not a specific line:** Students talk about the poem's theme or overall message instead of quoting a line.
    *   *Example:* "I like the poem because it is about a bird." (No line, just general liking)

3.  **Incorrectly quoted/paraphrased line with a weak "why":** Students recall a line poorly and then struggle with the justification.
    *   *Example:* "I like bird flying. It is nice." (Poor line recall, weak 'why')

4.  **Focus on "like" with minimal or no reference to the poem/line:** Students interpret "like" as a general positive sentiment.
    *   *Example:* "I like this poem very much." (Doesn't quote a line or explain why)

5.  **Direct translation/simplistic "why":** Students use very basic English, often struggling with grammar and vocabulary for the "why."
    *   *Example:* "I like 'sun shine'. It is happy." (Grammatically incorrect, very basic justification)

**II. Estimating the Pass Rate:**

Given the average pass rate of 29% for general subjects, this specific question is particularly challenging due to the subjective nature
