Let's break down the likely student responses and errors for this question.

**Target Students:** Class 7, Indian government schools, mostly economically weaker sections, limited English. Average pass rate ~29%.

**Question:** Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason.
**Rubric:** The king wanted to answer (based on the reading passage) the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with. Any valid reason. Max score: 1

**Analysis of Likely Errors and Student Behavior:**

1.  **Misconceptions about English / Language Misunderstandings:**

    *   **"Do you think..." misunderstanding:** Many students, especially those with limited exposure to direct questions requiring personal opinion, might struggle with the "Do you think" part. They might interpret it as a factual question *about* the king's questions from the story, rather than *their opinion* on their real-life relevance.
    *   **"Important in real life" - Abstract Concept:** The phrase "important in real life" is quite abstract for this age group and language level. They might struggle to connect the fictional king's dilemma to their own lived experience or the broader world. They might understand "important" but not "real life" in this context.
    *   **"Reason" - Expressing Causality:** Providing a coherent "reason" in English is a significant hurdle. They might understand *what* the king wanted to know, but formulating "because it helps us..." or "so that we can..." might be beyond their current linguistic ability. They might just state a fact from the passage instead of a reason for importance.
    *   **Vocabulary Gaps:** While "important" and "king" are likely known, words like "real life" (as an abstract concept) and "reason" (in the sense of explanation) might be tricky for some.
    *   **Grammar/Syntax Issues:** Even if they have the ideas, constructing a grammatically correct sentence to express them will be a major challenge. Subject-verb agreement, tense, prepositions, and sentence structure will likely be incorrect.

2.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

    *   **High Attempt Rate:** Most students will attempt this question because it uses relatively common words ("king," "questions," "important") and asks for a simple "yes/no" type response initially. They might also feel pressured to write *something*.
    *   **Failure in Attempt:** While attempting, a large number will fail due to the reasons above. They might write something vaguely related but not directly addressing the prompt or providing a valid reason.

3.  **Most Common Wrong Answers:**

    *   **Simply stating "Yes" or "No" without a reason:** This will be very common. They understand the first part of the question but fail on the second.
    *   **Reciting parts of the story:** Many will revert to recounting what the king wanted to know ("King wants to know right time, right person, right thing"). This shows recall of the passage but not an understanding of the *importance in real life* or the ability to give a *reason*.
    *   **Generic praise for the king/questions:** "King's questions are good." "King is smart." This is a common coping mechanism when they don't fully understand the prompt.
    *   **Simple agreement without elaboration:** "Yes, it is important." (Still missing the reason).
    *   **Completely irrelevant answers:** Some might write about something else entirely, or just copy parts of the passage that are not relevant to the question.
    *   **Grammatically incoherent sentences:** Attempts to provide a reason might result in a string of words that don't form a clear thought. Example: "Yes. King ask time person work." (Missing "is," "right," "do," "to," and connection to "real life importance").

**Detailed Breakdown of Expected Responses (and their scores):**

*   **0 Marks (Majority):**
    *   "Yes." or "No." (No reason)
    *   "King wants to know right time." (Factual recall, no real-life connection or reason)
    *   "King questions are good." (Generic, no reason)
    *   "King ask good questions." (Generic, no reason)
    *   "Yes. Time person work." (Incomplete, ungrammatical, missing the "why important" link)
    *   "Yes. Right time right person right thing to do." (Recap of king's questions, not a reason for *importance*)
    *   Completely irrelevant answers.
    *   Blank/No attempt (though likely low for this question).
