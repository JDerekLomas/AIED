Let's break down the likely errors for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and the nature of the question.

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science:**

*   **Lack of Causal Understanding:** Many students, especially at this level, struggle with understanding cause-and-effect relationships in history. They might memorize facts (Battle of Plassey in 1757, British won) but fail to connect *how* one event led to another. They might see it as "British won, so they became powerful" without explaining the mechanism.
*   **Focus on Military Victory Only:** Students might primarily think of "power" in terms of military strength. While the victory was military, the *contribution to expansion* requires understanding the political and economic implications beyond just winning a battle.
*   **Vagueness about "Expansion of Power":** What does "expansion of power" mean to them? It might be very abstract. They might just think "British became more powerful" without specifying *how* or *where*.
*   **Superficial Knowledge:** They might know the name of Mir Jafar or Siraj-ud-Daulah, but not understand their roles or the significance of a "puppet nawab."
*   **Eurocentric/Colonial Narrative Echoes:** While the curriculum aims to be balanced, the sheer volume of colonial history can sometimes lead to an uncritical acceptance of British dominance as an inevitable "rise" rather than a consequence of specific events and strategies.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Contribute to":** This phrase can be tricky. It requires understanding how one thing *helps bring about* another. Students might struggle with the nuance compared to simpler questions like "What happened after...?" or "Who won...?"
*   **"Expansion of British power":** While "British power" is relatively clear, "expansion" might be understood in a very literal, geographical sense, without grasping the political and economic dimensions.
*   **"Rubric language" (e.g., "political dominance," "control over Bengal," "puppet nawab"):** These terms are sophisticated. While the answer doesn't need to use these exact terms, understanding the *concept* behind them is crucial. Students might use simpler, less precise language.
*   **General English Comprehension:** Even common words might be challenging for students with limited English exposure, especially in a formal academic context.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **Attempt but Fail:** Most students will likely attempt the question, as it's a significant historical event covered in their syllabus. However, their attempts will often be superficial or lack the specific causal link required by the rubric.
*   **Not Attempt at All:** A smaller percentage might not attempt it if they feel they have absolutely no idea or cannot understand the question, but given its prominence, this would be less common than a poor attempt.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer:**

The most common wrong answer would likely be:

*   **"The British won the Battle of Plassey and became powerful."** (Lacks specific mechanism, just states victory and power).
*   **"The British defeated Siraj-ud-Daulah and expanded their control."** (Slightly better, but "expanded their control" is still vague without mentioning *where* or *how* beyond the military victory).
*   **"It helped the British gain more land/territory."** (Focuses too much on direct territorial annexation, missing the political dominance through a puppet ruler).
*   **Listing facts:** "The Battle of Plassey was fought in 1757. Robert Clive was involved. The British won." (Fails to answer the "how it contributed" aspect).
*   **Confusing with other events:** Students might mix up details with other battles or treaties.

**Analysis against Rubric:**

The rubric asks for explaining that the victory led to "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)." This requires more than just stating "British became powerful." It demands understanding the *mechanism* of that expansion.

Given the typical level of understanding of Class 8 students from these backgrounds, particularly concerning nuanced historical causation and specialized vocabulary, a significant number would struggle to articulate this precise causal link. They'd likely get stuck at "British won, British became powerful."

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for these students, and the specific demands of this question (causal explanation, understanding political manipulation beyond simple military victory), I would estimate a lower pass rate than the average for this specific question.

I would estimate that only a minority would clearly articulate the political dominance over Bengal or the concept of a puppet nawab. Many would provide general answers about
