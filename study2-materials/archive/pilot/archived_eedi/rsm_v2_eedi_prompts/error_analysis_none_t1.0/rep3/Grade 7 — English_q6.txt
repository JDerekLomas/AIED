Let's break down the potential errors for this question among Class 7 students in Indian government schools from economically weaker sections.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **"Describes" Misunderstanding:**
    *   **Misconception:** Many students might not fully grasp the meaning of "describes." They might interpret it as "what is the poet doing?" or "what is the poem about?" rather than "what kind of words would you use to characterize the *style*?"
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** "Describes" is a common verb, but its specific nuance in this context (asking for an *adjective* characterizing a *style*) can be tricky. They might think "describes" means "tells about" and then just summarize the poem's content.

2.  **"Poet's Writing Style" Misunderstanding:**
    *   **Misconception:** This is the core difficulty. "Writing style" is an abstract concept. Students might confuse it with:
        *   The *topic* of the poem (e.g., "nature," "love").
        *   The *emotions* conveyed in the poem (e.g., "sad," "happy").
        *   The *form* of the poem (e.g., "rhyming," "stanza").
        *   The *moral* of the poem.
        *   The *effect* of the poem on them (e.g., "interesting," "boring").
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** "Style" itself might be understood in a very general sense (like fashion style) rather than literary style. "Writing style" as a compound noun referring to *how* something is written is quite advanced for this level, especially with limited exposure to literary analysis.

3.  **Lack of Appropriate Vocabulary:**
    *   Even if they understand "writing style," they might lack the specific adjectives required by the rubric (simple, descriptive, informal, direct, vivid, intricate, complex, formal, emotional, engaging, etc.). Their vocabulary for literary analysis is likely very limited.
    *   They might default to very general positive or negative adjectives if they try to describe it (e.g., "good," "nice," "bad").

4.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **Attempt but Fail:** Most students will attempt. They will try to write *something* because they recognize words like "poet" and "writing." However, their answers will likely miss the mark due to the misunderstandings above. They won't leave it blank unless they truly have no idea what any of the words mean.
    *   **Not Attempt at All:** A smaller percentage, those with very low English proficiency, might be intimidated by the phrase "writing style" and not attempt, fearing they don't know the answer.

5.  **Most Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   **Summarizing the poem's content:** "He writes about trees." "It is about nature." "The poet talks about his village."
    *   **Describing the *theme* or *topic*:** "Nature." "Love." "Friendship."
    *   **Describing the *feeling* or *emotion* conveyed:** "Sad." "Happy." "Emotional." "Touching."
    *   **Generic positive/negative adjectives related to their experience:** "Good." "Interesting." "Beautiful." "Nice." "Enjoyable." (These are describing their *reaction*, not the *style*.)
    *   **Describing the *form*:** "Rhyming." "Has stanzas." (Closer, but not about *style* of language use.)
    *   **Misinterpreting "style" as "habit":** "He writes daily." "He writes in English."

**Implications for Pass Rate:**

Given these significant hurdles, the pass rate will be very low.

*   The core concept of "writing style" is sophisticated.
*   The required vocabulary for describing style is likely absent.
*   The common misunderstandings lead to answers that are fundamentally off-topic for the rubric.

Even "simple" as an acceptable answer requires understanding "style" and then having "simple" in their active vocabulary for description. Many might use "easy" instead of "simple" (which might be accepted depending on marker discretion, but "simple" for style is more precise).

**Revised Pass Rate Estimation:**

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for general questions, this specific question is significantly harder due to its abstract nature and specialized vocabulary.

*   A student might get it right by sheer luck (e.g., they happened to read a critique of a poet as "simple").
*   A few might have excellent teachers who introduced such concepts.
*   Many who attempt
