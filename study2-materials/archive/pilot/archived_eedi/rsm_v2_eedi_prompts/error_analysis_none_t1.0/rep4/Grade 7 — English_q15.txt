Let's break down the likely errors for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, mostly from EWS backgrounds with limited English, attempting the "My Favourite Hobby" paragraph question.

**Anticipated Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Understanding "Paragraph":**
    *   **Misconception:** Many might not grasp the concept of a "paragraph" as a cohesive unit of related sentences. They might write bullet points, a list of sentences that are disconnected, or just one long sentence.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** "Paragraph" is an academic term. While they might have heard it, applying it practically, especially in English, could be difficult.
    *   **Attempt/Fail:** Most would attempt to write *something*, but fail to structure it as a paragraph.

2.  **Sentence Structure and Cohesion (4-5 sentences):**
    *   **Misconception:** Stringing together simple sentences without proper conjunctions, transition words, or logical flow.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** Lack of vocabulary for connectors (e.g., "because," "and," "but," "also," "when," "so"). Difficulty forming complex or compound sentences.
    *   **Attempt/Fail:** They will write sentences, but they might not add up to 4-5 *meaningful* and *connected* sentences. Some might write just 2-3 very short sentences.

3.  **Understanding "Favourite Hobby":**
    *   **Misconception:** Some might not grasp "favourite" (they might just state *a* hobby, not their *most liked*). "Hobby" itself might be understood simply as "something I do for fun," rather than a regular, enjoyable activity.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** Simple translation might lead to "pasandida kaam" (liked work), which might include chores if they frame it that way.
    *   **Attempt/Fail:** Most will identify *some* activity, even if it's not strictly a hobby (e.g., "studying").

4.  **Addressing the Specific Prompts ("what it is, when you do it, why you enjoy it"):**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might pick up on one or two parts but miss the others. For example, they might state the hobby and when they do it, but omit "why I enjoy it," or give a very generic reason.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** "Why you enjoy it" requires expressing feelings and reasons, which demands more advanced vocabulary and sentence structures (e.g., "I enjoy it because it makes me happy," "It helps me relax").
    *   **Attempt/Fail:** This is where many will fail to meet the "complete paragraph" part of the rubric. They might answer one or two points but miss the third, or answer them very poorly.

5.  **Basic English Grammar and Vocabulary:**
    *   **Misconception:** Incorrect verb tenses (e.g., present continuous instead of simple present for habitual action), subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect prepositions, limited vocabulary to describe the hobby or feelings.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** Direct translation from their native language often leads to grammatically incorrect English. Limited exposure to diverse vocabulary.
    *   **Attempt/Fail:** Even if they attempt, the numerous grammatical errors might obscure meaning, making it difficult to score.

6.  **Not Attempting at All:**
    *   A small percentage might not attempt if they feel completely overwhelmed by the English or the task of writing a paragraph. However, given it's a relatively simple prompt, most will try *something*.

**Most Common Wrong Answer Look:**

*   **Structure:** A few disconnected, very short sentences. Possibly just a list.
*   **Content:**
    *   "My favourite hobby is playing cricket." (Addresses "what it is")
    *   "I play cricket everyday evening." (Addresses "when you do it")
    *   "I like cricket very much." (Weakly addresses "why you enjoy it," if at all)
*   **Errors:**
    *   Grammar: "I play cricket everyday evening." (Should be "every evening" or "every day in the evening")
    *   Vocabulary: Limited descriptive words.
    *   No true paragraph structure.
    *   Missing one of the key elements (e.g., "why I enjoy it" might be absent or extremely brief/generic).

**Pass Rate Estimation:**

Considering the average pass rate for similar tasks is 29%, and analyzing the specific challenges:

*   **"Complete paragraph"**: This is a major hurdle. Many will write sentences but not a cohesive paragraph.
*   **"Clearly mentions all three
