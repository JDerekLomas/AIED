Let's break down the potential student experience with this sentence rearrangement task.

**Understanding the Target Audience:**

*   **Class 6 Indian Government School Students:**
    *   **Economically Weaker Sections:** Often means less exposure to English outside school, potentially limited resources (books, media).
    *   **Limited English:** Grammatical structures, vocabulary, and sentence construction will be basic. They've likely been exposed to simple present, present continuous, and simple past, but applying rules consistently can be a challenge.
    *   **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is a crucial indicator. It suggests that even relatively straightforward questions can be difficult, and many students struggle significantly with the subject matter.

**Analyzing the Question:**

*   **Words:** book, reading, a, is, he
*   **Target Sentence:** He is reading a book. (Subject-Verb-Object)
*   **Key Grammatical Concepts Involved:**
    *   Subject pronoun ("he")
    *   Auxiliary verb ("is")
    *   Main verb (present participle - "reading")
    *   Article ("a")
    *   Noun ("book")
    *   Standard English SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) word order.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Lack of SVO Understanding (Most Common & Critical):**
    *   Students might not instinctively understand that a sentence *must* start with a subject, followed by a verb. They might not have internalized this rule for English.
    *   They might try to arrange words based on what "sounds okay" to them in their native language context, which might not map to English SVO.

2.  **Confusion with Auxiliary Verb Position:**
    *   While "is" is common, students might place it incorrectly. They might put "is he reading a book" (interrogative structure, even if they don't mean it) or "reading is he a book."

3.  **Confusion with "a" (Article):**
    *   They might place "a" before "reading" or "he" instead of "book." "a reading book" or "a he" are possibilities, though less likely than other errors.

4.  **Influence of Native Language (L1 Interference):**
    *   Many Indian languages have different word orders (e.g., SOV - Subject-Object-Verb is common in Hindi). If a student tries to mentally translate and reorder, it could lead to "He book reading is" or similar structures, especially if they are trying to fit "is" (है) at the end.
    *   They might prioritize placing the main action ("reading") earlier in the sentence if that's more natural in their L1.

5.  **Vocabulary/Meaning Focus Over Grammar:**
    *   They understand "he," "book," "reading." They might try to combine these three core elements first, neglecting the auxiliary verb or article placement. This could lead to "He reading book" or "Book he reading."

6.  **Guessing/Random Arrangement:**
    *   If they are completely lost, they might just write the words in the order they heard them, or a random permutation.

7.  **Not Attempting at All:**
    *   Given the low pass rate, some students might simply look at the jumbled words and not even try to form a sentence, especially if they find it overwhelming or don't understand the instructions "rearrange to make a meaningful sentence." (Though "meaningful sentence" is fairly straightforward).

**Most Common Wrong Answers:**

Based on these errors, the most common wrong answers would likely look like:

*   **"He reading a book is."** (L1 interference, placing verb/auxiliary at end)
*   **"He book reading is."** (L1 interference, S-O-V structure, trying to include all key words)
*   **"Reading he a book is."** (Focus on main verb first, trying to make sense)
*   **"Book reading is he."** (Random, or trying to start with a known noun)
*   **"He is a book reading."** (Misplacing the article)
*   **"He reading a book."** (Missing the auxiliary "is" entirely, or assuming it's implied)

**Why students would attempt but fail:**

*   This question is clearly designed to be attempted. It's not a complex paragraph or difficult vocabulary. Students will recognize the individual words.
*   The instruction is simple: "Rearrange."
*   The primary reason for failure will be a lack of firm grasp on basic English sentence structure (SVO, auxiliary verb placement). They will try to make *
