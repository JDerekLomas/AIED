Let's break down the likely student responses to the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

1.  **Misconceptions about Social Science (Geography specific):**
    *   **Lack of Specific Knowledge:** The most fundamental issue. Many students, especially those with limited exposure to formal geography beyond a very basic level, might simply not know the names of specific mountain ranges. They might know "mountains exist," but not their designated names.
    *   **Confusion with States/Cities/Rivers:** Students might substitute other geographical features they *do* know. For example, they might name a major state (e.g., "Uttar Pradesh"), a large city (e.g., "Delhi"), or a prominent river (e.g., "Ganga") because they are also "major" things in India. This shows an attempt to answer but a lack of specific category knowledge.
    *   **Regional Bias:** Students might only know a mountain range close to their own region, if any. If they are from the plains, they might have less exposure to mountainous regions.
    *   **Misunderstanding "Major":** While the rubric only requires one correct, some might overthink "major" and hesitate if they only know smaller local hills. However, for Class 6, even basic knowledge of Himalayas would usually satisfy this.
    *   **Hill vs. Mountain Range:** Some might confuse individual hills with actual "ranges." This is less likely to be a *primary* error for "Himalayas," but could be for other, less prominent ranges.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Major":** While understood broadly, some might interpret it as "most important" rather than just "large/well-known." This isn't a significant barrier, however.
    *   **"Mountain Ranges":** This term itself could be an issue. If they only know "pahad" (mountain/hill) and not the concept of a "range" (shrankhala), they might struggle to recall named ranges. However, "Himalayas" is often taught as a singular entity.
    *   **"Located in India":** This is generally straightforward.

3.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **High Attempt Rate:** Most students would likely attempt this question, even if their answer is incorrect. It's a direct recall question, not requiring complex reasoning. Students usually try to write *something*.
    *   **Guessing:** Many will guess if they don't know. The guesses will often be other significant Indian geographical features or places.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   **Geographical Feature Substitution:** As mentioned, naming a major state (e.g., "Rajasthan," "Madhya Pradesh"), a major city (e.g., "Mumbai," "Chennai"), or a major river (e.g., "Yamuna," "Godavari"). This indicates they are trying to provide "major Indian things" but not the specific category requested.
    *   **Generic Terms:** Simply writing "mountains" or "hills" without a specific name.
    *   **Local, Non-Major Hills:** Naming a very local hill that isn't a major range. (Less common than substitutions).
    *   **Blank:** Some will leave it blank if they genuinely have no idea or are too intimidated to guess.

**Revised Analysis Considering Average Pass Rate (29% for a full question):**

The rubric here is quite lenient: "Names one correct mountain range." This means they don't need both, and any of the major ones count. This significantly boosts the potential pass rate compared to needing two.

*   **Himalayas:** This is by far the most likely correct answer. It's prominent, widely taught, and almost synonymous with "mountains in India." If a student knows *any* mountain range, it will almost certainly be the Himalayas.
*   **Other Ranges (Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western/Eastern Ghats):** Knowing these is less common for Class 6, especially if their curriculum or regional focus doesn't emphasize them. However, a significant minority might know one of these.

Given the average pass rate of 29% for *full* questions, and the lenient rubric here (0.5 for one correct answer), we need to consider how many students would at least recall the Himalayas.

*   **Students who will get it right (at least one):** This group will primarily consist of those who have specifically learned about the Himalayas and possibly one or two others.
*   **Students who will get it wrong (no correct answer):** This group will give substitutes (states, cities, rivers), generic answers ("mountains"), or leave it blank
