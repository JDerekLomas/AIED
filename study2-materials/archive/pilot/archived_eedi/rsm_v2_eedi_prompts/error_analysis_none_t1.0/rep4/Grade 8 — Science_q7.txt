Let's break down the likely errors for Class 8 students in Indian government schools tackling this question.

**Analysis of Errors:**

**1. Misconceptions about Science:**

*   **Lack of understanding of Decomposition:** This is the core scientific concept being tested. Students might not fully grasp that organic matter breaks down. They might see it as just "sitting there" or "rotting" without understanding the process of decomposition by microorganisms.
*   **Ignorance of Microorganisms' Role:** Even if they know "rotting" occurs, they might not attribute it to bacteria and fungi. They might think it's just a natural decay without an agent.
*   **Limited Knowledge of Nutrient Cycling:** Connecting decomposition to "beneficial for soil health" requires understanding that nutrients are released back into the soil. This might be a leap for many.
*   **Focus on "Smell" or "Insects" rather than "Reduction in Volume":** While smell is a change, it doesn't demonstrate the scientific understanding of decomposition as effectively as a reduction in volume or a change in texture. They might also incorrectly attribute the smell to the plants "going bad" rather than decomposition.
*   **Confusion with "Waste Disposal":** Some might simply think of it as a way to get rid of waste, without the deeper understanding of its beneficial outcome.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Notice any change":** This is straightforward, but the *type* of change they focus on will be crucial. Will it be physical appearance, smell, or a more scientific understanding of volume reduction?
*   **"Give reasons":** This requires articulation of the decomposition process, which is where scientific vocabulary (even in Hindi) might be limited.
*   **"Evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health":** "Evaluate" might be a slightly more complex verb. "Beneficial for soil health" is fairly clear, but connecting *how* it's beneficial (nutrients, humus) will be the challenge.
*   **Technical terms:** Even if taught in Hindi, terms like "decomposition," "microorganisms," "nutrients," "humus" might not be firmly embedded in their vocabulary or understanding.
*   **Passive voice/Abstract concepts:** The question is fairly direct, but discussing processes like decomposition requires moving beyond concrete observations.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **Attempt:** Most students would likely attempt this question. It's about a relatable scenario (gardening, waste).
*   **Partial Attempt:** Many would attempt partially, perhaps stating "Yes, there will be a change" and maybe mentioning smell, but struggle with "reasons" and "evaluation of benefit."
*   **Incomplete Attempt:** Some might only state "Yes" and nothing else, showing a lack of deeper understanding or inability to articulate it.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer Look Like:**

*   **"Yes, it will smell bad."** (Focus on an obvious sensory change, but not a scientific reason for decomposition or its benefit).
*   **"Yes, it will rot/spoil."** (Uses a colloquial term without explaining the *why* or the *how* it benefits).
*   **"Yes, there will be insects."** (Another observational change, but not linking to decomposition's beneficial outcome).
*   **"Yes, it will become dirt."** (Simplistic, lacks the process).
*   **"Yes, it is good for the plants."** (Correct conclusion, but without a reason).
*   **A "Yes" followed by no or very weak reasons/benefits.**

**Estimating the Pass Rate (0.5 max score):**

To get 0.5, the student needs to suggest the gardener will notice *significant changes* (implying decomposition, not just smell) and ideally some hint of the *reason* or *benefit*. A mere "yes, it will smell" wouldn't cut it.

Considering:

*   **Economically weaker sections, limited English:** This suggests a reliance on Hindi instruction, which may or may not cover these concepts in depth, or the vocabulary needed to articulate them.
*   **Average pass rate of 29% for the whole paper:** This question is likely mid-difficulty.
*   **Core concept of decomposition:** This is fundamental but often poorly understood beyond a superficial level.
*   **Articulating reasons and benefits:** This is the highest hurdle.

Given these factors, while most will attempt, very few will provide a sufficiently detailed and scientifically sound answer to meet the rubric's expectation for even half marks. Many will get only observational changes or very vague benefits.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT (0.5 score): 10-15%**

*   **10%** for
