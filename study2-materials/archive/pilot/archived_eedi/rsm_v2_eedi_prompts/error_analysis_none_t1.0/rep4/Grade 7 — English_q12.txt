Let's break down the likely errors for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and typical English proficiency.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Fundamental Lack of Understanding of "Voice":** Many students will not conceptually understand what "active" and "passive" voice mean. They might have been taught rules without grasping the underlying shift in focus (doer vs. receiver of action).
    *   **Result:** Blind application of remembered patterns, or just rewording without changing voice.

2.  **Vocabulary/Verb Forms:**
    *   **"Blew" (Past Simple) to "Blown" (Past Participle):** This is a critical hurdle. Irregular past participles are often difficult. Students might use "blewed" (common overgeneralization), "blowed," or simply retain "blew."
    *   **"Away":** While simpler, some might struggle to integrate it correctly.

3.  **Auxiliary Verb Usage ( "to be" + Past Participle):**
    *   **Tense Confusion:** The original sentence is in the past tense ("blew"). The passive voice requires the past tense of "to be" ("were"). Students might use "are," "is," or "was" (if they confuse singular/plural with "leaves").
    *   **Missing Auxiliary:** Some might just put "The leaves blown away..."
    *   **Incorrect Auxiliary:** Using "has," "had," "did," etc.

4.  **Identifying Subject/Object:**
    *   **Subject-Object Swap:** While simpler for this sentence, some might struggle to correctly identify "the leaves" as the new subject and "the wind" as the agent.

5.  **Preposition "by":**
    *   **Missing "by":** A common omission.
    *   **Incorrect Preposition:** Using "from," "with," etc.

6.  **Sentence Structure (Word Order):**
    *   Even if they get some elements right, the correct word order ("The leaves were blown away by the wind") can be challenging. They might put "by the wind" too early or too late.

**Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**

*   **Attempt but Fail (Most Common):** Given it's a "change the sentence" question, most will attempt something. They'll try to rearrange words or change a few, even if they don't fully understand the grammar. Blank answers would be less common unless they genuinely have no clue what "voice" means or are intimidated by English writing.
*   **Not Attempt at All (Less Common but Possible):** If the concept of "voice" is entirely alien and they haven't learned any rules, or if they find the sentence structure too complex to manipulate.

**What would the most common wrong answer look like?**

Considering the above, here are a few likely candidates for common wrong answers, often combining several errors:

1.  **Focusing on rearranging without correct verb form/auxiliary:**
    *   "The leaves blew away by the wind." (Kept "blew," added "by the wind")
    *   "The leaves blow away by the wind." (Changed tense incorrectly, kept "by the wind")

2.  **Incorrect auxiliary verb and/or past participle:**
    *   "The leaves are blown away by the wind." (Wrong auxiliary tense)
    *   "The leaves was blown away by the wind." (Singular "was" with plural "leaves")
    *   "The leaves blown away by the wind." (Missing auxiliary)

3.  **Missing "by the wind" entirely, or struggling with "blown":**
    *   "The leaves were blew away." (Correct auxiliary but incorrect past participle)
    *   "The leaves were blowed away." (Common error for past participle)

**Likely Most Common Wrong Answer:**

I predict variations of **"The leaves blew away by the wind."** or **"The leaves are blown away by the wind."**

*   The first one shows they identified the object and tried to add "by the wind," but failed to change the verb form or add the auxiliary. This is a very direct, literal rearrangement attempt.
*   The second shows an attempt at "to be" + Past Participle but with a tense error ("are" instead of "were"). Many students are taught "is/am/are" passive constructions more frequently than "was/were."

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**

Given the students' background (EWS, limited English), average pass rate of 29% for general questions, and the specific difficulties of irregular verbs, auxiliary verbs, and
