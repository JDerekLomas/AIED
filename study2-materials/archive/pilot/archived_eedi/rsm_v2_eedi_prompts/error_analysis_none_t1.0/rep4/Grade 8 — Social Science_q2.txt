Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science/History:**

*   **Lack of Specific Knowledge:** The most fundamental issue. While "Harappan Civilization" might be a familiar term, specific features like "urban planning" might not be deeply ingrained. Students might have a general idea of ancient India but lack the detail needed to answer this question.
*   **Focus on Other Aspects:** Students might recall other aspects of Harappan civilization (e.g., their seals, agriculture, decline) and mistakenly bring those up instead of urban planning.
*   **Difficulty with "Key Feature":** Even if they know a few things, identifying *one key feature* related to *urban planning* requires a certain level of synthesis and understanding of what constitutes "key." They might list something that's true but not central to *urban planning* (e.g., they grew wheat).
*   **Reliance on Rote Memorization (and failure of it):** History in these contexts often involves rote memorization. If they haven't explicitly memorized "urban planning features," they'll struggle. There might not be a deeper conceptual understanding to fall back on.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Key Feature":** While "key" (मुख्य) is a common word, combining it with "feature" (विशेषता) in an academic context might be tricky for some. They might understand "feature" but miss the emphasis on "key" and provide any true but less significant detail.
*   **"Harappan Civilization":** This term itself might be recognized, but the specific details associated with it could be muddled with other ancient civilizations if not clearly distinguished.
*   **"Urban Planning":** This is the most crucial term and potentially the biggest hurdle.
    *   "Urban" (शहरी) might be understood, but "planning" (नियोजन) when applied to cities in a historical context, might not be immediately intuitive or linked to physical layout.
    *   They might interpret "planning" too broadly, thinking about social structure or economic activities rather than physical city design.
    *   The combination "urban planning" might be an unfamiliar academic phrase, even if individual words are known.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **Attempt but Fail:** This is highly likely. Students will recognize "Harappan Civilization" and likely write *something*.
    *   They might recall a vague detail that isn't related to urban planning (e.g., "they were ancient people," "they traded").
    *   They might list multiple things, hoping one hits the mark, but none are about urban planning.
    *   They might provide a very general statement like "their cities were good" without specific features.
    *   They might write about agriculture or the Indus River.
*   **Not Attempt at all:** Less likely for this question, as "Harappan Civilization" is a prominent topic. Most would try to write something, even if it's incorrect or irrelevant. A complete blank might occur if they truly draw a blank on anything related to Harappan or if the language barrier is insurmountable.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer:**

The most common wrong answers would likely fall into these categories:

*   **Vague generalities:** "Harappan cities were very developed." "They had good buildings."
*   **Irrelevant details:** "They lived near the Indus River." "They were an ancient civilization." "They had seals." "They farmed."
*   **Partially correct but not "key" or not "urban planning":** "They used bricks." (True, but without "baked bricks" or connecting it to *planning* like uniform size, it's weaker). "They had houses."
*   **Focus on decline/mystery:** "We don't know much about them." "They disappeared."
*   **Misinterpretations of "planning":** "They planned their crops." "They planned their families." (Less likely, but possible if "planning" is completely misconstrued).

**Rubric Consideration:** The rubric is quite specific: "well-planned grid layout," "advanced drainage system," "baked bricks," "citadel and lower town." A student needs to hit one of these.

**Estimating the Pass Rate:**

Given the context:

*   **Economically weaker sections, limited English:** This significantly increases the language barrier for terms like "urban planning" and "key feature."
*   **Average pass rate ~29%:** This tells us that even for questions they *should* know, a large majority struggles. This question, requiring specific recall and precise understanding of terms, is not easy.
*   **Rote learning often prevalent:** If they
