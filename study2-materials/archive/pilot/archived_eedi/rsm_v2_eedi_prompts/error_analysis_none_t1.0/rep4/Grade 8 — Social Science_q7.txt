Let's break down the likely errors for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and the question's nature.

**I. Analysis of Likely Errors:**

**A. Misconceptions about Social Science:**

1.  **Chronological Confusion/Lack of Context:**
    *   **Error:** Students might know "Battle of Plassey" and "British expansion" as separate facts but struggle to link them causally. They might not understand the *significance* of 1757 as a turning point.
    *   **Why:** Indian history syllabus often covers many events. Students might memorize names and dates without deeply grasping the cause-and-effect relationships or the broader narrative of British conquest.

2.  **Focus on Military Aspects vs. Political Outcomes:**
    *   **Error:** Students might describe *who fought* or *who won* (e.g., "British defeated Siraj-ud-Daulah") without elaborating on the *political consequences* of that victory. They might miss the "contribution to expansion of power" part.
    *   **Why:** Battles are often taught with a focus on participants and winners. The nuances of political control (puppet rulers, revenue collection, etc.) require a deeper analytical understanding.

3.  **Vague Understanding of "Power":**
    *   **Error:** Students might say "British became powerful" or "they got control," but fail to specify *how* (political dominance, control over Bengal) as required by the rubric.
    *   **Why:** "Power" can be an abstract concept. Connecting it to concrete actions like placing a puppet nawab or controlling revenue might be challenging.

4.  **Limited Understanding of "Expansion":**
    *   **Error:** They might not understand that "expansion" here refers to territorial and political growth, not just general influence. They might think "British got more land" without understanding the *mechanism*.

**B. Language Misunderstandings:**

1.  **"Contribute to":**
    *   **Error:** This phrase implies cause and effect. Students might struggle to articulate this causal link explicitly. They might just list facts without explaining the "how."
    *   **Why:** Requires higher-order thinking than simple recall.

2.  **"Expansion of British power":**
    *   **Error:** While "British power" is fairly direct, "expansion" might be slightly tricky. They might understand "grow" but connecting it to the specific political dimension might be hard.

3.  **Rubric Specifics ("political dominance/control over Bengal," "puppet nawab"):**
    *   **Error:** These are specific concepts. Students might not use this precise vocabulary or fully grasp their meaning. They might have a simpler understanding of "control."
    *   **Why:** These terms are part of academic discourse. Students might use more colloquial or less precise language.

**C. Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**

1.  **Attempt but Fail:**
    *   **Likely:** Most students will attempt this question. "Battle of Plassey" is a prominent event in their history curriculum.
    *   **Reasons for failure:** The errors described above (vague answers, focusing on military details without political implications, insufficient explanation of "contribution").

2.  **Not Attempt at All:**
    *   **Less Likely, but possible:** If a student has severe gaps in their history knowledge or struggles significantly with English comprehension. However, it's a key event, so some familiarity is expected.

**D. Most Common Wrong Answer:**

*   "The British won the Battle of Plassey against Siraj-ud-Daulah." (Focuses on military victory, lacks political consequence/contribution to expansion).
*   "The British became powerful after Plassey." (Too vague, doesn't explain *how* or specify *where*).
*   "They got control over India." (Overgeneralization, doesn't specify Bengal or the mechanism).
*   "Mir Jafar became the Nawab." (Factual, but doesn't explain *why* this led to British power expansion – misses the "puppet" aspect).

**II. Estimating the Pass Rate:**

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for the exam, and the specific challenges of this question:

*   **Difficulty Level:** This question requires more than mere recall; it demands an understanding of cause-and-effect and political consequences, which is a step up.
*   **Vocabulary:** "Contribute to expansion of power," "political dominance," "puppet nawab" are quite specific.
*   **Common Pitfalls:** The tendency to only state who won or that the British became powerful is very strong.

I believe a significant portion of those who attempt will give answers that are fact
