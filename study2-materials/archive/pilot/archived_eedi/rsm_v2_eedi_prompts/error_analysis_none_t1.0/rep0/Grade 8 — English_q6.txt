Let's break down the likely errors for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, considering their background.

**Analyzing Likely Errors:**

1.  **"Define" Misconception:**
    *   **Problem:** The word "define" itself can be a hurdle. Many students might struggle with the concept of providing a formal definition. They might confuse it with "give an example of," "tell about," or "explain (in their own words, but not a formal definition)."
    *   **Impact:** They might give a characteristic of a fable, an example of a fable, or a very loose explanation, rather than a structured definition.

2.  **Vocabulary Gaps (English):**
    *   **Fable:** While "fable" might be familiar from Hindi or regional language studies (e.g., *panchatantra ki kahaniyan*), translating that understanding into a precise English definition is tough. They might know *what* a fable is intuitively, but not have the English vocabulary to articulate it.
    *   **Keywords in Rubric:**
        *   **"Typically":** A nuanced word. They might understand "usually" but not "typically," or miss the importance of this qualifier.
        *   **"Imparts a moral lesson":** "Imparts" is high-level vocabulary. "Moral lesson" is more accessible, but "imparts" will likely be replaced by simpler verbs like "gives," "tells," "teaches." Some might just say "has a moral."
        *   **"Characters":** Likely understood.
        *   **"Short story":** Fairly accessible.

3.  **Syntactic/Grammatical Challenges:**
    *   Even if they have the words, constructing a grammatically correct and coherent sentence for a definition is difficult. They might produce fragmented sentences or sentences with incorrect subject-verb agreement, tense, or article usage.

4.  **Influence of Regional Language/L1 Interference:**
    *   Students might attempt to translate their understanding directly from Hindi or their mother tongue, leading to awkward or incorrect English phrasing. For example, the concept of "moral" might be understood, but its precise expression in English within a definition might suffer.

5.  **Understanding of Core Concepts:**
    *   **Animals as Characters:** This is a strong identifying feature of fables. Many will likely get this part.
    *   **Moral Lesson:** Also a key feature, and fairly universally understood, even if the phrasing is simple.
    *   **Short Story:** This part might be missed or taken for granted. Some might just focus on the animal and moral aspects.

6.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **Attempt:** Most students will likely attempt this question, as "fable" is a familiar concept, even if the English "define" is tricky. They'll try to articulate what they know. Blank answers might be fewer than for truly unknown concepts.
    *   **Failure to Attempt:** Some, discouraged by the "define" or their limited English vocabulary, might leave it blank, but I expect most to try.

7.  **Most Common Wrong Answer Look Like:**

    *   **Partial Definition (Missing one key element or using simple language):**
        *   "Fable is a story that has animals." (Missing moral lesson, "short")
        *   "Fable is a story that teaches us a moral." (Missing animals, "short")
        *   "Fable means a story where animals talk and give a lesson." (Okay, but not formal definition, "give" instead of "imparts")
        *   "Fable is like Panchatantra stories." (Example, not definition)

    *   **Incorrect Grammar/Structure:**
        *   "Fable are story of animal give moral."
        *   "A fable a short story with animal and lesson moral."

    *   **Focus on one aspect only:**
        *   "A fable is a story about animals."
        *   "A fable is a story which teaches a lesson."

    *   **Confusion with other genres:** Less likely for "fable" but possible if they have very limited genre knowledge (e.g., confusing with myth or legend, though fables are distinct enough).

**Estimation Rationale (Considering 29% average pass rate):**

*   **Positive Factors:**
    *   "Fable" is a known concept in their L1.
    *   "Animals as characters" and "moral lesson" are relatively concrete and memorable features.
    *   Many will attempt the question.

*   **Negative Factors:**
    *   "Define" is a challenge.
    *   The precise English vocabulary (e.g., "imparts," "typically
