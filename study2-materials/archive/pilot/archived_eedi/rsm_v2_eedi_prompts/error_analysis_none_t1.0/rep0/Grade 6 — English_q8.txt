Let's break down the likely errors for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English, attempting to rearrange "book/reading/a/is/he" into a meaningful sentence.

**Analysis of Potential Errors:**

1.  **Fundamental Lack of English Sentence Structure (SVO - Subject-Verb-Object):** This is the biggest hurdle. Many students at this level, especially with limited exposure, might not have a strong grasp of the standard English SVO order.
    *   **Misconception:** English sentence order is the same as their native language (e.g., Hindi often uses SOV, Subject-Object-Verb). So, "He book reading is a" might feel natural to some.
    *   **Misconception:** Confusing the auxiliary verb "is" with the main verb "reading" or not understanding its role.

2.  **Vocabulary/Word Recognition Issues (even for simple words):** While "he," "is," "a," "book," "reading" are common, a student with *very* limited English might still struggle to recognize all of them instantly or associate them with their correct meaning/function.
    *   "Reading" might be particularly tricky if they haven't encountered "-ing" forms much.

3.  **Identifying the Subject:** Pinpointing "He" as the starter might be difficult. They might pick "Book" or "Reading" to start, especially if they are looking for the most "concrete" or familiar word.

4.  **Identifying the Verb Phrase:** Understanding "is reading" as a unit might be challenging. They might separate them or place "is" at the end.

5.  **Placement of "a":** The article "a" might be misplaced, e.g., "book a," "reading a book he is."

6.  **"Meaningful" Misinterpretation:** What is "meaningful" to them might differ. If they can extract a few words that make sense together (e.g., "he reading book"), they might consider that "meaningful" enough, even if grammatically incorrect.

7.  **Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**
    *   **Attempt and Fail:** Most students would likely attempt it. It's a rearrangement task, not a creative writing one. They will try to put the words together.
    *   **Not Attempt at All:** A very small percentage, those who are completely lost or overwhelmed, might leave it blank, but it's less likely for a simple word rearrangement than for a complex comprehension question.

**Most Common Wrong Answers Would Look Like:**

*   **SOV Influence (Native Language Interference):**
    *   "He book reading is a."
    *   "He a book reading is."
    *   "He book is a reading."
*   **Starting with Object/Verb:**
    *   "Book he is reading a."
    *   "Reading he is a book."
    *   "Is he reading a book." (This is a question, so while grammatically almost correct, it's not the intended statement.)
*   **Random Order/Partial Correctness:**
    *   "He reading book is a." (Close, but "is a" is wrong)
    *   "Reading a book he is." (Missing "is" after "he")
    *   "Book reading a he is." (Completely jumbled)
    *   "He is a book reading." (Misplaced 'a')
    *   "He reading a book is." (Misplaced 'is')

**Revisiting the Average Pass Rate (29%)**

Given an average pass rate of 29% across various questions, this particular question ("Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence: book/reading/a/is/he") is relatively straightforward *if* a student has even a basic grasp of SVO. However, the context of "economically weaker sections with limited English" suggests that even basic SVO might not be universally established by Class 6.

*   The words are common.
*   The structure is simple (S-V-O with an auxiliary verb).
*   There are only 5 words.

Compared to more complex grammar, vocabulary, or comprehension questions, this *should* have a slightly higher pass rate than the average 29% for those who have been taught basic sentence formation. However, for those lacking that fundamental understanding, it's still a guessing game.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**

Considering the challenges and the typical exposure levels:

*   A significant portion will get it wrong due to SVO confusion (native language interference or lack of English SVO understanding).
*   Some will get it partially right but
