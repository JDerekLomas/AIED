Let's break down the likely errors for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and the nature of the question.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **"Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"**

    *   **Vocabulary/Grammar Misconceptions (English):**
        *   **"Which line":** Some might not understand "line" in the context of poetry. They might think it means "which direction" or "which type."
        *   **"from the poem":** While "poem" is a common word, "from" might be tricky. They might understand "the poem" but not realize they have to pick *from within* it.
        *   **"do you like":** Generally understood, but some might struggle with the auxiliary verb "do."
        *   **"most":** Understanding superlatives can be a hurdle. They might just pick *a* line they like, not necessarily the *most*.
        *   **"and why":** This is the biggest hurdle. Explaining a reason (causal connection) in English is a higher-order thinking skill and requires specific vocabulary and sentence structures (e.g., "because," "it shows," "I like it because..."). Many students at this level struggle with forming complex sentences or expressing abstract reasons.

    *   **Language Misunderstandings:**
        *   **Literal interpretation:** Some might try to find a "line" in the physical sense, not a poetic one.
        *   **Lack of comprehension of the poem itself:** If they don't understand the poem, how can they pick a line they like and explain why? This question *presupposes* comprehension of the poem, which is a significant barrier for many. The poem's complexity is not given here, but it's a critical factor. Assuming a simple poem.
        *   **Confusion with other tasks:** They might mistake it for a "copy the poem" task or "summarize the poem."

    *   **Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**
        *   **Not attempt:** A significant portion will likely not attempt *the "why" part* if they don't understand it or lack the vocabulary. Some might not attempt at all if the entire question is too daunting.
        *   **Attempt but fail:** Most will likely attempt the "which line" part, even if it's just copying a random line. The "why" part is where most will fail.

    *   **Most Common Wrong Answer Look Like:**
        *   **Copying a random line:** Many will just pick *any* line from the poem and write it down, ignoring "which one you like the most" or "why."
        *   **Copying the entire poem/stanza:** Misunderstanding "line" for "poem" or "stanza."
        *   **Writing a generic answer unrelated to the poem:** "I like this poem" or "The poem is good."
        *   **Attempting "why" with very limited or incorrect English:**
            *   "Good." (Too simplistic, no connection to the line)
            *   "I like." (Redundant, doesn't explain "why")
            *   "Because it nice." (Grammatically incorrect, limited explanation)
            *   "It is good line." (Again, no "why")
            *   "I like this line. It has words." (Trivial reason)
        *   **Leaving the "why" part blank.**
        *   **No answer at all.**

    *   **Rubric Implications:** The rubric ("Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why") means:
        *   Simply copying a line (even the "most liked" one) gets 0.
        *   Simply saying "I like this line" gets 0.
        *   They *must* provide a reason, however simple, that links to the line. "I like this line because it talks about birds" (if the line talks about birds) would likely get points.
        *   The phrase "mentions why" is crucial. A simple "good" or "nice" might not be sufficient if it doesn't clearly articulate a *reason* related to the content or feeling of the line.

Given the average pass rate of 29% for general questions, this question is demonstrably harder due to the "and why" component, which requires analytical thought and expressive English, not just recall or simple identification.

Let's consider the breakdown for scoring:
*   **0.5 points (identifying a line):** Many students might achieve this.
*   **1.0 point (mentioning a reason):** This is where most will struggle. The reason needs to
