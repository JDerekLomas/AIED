Let's break down the likely errors for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, keeping in mind their background and the nature of the question.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science (Geography):**

*   **Definition of "Mountain Range":** This is a primary hurdle.
    *   **Confusion with individual mountains:** Students might name a famous single peak (e.g., Mount Everest, Kanchenjunga) instead of a range. While Everest is *in* the Himalayas, naming the peak alone isn't naming the range. This is a common error even with students who understand the concept but lack precise vocabulary.
    *   **Confusion with plateaus/plains/rivers:** Less likely, but some might name a large geographical feature that isn't a mountain range if their fundamental understanding of landforms is weak.
    *   **Lack of precise geographical knowledge:** Even if they understand "mountain range," they might not know the *names* of the major ones in India, or they might confuse them with ranges in neighboring countries. They might know "mountains" are there but not their specific names.
*   **Scale and Scope:** Understanding that "major" implies a large, distinct system, not just a small hill range in their local area. They might name a local hill that isn't a "major mountain range."
*   **Recall vs. Recognition:** They might have been taught these names but struggle with recall without visual aids or multiple-choice options.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Major":** While a common word, "major" might be interpreted broadly. Some might think of any "big" mountain, leading to the "individual peak" error.
*   **"Mountain Ranges":** This phrase itself might be the biggest linguistic hurdle.
    *   "Mountain" is likely understood.
    *   "Range" might be new or not fully grasped in this geographical context. They might understand "range" as a "variety" or "scope," not a "chain of mountains."
    *   The combination "mountain ranges" specifically might be problematic, leading to the single peak error.
*   **"Located in India":** This is generally clear, but if they lack specific knowledge, they might name a famous range elsewhere (e.g., Alps, though less likely for this demographic).

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **Attempt:** Most students will likely attempt this question, as "mountain" is a familiar concept, and it's a direct recall question. Not attempting at all would suggest a complete lack of understanding or knowledge.
*   **Failure:** Failure would come from:
    *   Naming an individual peak (e.g., Everest, Kanchenjunga).
    *   Naming a non-mountain range geographical feature.
    *   Naming a small, local hill range that isn't considered "major."
    *   Incorrect spelling that makes the answer unintelligible (though the rubric is usually lenient for geography names).
    *   Writing "mountains" but not a specific name.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer:**

*   **Naming individual peaks:** "Mount Everest," "Kanchenjunga," or "Nanda Devi" would be extremely common. These are famous "mountains" to them, and they might not differentiate between a peak and a range.
*   **Generic answer:** "Mountains" or "Himalaya mountains" (without explicitly stating "Himalayas").
*   **Irrelevant but related:** Naming a state known for mountains (e.g., "Uttarakhand mountains").
*   **Blank:** For those with absolutely no recall.

**Rubric Consideration:**

The rubric is quite lenient: "Names one correct mountain range." This means they only need *one* to get 0.5 points. This significantly increases the chances of passing compared to needing two or more.

**Factors Influencing Pass Rate:**

*   **Prior Teaching:** How effectively were mountain ranges taught in their geography curriculum? Was it rote memorization or conceptual understanding?
*   **Visual Aids:** Were maps and diagrams used extensively?
*   **Language of Instruction:** While the question is in English, if geography is taught primarily in Hindi or other regional languages, translating "mountain range" and recalling names in English could be an issue. However, names like "Himalayas" are often transliterated.
*   **Economic Background:** Limited access to supplementary learning materials, books, or tutors might mean their only exposure is in the classroom.

**Estimating the Pass Rate:**

Given the average pass rate of 29% across various questions, and the specific challenges for this question:

*   **High Chance of Misconception:** The peak vs. range confusion is significant.
