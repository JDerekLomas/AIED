Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **"Some" vs. "Any" Misconceptions (Direct Grammatical Error):**
    *   **Lack of understanding of affirmative/negative contexts:** This is the core rule. Many students, especially at this level, may not have explicitly learned or internalized that "some" is for affirmative sentences and "any" is typically for negative sentences or questions.
    *   **Focus on quantity, not context:** They might just see both words as meaning "a few" or "a certain amount" and pick one randomly or based on which sounds slightly more familiar.
    *   **Overgeneralization of "any":** "Any" is used in questions ("Are there any apples?") and negative statements ("There aren't any apples."). If they've only seen it in questions, they might incorrectly assume it's for *all* non-positive statements, or simply struggle to distinguish between the two contexts.
    *   **Influence of L1 (Hindi/Other Regional Languages):** In many Indian languages, the distinction between "some" and "any" in affirmative/negative contexts might not be as rigid or expressed with distinct words in the same way. A single word might cover both meanings. This could lead to direct translation errors or simply not recognizing the grammatical rule in English as important. For example, "कुछ" (kuch) in Hindi can mean both 'some' and 'any' depending on context, but the English rule is stricter.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings (Vocabulary/Sentence Structure):**
    *   **"Apples," "basket":** These are relatively common words and likely understood.
    *   **"There are...":** This common opening for existential sentences is also likely familiar.
    *   **"Choose the correct word":** The instructions are straightforward.
    *   **Primary issue:** The misunderstanding will *not* be about the nouns or verbs, but solely about the nuanced grammatical function of "some" and "any."

3.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **Attempt:** Most students will *attempt* this question. It's a multiple-choice/fill-in-the-blank format, not a complex essay. They will likely read the sentence and the options.
    *   **Failure:** The failure will stem from an incorrect choice, not from a complete inability to engage with the question. They won't leave it blank unless they truly have no idea, but even then, a guess is highly probable.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   **"Any":** This would be the overwhelming most common wrong answer. If they don't know the rule, "any" is the only other option. They might choose it because:
        *   It "sounds okay" to them.
        *   They are guessing.
        *   They've heard "any" in other contexts and are applying it incorrectly here.
        *   They might associate "any" with a slightly more informal or common usage in their limited exposure.

**Revisiting the Average Pass Rate (29%) and Context:**

*   **Economically Weaker Sections, Limited English:** This is key. Formal grammar instruction on "some/any" might be present but not deeply internalized. Rote learning without true comprehension is common.
*   **Class 6:** This is a crucial stage for developing basic sentence structure and vocabulary, but complex grammatical nuances are often challenging.
*   **"Average pass rate is about 29%":** This general pass rate for *all* questions suggests that this particular question, focusing on a specific grammatical rule, is likely to be challenging for a significant portion of students.

**Applying the Analysis to the Question:**

The question is a direct test of the "some/any" rule in an affirmative sentence.

*   **Students who know the rule:** Will select "some" correctly.
*   **Students who don't know the rule:** Will guess or choose "any" based on faulty reasoning. Given there are only two options, a pure guess has a 50% chance of being correct. However, misunderstanding often biases guesses.

If the general pass rate for *all* questions is 29%, a specific grammar rule question like this will likely fall within a similar range, potentially slightly higher due to the limited options, or slightly lower if this rule is particularly tricky.

Considering:
*   The distinctness of the "some/any" rule, which is a common point of confusion.
*   The limited English proficiency and exposure.
*   The high likelihood of picking "any" as the wrong answer, not just guessing randomly.
*   The context of Class 6.
