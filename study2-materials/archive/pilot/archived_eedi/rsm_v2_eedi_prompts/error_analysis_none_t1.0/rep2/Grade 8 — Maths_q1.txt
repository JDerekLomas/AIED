Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Potential Errors:**

1.  **Mathematical Misconceptions:**

    *   **Concept of Negative Numbers:** This is the *biggest* hurdle. Many students, especially at this level and from backgrounds with less exposure to abstract math, struggle with negative numbers. They might not fully grasp that `4 - 9` results in a negative value.
    *   **Transposition/Inverse Operations:** While they might understand "taking 9 to the other side," they might struggle with the sign change. They might think:
        *   `y = 9 - 4` (common error: keeps positive 9, or changes 4 to negative)
        *   `y = 4 + 9` (common error: changes sign of 9 to positive)
        *   `y = -9 - 4` (less common but possible, misunderstanding sign change)
    *   **Order of Operations (less relevant here, but sometimes a general confusion):** While simple, some might think `y + 9` implies a different operation or sequence.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings:**

    *   **"Find the value of y":** This is generally clear, but if a student is completely new to algebra, the abstract nature of "y" might be a conceptual block, though less likely for Class 8.
    *   **"Equation":** Again, generally understood at Class 8.
    *   **Limited English:** While the words are simple, the general cognitive load of processing a question in a non-native language can increase error rates, even for straightforward math. This could manifest as increased anxiety leading to less careful calculation.

3.  **Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**

    *   **Most students *will attempt* this question.** It's short, has numbers, and appears solvable. It's not a complex word problem that might lead to a complete blank.
    *   The attempts, however, will often be incorrect due to the math misconceptions.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:**

    *   **`y = 5`:** This is almost certainly the *most common wrong answer*. It arises from the misconception that you always subtract the smaller number from the larger number, ignoring the position and sign: `9 - 4 = 5`. This shows an understanding of subtraction and moving terms, but a failure to grasp negative numbers or correct sign changes during transposition.
    *   **`y = 13`:** This comes from `4 + 9`. This indicates a failure to understand that addition becomes subtraction (or vice-versa) when moving terms across the equals sign. They simply see `+ 9` and add it to 4.
    *   **`y = -13`:** Less common, but possible if they incorrectly apply negative signs to both 9 and 4.
    *   **Leaving it blank/no answer:** Less likely given the simplicity, but possible if they are completely lost on the concept of solving for y or negative numbers.

**Revisiting the Average Pass Rate (29%) and Adjusting:**

The overall average pass rate of 29% for the entire paper implies that many students struggle significantly with a variety of questions. This specific question, while basic for algebra, hinges heavily on the concept of negative numbers.

Given that negative numbers are often a stumbling block, and `y=5` is a very attractive incorrect answer:

*   Many who *understand* basic equation structure will fall into the `y=5` trap.
*   Some will fall into the `y=13` trap.
*   A smaller group will correctly identify `y=-5`.

I would expect a slightly higher pass rate for this question compared to a more complex word problem or a geometry question requiring formula recall, but still significantly below what we might expect from students in a system where algebra is strongly reinforced.

**Considering the "economically weaker sections with limited English" aspect:**

*   This amplifies the negative number challenge, as less exposure to supplementary learning resources might mean this concept isn't as solidified.
*   The "limited English" might cause a slight additional cognitive load, but the question is so direct that it's unlikely to be the primary cause of error. The math itself is the barrier.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**

Considering all these factors, especially the prevalence of the `y=5` error and the difficulty with negative numbers at this level, I would estimate:

*   **20-25%** get it fully correct (`y = -5`).
*   **40-50%** get `y = 5`.
*   **15-20%** get `
