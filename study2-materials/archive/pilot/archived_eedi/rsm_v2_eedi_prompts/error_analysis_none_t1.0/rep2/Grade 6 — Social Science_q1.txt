Let's break down the likely errors for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, keeping in mind their background and the nature of the question.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science (Geography):**

*   **Lack of Specific Geographic Knowledge:** This is the most significant factor. While they might have heard of "mountains," associating specific names with India is a higher-level recall task.
    *   **Blurring of Categories:** They might confuse mountains with rivers (Ganga, Yamuna), deserts (Thar), or even cities. Their mental map of India might not be well-defined with distinct physical features.
    *   **Limited Exposure to Maps:** Many government schools have limited resources, and consistent exposure to detailed physical maps of India might be lacking. This makes it hard to internalize the names of mountain ranges.
    *   **Focus on Local Geography:** Their learning might be heavily skewed towards local geography, making national-level features less prominent.
    *   **Generalizing "Mountain":** They know what a mountain is, but don't have the specific names. They might just say "high mountains."
*   **Difficulty with "Range":** The term "mountain range" might be slightly more abstract than just "mountain." They might think of individual peaks if they think of anything specific at all, but even that is unlikely for Class 6.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Major":** While they'll understand "major" as important/big, the core issue is not knowing *any* range, let alone distinguishing "major" ones.
*   **"Located in India":** This is generally clear, but if their geographic knowledge is weak, they might name mountains from outside India if they've heard of them (e.g., Everest, which they might associate generally with "India region").
*   **"Mountain Ranges":** As discussed, "range" might be a slight cognitive hurdle, but "mountain" is generally understood. The core problem is the *specific names*.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **Attempt but Fail:** This is highly probable for a significant portion. They will attempt because it's a direct question. They might write:
    *   A common river name (Ganga, Yamuna).
    *   A generic term like "Pahar" (mountain in Hindi).
    *   A nearby famous landmark that isn't a mountain range.
    *   A famous peak if they know one (e.g., Mount Everest, even if only partially in India or not a range).
    *   Something completely irrelevant if they are guessing wildly.
*   **Not Attempt at All:** A smaller proportion will leave it blank if they genuinely have no idea or are very unconfident. This is less likely than attempting *something*, given the straightforward nature of the question.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer:**

*   **"Himalayas" (singular) or "Pahar" (Mountain):** Many might just write "Himalayas" (if they know it) but fail to provide a second, correct name. If they don't know Himalayas, "Pahar" or "Uccha Pahar" (high mountains) would be very common.
*   **Names of major rivers:** Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari. These are prominent geographical features they would have learned about.
*   **Names of states or cities:** Maharashtra, Delhi, etc., showing a fundamental misunderstanding of the question.
*   **Mount Everest:** As a prominent "mountain," even if not a range and only partially associated with India (via Nepal).

**Considering the Rubric:**

The rubric is quite generous: "Names one correct mountain range... Max score: 0.5". This means if they can just recall *one* of the listed ranges (Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats), they get full marks for this question. This significantly increases the pass rate compared to needing two.

**Estimating the Pass Rate:**

Given the average pass rate of 29% across the entire paper, and the specific challenges for this question:

*   **Himalayas:** This is the most likely correct answer for any student who has *any* geographic knowledge of India's mountains. It's iconic.
*   **Aravalli:** Possible, especially for students from certain regions (Rajasthan, Gujarat).
*   **Vindhya/Satpura/Ghats:** Less likely to be consistently known by a broad national sample, especially given limited resources.

**Factors for success:**

*   Rote memorization: Some students might have simply memorized a few names.
*   Good teacher: A teacher who focused on physical geography
