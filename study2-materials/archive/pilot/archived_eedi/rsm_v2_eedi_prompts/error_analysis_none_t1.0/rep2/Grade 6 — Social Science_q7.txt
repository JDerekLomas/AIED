Let's break down the likely errors for Class 6 students in Indian government schools from economically weaker sections with limited English attempting this question.

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science (especially Geography/Environmental Science):**

*   **Definition of "Natural Resource":** This is a key hurdle.
    *   **Common Misconception:** Students might equate "resource" with something immediately consumed or *man-made* (e.g., "food," "clothes," "houses"). They might struggle to differentiate between a raw material and a finished product. They might also think of things specific to *their household* rather than broader regional resources.
    *   **Concrete Example of Error:** Instead of "Marble," they might say "statues." Instead of "copper," they might say "utensils" or "wires."
    *   **Another Misconception:** They might name *animals* or *plants* generally, without connecting them to a specific "resource" context (e.g., "cows," "trees" without mentioning wood or dairy products). While technically natural, it might not be what the question intends in terms of *extractable* resources.
*   **Locating Rajasthan:** While they are in India, general geographical knowledge of specific states and their unique resources might be weak. They might name resources common throughout India, or even just what they see around their immediate village, which might not be specific to Rajasthan's prominent natural resources.
*   **Understanding "Influences Lives":** This requires a causal link.
    *   **Difficulty:** Connecting a resource to its impact on daily life might be abstract for younger students. They might describe the resource itself but not its *influence*. For example, they might say "Rajasthan has sand" but struggle to explain how sand *influences* lives (e.g., building material, desert landscape affecting agriculture/lifestyle).
    *   **Superficial Explanation:** They might give very basic, almost tautological explanations (e.g., "Water influences lives because people drink water"). The rubric asks for "explains how," implying a slightly deeper understanding of its societal impact.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Natural Resources":** As discussed above, the compound term might be tricky. "Prakritik Sansadhan" (प्राकृतिक संसाधन) in Hindi might be understood better, but their English vocabulary might not be strong enough to accurately translate or recall examples.
*   **"Influences":** This is a moderately complex verb. They might understand "affect" but struggle with "influence." They might simply list uses rather than explaining the *impact* or *consequence* of the resource's presence/absence.
*   **"Mention any two..." vs. "explain how one...":** The two-part instruction could be confusing. Some might only list resources, some might only explain one, and some might get mixed up.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **High Attempt Rate (but potentially poor quality):** Given it's a direct question asking for examples, most students will attempt it. The natural inclination to write *something* will be strong.
*   **Struggling with the "Explain" Part:** While they might list two resources, the "explain how" part will likely lead to many failed attempts or very superficial answers.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer Look Like:**

*   **Partially Correct, Partially Incorrect:**
    *   "Water, trees" (trees are natural, but maybe not specific *forest* resources of Rajasthan, and "trees" is too general).
    *   "Sand, sun" (good, but then the explanation is weak).
*   **Irrelevant Resources:** "Food," "Clothes," "Houses," "Animals" (too general), "Plants."
*   **Only One Resource:** Many might only be able to recall one specific natural resource.
*   **Only Listing, No Explanation:** "Water. Marble." (fails the second part of the question).
*   **Vague/Circular Explanations:** "Water influences lives because it is important." or "Marble influences lives because people use it." (lacks specific detail).
*   **Mistaking Man-made for Natural:** "Crops" (while from nature, it's a cultivated resource, not typically what's meant by *natural resource* in this context, though some might argue it's linked to fertile soil).
*   **Resources Not Specific to Rajasthan:** While water is universal, they might just list things found everywhere without considering Rajasthan's unique geological/climatic profile.

**Pass Rate Calculation Strategy:**

Let's consider the breakdown for scoring 1 mark (two correct resources AND one good explanation).

1.  **Ability to name two *correct*
