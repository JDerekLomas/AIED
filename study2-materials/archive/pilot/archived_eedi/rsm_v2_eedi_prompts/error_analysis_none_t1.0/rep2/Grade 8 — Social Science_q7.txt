Let's break down the likely errors for Class 8 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections with limited English attempting this question.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Fundamental Misconception about "Contribution to Expansion":**
    *   **Focus on the battle itself, not its *consequences*:** Students might describe the battle (who fought, who won) without linking it to the *expansion of British power*. They might know *that* the British won, but not *how* that victory specifically furthered their power.
    *   **Lack of understanding of "power":** They might think of "power" in purely military terms and struggle to connect it to political or economic dominance.
    *   **Focus on the immediate, not the long-term impact:** They might mention Mir Jafar but not understand the *significance* of him being a "puppet" or how that changed the power dynamic.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Contribute to":** This phrase can be tricky. Students might understand "how it happened" (the battle) but not "how it helped/caused something else." They might simply narrate the event.
    *   **"Expansion of British power":** While "British power" is fairly straightforward, "expansion" might be interpreted broadly as just "the British got stronger" rather than "they gained more territory/political control."
    *   **Vocabulary Gaps:** Terms like "political dominance," "puppet nawab," "suzerainty," "revenue collection" (if they try to elaborate) might be beyond their consistent comprehension or recall. They might have heard them but not internalized their meaning sufficiently for application.

3.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **Attempt:** Most students will likely *attempt* the question. The Battle of Plassey is a standard topic in Indian history textbooks for this age group. They will have *some* knowledge.
    *   **Failure:** The failure will stem from an inability to connect the dots as required by the rubric, rather than complete ignorance of the topic. They might recall facts but fail to synthesize them into the causal link asked for.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   **Simple statement of victory:** "The British won the Battle of Plassey." or "The British defeated Siraj-ud-Daulah." (Fails to explain *how* this led to expansion of power).
    *   **Partial or vague connection:** "After the Battle of Plassey, the British became very powerful." (Too general, doesn't explain *how*).
    *   **Naming Mir Jafar without context:** "Mir Jafar became the new Nawab." (Doesn't explain his puppet status or the resulting British control).
    *   **Narrating events leading up to the battle:** Some might get lost in describing the causes of the battle (e.g., Black Hole tragedy, trade disputes) without getting to the *consequences*.
    *   **Confusion with other battles/events:** While less likely for Plassey, some might mix up details with other battles if their historical knowledge is weak.

**Impact of Context (Economically Weaker Sections, Limited English):**

*   **Rote Learning:** Students are more likely to have memorized facts rather than understood complex historical causality. The question specifically asks for "how it contributed," which requires analytical thinking beyond mere recall.
*   **English as a Barrier:** Even if they understand the historical concept in their native language, articulating it precisely in English, especially with terms like "contribute to" or "expansion of power," can be a significant hurdle. They might know *what* happened but struggle to *explain* it *why* it mattered in the specific way asked.
*   **Lack of Exposure:** Limited exposure to diverse reading materials and critical thinking exercises can hinder their ability to formulate nuanced answers.

**Estimated Pass Rate (Considering the Rubric):**

The rubric is quite specific: "explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)."

*   Simply stating "British won" will not pass.
*   Stating "British became powerful" might be too vague.
*   They need to link the victory to *political dominance/control* or explicitly mention the *puppet nawab* and understand its significance.

Given the typical challenges:

*   Many will likely narrate the victory without explaining the *how*.
*   Many will know Mir Jafar but fail to articulate his "puppet" status and its implications for British power.
*   The analytical "contribute to expansion" part is where most will fall short.
