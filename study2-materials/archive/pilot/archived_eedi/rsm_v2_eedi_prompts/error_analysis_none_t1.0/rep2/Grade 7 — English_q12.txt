Let's break down the likely errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the student profile (economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate 29%):

1.  **Fundamental Lack of Understanding of Voice:**
    *   Many students simply won't know what "Active Voice" or "Passive Voice" means, even if they recognize the words "active" and "passive." The grammatical terms themselves are barriers.
    *   They might have been taught it, but without deep conceptual understanding or practice, it won't stick.

2.  **Vocabulary/Terminology Barriers:**
    *   "Transform," "sentence," "active," "passive," "voice" – all these words might not be fully understood in a grammatical context. "Change" is probably the most accessible word here.

3.  **Subject-Object Identification Issues:**
    *   Even if they dimly understand "doing" vs. "being done to," they might struggle to correctly identify the subject ("the wind") and the object ("the leaves"). This is a prerequisite for transformation.

4.  **Tense Confusion (Past Simple vs. Past Participle):**
    *   The original sentence is "blew" (simple past). The passive requires "was/were + past participle."
    *   **Common error:** They might use the simple past form again: "The leaves were *blew* away by the wind."
    *   **Less common but possible error:** Using present tense "are blown" or even future "will be blown" if their grasp of tense is weak.
    *   Knowing "blown" as the past participle of "blow" is crucial. Many irregular verbs are challenging.

5.  **Auxiliary Verb "to be" Confusion:**
    *   Knowing to use "was/were" based on the tense of the original sentence and the plurality of the new subject ("leaves" -> "were").
    *   **Common error:** Omitting the auxiliary verb entirely: "The leaves blown away by the wind."
    *   **Common error:** Using the wrong form: "The leaves *was* blown away..." (singular 'was' with plural 'leaves').

6.  **Preposition "by" Omission/Misuse:**
    *   The agent ("by the wind") is a key part of the passive voice structure when the agent is specified.
    *   **Common error:** Omitting "by the wind" completely: "The leaves were blown away." (This is a grammatically correct passive sentence, but it doesn't fully transform the *given* sentence by including the agent, which is usually expected in such exercises unless specified). If strict, this might be marked incorrect or partially correct.
    *   **Less common error:** Using another preposition (e.g., "from the wind").

7.  **Word Order Confusion:**
    *   Even if they get some elements, putting them in the correct sequence ("Subject + be + V3 + by + Agent") can be challenging.

**Likely Student Behaviors:**

*   **Not attempt at all:** A significant portion (perhaps 20-30%) will see the question and not even try, either due to not understanding the prompt or feeling overwhelmed by the grammar.
*   **Attempt but fail significantly:** Many will try, but produce responses that are far from correct due to multiple errors (tense, auxiliary, word order, participle).
*   **Attempt and partially succeed:** A smaller group might get some elements right (e.g., identify "leaves" as the new subject) but make crucial errors with the verb form or auxiliary.

**Most Common Wrong Answers:**

1.  **No attempt / Blank.**
2.  **"The leaves blew away by the wind."** (Switched subject/object but kept active verb form and added 'by the wind'). This shows some understanding of moving the object but a complete failure on the verb transformation.
3.  **"The leaves was blown away by the wind."** (Correct structure, correct participle, but wrong auxiliary verb 'was' instead of 'were' for plural 'leaves'). This is a very common and almost-correct error.
4.  **"The leaves blown away by the wind."** (Missing the auxiliary verb 'were').
5.  **"The leaves are blown away by the wind."** (Used present tense auxiliary instead of past).
6.  **"The wind blown the leaves away."** (Only changed "blew" to "blown," maybe thinking "blown" is more "passive," but kept the active structure).

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**
