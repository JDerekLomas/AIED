Let's break down the likely errors for Class 7 students in Indian government schools from economically weaker sections with limited English.

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

**1. Misconceptions about Mathematics:**

*   **Forgetting the "1/2" in the formula:** This is the most common mathematical error for this type of problem. Students might just multiply base and height, treating it like a rectangle's area. This indicates a lack of conceptual understanding of why the "1/2" is there (a triangle is half of a rectangle/parallelogram with the same base and height).
*   **Confusion with perimeter:** Less likely for this specific question as "area" is explicitly mentioned, but some might default to adding all numbers if they're just scanning for operations.
*   **Incorrect multiplication:** Even if they know the formula, errors in multiplying 1/2 * 8 * 6 (e.g., 8*6 = 48, then dividing by 2 could be tricky for some, or miscalculating 1/2 * 8 as 16).
*   **Units confusion (less likely to cause a "wrong" answer per rubric, but indicates weakness):** They might write "cm" instead of "cm²".

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Area":** While "area" is a common mathematical term, the English word itself might be a barrier for some. They might not fully grasp its meaning despite having encountered it in their mother tongue. However, at Class 7, it's expected they would have some exposure.
*   **"Base" and "Height":** These terms are usually taught along with the concept, but for students with limited English, the words themselves could be confusing if not reinforced adequately with diagrams and context in their local language.
*   **"Whose":** This is a relatively simple conjunction but could add a slight layer of cognitive load.

**3. Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**

*   **Attempt and Fail:** The vast majority who recognize it as a math problem and not pure English comprehension will attempt it. This is a standard formulaic question.
*   **Not Attempt at all:** Only a very small percentage would leave it blank if they completely don't understand "area" or see numbers and no clear operation. Many students are trained to attempt something rather than leave it blank.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer:**

*   **"48" (from base × height):** This is overwhelmingly the most likely incorrect answer. It shows they recognized the key dimensions and knew they needed to multiply, but missed the "1/2".
*   "24" (if they somehow get 1/2 * 8 = 4, but then forget to multiply by 6, or some other combination).
*   "14" (if they added 8 + 6, indicating perimeter confusion, but less likely given "area").

**Pass Rate Estimation:**

Considering the factors:

*   **Formula recall is key:** This is a direct application of a formula. Those who know it will likely get it right.
*   **"1/2" is the pitfall:** The most common error will be multiplying base x height.
*   **Language is a hurdle:** While "area," "base," and "height" are common math terms, the English medium for many low-income students is a significant cognitive load. They might understand the concept in their mother tongue but struggle to connect it to the English terms.
*   **Teacher quality/resource availability:** Government schools in weaker sections often have larger class sizes, less individualized attention, and fewer resources for conceptual understanding, leading to rote memorization which can be fragile.

Given the average pass rate of 29% for general questions, this question is relatively straightforward if the formula is known. However, the "1/2" is a consistent stumbling block.

Let's assume:
*   A group of students will know the formula perfectly.
*   A larger group will know they need to multiply base and height but forget the "1/2".
*   A smaller group will have language issues or completely misunderstand.

If we say about half of those who attempt it mathematically will forget the 1/2, and then factor in some who struggle with English or basic multiplication:

*   Students who get it correct (know the formula and execute): Let's estimate **35-40%** would fall into this category. They've either memorized it well, or conceptually understood it.
*   Students who write 48: This will be a significant chunk, probably **30-40%**.
*   Students who make other errors or don't attempt: **20-30%**.

Considering the "average pass rate of 2
