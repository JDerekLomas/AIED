Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

**1. Misconceptions about Mathematics:**

*   **Forgetting the "1/2" in the formula:** This is probably the most common mathematical error. Students might remember "base × height" from rectangles/squares and apply it directly without understanding the triangle-specific adjustment.
*   **Confusing area with perimeter:** Less likely for this specific question, but a general confusion could lead to adding the base and height, or looking for a third side (which isn't given).
*   **Incorrect multiplication:** Even if they know `8 × 6`, some might make a simple arithmetic error (e.g., `42`, `56`, etc.). Similarly, `1/2 × 48` could lead to errors like `48/2 = 25` or `20.4`.
*   **Not knowing how to calculate 1/2 of a number:** While basic, some students might struggle with division by 2, especially if mental math is weak.
*   **Units confusion:** While not directly leading to a wrong *number*, some might just write "cm" instead of "cm²". The rubric asks for the correct formula, so this might not penalize *this specific item*, but shows a conceptual gap.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Area":** Students might not understand what "area" means in a mathematical context. They might understand the general word but not the specific calculation it requires.
*   **"Base" and "Height":** These terms might not be clear, especially if visual aids are not commonly used in teaching. They might confuse them with "length" or "width" without understanding their specific roles in triangle area.
*   **"Triangle":** While most would recognize the word, if their understanding of its properties is weak, they might not recall the specific formula.
*   **Simple vocabulary:** The overall sentence structure is quite simple, so major misunderstanding due to complex English is less likely for this particular question, but the individual mathematical terms are key.

**3. Attempt Status:**

*   **Attempt and fail:** This will be the majority. Most students will recognize it as a math problem and try to apply a formula. The issues will be with the correctness of the formula or the calculation.
*   **Not attempt at all:** A significant portion of students (especially those with very weak foundations or high anxiety) might leave it blank, either because they don't understand *any* of the terms or simply don't remember any relevant formula. This is particularly true if they have low confidence in their English comprehension of math terms.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer:**

*   **`48` cm²:** This is almost certainly the most common wrong answer. It comes from applying `base × height` directly, forgetting the `1/2`.
*   **`28` cm²:** (8 + 6 + something else?) Less likely for this problem as there isn't a clear perimeter calculation without a third side.
*   **`14` cm:** (8 + 6) Confusing area with perimeter, adding the given numbers. Possible, but less common than the `48`.
*   **Leaving it blank:** A significant number of students will likely do this.

**Revised Pass Rate Estimation:**

Given the context:
*   Mostly economically weaker sections, limited English.
*   Average pass rate is about 29% (overall, not for this specific question). This general pass rate suggests a significant struggle across subjects.
*   The question involves a standard formula, but one that is often misremembered.

Let's consider the breakdown:

*   **Knows formula and calculates correctly:** This group is what we're aiming for.
*   **Knows `b * h` but forgets `1/2`:** This will be a large group, leading to `48`. They understand the concept of using base and height, just miss the specific triangle rule.
*   **Knows formula but makes calculation error:** A smaller group, but present.
*   **Doesn't know any relevant formula / Leaves blank:** This group will be substantial due to language barriers, lack of conceptual understanding of "area," or simply never having learned/retained the formula.
*   **Confuses with perimeter/addition:** A smaller group.

The fact that "forgetting the 1/2" is such a prevalent error in *any* student population, combined with the general struggles of this specific group (limited English, weaker foundations, low overall pass rate), suggests that while some will get it right, a substantial portion will make this common error or fail to attempt.

If the *overall* pass
