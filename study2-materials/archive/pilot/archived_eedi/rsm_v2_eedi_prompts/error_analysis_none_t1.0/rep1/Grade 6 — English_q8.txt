Let's break down the likely student experience with this question.

**Target Students:** Class 6, Indian government schools, economically weaker sections, limited English.

**Question:** Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence: book/reading/a/is/he
**Rubric:** Arranges words into 'He is reading a book.' (subject-verb-object format) Max score: 1

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Misconceptions about English Word Order (SVO):**
    *   **Direct Translation/Mother Tongue Influence:** Many Indian languages (like Hindi, Marathi, etc.) have an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) structure. A common error could be "He book reading is a." or "He a book reading is." This is a significant hurdle as the fundamental sentence structure differs.
    *   **Focus on Keywords:** Students might identify "he," "book," and "reading" as key words and try to string them together without proper grammar, perhaps prioritizing what they perceive as the "action" word.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings/Vocabulary:**
    *   **"a":** While "a" is a common article, in the context of rearranging words, its placement can be tricky. Students might struggle to place it correctly before "book."
    *   **"is":** The auxiliary verb "is" might be misplaced. They know it indicates "being" or "doing" but its exact position after the subject can be confusing if the SVO structure isn't ingrained.
    *   **Understanding "Meaningful Sentence":** The concept of "meaningful" might be interpreted loosely. A sentence that *sort of* makes sense to them, even if grammatically incorrect, might be considered "meaningful."

3.  **Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**
    *   **Most will attempt:** Given it's a rearrangement task with common words, most students will likely *attempt* to do something. They'll recognize the individual words.
    *   **High failure rate among attempts:** While they'll attempt, a large proportion will fail to get the correct SVO order.
    *   **Non-Attempts (very few):** Only those completely overwhelmed by English or who genuinely don't know what "rearrange" means (though the example is simple enough) might not attempt. This would be a small minority.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answers:**

    *   **"He book reading is a." / "He a book reading is." (SOV influence):** This is highly probable due to mother tongue interference.
    *   **"Reading he is a book." / "Reading a book he is." (Prioritizing the action):** Some might put the verb/gerund first, perhaps seeing "reading" as the most active word.
    *   **"Is he reading a book." (Interrogative form mistaken):** While less common for a declarative sentence task, some might mistakenly arrange it as a question if they've only memorized "is he" as a common phrase.
    *   **"A book he is reading." (Object-first, perhaps as an attempt to vary):** Less likely but possible, especially if they are trying different combinations.
    *   **Random jumble that vaguely connects the main words:** "He reading book a is," etc., showing an attempt but no structural understanding.

**Factors Influencing Pass Rate (Considering 29% average):**

*   **Simplicity of words:** The words themselves ("he," "is," "reading," "a," "book") are very common and likely known. This helps.
*   **Fundamental grammatical concept:** Sentence structure (SVO) is fundamental, but also where the biggest interference from L1 occurs.
*   **Practice level:** If students have had consistent practice with simple SVO sentences and rearrangement exercises, their chances improve. However, "limited English" suggests this practice might be inconsistent.
*   **"Meaningful sentence":** This instruction is key. Students who have been taught what a "correct" sentence looks like in English will have an advantage.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:** 35%

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

*   **Slightly above average pass rate (29%):** The words are extremely simple and high-frequency. This isn't a vocabulary test. The core challenge is sentence structure.
*   **SVO Interference:** This is the *biggest* barrier. Many students will instinctively try to apply an L1 sentence structure.
*   **"Is" and "a" placement:** These small words are crucial for correctness and are often misplaced even if the main Subject-Verb-Object are in the right general area.
*   **Repetitive Practice:**
