Let's break down the potential errors for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, keeping in mind their background and the question.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science:**

*   **Definition of "Natural Resources":** This is likely the biggest hurdle.
    *   **"Natural" vs. "Man-made":** Students might confuse natural resources with things found in nature that are *processed* or *built* by humans. For example, they might say "cement" instead of "limestone" or "buildings" instead of "stone."
    *   **Scope of "Resources":** They might focus only on immediate needs like food or water and miss minerals or energy sources.
    *   **Location Specificity:** While Rajasthan is mentioned, they might list generic resources found anywhere (e.g., trees, animals, which are less defining for Rajasthan's economy/geography compared to minerals or water scarcity).
*   **"Influences the lives of people":**
    *   **Abstract Thinking:** Explaining *how* something influences lives requires a slightly abstract thought process beyond just listing. They might struggle to articulate the connection beyond "people use it."
    *   **Cause and Effect:** Understanding that a resource leads to specific livelihoods, challenges, or opportunities might be difficult. For example, instead of explaining how water scarcity leads to agriculture challenges and reliance on wells, they might just say "people drink water."
    *   **Lack of Specific Knowledge about Rajasthan:** Even if they identify a resource like marble, they might not know how it specifically influences Rajasthani lives (e.g., marble industry, sculptures, tourism). Their knowledge might be too general.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Mention any two":** This part is straightforward.
*   **"Natural Resources":** As discussed, this is the core vocabulary challenge. They might translate "natural" literally without understanding the specific Social Science context of "resource."
*   **"Influences":** This word might be slightly advanced. They might understand "changes" or "affects" but struggle to articulate it.
*   **"Explain how... influences":** This requires descriptive writing, which can be challenging in a second language, especially for complex concepts. They might provide a very short, simplistic answer.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **Attempt:** Most students would likely attempt this question, as it's not overly complex in its phrasing (once "natural resources" is understood). They might, however, only list resources without explaining.
*   **Failure:** Failure would likely come from:
    *   Listing non-natural resources (e.g., "forts," "tourism," "clothes").
    *   Listing natural resources but not specific to Rajasthan (e.g., "trees," "animals" without context).
    *   Listing resources but failing to explain the influence, or providing a very superficial explanation.
    *   Listing only one correct resource.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer:**

*   **Scenario 1 (Most likely):** Listing two items, but at least one or both are *not* natural resources in the Social Science context, or not specific/prominent for Rajasthan.
    *   *Example:* "Water, forts." (Forts are man-made).
    *   *Example:* "Trees, animals." (While natural, less distinctive and impactful for Rajasthan's unique challenges/economy compared to water scarcity or minerals).
    *   *Example:* "Food, clothes." (Man-made/processed items).
*   **Scenario 2:** Listing two correct natural resources, but failing to explain the influence of either, or providing a very weak explanation.
    *   *Example:* "Water, Marble. People drink water." (Too simplistic for "explain how it influences").
*   **Scenario 3:** Listing only one correct natural resource.
    *   *Example:* "Water, then nothing else or something incorrect."

**Rubric Analysis:**

The rubric is quite specific: "Mentions two correct natural resources." This means even a good explanation for one won't save them if they only list one, or list one correct and one incorrect. The "explanation" part is secondary to identifying two resources. Given the "Max score: 1," it's highly likely they need *both* correct resources and *some* attempt at explanation, even if brief, to get the point. However, the wording "Mentions two correct natural resources" is the primary hurdle for the point.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%):**

This average pass rate for general questions tells us that students struggle significantly. This specific question, with its precise definition of "natural resources" and regional specificity, is likely harder than a generic
