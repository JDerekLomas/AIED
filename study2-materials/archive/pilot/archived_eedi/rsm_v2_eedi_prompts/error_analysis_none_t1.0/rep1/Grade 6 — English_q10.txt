Let's break down the likely errors for Class 6 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections with limited English attempting the question: "Choose the correct word. There are (some/any) apples in the basket."

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Direct Translation/Literal Meaning:**
    *   **"Any" sounding more absolute/general:** In many Indian languages, a word like "kuch bhi" (anything) or "koi bhi" (anyone) can be used more broadly. Students might hear "any" and associate it with a general sense of *presence* without the negative implication that "any" typically carries in English questions/negations.
    *   **"Some" sounding less definitive:** "Some" might feel less specific or strong than "any" to a student looking for a clear positive statement.

2.  **Lack of Exposure to "Some/Any" Rules:**
    *   The grammatical rule that "some" is used for positive statements and "any" for questions or negative statements is quite specific to English. This is a higher-level grammatical concept that might not have been thoroughly covered or reinforced, especially if the curriculum focuses more on basic vocabulary and sentence formation.
    *   They might have encountered "any" in questions ("Are there any apples?") or negatives ("There aren't any apples"), but not fully grasped the distinction for affirmative statements.

3.  **Confusion with Other Quantifiers/Determiners:**
    *   They might confuse "some/any" with other quantity words they know, even if imperfectly, like "many," "a few," "a lot." The distinction between "some" and "any" might be too subtle for their current grasp of English.

4.  **Phonetic Similarity/Guessing:**
    *   "Some" and "any" are both short, common words. If a student doesn't know the rule, they might simply pick the word that "sounds better" to them, or just guess. There's no inherent phonetic clue that would strongly favor one over the other for a non-native speaker.

5.  **Not Understanding "Choose the Correct Word":**
    *   While unlikely for Class 6, a very weak student might not fully grasp the instruction to *choose* between the two provided words, perhaps trying to write their own word, or not attempting at all due to confusion.

**Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**

*   **Attempt and Fail (Most Common):** The words are short and present. Most students would attempt to choose one. The question format (multiple choice implicitly, as words are in parentheses) encourages an attempt.
*   **Not Attempt at All (Less Common):** Only the very weakest students, or those completely disengaged, would likely leave it blank. The simplicity of the words makes it less intimidating than a complex sentence.

**What would the most common wrong answer look like?**

The most common wrong answer would be **"any"**.

*   **Why "any"?**
    *   It's a common word, often introduced early.
    *   Without understanding the specific "some/any" rule, "any" might feel like a general quantifier, meaning "some quantity of" or "at least one."
    *   It doesn't inherently sound "wrong" in a literal translation sense to a learner without the grammatical nuance.
    *   Students might have learned "any" in a question context ("Do you have *any* books?") and mistakenly apply it here, not understanding the shift for affirmative statements.

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

Given the average pass rate of 29% for general questions, and considering the specific challenges with "some/any":

*   This is a grammatical rule that is often tricky for ESL learners.
*   It requires understanding nuance beyond basic vocabulary.
*   "Any" is a very plausible distractor.

I would estimate this particular question to be slightly harder than the average, as it targets a specific grammatical rule that often requires explicit teaching and practice.

Therefore, I'd lean towards a pass rate slightly below the average.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%**
