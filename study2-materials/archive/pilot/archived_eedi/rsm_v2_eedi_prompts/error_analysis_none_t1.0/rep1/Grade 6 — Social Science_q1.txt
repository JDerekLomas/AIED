Let's break down the potential student responses and errors to arrive at an estimated pass rate.

**Understanding the Target Audience and Context:**

*   **Class 6, Indian Government Schools:** Primarily 10-12 year olds.
*   **Economically Weaker Sections, Limited English:** This is crucial. English will be a significant barrier. General knowledge, especially geographical specifics, might be less solidified compared to a more privileged background.
*   **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This tells us the overall academic performance is low. We should expect a significant number of non-attempts or very poor answers across the board.

**Analysis of Errors:**

**1. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Major":** While most students might grasp "big," the nuance of "major" in a geographical context (prominence, length, height) might be missed. They might list any small hill they know.
*   **"Mountain Ranges":** This is the biggest language hurdle.
    *   They might understand "mountain" (पहाड़), but "range" (श्रृंखला) is a more abstract concept. They might just list individual peaks if they even know them, or simply "mountain."
    *   They might confuse "mountain ranges" with other geographical features: rivers, deserts, plains, plateaus. This is a very common type of conceptual confusion at this level.
    *   They might confuse it with states or cities.
*   **"Located in India":** This is relatively straightforward, but if they confuse mountain ranges with other features, their "in India" filter will also fail.

**2. Misconceptions about Social Science (Geography Specific):**

*   **Lack of Specific Geographical Knowledge:**
    *   Many students might simply not know the names of specific mountain ranges, even in their local language. Their curriculum might touch upon them, but memorization and retention can be low.
    *   They might know "Himalayas" as a general concept of "big mountains to the north," but struggle to name others.
    *   Confusion between mountain ranges and individual mountains (e.g., Mount Everest is a peak, not a range, though the Himalayas are the range it's in).
*   **Confusion with Other Landforms:** As mentioned, mixing up mountains with rivers (Ganga, Yamuna), deserts (Thar), or plateaus (Deccan) is a very high probability.
*   **Local Bias:** They might list a small local hill or an area they are familiar with, which isn't a major mountain range in India.
*   **Simply not knowing/retaining information:** Even if taught, many students at this level, especially in challenging environments, struggle with recall.

**3. Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**

*   **Non-Attempt:** Given the low overall pass rate (29%), a significant percentage will likely leave it blank. This could be due to complete lack of knowledge, inability to understand the question, or simply giving up. I would estimate 20-30% non-attempts.
*   **Attempt but Fail:** This will be the majority. They will attempt but provide incorrect answers due to the reasons listed above.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **Rivers:** Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Brahmaputra. (Very high likelihood)
*   **States/Cities:** Delhi, Mumbai, Uttar Pradesh. (Moderate likelihood)
*   **Deserts/Plains/Plateaus:** Thar Desert, Northern Plains, Deccan Plateau. (Moderate likelihood)
*   **General "Mountains":** Simply writing "mountains" (पहाड़) or "big mountains."
*   **Individual peaks (if they know any):** Everest (though not *in* India), K2 (partly in India but less commonly known as a range).
*   **Local, non-major hills.**
*   **Single, unidentifiable word/gibberish.**

**Applying the Rubric (0.5 max score for one correct):**

The rubric is quite generous – *any one* correct major mountain range gets 0.5 points. This means partial knowledge is rewarded.

**Estimation Process:**

Let's break down the student population:

1.  **Non-Attempts:** ~25%
    *   Score: 0
2.  **Totally Wrong (due to language, concepts, or sheer lack of knowledge):** ~45%
    *   These are the ones writing rivers, states, deserts, "mountains" (too generic), etc.
    *   Score: 0
3.  **Partially Correct/Exactly Correct:** ~30%

    *   Within this 30%, let's consider:
        *   **Knowing
