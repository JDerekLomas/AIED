Let's break down the likely errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Errors:**

1.  **"Do you think..." Misinterpretation:**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might interpret "Do you think" as simply asking for a yes/no answer without realizing the need for a reason. They might think a simple "Yes" or "No" is sufficient.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** The nuance of "Do you think X? Give a reason" is often lost. They might not understand that the *reason* is the crucial part for marks.
    *   **Attempt/Failure:** Many will attempt, but only give "Yes" or "No" and fail to provide a reason, thus scoring 0.

2.  **"King's questions" Misunderstanding (Connecting to the Passage):**
    *   **Misconception:** While the prompt states "based on the reading passage," some students might struggle to recall the *specific* questions the king had, or the *purpose* of those questions. They might remember "the king had questions" but not *what* they were about.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** "King's questions" might be too abstract if they haven't internalized the passage well. They might think "questions" in a general sense, not relating them to the "right time, right thing, right people."
    *   **Attempt/Failure:** They might try to give a reason, but it could be generic ("questions are always important") and not connect to the *importance in real life* for the *king's specific questions*.

3.  **"Important in real life" Misinterpretation:**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might struggle to bridge the gap between a story/fable and "real life applicability." They might think, "This is a story, so it's not real life."
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** "Real life" might be understood too literally as "happening right now outside." The abstract concept of universal truths or practical wisdom might be difficult to grasp.
    *   **Attempt/Failure:** They might give a reason like "No, because kings don't exist anymore" or "Yes, because kings are powerful," which doesn't address the *substance* of the king's questions.

4.  **"Give one reason" (Specificity and Articulation):**
    *   **Misconception:** Even if they understand the question, articulating a clear, coherent reason in English can be a significant hurdle. Their vocabulary might be limited.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** They might have a valid idea but struggle to form it into a grammatically correct or understandable sentence.
    *   **Attempt/Failure:** They might write something vague or grammatically incorrect that doesn't fully convey a valid reason, leading to a 0.
    *   **Most Common Wrong Answer Look-Alike:** Vague statements like "Yes, it is important," "Yes, we need to know everything," or "No, because it is a story."

5.  **Not Attempting at All:**
    *   Some students, especially those with very low English proficiency or lacking confidence, might skip the question entirely if they don't understand it after a quick read. This could be due to the multi-part nature ("Do you think... Give one reason").

**Common Wrong Answers & Why:**

*   **"Yes." / "No." (and nothing else):** Students understood "Do you think..." but missed or ignored "Give one reason."
*   **"Yes, it is important." (too vague):** Understood the importance but couldn't articulate *why* or connect it to the king's specific questions.
*   **"Yes, because king is big." / "No, because story is fake." (irrelevant reasoning):** Misunderstood "important in real life" or couldn't link the questions' content to real-world applicability.
*   **"King asked about right time." (descriptive, not reasoned):** Recalled the questions but didn't state *why* that makes them important in real life.
*   **Broken English/Grammatically Incorrect (but with a kernel of truth):** This is where markers might be lenient, but many might fail to convey a full valid reason. e.g., "Yes, because we learn from mistakes." (Could be seen as valid, but if poorly phrased, might not get marks).

**Estimation of Pass Rate:**

Considering the average pass rate of 29% and the multiple layers of difficulty:

*   Many will only give "Yes/No." (0 marks)
*   Many will give vague or irrelevant reasons. (0 marks)
*   Many will struggle with
