Let's break down the question and estimate the proportion of Class 7 Indian government school students who would answer it correctly.

**Question:** Find the area of a triangle whose base is `8` cm and height is `6` cm.

**Rubric:** States or uses the correct formula for the area of a triangle: `Area = 1/2 × base × height`. Max score: 1

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geometric Shapes:** Basic understanding of what a triangle is, and concepts of base and height in a geometric context. This is generally taught by Class 7.
    *   **Measurement:** Understanding of "cm" as a unit of length and what area represents (amount of surface).
    *   **Arithmetic Operations:** Multiplication, specifically with fractions (1/2 or 0.5) and whole numbers.
    *   **Formulas:** The concept that a specific formula exists for calculating area of shapes.

2.  **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   "Find the area": "Area" might be a familiar term if taught in English, or students might mentally translate it to a Hindi equivalent like "kshetra" (क्षेत्र). "Find" is a common directive.
    *   "triangle": Again, potentially known or easily recognizable.
    *   "whose base is 8 cm": "Base" is a critical mathematical term. This is likely one of the biggest language hurdles. They would need to know the English word "base" and its corresponding Hindi term ("aadhaar" - आधार).
    *   "and height is 6 cm": "Height" is another critical mathematical term, likely to be known or translated as "unchai" (ऊंचाई).
    *   **Overall:** The sentence structure is straightforward, not complex. The key is recognizing "base" and "height" as the variables for the formula.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of a learned formula. Students need to *recall* the formula for the area of a triangle, *identify* the base and height from the given information, and then *substitute* these values into the formula to calculate the result.
    *   It involves very minimal *reasoning* beyond understanding the problem's request and knowing which formula to apply. There are no trick questions, distractors, or complex multi-step logical deductions required.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Ease:** This is about as *basic* and *direct* as a geometry application question gets at the Class 7 level. It's a textbook "example" problem.
    *   **Directness:** It provides all necessary information explicitly and directly. There's no need to infer or calculate the base or height from other given data (e.g., finding the height using Pythagoras theorem, which would be Class 8 or 9).
    *   **Numerical Simplicity:** The numbers (8 and 6) are small, whole numbers, leading to a simple multiplication: 1/2 * 8 * 6 = 4 * 6 = 24. No complicated decimals or large numbers.

**Contrastive Analysis Summary:**

*   **Positive factors (making it easier):** Very direct question, standard formula application, simple numbers, no complex reasoning. The average pass rate of 29% usually includes more challenging reasoning-based or multi-step problems. This specific item is significantly simpler than many items contributing to that average.
*   **Negative factors (making it harder):** English language barrier for "base" and "height," potential forgetfulness of the exact formula (specifically the `1/2` factor).

Given that geometry is a core topic, and the area of a triangle is one of the *first* and *most fundamental* area formulas taught, many students would have encountered and practiced this. Even if English medium students grasp this readily, the Hindi medium students will be taught the formula using Hindi terms. The crucial point for them would be to correctly map the English "base" to "आधार" and "height" to "ऊंचाई." Most schools, even Hindi medium, do introduce common mathematical terms in English, alongside Hindi.

Considering the simplicity of the numbers and the directness of the question, this is likely one of the easier items on such an exam, pulling the expected success rate *above* the average of 29%.

I anticipate that a good portion of students will have memorized this fundamental formula and be able to apply it. The main pitfalls would be:
1.  Forgetting the 1/2 factor.
2.  Confusing the area of a triangle with a rectangle.
3.
