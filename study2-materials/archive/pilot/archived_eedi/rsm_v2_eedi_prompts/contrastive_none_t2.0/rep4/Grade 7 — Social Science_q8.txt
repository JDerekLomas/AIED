Here's a contrastive analysis and the estimated proportion correct for the given question:

## Contrastive Analysis of the Question:

"What are the main occupations of people in the rural areas of Rajasthan? Describe any one in brief."

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **State-specific knowledge:** The question specifically mentions "Rajasthan." While general knowledge about Indian rural life is helpful, students need to be able to apply this specifically to Rajasthan or at least be familiar with typical desert/arid region occupations.
*   **Basic understanding of "occupation":** Most Class 7 students would grasp this concept.
*   **Awareness of rural life characteristics:** They should know that rural areas differ from urban ones and have distinct economic activities.
*   **General geography/climates of India:** An implicit understanding that Rajasthan is a relatively dry state with desert/semi-desert regions would help connect to animal husbandry and certain types of agriculture.

**2. Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency Context):**

*   **"Main occupations":** This phrase is relatively straightforward. "Main" is common, "occupations" is a core vocabulary word in Social Science.
*   **"Rural areas":** Another fundamental term.
*   **"Rajasthan":** A proper noun, easy to recognize.
*   **"Describe any one in brief":** "Describe" is a standard command word. "In brief" indicates conciseness.
*   **Overall complexity:** The sentence structure is simple declarative, then an imperative. No complex conjunctions or embedded clauses.

**3. Type of Cognitive Process:**

*   **Recall:** Identifying the main occupations is primarily recall of information learned from textbooks, discussions, or general knowledge.
*   **Brief Description (Application/Simple Reasoning):** Describing one occupation in brief moves slightly beyond pure recall into a very basic application or simple reasoning. For example, describing agriculture might involve mentioning farming crops, or animal husbandry might involve mentioning rearing animals for milk/wool. This is not complex analytical reasoning.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Standard difficulty:** This question is quite standard for a Class 7 Social Science (Geography/Civics) textbook exercise.
*   **Information Availability:** Textbooks at this level for Class 7 in India often have dedicated chapters or sections on "Rural Livelihoods," "States of India," or specific regions, which would cover this content explicitly.
*   **Expected Depth:** The "in brief" part of the description indicates that a superficial understanding, rather than detailed analysis, is sufficient, matching the level.
*   **Contrast to Harder Questions:** Harder questions might involve comparing rural occupations across different regions (e.g., Rajasthan vs. Kerala), analyzing reasons for specific occupations, or proposing solutions to challenges faced by these occupations. This question doesn't go there.

**What Makes this SPECIFIC Question Easy/Hard:**

*   **Easy:**
    *   **Direct Recall:** The main occupations (agriculture, animal husbandry) are extremely common knowledge for rural India and often highlighted for states like Rajasthan.
    *   **Simple Language:** The English is clear and uses common Social Science vocabulary.
    *   **Broad Acceptability for "Main Occupations":** The rubric allows for "at least two main occupations," giving flexibility. Students might name farming, cattle rearing, pottery, handicrafts, labor work – many are likely correct within the "main" category.
    *   **Relatability:** Students from economically weaker sections often have direct or indirect exposure to these occupations in their families or communities, even if they're not in Rajasthan.
    *   **Explicit Curriculum Content:** This is a very common topic covered in textbooks.
*   **Hard:**
    *   **"Rajasthan" Specificity:** If a student hasn't specifically studied Rajasthan, they might provide general Indian rural occupations, which might still overlap significantly but may miss nuanced or region-specific ones (though agriculture and animal husbandry are generally correct for Rajasthan).
    *   **Naming *Two* and Describing *One*:** Some students might just name one or just list, and not attempt the description, especially if they are trying to rush or avoid longer answers in English.
    *   **Spelling and Grammar for Description:** While the content might be known, writing it in grammatically acceptable English can be a hurdle for some students with very limited English proficiency. However, the rubric suggests a focus on content for the description ("brief") rather than perfect grammar.

**Overall Assessment:** This question is **easier than average** for a Class 7 Social Science question in English, especially given the "average pass rate across items on this exam is about 29%." The content is fundamental, the language is simple, and the cognitive demand is mostly recall with a touch of very basic application. The ability to correctly identify
