Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the typical context.

**Contrastive Analysis of Difficulty:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Time Calculation:** Students need to understand how to calculate time difference between AM and PM. This involves knowing there are 12 hours between AM and PM cycles (e.g., 10 am to 12 pm is 2 hours, 12 pm to 4 pm is 4 hours, totaling 6 hours). This is a common Class 4-5 skill.
    *   **Multiplication:** They need to multiply the hourly temperature increase by the number of hours (2 * 6 = 12). This is a basic arithmetic skill, well within Class 6 expectations.
    *   **Addition:** They need to add the initial temperature to the total increase (30 + 12 = 42). Another basic arithmetic skill.
    *   **Context:** Understanding temperature (degrees Celsius) and how it changes over time. This is generally familiar from daily life and basic science.
    *   **No Negative Numbers:** Crucially, the temperature *increases*, and all values are positive. This avoids the complication of negative numbers often introduced later or with more complex temperature problems.

*   **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   "at `10` am in the morning": Fairly straightforward. "morning" reinforces "am."
    *   "temperature of Jodhpur was `30^0 C`": "Temperature" and "degrees Celsius" are standard terms often introduced visually or with practical examples.
    *   "If the temperature increases by `2^0 C` per hour": "Increases by" is a key phrase. "Per hour" indicates a rate. These are moderately challenging but often encountered in word problems. The word "increases" strongly signals addition later.
    *   "then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?": "What will be" signals future state, "evening" reinforces "pm." This phrasing is common for a "find the final value" type of question.
    *   **Overall:** The language uses relatively common mathematical problem vocabulary. The presence of specific numerical values (10 am, 30°C, 2°C, 4:00 pm) provides concrete anchor points. Students might struggle with "per hour" if they just see "increases" and jump to just adding 2, but the full context usually guides them. This problem's English is **manageable but requires careful reading** for students with limited proficiency. A Hindi translation would make it significantly easier.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application** of arithmetic concepts (time calculation, multiplication, addition) within a real-world scenario.
    *   There's a minor element of **reasoning** required to first calculate the duration, then the total increase, then the final temperature. It's a multi-step problem, not a single recall or direct calculation.

*   **Difficulty compared to typical textbook exercises:**
    *   This problem is a **standard multi-step word problem**. It's harder than a direct calculation (e.g., "What is 30 + 12?") but not as hard as problems involving fractions, decimals, or complex geometry at the Class 6 level.
    *   Similar problems involving speed/distance/time, work rates, or simple interest (though often not explicitly stated as such at Class 6) often have this structure.
    *   The "time elapsed" calculation between AM and PM is often a separate skill practiced before being integrated into such word problems.

**Summary of Difficulty Factors:**

*   **Easier:**
    *   Positive numbers only.
    *   Common arithmetic operations.
    *   Familiar context (temperature).
    *   The increase is linear and consistent.
*   **Harder:**
    *   Multi-step problem (time difference -> total increase -> final temp).
    *   Calculating time difference between AM/PM requires attention.
    *   Language demands for EAL students (though manageable).

**Likely Errors:**

1.  **Time Calculation Error:** Most common might be calculating 10-4 as 6 hours directly, without understanding AM/PM transition (e.g., 4 - 10, or 12 - 10 = 2, 4 - 0 = 4; so 2+4=6). Students might get 14 hours by misunderstanding the "pm" part (thinking 4 pm as 16 hours from midnight). However, Class 6 curriculum typically covers AM/
