Let's break down the question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, focusing on the specific context provided.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Direct Knowledge:** Students are expected to have some geographical knowledge of Rajasthan, specifically its rural characteristics. This is a very common topic in Class 6/7 Social Science (Geography and sometimes Civics/Social and Political Life). They would likely have learned about different types of regions (mountains, plains, deserts, coastal areas) and associated livelihoods. Rajasthan's desert/semi-desert environment and traditional occupations (agriculture, animal husbandry) are foundational.
    *   **General Understanding:** They need to understand what "occupations" and "rural areas" mean. This should be covered extensively by Class 7.
    *   **"Main occupations":** This implies they need to identify the most prevalent, not every possible minor occupation. This judgment comes with understanding the core economy of rural Rajasthan.

2.  **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   **"What are the main occupations..."**: "Main" and "occupations" are relatively common vocabulary in Social Science, even for students with limited English. They are likely to have encountered these terms repeatedly in their English medium social science textbooks, even if the primary instruction is Hindi.
    *   **"...of people in the rural areas of Rajasthan?"**: "Rural areas" is also standard. "Rajasthan" is a known proper noun.
    *   **"Describe any one in brief."**: This part increases the linguistic load slightly, requiring not just recall but a brief formulation. "Describe" and "brief" are common directives in exams.
    *   **Overall:** The vocabulary is **moderate** for this group. It uses key terms often reinforced in Social Science contexts. The prompt structure is straightforward (What are X? Describe one). The major barrier is if the student completely lacks basic Social Science English vocabulary. However, given their exposure through textbooks, this set of terms should be among the more recognizable ones.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall (Primary):** Identifying "main occupations" is primarily a recall task based on learned content about Rajasthan's geography and economy.
    *   **Application (Minor):** Selecting "any one" to describe in brief involves a minor application of knowledge about the chosen occupation, but the description itself would likely be recall of a few key facts about it.
    *   **Reasoning (Minimal):** There is very little higher-order reasoning required beyond selecting relevant information.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question is a **very typical** short-answer or even multiple-choice question found in Indian government school textbooks for Class 6/7 Social Science. Questions asking about the occupations of people in different regions are extremely common.
    *   The "describe any one in brief" part makes it slightly more open-ended than just listing, but still well within the expected scope. Textbooks often have "short answer type questions" that expect this level of detail.

**Synthesis of Difficulty:**

*   **Content:** The content itself (occupations in rural Rajasthan) is foundational and widely covered. It's not obscure or complex.
*   **Language:** While English is a barrier, the specific vocabulary used here ("occupations," "rural areas," "Rajasthan," "describe," "brief") is core Social Science vocabulary. If a student understands *any* English from Social Science, these words are high probability candidates.
*   **Cognitive Load:** It's largely recall. The second part requires slightly more, but it's not analytical or highly complex.
*   **Familiarity:** The question structure and content type are highly familiar from regular textbook exercises and class discussions.

Given that the average pass rate across items on this exam is about 29%, this question is likely to be **easier than average** because:
*   The content is central and frequently taught.
*   The English vocabulary, though a challenge, uses common Social Science terms.
*   It's a straightforward recall task, which many students with rote learning strategies can manage.
*   The "describe any one in brief" doesn't demand sophisticated writing, just a couple of pertinent points.
*   Crucially, Class 7 students are at a stage where regional geography and livelihoods are heavily emphasized.

**Factors potentially reducing the score:**
*   Complete lack of English comprehension for *any* of the key terms.
*   Poor recall of specific information about Rajasthan.
*   Confusing rural Rajasthan with urban areas or other regions.
*   Not being able to "describe in brief" even if they name an occupation. (Though the rubric only specifies naming two occupations for max score,
