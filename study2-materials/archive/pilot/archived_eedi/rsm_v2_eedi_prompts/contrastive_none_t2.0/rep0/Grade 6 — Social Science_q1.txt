Let's break down the question and its demands on Class 6 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis of the Question:**

*   **What prior knowledge is assumed?**
    *   **Geographical Vocabulary:** Students need to understand terms like "mountain range," "located in," and "India."
    *   **Basic Indian Geography:** They must have been exposed to the names and locations of India's major physical features, particularly mountains. This content is usually covered in Class 5 or Class 6 Social Science (Geography) textbooks in India. Topics like "Physical Divisions of India" or "Major Landforms" would cover this.
    *   **Recall of Specific Names:** Students need to recall the *names* of at least one specific mountain range.

*   **What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
    *   **Core Vocabulary:** "Name," "two," "major," "mountain ranges," "located in," "India."
        *   "Mountain ranges" is a key phrase. While the individual words "mountain" and "range" might be familiar, the compound phrase might be slightly less common in their daily English usage. However, the Hindi equivalents (पर्वत श्रृंखला, पहाड़) are directly taught in geography classes.
        *   "Major" might be the most abstract word here, implying a requirement for significant or well-known ranges. However, in the context of their studies, they would have only learned the "major" ones anyway.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple interrogative sentence. "Name any two X Y in Z." This is a straightforward construction.
    *   **Context:** The context is clearly geographical, which aligns with specific topics taught in Social Science.
    *   **Overall:** The language is quite basic and uses words frequently encountered in a classroom setting, especially for Social Science/Geography. The concepts (mountain, India) are very foundational. A student with even minimal English literacy for academic purposes would likely grasp the core meaning if they knew the Hindi equivalent terms and the content.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Pure Recall:** This is a direct recall question. There's no application of concepts or complex reasoning required. Students simply need to remember names associated with a category.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Low Difficulty:** This question is very similar to "fill in the blanks," "match the following," or "name the following" type exercises found in Class 5/6 Social Science textbooks, particularly in the geography sections on physical features of India. It's a fundamental fact they are expected to memorize.
    *   **Scaffolding in Rubric:** The rubric requires only *one* correct answer for 0.5 marks, making it even easier. Many Class 6 exercises might ask for two or three, but for full credit.

**Factors Influencing Difficulty for This Specific Group:**

*   **Economically Weaker Sections:**
    *   May have fewer external resources (books at home, digital learning aids).
    *   Parental literacy might be lower, reducing at-home support for English or academics.
    *   Could lead to less exposure and reinforcement of academic concepts, potentially making recall harder if initial classroom learning wasn't robust.
*   **Hindi-medium Schools:**
    *   While the English terms might not be used in daily conversation, the academic equivalents are taught. Students are often expected to know both the local language (Hindi) terms and the English terms for key geographical features as they progress.
    *   The core geographical knowledge itself (names of ranges) is taught in Hindi. The barrier is primarily translating that recalled Hindi knowledge into English words they have been taught. Given the basic vocabulary, this should not be an insurmountable barrier for a student who *knows* the answer in Hindi.
*   **Limited English Proficiency:** This is the primary hurdle. However, as noted above, the specific English vocabulary for *this* question is foundational and likely to be among the first geographical terms taught in English alongside their Hindi equivalents.
*   **Average Pass Rate ~29%:** This is a crucial benchmark. Questions often include a mix of difficulties. A "pass rate" of 29% for *all* items suggests that a significant number of items are quite challenging.

**Estimating Proportion Correct:**

Considering all the factors:

*   The *concept* (major Indian mountains) is fundamental to Class 5/6 geography.
*   The *question type* is pure recall, which is straightforward.
*   The *English vocabulary* required is basic for a school context and often reinforced.
*   The *rubric* only requires one correct answer, significantly lowering the bar.
*   However, the background of students (
