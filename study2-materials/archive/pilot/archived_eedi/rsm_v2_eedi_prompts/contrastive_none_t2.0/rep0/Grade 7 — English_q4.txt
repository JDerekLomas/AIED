Let's break down the question and its demands.

**Question:** "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Reading Comprehension:** Students must have understood the preceding passage about the king and his three questions (the right time, the right thing, the right people). This is fundamental. If they didn't grasp the core of the king's questions from the passage, answering this specific question correctly is impossible.
*   **Basic Understanding of "Importance":** Students need to grasp the concept of something being "important" in a general sense. This is a very common and simple vocabulary word.
*   **General World Knowledge/Common Sense:** The "real life" aspect requires students to connect the king's abstract concerns to practical implications. They don't need highly specialized knowledge, but rather an ability to see the practical utility of planning, discerning what's important, and choosing collaborators wisely.

**Language Demands:**
*   **"Do you think":** Straightforward request for an opinion.
*   **"King's questions":** Direct reference to the passage. If "questions" were plural and there was only one question, that could be tricky, but in this case, "questions" (plural) clearly refers to the three.
*   **"Important":** Very common English word, likely taught early.
*   **"Real life":** Another common phrase. "Life" itself is very common; "real" adds emphasis, but doesn't make it much harder.
*   **"Give one reason":** A simple command, requiring a supporting statement. This is the part that might demand a slightly more complex sentence structure than a simple 'yes/no'.

Compared to many other English texts, the vocabulary and sentence structure here are relatively simple. There are no complex grammatical constructions (e.g., passive voice, multiple clauses, idiomatic expressions). The abstractness is not in the language itself, but in the concept of "importance" and its application to life decisions.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
*   **Recall:** Students need to recall what the king's questions *were* from the passage. This is implied understanding.
*   **Application:** Students must *apply* the concept of the king's questions to a "real-life" context beyond the story itself.
*   **Reasoning:** This is the primary skill. Students must reason *why* these types of questions (time, action, people) would be important in real life, formulating a simple logical connection.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   Many textbook exercises focus on direct recall or paraphrasing information from a passage. This question goes a step further by requiring a personal opinion ("Do you think...") and a justification ("Give one reason") that draws on broader reasoning skills, not just rote memorization or direct textual extraction.
*   However, it's not overly complex. "Why" questions requiring simple justifications are common even at lower levels in various subjects. The reason doesn't need to be profound; any valid, simple reason suffices (e.g., "so you don't waste time," "to make good decisions," "to avoid problems").
*   The fact that a simple 'yes' and *any* valid reason (even implicitly stated) will get full marks makes it relatively forgiving compared to more precise, content-specific answers.

**Contrastive Analysis for Limited English Speakers:**
*   **Positive:** The core vocabulary ("think," "king," "questions," "important," "real life," "reason") is quite basic and frequently encountered. There are no specialized academic terms or culturally specific references that might be alien.
*   **Neutral:** The question requires synthesis of the passage's content and a personal opinion/justification. Students from rote-learning environments might struggle more with expressing personal opinions or providing reasons, even in their native language, if they are unaccustomed to such tasks. They might look for an "answer" *in the text* rather than generating one.
*   **Negative:** Formulating even a simple "reason" in English, when one's proficiency is limited, can be a hurdle. They might understand the concept perfectly in Hindi but struggle to articulate it in a complete English sentence. A common strategy for limited English speakers is to give short, incomplete answers, or resort to "yes" without a follow-up.

Given the average pass rate of 29% for other items, we're looking at a base difficulty. This question has elements that make it potentially easier and potentially harder than that average.

**Factors making it easier:**
*   Very simple vocabulary and sentence structure.
*   Relatable concept (making good choices).
*   Any valid reason is accepted.
*   A 'yes
