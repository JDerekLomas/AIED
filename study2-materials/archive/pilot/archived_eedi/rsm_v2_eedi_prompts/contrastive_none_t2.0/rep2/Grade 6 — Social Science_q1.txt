Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and an estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis: "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."

### Prior Knowledge Assumed:
*   **Basic understanding of geography:** Students need to know what a "mountain range" is. This concept is typically introduced early in Social Science/Geography.
*   **Knowledge of India's physical features:** Specifically, recognition of major mountain ranges within India. The major ranges like Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, and Eastern Ghats are fundamental geographical features of India and are invariably taught in Class 6 or earlier grades in Social Science textbooks. Many state board textbooks include detailed maps and descriptions of these features.
*   **Recall of specific names:** This is the core task – recalling the names.

### Language Demands:
*   **"Name any two":** This is a straightforward instruction. "Any two" implies flexibility, reducing the pressure to recall specific ones out of a list.
*   **"Major mountain ranges":** "Major" is a key adjective, guiding students to well-known ranges, not obscure local hills. "Mountain ranges" is standard geographical terminology.
*   **"located in India":** Clear geographical scope.

Given the Hindi-medium context and limited English proficiency:
*   While the English terms "major mountain ranges" might not be instantly familiar to all, the underlying geographical concept of "pahad shrunkhala" or "parvat shrunkhala" (mountain range) is absolutely standard and frequently taught in Hindi.
*   The names of the ranges (Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, etc.) are often pronounced and written very similarly in Hindi and English. Many students might recognize "Himalaya" even if they struggle with other English words.
*   The overall sentence structure is simple, direct, and active. There are no complex grammatical structures or obscure vocabulary.

### Recall, Application, or Reasoning?
*   **Pure Recall:** This is a straightforward recall question. There's no application of concepts or complex reasoning involved. Students either know the names or they don't.

### Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:
*   This question is highly typical of Class 6 Social Science/Geography exercises. Such questions often appear as "Fill in the blanks," "Name the following," "Match the columns," or short answer questions in chapter-end exercises or internal assessments.
*   Textbooks at this level heavily emphasize identifying and naming key geographical features. Maps showing these features are always prominent.
*   The question directly tests foundational knowledge that is core to the Class 6 Geography curriculum.

### Factors Making it Easier:
1.  **Fundamental Topic:** Mountain ranges of India are a core Class 6 Geography topic.
2.  **Recall, Not Application:** Requires direct recall, which is often tested explicitly.
3.  **Simple Language:** Basic English, direct sentence structure, familiar geographical terms.
4.  **"Any two":** Offers flexibility; students don't need to recall a specific two, just *any* two from a list of several major ones.
5.  **Names are often cognates/familiar:** Names like 'Himalaya' are widely known even to those with limited English.
6.  **Visual Learning:** These topics are often taught with maps, aiding recognition.

### Factors Making it Harder:
1.  **Limited English Proficiency (for *some* students):** While the question is simple, some students may still struggle with any English.
2.  **Retention:** Students might have learned the topic but forgotten the specific names.
3.  **Pressure:** Test-taking anxiety could affect recall.
4.  **Misspellings:** Even if they know the answer, poor English spelling could make them hesitate or get it marked incorrect if not within the rubric's tolerance. (However, the rubric is generous: "Names one correct mountain range... Max score: 0.5") This indicates partial credit for just one name, which significantly eases the burden.

## Estimated Proportion Correct:

Given that this is a core concept, taught repeatedly, involves simple language, and the rubric is very generous (0.5 for *one* correct answer), the difficulty is relatively low for an item on a test where the average pass rate is 29%.

*   Most students, even from disadvantaged backgrounds, would have been exposed to the names of major mountain ranges like the Himalayas, Aravalli, and Vindhyas.
*   The flexibility of "any two" (or even "one" for partial credit) significantly increases the chances of success.
*   The phonetic similarity of the names across Hindi and English would aid recognition.

I believe a significant proportion of students, even with the stated constraints, would be able to recall
