Let's break down the question "Define fable" for Class 8 Indian government school students.

### Contrastive Analysis of "Define fable."

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Understanding of "Story":** Very high likelihood, this is a fundamental concept in all languages and cultures.
*   **Understanding of "Moral Lesson":** Also very high likelihood. Concepts of right/wrong, good/bad behavior, and lessons from stories are culturally ubiquitous and part of traditional education and family narratives.
*   **Familiarity with the *Concept* of Fables:** High likelihood, even if not explicitly labeled "fable." Many traditional Indian folktales (e.g., from Panchatantra, Jataka tales) align perfectly with the definition of a fable – short stories, often with talking animals, teaching a moral. Students would have heard such stories in their homes or local languages.
*   **Knowledge of the English word "Fable":** This is the crucial gap. While the *concept* is known, the specific English *term* might be new or unfamiliar. Their textbooks might cover such stories but label them as "moral stories," "animal stories," or by their traditional Indian names, rather than consistently using "fable."

**2. Language Demands (for students with limited English):**

*   **"Define":** This is a fairly common instructional verb. Most students would understand they need to explain what something is. It's not particularly complex vocabulary.
*   **"Fable":** This is the primary linguistic hurdle. If a student has never encountered this word or heard it used in their English classes, they will not be able to answer, even if they know dozens of fables.
*   **Expected Output Language:** The rubric expects English output. While the *concept* might be clearer in Hindi/regional language, formulating the definition in English, using terms like "short story," "typically," "characters," "imparts," "moral lesson," requires a certain level of productive English vocabulary and sentence structure.

**3. Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   This is primarily **Recall**. Students need to recall the established definition of "fable." There's no application or complex reasoning involved beyond bringing up learned information.
*   If they haven't learned the English word "fable" and its definition, they cannot answer. They can't "reason" out the meaning of "fable" if it's unfamiliar.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Recognition of the *concept* in a textbook:** Easy. Students would recognize stories like "The Ant and the Grasshopper" as a moral story with animals.
*   **Being asked to *define* a specific English literary term like "fable":** Potentially difficult.
    *   Many textbooks for this demographic might prioritize functional English, basic grammar, and simpler comprehension exercises over formal literary terminology.
    *   While they *might* have encountered it, it's not as guaranteed as, say, defining "noun" or "verb."
    *   The typical pass rate of 29% for general items suggests that even moderately difficult vocabulary and conceptual recall in English is a significant challenge for the majority.

### Contrastive Summary:

*   **What makes it easy:** The underlying *concept* is highly familiar and culturally relevant. "Define" is a straightforward instruction.
*   **What makes it hard:** The specific English *term* "fable" is the critical barrier. Even if students understand the *idea* perfectly in their mother tongue and could list examples, without having learned the English word and its specific definition, they cannot fulfill the rubric requirements. The demand for specific English vocabulary in the definition (e.g., "imparts," "moral lesson") also adds a layer of difficulty beyond just knowing "fable."

### Estimate:

Given that the average pass rate is 29% across items, and "Define fable" hinges heavily on recall of a specific English term that may not be universally taught or retained:

*   A significant portion of students will have *never* encountered "fable" or "define fable" in their English curriculum, or only fleetingly.
*   Even if taught, retaining a formal literary term's definition can be harder than basic vocabulary or simple sentence comprehension.
*   The requirement for accurate English phrasing in the definition also filters out many.

I would estimate it to be around the lower end of the average or slightly below, primarily due to the vocabulary hurdle of "fable" itself.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **20%**
