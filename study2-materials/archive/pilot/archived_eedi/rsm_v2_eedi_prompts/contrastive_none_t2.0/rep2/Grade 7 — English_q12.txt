## Contrastive Analysis: "Change to Passive Voice" (Class 7, Indian Government Schools)

Here's an analysis of the question and its suitability for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their typical background:

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Understanding of "Sentence":** Basic recognition of a sentence and its components (subject, verb, object). This is usually covered by Class 5-6.
*   **Concepts of "Active" and "Passive" Voice:** This is a more advanced grammatical concept. It is introduced, often briefly, in Class 6 or 7. Many textbooks will explain the "who does what" versus "what is done" distinction.
*   **Verb Tenses (Past Simple):** Students need to recognize "blew" as the past tense of "blow" and be able to use the past participle "blown." Past tense forms are taught much earlier, but irregular past participles (like blow-blew-blown) can be tricky.
*   **Subject-Verb Agreement:** Implicitly, they need to know "leaves" (plural) takes "were" (plural helping verb).
*   **Prepositional Phrases:** Understanding how "by the wind" functions in the passive structure.

**2. Language Demands (English Proficiency):**

*   **Grammatical Terminology:** "Active Voice," "Passive Voice," "Sentence" are specific English grammatical terms. While "वाच्य" (vachya) is the Hindi equivalent for voice, the direct mapping and understanding of these English terms will be challenging for students who primarily learn grammar in Hindi.
*   **Instructional Phrase:** "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice." This sentence itself is quite advanced. Students need to grasp "change," "following sentence," and the two voice terms.
*   **Lexicon:**
    *   **"wind"**: Common noun, likely known.
    *   **"blew"**: Past tense of "blow." While "blow" itself (फूंकना, हवा चलना) might be known, "blew" (उड़ा दिया) in this context might require understanding the context rather than direct translation.
    *   **"leaves"**: Common noun, likely known (पत्ते).
    *   **"away"**: Common adverb, likely known (दूर).
    *   The original sentence "The wind blew the leaves away" itself uses relatively simple vocabulary and a straightforward past-tense structure, which helps.
*   **Abstract Concepts:** Voice transformation is an abstract grammatical concept. Even if they know the words, applying them to the rules can be difficult if the underlying concept hasn't been solidified through extensive practice.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

*   **Application (primarily) with elements of Recall:**
    *   **Recall:** Recalling the *rules* for converting active to passive voice (Object of active becomes subject of passive, suitable 'be' verb + past participle, 'by' + subject of active becomes object of preposition).
    *   **Application:** Applying these rules to a specific sentence, involving changing verb forms (blew -> were blown), identifying subject/object, and constructing the new sentence.
    *   It's less about complex reasoning and more about rule-based transformation.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Difficulty Level:** This specific sentence ("The wind blew the leaves away") is *moderately difficult* within the scope of Class 7 passive voice exercises.
    *   **Easier aspects:** Simple past tense (common starting point), simple direct object ("the leaves"). The sentence meaning is also easy to grasp.
    *   **Harder aspects:**
        *   **Irregular verb "blow"**: requires knowledge of its past participle "blown." Many basic exercises start with regular verbs or common irregular verbs like "write" or "make."
        *   **Transformed sentence length/complexity:** The passive form ("The leaves were blown away by the wind") requires rearranging and adding words.
        *   **Lack of direct Hindi grammatical analogy:** While voice (वाच्य) exists in Hindi, the transformation rules and structures are different. Direct transfer of concepts is difficult.
        *   **Instructional language barrier:** The instructions "Active Voice to Passive Voice" itself is a significant hurdle. Many teachers would write this in Hindi on the board (सक्रिय वाच्य से निष्क्रिय वाच्य में बदलें).

**Specific Challenges for this cohort:**

*   **Focus on Rote Learning:** Grammar is often taught by rote. Students might memorize definitions but struggle with application, especially with less familiar structures or irregular verbs.
*   **Limited Practice with Application:** Due to limited English exposure, opportunities for extensive application and practice in diverse sentence
