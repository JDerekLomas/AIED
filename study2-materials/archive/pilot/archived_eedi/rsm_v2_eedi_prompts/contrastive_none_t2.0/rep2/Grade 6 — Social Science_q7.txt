Let's break down the question for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their typical background.

**Contrastive Analysis of the Specific Question:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Concept of "Natural Resources":** This is a core concept taught in Class 6 Social Science (Geography). Students should broadly understand what natural resources are.
    *   **Geography of Rajasthan:** This is the most crucial assumed knowledge. Students need to have a basic understanding of what natural features or minerals are prominent in Rajasthan.
        *   They will likely know *water* is scarce and therefore important, especially from daily experience or simple geography lessons.
        *   *Sand* is obvious from its desert landscape (though "sand" as a *resource* might be tricky for them if not specifically taught for construction).
        *   *Marble* or other building stones (like sandstone) are common references for famous structures from Rajasthan (e.g., forts, palaces), so this is a plausible answer.
        *   *Salt* is a well-known resource due to its presence in deserts and history.
        *   *Minerals* like copper, zinc, mica, gypsum, limestone might be less familiar, as these are often discussed in higher classes or only for specific locations. They might have heard of one or two if specifically mentioned for Rajasthan in their textbooks.
        *   *Sunlight* and *Wind* as resources for energy might be more abstract, but increasingly discussed in textbooks, especially given India's focus on renewable energy.
    *   **Influence of Resources on Lives:** This requires a basic understanding of cause and effect – how a resource's presence or absence shapes daily life, occupations, housing, etc.

*   **Language Demands (English Medium):**
    *   "Mention": Straightforward instruction.
    *   "natural resources": Core vocabulary, likely familiar from textbooks.
    *   "found in Rajasthan": Locational knowledge.
    *   "explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":
        *   "influences": This word might be slightly challenging. It's not obscure, but for a student with limited English proficiency, it might take a moment to grasp "impacts" or "affects."
        *   "lives of the people there": Fairly common phrase.
    *   Overall, the language is relatively straightforward and uses common Social Science vocabulary at this level. The biggest hurdle would be if the student is severely limited in English and struggles with basic comprehension beyond individual words. However, the task of *naming* two resources is simple even for limited English. The explanation part requires slightly more complex sentence formation.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Identifying two natural resources from Rajasthan is primarily recall.
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** Explaining *how* one influences lives is a low level of application/reasoning. It doesn't require deep analytical skills but rather a practical understanding (e.g., "water is scarce, so people have to save it" or "marble is found, so people build houses with it and sell it"). It's more descriptive reasoning than abstract analytical reasoning.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question is very much aligned with typical Social Science textbook exercises for Class 6. Questions like "Name important resources in [State/Region]" and "How do these resources affect daily life?" are standard.
    *   The "explain how one influences" part usually requires 1-2 sentences, mirroring the level of detail expected.
    *   It's not overly complex, obscure, or multi-layered.

**Difficulty Compared to Average Item (29% Pass Rate):**

Considering the average pass rate is 29%, this question seems to fall in the *easier to moderate* category, possibly above the average.

*   **Positive factors for this question:**
    *   "Natural resources" is a fundamental Class 6 topic.
    *   Rajasthan is a prominent state, and some of its resources (water scarcity, desert, building stones like marble, salt) are well-known general knowledge.
    *   The "explain" part is descriptive, not analytical.
    *   Even if a student struggles with the "explain" part, they can still score if they list two correct resources. The rubric states "Mentions two correct natural resources" for maximum score, which implies just listing them gets the mark. *Correction: "Max score: 1" for mentioning two resources. This implies the explanation is not required to get the single point, making it even easier.*

*   **Negative factors:**
    *   Specific knowledge of Rajasthan's minerals might vary greatly. If they only know "desert" and can't articulate "sand"
