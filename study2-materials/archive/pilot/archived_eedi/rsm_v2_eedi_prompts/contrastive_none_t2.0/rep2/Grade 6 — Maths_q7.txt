Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the typical context.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Time:**
    *   Understanding of "am" and "pm".
    *   Ability to calculate elapsed time within a day (counting hours).
    *   Understanding "in the morning" vs. "in the evening."
*   **Numbers/Operations:**
    *   Basic addition (adding 2 repeatedly, or multiplication by 2).
    *   Understanding of "increases by."
    *   Concept of temperature units ($^0 C$) – though understanding the actual meaning isn't crucial for *this* problem, only that it's a measurable quantity.
*   **Word Problems:** Basic comprehension of a multi-step word problem.

**Language Demands:**

This is where the challenge significantly increases for Hindi-medium students with limited English.

*   **Key Vocabulary:**
    *   "At 10 am in the morning": While "10 am" might be somewhat understood due to exposure to clocks, "in the morning" provides crucial context.
    *   "temperature": A common science word, but its exact meaning might be hazy. However, it's generally associated with a number changing.
    *   "increases by": Very important phrase. If "increases" isn't understood, the student might subtract or just provide one of the numbers.
    *   "per hour": Crucial for understanding the rate of change. This might be a difficult phrase to parse.
    *   "then what will be the temperature": Standard question format, but the future tense "will be" and the interrogative "what" need to be understood.
    *   "4:00 in the evening": Similar to 10 am, "in the evening" helps clarify "pm."
    *   "Jodhpur": A place name, but not relevant to the calculation.
*   **Sentence Structure:** The sentences are relatively straightforward. The main challenge is the specialized vocabulary related to rates of change and future conditions.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   **Recall:** Minimal direct recall of facts, beyond basic arithmetic and time conventions.
*   **Application:** This is primarily an application problem. Students need to apply their knowledge of elapsed time and addition/multiplication to a real-world scenario.
*   **Reasoning:** Requires some basic logical reasoning to determine the total change over multiple hours. It's not a complex abstract reasoning task, but involves chaining steps.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Elapsed Time:** Calculating elapsed time is a common Class 4-6 topic. The difference here is crossing the "noon" barrier from am to pm (10 am to 4 pm), which can be slightly trickier than, say, 10 am to 2 pm (without going past noon).
*   **Rate Problems (Simple):** Very simple rate problems are introduced around Class 5-6, often involving speed or "cost per item." This problem is structurally similar, just with temperature.
*   **English Language Barrier:** This is the most significant differentiating factor. Textbook exercises in Hindi medium would be in Hindi, or simpler English if it's an English class. A full word problem like this, *in English*, would be considerably harder for many government school students who might primarily use Hindi for math. Many might grasp the numbers ($30^0C$, $2^0C$, $10$ am, $4$ pm) and some action word but miss "increases by" or "per hour."
*   **Multi-step:** It's a two-step problem: calculate duration, then calculate temperature change. This is standard for Class 6 but can be an obstacle for students with weak comprehension.

**Likely Mistakes and Challenges:**

1.  **Misinterpreting "increases by 2^0C per hour":**
    *   Might just add 2 to 30 and say 32.
    *   Might subtract 2.
    *   Might not realize it's *per hour*.
2.  **Incorrect Elapsed Time:**
    *   Counting 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, resulting in 7 hours (starting count from 10, not from *after* 10).
    *   Mistake with crossing 12 (am to pm). (e.g., 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 is 6 hours; but 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3 could be mistakenly seen as 7
