Let's break down the question for Class 6 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Low Difficulty:** Students are expected to have *just read* the poem (context provided, as this question likely follows the poem itself). The core "what do you like?" concept is universal and familiar in any language. They understand what "line" means, as poems are presented line by line.
    *   **Moderate Difficulty:** Basic understanding of a poem's themes, emotions, or imagery. They need to understand the *content* of the lines to be able to pick one they "like."
    *   **Implicit Understanding:** The ability to *articulate a reason* for liking something implies a level of critical thinking, even if simple.

*   **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   **Key terms:** "Which line," "poem," "like the most," "why."
        *   "Line" is fairly straightforward from visual context in a poem.
        *   "Poem" is also clear given the preceding text.
        *   "Like the most" is common and would likely be understood even with limited English, perhaps even from film/media exposure.
        *   "Why" is a fundamental question word and commonly taught.
    *   **Syntactic structure:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" This is a direct question, relatively simple subject-verb-object structure, followed by the "why." Not overly complex for those who grasp basic English questions.
    *   **Output requirement:** Students need to *write down* a line and *write down* a reason.
        *   **Choosing the line:** Requires copying directly from the text, which is easier than generating new vocabulary.
        *   **Explaining "why":** This is the biggest hurdle. Even if they understand "why," articulating a reason *in English* might be difficult. Their reason might be simple ("because it is beautiful," "because it is true," "it talks about animals I like") but they still need to form that sentence. They might think of the reason in Hindi and struggle to translate it.
        *   **Likely errors:** Grammatical mistakes, simple vocabulary, fragmented sentences for the "why" part.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Partial. They need to recall lines from the poem, but this is a low-level recall (recognition/copying) since the poem would be in front of them.
    *   **Application:** Minimal. They are applying their personal preference.
    *   **Reasoning:** Primarily. The "why" part demands a basic level of personal reasoning and expression. It's subjective reasoning, not logical deduction, which makes it less academically taxing but more linguistically taxing.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Easier:** Than factual recall questions about specific details in a prose passage, which might require more precise vocabulary and complex sentence understanding.
    *   **Similar:** To questions asking for opinions or feelings about a story character or a specific event, if those questions are framed simply.
    *   **Harder:** Than simple "tick the correct option" or fill-in-the-blank questions.
    *   **Challenge:** The *open-ended nature* of the "why" is harder than a multiple-choice question where the answer is already provided in simple English. The onus is on the student to generate the language. Textbook exercises often stick to direct comprehension or vocabulary rather than personal critical response.

**Overall Difficulty:**

The prompt to choose a line and *copy it* is very easy. The prompt to say "why" makes it significantly harder. Students might understand *what* to do and *what* they feel, but struggle to formulate even a basic reason in English. The open-ended writing requirement is the primary difficulty, especially for students with limited English writing skills. Their response might be one word, a very short phrase, or even a non-sequitur due to language barrier, not lack of understanding.

Considering an average pass rate of 29% for general items, and factoring in the specific challenges:

*   Many will successfully *identify* and *copy* a line (the first part of the rubric).
*   Fewer will provide a *reason*.
*   Even fewer will provide a reason that is both understandable *and* somewhat grammatical/relevant to fully score (1.5). The rubric asks to "denote a line" AND "mention why." A one-word "beautiful" might score something, but full marks would likely require a sentence.

I expect a significant drop from those who identify the line to those who
