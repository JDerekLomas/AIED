Let's break down the question for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, keeping their context in mind.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **"Battle of Plassey in 1757":** This is a specific event and date. It's a foundational topic in the history curriculum for Class 8 in India, especially in the "Colonialism and the Countryside" or "From Trade to Territory" chapters. Students are expected to know about this battle as a major turning point.
    *   **"Expansion of British power in India":** This general theme is central to the Class 8 history syllabus. Students learn about how the British gradually gained control.
    *   **Causal link:** The question requires understanding *how* one event (Plassey) contributed to another (British expansion). This assumes an understanding of cause and effect in historical events.
    *   **Basic understanding of political control/dominance:** Terms like "political dominance" or "puppet nawab" (as per the rubric) require some conceptual understanding beyond just rote memorization of names and dates.

*   **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **"Contribute to the expansion of British power":** "Contribute to" might be slightly more sophisticated than a direct "What was the result of..." but is generally understandable. "Expansion" and "power" are relatively common words in a history context.
    *   **Key terms are proper nouns/dates:** "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "British," "India" are not demanding in themselves, as they are learned concepts.
    *   **Rubric terms:** "political dominance," "control over Bengal," "puppet nawab" are technical historical terms. While taught, internalizing their meaning in English could be a challenge. Hindi equivalents would likely be more readily understood.
    *   **Concise answer:** The question asks for a direct explanation, which typically requires fewer complex grammatical structures than a descriptive or analytical essay question.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Predominantly Recall:** Identifying the immediate consequence of the Battle of Plassey is primarily recall of a taught historical fact.
    *   **Some basic Reasoning/Application:** The "how did it *contribute*" part requires a simple causal link – recognizing that victory led to dominance. It's not just stating *what* happened, but *why* it mattered for British power. However, it's a very direct and often pre-explained cause-and-effect relationship in textbooks.
    *   **Rubric analysis:** The rubric "explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal" points directly to a recalled consequence. "Placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab" is a specific detail used to illustrate that dominance.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Typical Difficulty:** This question is very similar to "short answer" or "explain" questions found at the end of Class 8 history chapters related to the rise of British power.
    *   **Focus on Key Events:** The Battle of Plassey is consistently highlighted as a pivotal moment. Textbooks explicitly link it to the establishment of British rule in Bengal.
    *   **Direct Explanation:** The question is direct, not requiring multiple steps of analysis or synthesis of information from different chapters.

**Synthesized Difficulty Assessment:**

This question targets a *core concept* within the Class 8 Indian history curriculum. Students would have studied the Battle of Plassey in detail, and its significance for the British expansion would be emphasized.

*   **Strengths (making it easier):**
    *   Central topic: Every student should have encountered this information.
    *   Direct causal link: The Plassey-Bengal dominance link is a fundamental teaching point.
    *   Short, focused answer: Reduces writing burden and linguistic complexity.
    *   Relies on direct recall, with minimal complex reasoning beyond a simple cause-and-effect.

*   **Weaknesses (making it harder):**
    *   English language: While simpler than some, explaining "political dominance" or "puppet nawab" accurately in English could be challenging for those with very limited proficiency, even if they know the concept in their mother tongue. They might state facts but struggle with the phrasing.
    *   Recall accuracy: While the main point is core, some students might recall superficial details but miss the crucial element of political control.
    *   Memorization vs. understanding: Students who rote-memorize without understanding the *why* might struggle to formulate a coherent answer about its *contribution*.
