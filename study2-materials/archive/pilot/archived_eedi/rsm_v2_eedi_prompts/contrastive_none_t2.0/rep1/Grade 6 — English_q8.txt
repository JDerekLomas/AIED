Let's break down the question for Class 6 Indian government school students, considering their background:

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Basic English Sentence Structure:** The fundamental understanding of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order. They should have encountered simple declarative sentences in English.
*   **Vocabulary:** All the words (`book`, `reading`, `a`, `is`, `he`) are very common, foundational English words typically introduced by Class 3-4, if not earlier. They should be familiar with their meanings.
*   **Verb "to be":** Understanding "is" as part of a continuous action ("is reading").
*   **Present Continuous Tense:** While they may not articulate it as "present continuous," they should recognize the common "Subject + is/am/are + -ing verb" pattern for ongoing actions.

**Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**

*   **Decoding:** All words are short and high-frequency, making them easy to decode even for those with limited phonics skills.
*   **Vocabulary:** As noted, all words are likely to be known. The potential pitfall is not knowing the meaning of a key word, but that's unlikely here.
*   **Grammar (implicit):** The core task is grammatical – forming a correct sentence. This relies on internalizing SVO order, which is a significant demand for students learning English as a second or third language, especially if their native language (e.g., Hindi) has a different dominant word order (SOV). While Hindi is SOV, many common English sentence structures are heavily drilled even in elementary English classes.
*   **Instruction Clarity:** "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence" is a fairly standard instruction in English exercises. Most students would likely understand what they need to do. The example given in the prompt for students to understand what they have to do to reorder.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   **Application:** This is primarily an application task. Students aren't just recalling a definition; they're applying their knowledge of English grammar and word order to a specific set of words.
*   **Limited Reasoning:** While there's a degree of logical arrangement, it's not "higher-order reasoning" like problem-solving or analysis. It's more about following established grammatical rules.

**Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Very Common:** This is a *very common* type of exercise in Class 5-6 English textbooks in India, often found in "grammar" sections or even as warm-up activities. Teachers frequently drill sentence construction, subject-verb agreement, and basic tenses.
*   **Simple Sentence Structure:** "He is reading a book" is a very basic and commonly taught sentence structure. It's a fundamental building block.
*   **Likely Drilled:** The specific vocabulary and present continuous structure are highly likely to have been taught and drilled multiple times.

**Contrastive Analysis Summary:**

*   **EASY points:** All words are common vocabulary. The instruction is clear. The resulting sentence structure (SVO, present continuous) is extremely common and fundamental. This specific type of "jumbled words" exercise is ubiquitous in Indian English language teaching.
*   **HARD points:** The biggest hurdle is the **syntactic difference** between Hindi (SOV) and English (SVO), though this particular English structure is heavily emphasized early on. For students with *extremely* limited exposure, simply internalizing the SVO order can be challenging. However, by Class 6, they should have had sufficient exposure to simple SVO sentences. Another difficulty might arise if a student incorrectly identifies "he" as the object and "book" as the subject, or gets confused by the placement of "is."

Considering the "average pass rate across items on this exam is about 29%," this specific question feels like it should perform *better* than the average. It's a foundational skill rather than a more complex comprehension or inferential task that might pull the average down. Students may struggle with more nuanced vocabulary, complex tenses, or abstract concepts, but basic sentence construction using common words like these is usually prioritized and drilled.

The fact that it's a very simple, single, affirmative statement further increases its chances of being correct. There are no inversions, no negative forms, no questions, and no complex conjunctions.

**Potential Errors:**

*   "Is he reading a book?" (Misunderstanding statement vs. question)
*   "He reading a book is." (Direct Hindi SOV transfer, but less likely with 'is')
*   "Book is he reading a." (Incorrect subject/object identification)
*   "Reading he is a book." (Unusual, but possible jumble)

However, the most natural-sounding and frequently taught
