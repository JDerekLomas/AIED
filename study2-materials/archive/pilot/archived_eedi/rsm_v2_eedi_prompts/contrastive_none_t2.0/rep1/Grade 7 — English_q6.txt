Let's break down this question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, keeping in mind their specific context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **"Poet's writing style"**: This assumes they have been taught, or at least encountered, the concept that authors (poets, in this case) *have* distinct writing styles. They need to understand what "style" refers to in a literary context – not just fashion or hair. This might be a relatively advanced concept for Class 7 students in government schools, where literary analysis beyond basic comprehension and factual recall might be less emphasized.
    *   **Understanding "Describe"**: A common verb, but "describe *style*" elevates it.
    *   **Exposure to poetry in English**: They must have read *some* English poetry in their curriculum. The question doesn't provide the poem, so it assumes a general understanding of how to analyze a *hypothetical* poem's style. This abstraction makes it harder. If a specific poem were given, they would only need to apply it. Without one, they need to recall common stylistic elements or the concept itself.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **"Describes"**: Relatively common verb, but again, in a literary context.
    *   **"Poet's"**: Possessive form, should be understood.
    *   **"Writing style"**: This is the core term. "Style" itself can have multiple meanings. In Hindi, "शैली" (shaili) or "अंदाज़" (andaaz) could translate to style, but the nuanced understanding of *literary* style might not be firmly established. If their textbooks don't frequently use this exact phrasing or delve into such analysis, it becomes a hurdle.
    *   **Generating suitable descriptive words**: This is the biggest language challenge. The rubric suggests words like "simple, descriptive, informal, direct."
        *   "Simple" is a common word.
        *   "Descriptive" is related to "describe" but might be slightly less frequent.
        *   "Informal" is likely a lower-frequency word for these students, especially in an academic context.
        *   "Direct" is also likely low-frequency for literary analysis.
        *   Students need a vocabulary to articulate style, which is often limited in those with developing English. They might know "good," "bad," "nice," but those won't score.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   It's primarily **recall** of a concept ("what is writing style and how do we talk about it?") combined with a touch of **reasoning/application** (thinking about types of words that describe style). However, without a specific poem to *apply* it to, it becomes more about recalling the *framework* for stylistic analysis.
    *   The "reasoning" part is anticipating what kinds of words would be relevant.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **More Difficult:** Typical textbook exercises at this level for government schools often focus on:
        *   Literal comprehension (answering factual questions about a given text).
        *   Vocabulary (matching, fill-in-the-blanks with words from the text).
        *   Grammar application (transforming sentences, identifying parts of speech).
        *   Less frequently, they delve into abstract literary analysis like "writing style" *without* providing a specific text to analyze. If a poem were given, the question would transform from abstract concept recall to specific application, which might be slightly easier depending on the poem. The *abstraction* without context is a major difficulty booster.
    *   The rubric examples ("simple, descriptive, informal, direct") suggest a level of vocabulary and analytical thinking that is often beyond basic Class 7 comprehension exercises in Hindi-medium settings.

**Combined Difficulty Factors:**

*   **Abstract nature:** No specific poem is provided, making it an abstract conceptual question.
*   **Literary concept:** "Writing style" might be an unfamiliar or not fully understood analytical concept.
*   **Vocabulary demand:** Students need to not only understand "writing style" but also recall appropriate English adjectives to describe it, which are often not high-frequency words in their daily vocabulary or basic textbooks.
*   **English proficiency:** Limited English skills make accessing and responding to abstract questions, especially with less common analytical vocabulary, very challenging.

Given the average pass rate of 29% across all items, this specific item is likely harder than average. The demands are quite high for the target demographic. A good percentage would fail just on understanding "writing style," and an even higher percentage on generating a
