Let's break down the question for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their background:

**Question:** Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there.

**Rubric:** Mentions two correct natural resources (e.g., water, Marble, Copper, Sandstone, Gypsum, mica, limestone, zinc, salt, Sunlight for solar energy, Wind for wind energy).
Max score: 1

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **What prior knowledge is assumed?**
    *   **Basic geographical knowledge:** Students should know what "natural resources" are in a general sense (things from nature that people use) and be aware that Rajasthan is a specific region in India.
    *   **Knowledge of Rajasthan's specific geography/resources:** This is the core knowledge assumed. Students are expected to know *which* resources are found in Rajasthan. Common examples would be sand/desert, water (its scarcity), certain minerals, or even the sun for solar.
    *   **Causality/Influence:** The second part of the question ("how one of them influences the lives...") requires understanding a cause-and-effect relationship between a resource and human life. This is a basic social studies concept, often explored through examples in textbooks (e.g., rivers providing water for farming, minerals providing jobs).

*   **What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Mention": Straightforward instruction.
        *   "Natural resources": This is a key technical term. While a Class 6 social science curriculum would introduce this, students in Hindi-medium schools might be more familiar with its Hindi equivalent (प्राकृतिक संसाधन - *praakritik sansadhan*). They need to recognize it in English.
        *   "Rajasthan": A proper noun, straightforward.
        *   "Explain": Requires more than just naming; demands descriptive text.
        *   "Influences": Another key vocabulary word, implying effect or impact. (प्रभावित करता है - *prabhaavit karta hai*).
        *   **Resource names:** Naming specific resources (Marble, Copper, Gypsum, Sunlight, etc.) in English can be a hurdle if they primarily learned them in Hindi. "Water" and "sand" are universally recognizable, but others might be tricky.
    *   **Sentence structure:** "Mention any two X and explain how one of them influences Y." This is a moderately complex sentence structure, requiring understanding of two separate tasks connected by "and."
    *   **Overall comprehension:** The primary difficulty will be processing the key terms ("natural resources," "influences") in English and then articulating a response that meets both parts of the question.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Identifying two natural resources found in Rajasthan is primarily **recall** of factual information learned in their social studies curriculum.
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** Explaining *how* a resource influences lives leans towards **application** of basic geographical/economic concepts and some simple **reasoning**. It's not a deep, complex reasoning task but requires connecting the resource to human activity (e.g., "water is scarce, so people struggle for drinking water and irrigation" or "marble provides building material and jobs for quarry workers").

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Naming Resources:** Many textbook exercises at this level involve listing examples of natural resources in different regions. So, identifying two resources should be a fairly standard recall task.
    *   **Explaining Influence:** Explanatory questions, especially regarding the impact of geography/resources on human life, are common in Social Science. Textbooks would provide examples (e.g., rivers provide water for farming, minerals are used in industries, deserts make farming difficult). Students would likely have encountered such explanations for different regions, and they are expected to apply similar thinking to Rajasthan.
    *   **Rubric "Max score: 1" for BOTH parts:** This is crucial. If a student only names two resources but cannot explain the influence, they get 0. If they explain one influence but only name one resource, they get 0. This single point rubric makes it harder to achieve. They *must* answer both components correctly.

**Specific Considerations for these Students:**

*   **Economically Weaker Sections:** May have less exposure to English outside of school. Limited access to supplementary learning materials.
*   **Hindi-medium:** This is a major barrier for English vocabulary and understanding nuanced instructions like "influences."
*   **Average pass rate (29%):** This implies that *most* items are challenging, and this exam is designed to differentiate.

**Predicted Performance Challenges:**
