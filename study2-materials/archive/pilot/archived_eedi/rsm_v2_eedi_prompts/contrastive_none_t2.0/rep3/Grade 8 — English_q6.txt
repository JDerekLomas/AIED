Here's a contrastive analysis of the question "Define fable" for Class 8 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections, followed by an estimate:

## Contrastive Analysis: "Define Fable"

### Prior Knowledge Assumed:

*   **Core Concept of "Story":** Highly likely to be present. Stories are a fundamental part of childhood across cultures.
*   **Awareness of Morals/Lessons:** Likely present through traditional folktales, religious stories, and even direct parental instruction. The concept of "what this teaches us" is common.
*   **Familiarity with Animals as Characters:** Very high. Animal characters are ubiquitous in children's literature, comics, and cartoons globally and locally (e.g., Panchatantra).
*   **Implicit understanding of "shortness":** Most familiar fables are indeed short, so the *concept* isn't alien, even if the word "short" isn't explicitly defined.
*   **Direct Exposure to Fables:** This is crucial. While "fable" itself might be an English word, the *content* (stories like the Tortoise and the Hare, the Ant and the Grasshopper, or stories from the Panchatantra) is almost certainly familiar through various regional languages or translated versions. Their English textbook or supplementary materials might even include a few classic fables, which would implicitly introduce the concept.

### Language Demands:

*   **"Define":** This is a fairly common instructional word in academic contexts. While not entirely basic English, Class 8 students should ideally be familiar with it, especially in subject-specific exams. They know they need to *explain* what something is.
*   **"Fable":** This is the key vocabulary item. If they have not explicitly encountered this word in English, even if they know the *concept*, they will struggle. Its non-cognate nature with common Hindi/regional words makes it harder to guess. However, as mentioned, it's a relatively common term in English literature, and might appear in their textbooks.
*   **Vocabulary for the Definition:** "Short story," "animals," "characters," "imparts," "moral lesson."
    *   "Short story": Fairly straightforward. "Short" and "story" are common words.
    *   "Animals," "characters": Very common and likely known.
    *   "Imparts": This is the most challenging word in the expected rubric. Many students might struggle with "imparts" and instead use simpler verbs like "gives," "teaches," or "tells." This would still be considered correct in terms of concept, even if the vocabulary isn't exact.
    *   "Moral lesson": "Moral" might be a slight stretch for some, but "lesson" is common. Together, it conveys the idea effectively. They might substitute with "good lesson" or "what we learn."

### Recall, Application, or Reasoning?

*   **Recall:** This is primarily a **recall** question. Students need to remember the specific definition of "fable" that they have been taught or have implicitly understood from their English reading. It is not an application or reasoning question.

### Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:

*   **Typical Definition Questions:** Such "Define X" questions are very common in textbooks across all subjects (e.g., "Define noun," "Define photosynthesis," "Define democracy"). Students are accustomed to memorizing and reproducing definitions.
*   **Complexity of Concept:** The *concept* of a fable (short, animals, moral) is not inherently complex or abstract for Class 8. It's more straightforward than, say, defining a literary device like 'metaphor' or a scientific process like 'respiration'.
*   **Likelihood of Direct Instruction:** If "fables" are covered in their English curriculum (which is highly probable given its foundational nature in literature), students would have likely seen and perhaps even memorized its definition.
*   **Rubric Lenience:** The rubric allows for flexibility. Even if they don't use "imparts," stating "teaches a moral" would get credit.

## Synthesis and Estimate

The biggest hurdle for this specific question is the direct recall of the English word "fable" and its formal definition. However, several factors work in its favor:

1.  **Familiarity with the concept:** Students will almost certainly know stories that are fables, even if they don't know the English term.
2.  **Likelihood of appearing in curriculum:** Fables are fundamental and likely taught, or at least discussed, in Class 8 English.
3.  **Relatively simple concept:** The core components of a fable are easy to grasp.
4.  **Common question format:** "Define X" is a standard exam question.
5.  **Relatively accessible vocabulary
