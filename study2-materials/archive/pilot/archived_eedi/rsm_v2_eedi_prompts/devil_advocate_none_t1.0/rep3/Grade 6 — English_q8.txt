Here's my thought process for calibrating the estimate:

1.  **Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):** My first thought is "This is pretty easy. Subject-verb-object. Basic sentence structure. Most 6th graders *should* get this." This is the expert bias at play. I'm fluent in English, I understand grammar implicitly, and I forget what it's like to struggle with the language.

2.  **Considering the Constraints:**
    *   **Class 6, Indian Government Schools:** This immediately flags lower socio-economic status, likely first-generation learners, and varying quality of instruction.
    *   **Limited English:** This is crucial. "Reading" might be a known word, "book" certainly. "He" and "is" are also very common. But understanding how they *fit together* syntactically is the challenge.
    *   **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is a strong anchor. If the average pass rate for *all* questions is 29%, then this question needs to be considered in that context. It might be easier than some math problems, but harder than others.
    *   **Teacher/Expert Overestimation:** This is the explicit warning. I *must* challenge my "easy" instinct.
    *   **"Basic" Isn't Basic:** Subject-verb-object seems basic to me, but for a student struggling with English, it's a specific rule they might not have internalized, especially if their native language has a different structure or they're just learning English as words, not as a system.
    *   **Exam Anxiety:** Can lead to scrambling words even if they *could* do it.
    *   **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** This is a big one. They might be familiar with sentence construction but not specifically *rearranging jumbled words*. If they haven't seen this format, it adds an extra cognitive load.
    *   **Absent for Topic:** A significant portion of students will have missed critical lessons.

3.  **Breaking Down the Cognitive Load for the Student:**
    *   Identify individual words: "book", "reading", "a", "is", "he" (easy for most).
    *   Understand the meaning of each word (mostly easy, "a" might be harder to place).
    *   Recognize that it's a sentence about someone doing something.
    *   Identify the subject: "he".
    *   Identify the verb phrase: "is reading".
    *   Identify the object: "a book".
    *   Synthesize this into the correct SVO order.
    *   *Crucially:* For many, this isn't an intuitive process; it requires applying a learned rule that may or may not be solidified. They might try "Reading he is a book" or "A book he is reading."

4.  **Calibrating Down from Initial Instinct:**
    *   My initial *uncalibrated* thought might be 60-70%.
    *   Applying the "limited English" filter: Drops significantly. Many won't grasp the syntax.
    *   Applying the "absent for topic" filter: Further drop.
    *   Applying the "never practiced this question type" filter: Another drop. They might know the words and even understand the meaning if someone said "He is reading a book," but constructing it from jumbled words is a different skill.
    *   Considering the 29% average pass rate: This question is likely *easier* than some complex math problems or deeper comprehension questions, but it's probably *not* a huge outlier in difficulty compared to the overall average. If it were truly "easy," it would pull the average up.

5.  **Reaching the Estimate:**
    *   Could a student who barely reads English get this? Some might, if they've heard the sentence structure repeatedly. Others will just jumble words.
    *   Could a student who was absent? Unlikely, unless they're naturally very good at language.
    *   I need to land somewhere that acknowledges it's a fundamental English skill, but heavily impacted by the constraints. It's likely *above* the 29% average, as sentence construction is a core part of English learning, but not by a massive amount given the explicit warnings.
    *   If 29% is the *average*, and some questions are very hard, then some questions must be easier. This question probably falls into the "easier end of average" or "slightly above average" category.
    *   A student might correctly identify "He" as the start and "book" as the end, but struggle with the "is reading a" part,
