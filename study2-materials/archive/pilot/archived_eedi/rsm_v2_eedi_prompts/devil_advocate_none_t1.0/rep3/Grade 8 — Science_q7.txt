Let's break down the question and the likely student response, keeping in mind the constraints:

**Question Analysis:**

*   **"A gardener has collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit."** This sets the context – composting.
*   **"Does gardener notice any change after some days?"** This is the core question. The expected answer is "Yes" (decomposition).
*   **"Give reasons..."** This requires understanding *why* the change happens (decomposition by microbes).
*   **"...and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health."** This requires understanding the *purpose* and *benefits* of compost (adds nutrients, improves structure, etc.).

**Student Challenges:**

1.  **English Language:**
    *   "Collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit": Fairly understandable, but "pit" might be less common than "hole" or "digging."
    *   "Notice any change": "Notice" is a common verb, but "any change" could be missed by struggling readers.
    *   "Give reasons": Standard instruction.
    *   "Evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health": "Evaluate" is a higher-order verb. "Beneficial" is a common enough word, but "soil health" as a concept might be less frequently discussed explicitly in this exact phrasing.

2.  **Conceptual Understanding:**
    *   **Composting:** While "waste of plants, vegetables and fruits" might hint at it, the term "compost" isn't used. Students might have learned about "manure" (खाद) or "fertilizer" more than "composting" explicitly.
    *   **Decomposition:** Do they understand *why* things rot? The role of microorganisms might not be clear, or they might just say "it rots" without a deeper reason.
    *   **Benefits for soil health:** This requires connecting decomposition to nutrient cycling and soil structure. Many might just say "it makes the plants grow better" without the "soil health" link.

3.  **Anxiety & Question Type:**
    *   This is a multi-part question: yes/no, reasons, evaluation. Students often struggle to address all parts.
    *   "Evaluate" implies a judgment and justification, which is harder than just stating a fact.
    *   "Some days" is vague, but the concept of change over time should be graspable.

**Rubric:** "The user suggests that the gardener will notice significant changes." This means they only need to get the first part correct: "Yes, changes will be noticed." They don't need to elaborate on *what* changes or *why*. This significantly lowers the bar.

**Challenging Initial Instinct:**

My first instinct, based on it being a "basic science concept," might be around 40-50% if they just need to say "yes, it will change." However, the "average pass rate of 29%" for the *entire exam* (which would include much simpler questions) suggests that *even basic recognition* is not universal.

The question asks for *any change*. This is easier than describing the change. Many students will have observed organic matter rotting. They might not connect it to "soil health" or microbes, but they will likely know that "waste" doesn't stay the same.

The phrase "Does gardener notice any change after some days?" is simple enough that even a struggling English speaker could grasp "change after some days." They might associate "waste" with "smell" or "disappearance."

Considering the *low bar* of the rubric (just "significant changes"), and the widespread observation of things rotting, I think many will get this first part right. However, the *average pass rate of 29%* for the entire paper pulls my estimate down. If the average for the paper is 29%, a question where they simply have to recognize that "waste changes over time" should be slightly higher, but not dramatically so.

Let's imagine:
*   20% will barely understand the question or freeze.
*   Another 20% might understand but overthink, or focus on other parts of the question.
*   The remaining 60% might grasp the basic "change" aspect.

Even with the low bar, getting just the "Yes, changes will be noticed" requires a certain level of comprehension and confidence.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Given the low average pass rate and the challenges, but also the very low bar of the rubric for *this specific question*, I'll lean slightly higher than the average, but not by a huge margin.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **35%**
