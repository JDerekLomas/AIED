I've challenged my assumptions, considering the limited English proficiency, basic concept struggles, exam anxiety, and lack of practice for this specific question type among Class 7 students in Indian government schools from economically weaker sections.

My initial thought might lean towards a higher percentage, given that "writing style" is a common literary term. However, the constraints significantly pull this down.

Here's my breakdown of why the proportion would be low:

*   **"Describes the poet’s writing style."**: The phrase "writing style" itself might be challenging. While they might have encountered "style" in the context of clothes or hair, "writing style" is a more abstract concept. They might know what a poem *is*, but articulating its *style* is a higher-order thinking skill.
*   **Limited English**: Even if they grasp "style," coming up with a suitable *English* adjective like "simple," "descriptive," or "informal" requires a decent vocabulary. Many students might understand the *concept* of a simple poem but struggle to retrieve or form the word "simple."
*   **No prior practice**: If they haven't been explicitly taught to analyze and label writing styles with specific adjectives, they're unlikely to succeed. Their curriculum might focus more on comprehension than literary analysis terminology.
*   **Anxiety**: Faced with a question that feels abstract and requires specific vocabulary, many might leave it blank rather than attempting.
*   **"Basic concepts aren't basic"**: For a student struggling with foundational literacy, differentiating between "what the poem says" and "how the poet says it" (i.e., style) is not basic.

Considering all these factors, the average pass rate of 29% seems relevant for overall performance, but this specific question might be even harder for the reasons above. The expectation that they can readily produce a suitable adjective for "writing style" is likely an overestimation.

Even if they *know* the poem is simple, finding the word "simple" and writing it down is a hurdle. Many might write something like "good" or "nice," which wouldn't get a point as it doesn't describe the writing *style*.

After challenging my initial instincts, I believe this question is more difficult than it appears on the surface for this student demographic.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **12%**
