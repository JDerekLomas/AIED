After challenging my assumptions and considering the context:

*   **Limited English:** "Blew" and "blown" are irregular past participles that can be tricky even for native speakers. "Away" might add a slight complication. Understanding "passive voice" itself requires a good grasp of English grammar terms, which are often taught in English.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While active/passive voice is a standard grammar topic, for students who are struggling with basic sentence formation and vocabulary, the concept of voice transformation can be very abstract. They might memorize a rule, but struggle to apply it to a slightly different sentence.
*   **Exam Anxiety/Never Practiced:** If they haven't seen this exact sentence or a very similar one, or if they haven't practiced this type of transformation extensively, anxiety can make them freeze. Even if they know the rule, applying it under pressure is hard.
*   **"The leaves were blown away by the wind."**: This is a fairly standard transformation, but it requires several steps:
    1.  Identify the object ("the leaves").
    2.  Make it the new subject.
    3.  Identify the tense (simple past).
    4.  Use the correct form of "to be" for that tense and the new subject ("were").
    5.  Use the past participle of the main verb ("blown").
    6.  Add "by the wind."

Given the average pass rate of 29% for these students, and the fact that teachers overestimate difficulty, I need to lean towards a lower estimate for this specific grammar transformation. Many might get "The leaves were blown away," but forget "by the wind," or struggle with "blown." Even remembering the structure (be + past participle) can be a hurdle.

My initial instinct might be higher, but considering the specific challenges, I believe it would be lower than what many expect.
