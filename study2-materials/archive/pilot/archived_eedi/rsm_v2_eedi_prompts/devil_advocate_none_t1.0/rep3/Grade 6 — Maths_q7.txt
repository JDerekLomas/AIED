Let's break down the question and the challenges for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the factors mentioned.

**Question Analysis:**

*   **Core Math:** Simple addition and multiplication.
*   **Reading:**
    *   "At 10 am in the morning": Clear.
    *   "temperature of Jodhpur was 30^0 C": Clear.
    *   "If the temperature increases by 2^0 C per hour": "Increases," "per hour" are key.
    *   "then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?": "What will be," "in the evening" are important for the time calculation.
*   **Time Calculation:**
    *   From 10 am to 12 pm (noon): 2 hours.
    *   From 12 pm to 4 pm: 4 hours.
    *   Total: 6 hours. This requires understanding the 12-hour clock cycle and transitioning from AM to PM.
*   **Final Calculation:** 30 (initial) + (6 hours * 2 degrees/hour) = 30 + 12 = 42 degrees.

**Challenges for the Target Audience:**

1.  **English Comprehension:**
    *   "Increases by": While "increase" is common, "by" in this context might be tricky for some.
    *   "Per hour": This is a crucial phrase for understanding the rate. Students who struggle with English might misinterpret it as "every hour" without grasping the multiplication implication, or even just skip over it.
    *   "At 4:00 in the evening": Understanding "evening" in relation to "pm" and the transition from "am" to "pm" is key for the time calculation.
    *   The overall sentence structure, though relatively simple, can be a hurdle for low-proficiency readers.

2.  **Time Calculation (AM/PM Transition):** This is the single biggest *mathematical* hurdle. Many students, even with decent English, struggle with calculating durations that cross the noon boundary (12 PM).
    *   They might count 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 and get 7 hours.
    *   They might count from 10 to 4 directly on a number line without realizing the 12-hour cycle, leading to 6 hours or 7 hours depending on inclusion/exclusion of start/end.
    *   They might convert 4:00 PM to 16:00 (24-hour clock) and then subtract 10, getting 6 hours. This is an advanced strategy for many Class 6 students, especially those not regularly exposed to the 24-hour format.

3.  **Conceptual Understanding:** "Per hour" implies a rate and multiplication. Some might just add 2 to 30 for each hour, but if they get the time wrong, the final answer is wrong. Others might struggle to link "per hour" to repeated addition or multiplication.

4.  **Multi-step Problem:** It's not a single operation. It requires:
    *   Reading and understanding the problem.
    *   Identifying the initial temperature.
    *   Identifying the rate of change.
    *   Calculating the duration.
    *   Calculating the total change in temperature.
    *   Calculating the final temperature.
    *   Any error in these steps leads to an incorrect answer.

5.  **Anxiety/Lack of Practice:** As noted, many students haven't practiced this *exact* question type. The mix of time, temperature, and rates can be overwhelming.

**Recalibrating My Initial Instinct:**

My first instinct might be "this is pretty basic arithmetic, many would get the calculation if they understood the words." However, the prompt specifically warns against overestimating.

*   **English barrier:** "Per hour" and the AM/PM distinction are the biggest English traps.
*   **Time calculation:** This is the *killer* for a large percentage. Even good students can falter here.
*   **Multi-step:** The cumulative effect of these small errors is significant.

Considering an average pass rate of 29% for the cohort: this question is more complex than a simple addition or subtraction. The time calculation alone would trip up a significant chunk of students. Students barely reading English will likely fail to grasp "per hour" or the AM/PM change. Even those who understand the language might make a counting error for the hours.

A student who was absent for "time duration" topics or for "rate" concepts would certainly struggle.
