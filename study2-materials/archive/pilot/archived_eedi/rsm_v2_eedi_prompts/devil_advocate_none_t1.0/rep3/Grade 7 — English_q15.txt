Let's break down the challenge here.

**Initial instinct (and why it's likely wrong):** "This is a simple topic. Everyone has a hobby. They just need to write a few sentences. Many will get it."

**Challenging the instinct based on the provided context:**

1.  **Limited English:** "Write a short paragraph" is a complex instruction for someone with limited English. They might understand "write about hobby" but struggle with "paragraph," "sentences," "mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it." Even seemingly simple words like "mention" can be a stumbling block. They might just list things.
2.  **"Basic" concepts aren't basic:** The *structure* of a paragraph (cohesive sentences, a clear topic) is not inherently known. Many students struggle with linking ideas, even in their native language, let alone English.
3.  **Exam Anxiety:** The pressure of an exam, combined with unfamiliarity with the *exact* question format, can lead to freezing. A blank response is a real possibility.
4.  **Never practiced this exact question type:** While they might have written about hobbies before, the specific instruction of "4-5 sentences," "mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it" might be new. They might write 2 sentences, or just list facts without forming a coherent paragraph.
5.  **Average pass rate 29%:** This is a crucial indicator. If the *overall* pass rate is so low, it implies a significant portion of students are struggling across the board. This specific question, while seemingly easy to an adult, still requires several foundational skills in English writing.
6.  **The Rubric:** "Student writes a complete paragraph that clearly mentions the hobby, when it is done, and why it is enjoyable."
    *   "Complete paragraph": This rules out bullet points or just disconnected sentences.
    *   "Clearly mentions": Requires specificity and clarity, not just vague statements.
    *   All three components *must* be present. If they forget "when you do it," it's a 0. If they just say "I like it" instead of *why*, it's a 0.

**Re-evaluating based on the challenges:**

*   Many will struggle with the *paragraph structure* itself.
*   Many will struggle to incorporate *all three required elements* (what, when, why) within a cohesive paragraph. They might list them, but not integrate them smoothly.
*   The vocabulary needed for "why I enjoy it" might be limited beyond "it is good" or "I like it."
*   Spelling and basic grammar errors will be rampant, potentially making sentences unclear even if the intent is there.
*   A significant number will likely leave it blank or write something completely incoherent due to anxiety or lack of understanding.
*   The "4-5 sentences" instruction might be missed or ignored, leading to too few or too many disconnected sentences.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for *all* questions, and the specific demands of this writing task, which requires understanding instructions, basic paragraph construction, and expressing ideas in English, the proportion correct will be quite low. This is not a multiple-choice question where they can guess. This requires productive output.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

I initially thought higher, but with the specific constraints and the low overall pass rate, I have to be conservative. Many will produce *something*, but few will meet all the rubric's requirements for a "complete paragraph that clearly mentions all three aspects."

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **15%**
