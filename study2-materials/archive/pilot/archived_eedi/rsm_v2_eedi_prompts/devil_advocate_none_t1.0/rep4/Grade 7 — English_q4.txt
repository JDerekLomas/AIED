Let's break down the question and the target demographic.

**The Question:** "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."

**The Rubric:** The king wanted to answer (based on the reading passage) the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with. Any valid reason. Max score: 1.

**Target Demographic:** Class 7 students in Indian government schools, mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English. Average pass rate around 29%.

**Challenging Assumptions:**

1.  **English Comprehension:** "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life?"
    *   "Important in real life" is a fairly common phrase, but students with limited English might struggle to grasp the nuance or connect it to their own experiences if the passage itself was challenging.
    *   They need to understand "king's questions" – which implies they understood the passage about the king's quest for answers. If the passage itself was not well understood, this question is immediately harder.

2.  **Passage Recall/Understanding:** The rubric explicitly states the king wanted to answer "the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with." This means students need to have understood the *gist* of the passage and recall these core themes.
    *   If the passage was read quickly, or if the teacher didn't spend much time on it, many students might not explicitly remember these three specific questions, even if they remember "the king wanted answers."

3.  **Formulating a "Valid Reason":** "Give one reason."
    *   This requires not just a "yes/no" answer, but justification.
    *   The "valid reason" can be quite broad, but it still requires some level of critical thinking and expression.
    *   For students with limited English, expressing a reason clearly and concisely can be a significant hurdle, even if they grasp the concept. They might think "yes, because it's good to know," but struggle to articulate *why* it's good.
    *   Linking it to "real life" adds another layer. They need to generalize from the king's abstract questions to practical applicability.

4.  **Exam Anxiety/Novelty:**
    *   This type of question ("Do you think X is important? Give a reason") is common in higher-level English comprehension but might be less frequent for students primarily focused on basic recall or grammar.
    *   Anxiety can definitely lead to blank responses or very simplistic answers that might not fully meet the rubric (e.g., just "yes" without a valid reason).

5.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While "importance" and "real life" seem basic, articulating a *reason* for something's importance, especially in a second language, is not trivial for struggling learners. The core questions themselves (right time, right thing, right people) are philosophical. Understanding their *relevance* is a step beyond just understanding what they are.

**Revisiting My Instinct:** My initial instinct might be "Many students would get this; it's asking for an opinion with a simple reason."

**Calibrating:**

*   **Low English Comprehension:** Many students might not fully grasp "important in real life" or the specific details of the king's questions from the passage.
*   **Recall/Synthesis:** Recalling the *specific nature* of the king's questions (right time, right thing, right people) and then connecting them to real-life importance is a multi-step process.
*   **Expression:** Even if they understand, expressing a "valid reason" in English is a major challenge for many. They might provide a very vague answer that doesn't meet the rubric, or just say "yes" without justification.
*   **Passage Dependency:** Success hinges heavily on how well the preceding reading passage was understood. If that was challenging, this question immediately becomes much harder.
*   **Average Pass Rate (29%):** This is a strong indicator that most questions are difficult for these students. A question requiring comprehension, recall, synthesis, and expression in English is likely to be harder than average.

Considering the cumulative difficulty posed by limited English, the need for recall of specific passage details, the requirement to generalize to "real life," and the articulation of a "reason," I expect a significant drop-off from even basic comprehension.

**Revised Estimate:** I'm going to lean towards the lower end of what teachers might expect, given the average pass rate is 29% and this question requires multiple cognitive steps and English proficiency.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **18%**
