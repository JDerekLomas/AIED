Let's break this down using the provided insights to avoid overestimation.

1.  **Limited English:** "Name any two major mountain ranges..." is straightforward enough in terms of English, but if a student struggles with basic vocabulary, even this can be a hurdle. However, for a Class 6 student, "Name two mountains" is generally understandable.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** This is the *crucial* point. While "Himalayas" might seem like an obvious answer to an adult, many students from EWS backgrounds in government schools might not have the same level of general knowledge or exposure to geography. They might have heard the word, but might not be able to recall it on demand, especially under pressure. Other ranges like Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western/Eastern Ghats are even less likely to be universally known or easily recalled.

3.  **Exam Anxiety:** Anxiety can make even known facts disappear from memory. If a student is already struggling, the pressure to recall *any* mountain range could lead to a blank.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** While "naming" is a common task, the specific recall of geographical features might not be a routine part of their assessments, or if it is, the focus might be on memorization rather than understanding, making it fragile.

5.  **Average Pass Rate (29%):** This is a strong indicator of overall academic struggle. It means the majority of students are not consistently mastering even basic curriculum.

**Challenging the First Instinct:**

My first instinct might be: "Himalayas is so famous, surely many students would know it. Maybe Aravalli too."

*   **Reconsider "Himalayas":** While famous, can a student who barely reads English, possibly has inconsistent attendance, and is already struggling academically, reliably recall and write "Himalayas" correctly? Some might know it verbally, but writing it can be a barrier.
*   **Reconsider "Aravalli/Vindhya/Ghats":** These are significantly less likely to be known by a struggling Class 6 student than the Himalayas. If they can't even get one, they won't get a second.
*   **"Names one correct mountain range" for 0.5 points:** This means we're looking for *at least one* correct range.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Given the low average pass rate and the factors that lead to overestimation:

*   A significant portion will struggle with the *concept* of mountain ranges beyond maybe hearing "Himalayas" in passing.
*   Even those who have heard of the Himalayas might struggle with spelling or recall under pressure.
*   The likelihood of knowing a second range (Aravalli, Vindhya, etc.) is very low for this demographic.
*   Many might confuse rivers, states, or other geographical features.

I believe a very small percentage will be able to reliably name even *one* correct mountain range.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 15%**
