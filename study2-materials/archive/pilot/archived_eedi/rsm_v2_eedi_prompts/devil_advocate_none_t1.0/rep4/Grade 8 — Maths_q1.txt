Here's a breakdown of the thought process, challenging initial assumptions to arrive at a calibrated estimate:

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong for this demographic):**

* **"This is a very simple algebra problem."** Yes, for someone with a solid grasp of basic arithmetic and the concept of an unknown.
* **"They would have covered this in Class 8."** Theoretically, yes. Practical application and retention are different.
* **"They just need to subtract 9 from both sides."** Assumes understanding of "both sides," "subtracting from both sides" as an operation, and negative numbers.

**Challenging the Assumptions (Applying the given context):**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "Find the value of `y` in the equation:" - Even this phrase might be a stumbling block. "Value," "equation" could be unfamiliar.
    *   The `+` sign is universal, but the overall sentence structure can be confusing.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   **Negative Numbers:** This is a *huge* hurdle. Many students, especially those struggling, have a very weak grasp of negative numbers. `4 - 9` resulting in `-5` is not intuitive for them. They might get `9 - 4 = 5` and then be stuck, or write `5` as the answer.
    *   **Concept of Equality/Equation:** Understanding that `y + 9` is "equal to" `4` and the goal is to isolate `y` might not be fully formed. They might just see it as a sum.
    *   **Inverse Operations:** The idea that to undo `+9`, you do `-9` is foundational to algebra but often poorly taught or understood.

3.  **Exam Anxiety:**
    *   Even if they've seen this, the pressure of an exam can make them forget simple steps, especially with negative numbers.
    *   A student who is already struggling will likely freeze when encountering something that isn't a straightforward positive calculation.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type / Lack of Practice:**
    *   While they might have done `y + 4 = 9` (where the result is positive), doing `y + 9 = 4` (where the result is negative) is a distinct type of problem that requires a specific understanding of negative numbers. If they haven't practiced this *exact* structure extensively, many will stumble.
    *   Government schools often have large class sizes, less individualized attention, and potentially less homework/practice given or checked.

5.  **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is a strong indicator of overall academic struggle. If only 29% pass *everything*, then even seemingly simple items will have a low success rate. This question, while basic for a fluent English speaker with strong math foundations, requires several specific conceptual leaps that many in the 29% struggling group will not have made.

**Revised Estimate Justification:**

*   The biggest obstacle is the negative number. Many will incorrectly answer `5` or `13` (adding 9 to 4).
*   Even for those who understand the concept of isolating `y`, the arithmetic of `4 - 9` will be a significant error point.
*   The language barrier, while not extreme here, adds to the cognitive load for already struggling students.
*   The absence factor is real. If they missed the specific class on solving equations leading to negative results, they're lost.

Considering all these factors, particularly the negative number and the low overall pass rate, the proportion correct will be significantly lower than what an expert might intuitively think. It's not just about knowing "how to solve for y"; it's about flawlessly executing *all* steps, including the arithmetic with negative numbers, under exam conditions.

**Calibrated Estimate:** 15%
