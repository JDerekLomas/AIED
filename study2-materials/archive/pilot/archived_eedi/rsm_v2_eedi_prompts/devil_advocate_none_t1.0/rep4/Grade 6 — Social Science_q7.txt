Let's break down the question and the context for Class 6 students in Indian government schools from economically weaker sections.

**Question Analysis:**
*   "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan":
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Natural resources," "found in Rajasthan." "Rajasthan" is a specific state, so students need geographic knowledge.
    *   **Cognitive Load:** Recall two specific items from a list of possibilities.
*   "and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Explain," "influences," "lives of the people there."
    *   **Cognitive Load:** Establish a cause-and-effect relationship. This requires not just recall but understanding of application/impact.

**Contextual Challenges (Class 6, economically weaker sections, limited English, Indian government schools):**

1.  **English Proficiency:** This is the biggest hurdle.
    *   "Mention," "natural resources," "influences," "lives of the people" are not extremely complex words, but when combined with a factual recall and an explanation, it becomes demanding.
    *   A student who "barely reads English" would struggle significantly with understanding the full prompt. They might pick up "Rajasthan" and "resources" but miss the "explain how one influences" part.
2.  **Geographic and Scientific Knowledge:**
    *   "Natural resources": While a basic concept, for a struggling learner, defining it might be vague. Do they truly understand what falls under this category (minerals, water, solar, wind)?
    *   "Found in Rajasthan": Requires specific regional knowledge. While water is universal, specific minerals like Marble, Copper, Gypsum are more localized. Solar/wind energy are emerging concepts that might not be uniformly taught or understood as "natural resources" in the same way as minerals.
3.  **Explanation Skill:** "Explain how one of them influences the lives..." This is a higher-order thinking skill than mere recall.
    *   It requires connecting a resource (e.g., water) to its impact (irrigation, drinking, livelihood).
    *   Many students might list two resources but fail to articulate the influence or provide a very superficial answer (e.g., "Water is important").
4.  **Curriculum Coverage:** Were these specific resources for Rajasthan covered adequately? Was the *impact* aspect emphasized, or just the listing?
5.  **Exam Anxiety/Practice:** Students might panic, forget, or simply write down anything they remember. If they haven't practiced this *exact question type* (two parts, recall + explanation), they might not structure their answer correctly.
6.  **"Basic Concepts Aren't Basic":** While "natural resources" might seem basic, the *depth* required for the explanation part escalates the difficulty. "Water" is a natural resource. How does it influence lives? "It helps us live" is too simplistic for a full point. "It is used for irrigation which helps farmers grow crops, providing food and income" is what's expected for a good explanation, which is quite complex for a Class 6 student with limited English.

**Challenging the First Instinct:**
My first instinct might be "Water and solar energy are common in Rajasthan, surely they can name two and say water is used for drinking and farming."

However, upon deeper reflection:
*   Naming two is one part. The *explanation* is the tougher part. A vague explanation like "Water is important for people" probably wouldn't get the point.
*   The "limited English" aspect is critical. Students might *know* the facts in their local language but struggle to *express* them coherently in English.
*   The "explanation" requires more than just a single word or phrase. It requires a sentence or two demonstrating understanding of cause and effect.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for the entire paper, this question, which requires both recall *and* explanation in English, is likely to be on the harder side for many students. Even if they name two resources, framing the explanation correctly in English will be a significant hurdle.

A student who was "absent for this topic" would get 0.
A student who "barely reads English" might list two resources but fail completely on the explanation, or not even understand the prompt.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

I believe a significant number of students will fail to get the full point either because:
1.  They only list one resource or two incorrect ones.
2.  They list two correct resources but completely fail the explanation part due to language or conceptual difficulty.
3.  They provide a very superficial explanation that doesn't fully answer "how it influences lives."

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **15%**
