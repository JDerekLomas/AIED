Let's break this down, keeping the given constraints and typical expert overestimation in mind.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):**
My first thought might be, "This is simple! Most students know what a hobby is, and can write a few sentences. Even with limited English, they can probably manage." This is exactly the kind of overestimation the prompt warns against.

**Challenging the Assumptions:**

1.  **"Mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English":**
    *   **Limited English:** "Write a short paragraph" implies understanding of paragraph structure. "Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it" requires interpreting multiple instructions. Many students might only address one or two points. "Favourite Hobby" itself might be understood, but articulating *why* they enjoy it in English could be a significant hurdle beyond "I like it." "When you do it" might be simply "in the evening" but forming a coherent sentence around that is tough.
    *   **Vocabulary/Grammar:** Even if they know basic words, forming 4-5 grammatically acceptable sentences that flow as a "paragraph" is a high bar for someone with limited English. They might write a list of sentences rather than a connected paragraph.

2.  **"Average pass rate is about 29%":** This is a critical anchor. If the *average* pass rate across all subjects/questions is so low, this question needs to be considered in that context. While this might be an easier question than, say, a math problem, it's still an *English writing* task.

3.  **"Basic concepts aren't basic for struggling learners":** "Paragraph" might not be a well-understood concept. They might just write 4-5 disconnected sentences. "Hobby" itself might be understood, but the concept of articulating *why* they enjoy something in a structured way might not be a "basic" skill they've mastered in English.

4.  **"Exam anxiety causes blank responses":** The moment a student feels overwhelmed by the writing task, the English requirement, or the structure, they might just leave it blank or write something very minimal that doesn't meet the rubric.

5.  **"Never practiced this exact question type":** They might have written sentences about themselves, but specifically writing a *paragraph* with *multiple specific prompts* (what, when, why) about a *hobby* might be new territory.

**Re-evaluation considering the rubric:**
*   "Student writes a complete paragraph..." - This is a significant hurdle. Many might write disconnected sentences.
*   "...clearly mentions the hobby, when it is done, and why it is enjoyable." - Addressing all three points clearly in English, within a paragraph structure, is demanding. A common failure point would be addressing only one or two points, or doing so unclearly due to limited vocabulary or grammar.

Given the 29% average pass rate, the limited English, the expectation of a "paragraph," and covering *three specific points* (what, when, why), this question is harder than it initially seems. Students who can just manage to write "My hobby is playing. I play evening. I like it." would likely *not* get the point for a "complete paragraph" clearly mentioning all aspects. They need to string together coherent, grammatically sensible sentences.

I imagine a significant portion will:
*   Write less than 4 sentences.
*   Write disconnected sentences, not a paragraph.
*   Fail to address all three points (especially "why" or "when" clearly).
*   Have too many grammatical errors to be considered "clear."
*   Leave it blank due to anxiety or lack of confidence in writing in English.

This isn't just about knowing what a hobby is; it's about executing a multi-faceted writing task in a second (or third) language for struggling learners.
