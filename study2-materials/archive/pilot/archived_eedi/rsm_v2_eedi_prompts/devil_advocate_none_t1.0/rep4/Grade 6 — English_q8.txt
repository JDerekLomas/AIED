Let's break down the thinking process, challenging assumptions as requested.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**
My first thought is, "This is simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object). Most Class 6 students should know this. Maybe 60-70%."

**Challenging the Initial Instinct (Applying the provided constraints):**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "Book" and "reading" are likely known. "He" and "a" are also common. "Is" might be trickier for some, but generally understood in simple present continuous.
    *   *However*, knowing individual words is different from understanding their grammatical role. The student needs to recognize "he" as the subject, "is reading" as the verb phrase, and "a book" as the object.
    *   For students with *very* limited English, just seeing the words jumbled might trigger confusion rather than a simple reordering task. They might focus on word recognition, not sentence structure.
    *   *Consider a student who barely reads English:* They might recognize "he," "book," "reading." But putting them in the correct *grammatical* order without a strong grasp of English sentence structure (especially for a continuous tense) is a leap. They might try "Book he is reading a" or "Reading book he is a."

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   While SVO is fundamental, the *present continuous tense* ("is reading") might be a step up for some, especially if their exposure to English is minimal and largely rote. They might struggle with the auxiliary verb "is" and the -ing form together.
    *   Jumbled sentences themselves can be a distinct question type that some students might not have explicitly practiced. If they've only done fill-in-the-blanks or simple translations, this requires a different cognitive skill.

3.  **Exam Anxiety:**
    *   A student who is already struggling with English and basic concepts will be more susceptible to anxiety. Seeing a jumbled sentence, even with known words, could just lead to a blank stare or a random arrangement, especially if they are trying to "translate" word-for-word rather than grasp the structure.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   This is critical. If their curriculum emphasizes rote learning or simpler exercises, they might not have developed the analytical skills needed to reconstruct a sentence from jumbled words. They might be able to *read* "He is reading a book" but struggle to *construct* it from scratch.

5.  **Absent for This Topic:**
    *   Grammar topics, especially verb tenses and sentence structure, build on each other. If a student missed lessons on present continuous or basic sentence formation, this question would be impossible for them. Given the "average pass rate is about 29%," it implies a significant proportion of students are indeed missing foundational knowledge.

**Re-evaluating based on challenges:**

*   The words are simple, which is a positive.
*   The target sentence is very common.
*   *However*, the jump from recognizing words to understanding and applying grammatical rules for sentence construction, particularly the present continuous tense, is significant for students with limited English and inconsistent schooling.
*   Many might get "He reading book" or similar incorrect but partially logical arrangements.
*   The "average pass rate about 29%" is a strong anchor. If students are struggling overall, a grammar question requiring structural understanding won't be an outlier of high success.
*   The instruction to "challenge my first instinct" and consider the lowest common denominator ("barely reads English") pushes the estimate significantly lower. A student who barely reads English would very likely fail this.

Given these considerations, a significant portion of students will either arrange the words incorrectly, miss the "is," or simply leave it blank. Those who succeed will be the ones with a decent grasp of basic English sentence structure and present continuous tense. This is likely a smaller subset than my initial optimistic view.

If the average pass rate for *all questions* is 29%, this particular question, while seemingly simple to a native speaker, requires a specific grammatical understanding that many government school students might lack. It's not just vocabulary; it's syntax.

I'm moving away from 60-70% and even 40-50%. It's hard for me to imagine *most* students getting this when the overall pass rate is 29%. If this were a *very* easy question, it would pull the average up. But it requires more than just word recognition.

Let's consider students who might get *close* but not perfect:
*   "He reading a
