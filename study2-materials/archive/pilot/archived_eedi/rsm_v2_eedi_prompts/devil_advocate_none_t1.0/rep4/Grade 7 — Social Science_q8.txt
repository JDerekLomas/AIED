Let's break this down by challenging the assumptions.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**
My initial thought might be: "This is a basic social studies question. Rajasthan is known for agriculture and animal husbandry. Most students would have heard of these." If I were a teacher, I might think 50-60% would get this.

**Challenging the Assumptions (applying the provided context):**

*   **Limited English:** "Main occupations" and "rural areas" might be understood, but "Rajasthan" might be a geographical blank for some. "Describe any one in brief" requires not just recall but sentence construction. Students from economically weaker sections often have less exposure to formal English outside of school.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While agriculture and animal husbandry are fundamental to rural India, *articulating* them as "occupations" might be the hurdle. Some might just list "farming" and "cows" which might not meet the rubric precisely (though "farming" clearly fits). Handicrafts might be even less commonly known as a "main occupation" for the *majority*.
*   **Exam Anxiety:** For students already struggling, this question, even if vaguely familiar, could trigger a blank. They might know people farm but can't retrieve the word "agriculture" or structure a response.
*   **Lack of Practice:** Have they practiced *describing* an occupation in brief? Or just listing? The second part of the question adds a layer of difficulty that might lead to incomplete answers.
*   **Absence/Inconsistent Teaching:** Given the overall pass rate of 29%, it's highly likely that a significant portion of students have gaps in their knowledge due to inconsistent attendance, poor teaching, or difficulty grasping the material in the first place. This specific topic might have been covered poorly or missed entirely by many.
*   **"Main Occupations":** Even if they know "farming," do they know "animal husbandry" as a distinct *main occupation*? Some might just combine them conceptually. "Handicrafts" might be a more niche answer.

**Re-evaluating based on the challenges:**

The rubric requires naming *at least two* main occupations correctly.
*   "Agriculture/Farming": Many would likely get "farming."
*   "Animal Husbandry/Pastoralism": This is where the first significant drop will occur. Many might know people keep animals but not associate it as a distinct "main occupation" or know the term "animal husbandry."
*   "Handicrafts": This is even less likely to be named by a large proportion.

So, getting *two* correct terms is harder than it seems.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for *all* questions, and the specific hurdles for this question:

*   A significant portion will struggle with the English.
*   A significant portion will only recall one occupation (e.g., farming).
*   A significant portion will not know "animal husbandry" or "pastoralism" as terms.
*   A significant portion will have missed the content or not fully grasped it.
*   The "describe in brief" part, while not explicitly part of the *scoring* for the 1 mark in this specific rubric, might deter some or consume mental energy.

I need to aim significantly lower than my initial teacher-brain estimate. If the overall pass rate is 29%, a question requiring recall of *two* specific terms, especially one like "animal husbandry," in a context of limited English and academic struggles, will likely perform below average for the cohort.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **20%**
