Let's break this down with the given caveats:

1.  **Limited English:** "Some" and "any" are basic, but for students with *very* limited English, even distinguishing between positive and negative/interrogative contexts for these words can be a hurdle. They might have a rudimentary grasp of "some" as meaning "a few" and "any" as "even one," but applying it correctly in a sentence structure might be difficult if the underlying grammar isn't solid.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While "some/any" is foundational in English, consistent exposure and practice in various contexts are needed. If their English instruction is rote or infrequent, this nuance might not have been deeply absorbed or retained.

3.  **Exam Anxiety:** For struggling learners, any question can trigger anxiety, leading to guessing or freezing, even on questions they *might* have been able to answer in a low-stakes environment.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** While they might have learned about "some" and "any," a fill-in-the-blank choice format specifically testing this distinction might be new. Many Indian government school curricula still rely on older, more memory-based teaching methods rather than contextual application.

5.  **Average Pass Rate (29%):** This is a critical anchor. If the *average* pass rate for *all* questions is 29%, a question needs to be significantly easier than average to get a higher score.

**Challenging the first instinct:** My first instinct (as someone fluent in English) is that "this is easy, most kids would get this." But then I remember:

*   Could a student who barely reads English distinguish the subtle positive assertion required for "some" versus the negative/interrogative usage for "any"? They might just recognize "apples" and "basket" and pick randomly or choose the first word they see.
*   Could a student who was absent for a topic specifically covering "some/any" usage in positive sentences recall this? Unlikely.
*   Many students might know "some" means "a few" and "any" means "any number," but not grasp the grammatical rule that "some" is used in positive statements and "any" in negative or interrogative ones (generally). They might see "apples" and think "some apples" intuitively, but it's not a guaranteed grammatical understanding.

Given the 29% average pass rate, this question *is* likely easier than many others, but it's not a trivial 80-90% correct item for this demographic. It requires a basic understanding of sentence structure and the specific contextual use of these quantifiers.

*   A significant portion of students will likely guess.
*   Some will have learned the rule well enough.
*   Some will get it right by intuition ("some apples" sounds right, "any apples" sounds wrong for a positive statement).

Considering all these factors, particularly the limited English proficiency and the low average pass rate for the entire exam:
