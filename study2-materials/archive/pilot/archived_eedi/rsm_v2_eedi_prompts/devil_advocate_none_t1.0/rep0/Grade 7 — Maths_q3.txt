Here's my thought process, applying the given considerations:

1.  **Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):** My first instinct, as someone with a strong educational background, is "This is a very basic geometry question. Most students who've been taught it should get it right." This is exactly what the prompt warns against.

2.  **Challenging the Instinct (Applying the Constraints):**

    *   **"Economically weaker sections with limited English":**
        *   "Find the area of a triangle..." – "Area" and "triangle" might be known visually but recognizing the English terms could be an issue.
        *   "...whose base is `8` cm and height is `6` cm." – "Base" and "height" are crucial. If these English terms are not firmly linked to their geometric concepts in their mind, the question is immediately inaccessible. They might know the *formula* in their local language but not recognize the terms in English.
        *   Reading comprehension of the full sentence structure could be a barrier even if individual words are somewhat known.

    *   **"Average pass rate is about 29%":** This is a strong anchor. If the overall pass rate is so low, it suggests a significant proportion of students struggle with *everything*, even basic concepts. This question, while basic to an expert, isn't necessarily "easier" than other things they fail at if English is the primary barrier.

    *   **"Teachers and experts consistently MISJUDGE item difficulty":** This reinforces not trusting my "easy" instinct.

    *   **"Limited English":** A student who "barely reads English" would struggle significantly with "find the area," "base," and "height." They might be able to pick out the numbers 8 and 6, but what to do with them?

    *   **"Basic concepts aren't basic for struggling learners":** Even if taught, the formula `1/2 * b * h` might be forgotten, misremembered, or never truly internalized, especially if the underlying concept of "area" and why the 1/2 is there isn't grasped.

    *   **"Exam anxiety":** Could lead to a blank response even if they *might* have known it in a calmer setting.

    *   **"Never practiced this exact question type":** While this is a very standard type, it's possible they've seen it only with diagrams, or only in their native language, or the numbers were different, or it was part of a larger problem. The *exact phrasing* in English might be novel.

    *   **Rubric:** "States or uses the correct formula." This means they need to recall `Area = 1/2 × base × height`. They don't even necessarily need to calculate the final answer (though most would if they got the formula).

3.  **Recalibrating:**

    *   Many students will be lost due to English comprehension of "base" and "height" specifically.
    *   Even if they understand the English, recalling the correct formula `1/2 * b * h` (and not `b * h` or `2 * b * h`) is a hurdle.
    *   The `1/2` is a common point of error for struggling students. They might just multiply 8 and 6.
    *   Considering the overall 29% pass rate, this question, while fundamental, is still part of the curriculum that many are failing.

    Given all this, a significant portion will fail due to language, formula recall, or both. If the overall pass rate is 29%, it's unlikely this specific question has a success rate that's dramatically higher, unless it's considered *the easiest* possible question, which it isn't if English and formula recall are barriers.

    I need to pull it down from my initial high estimate. If 29% is the *average*, this question might be slightly above average because it's a direct application, but not by a huge margin. I'm thinking about students who *might* get it: those who understood the English terms, recalled the exact formula, and avoided common errors like forgetting the 1/2. This group is not the majority.

    A student who barely reads English would *not* get this. A student who was absent for this topic would *not* get this. Even a student who was present might not get it due to retention issues or English.

    My initial instinct for a "basic" question would be 70-80%. After the challenge, I'm thinking closer to the average pass rate, or slightly above it if it's considered one of the more straightforward recall tasks. The biggest barrier is the English.
