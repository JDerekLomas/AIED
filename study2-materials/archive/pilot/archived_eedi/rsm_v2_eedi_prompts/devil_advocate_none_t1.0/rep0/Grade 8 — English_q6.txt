Let's break down the question and the target audience.

**Question:** Define fable.
**Rubric:** Defines fable as a short story that typically uses animals as characters and imparts a moral lesson.

**Target Audience:** Class 8 students in Indian government schools, mostly from economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate 29%.

**Initial Instincts (and why they might be wrong):**

1.  **"Fable is a pretty common literary term, they should know it."**
    *   **Challenge:** "Common" for whom? For an English medium student? For someone exposed to a lot of stories and literature? Many of these students have limited exposure to English literature *in English*. They might know *stories* that are fables (like Panchatantra), but the *term* "fable" itself, defined in English, might be new or not fully grasped.
    *   **English Proficiency:** Defining it requires understanding "short story," "typically uses animals as characters," "imparts a moral lesson." Each of these phrases could be a stumbling block. "Imparts" is a relatively advanced verb. "Moral lesson" might be understood as "good thing to learn," but articulating it precisely in English is hard.

2.  **"They learn this in school, it's a basic concept."**
    *   **Challenge:** "Basic" for struggling learners is relative. "Learned" doesn't mean "retained" or "can articulate." If the teacher taught it once, weeks or months ago, and they haven't practiced defining it, it's easily forgotten.
    *   **Curriculum vs. Retention:** The curriculum might *cover* fables, but given the 29% average pass rate, clearly a lot of taught material isn't sticking or isn't understood deeply enough for articulation.
    *   **No Practice:** "Many students have never practiced this exact question type" – defining a literary term precisely in English. They might be better at identifying a fable or giving an example, but defining it is a higher-order skill.

3.  **"Even if they don't get the full definition, they'll get parts of it."**
    *   **Challenge:** The rubric is quite specific and requires all three key components ("short story," "animals as characters," "moral lesson") for a maximum score. Partial answers might not score.

**Considering the Constraints:**

*   **Limited English:** "Define" itself might be understood, but forming a coherent, grammatically correct sentence or two to explain a concept in English is a major hurdle. Words like "imparts" or even "typically" might be unfamiliar or misinterpreted.
*   **Economically Weaker Sections:** May have less exposure to books outside of school, less support for English at home, and potentially less consistent attendance.
*   **Exam Anxiety:** Can cause even known information to become inaccessible.
*   **Absenteeism:** Some students may have missed the specific lessons where this was covered.
*   **Teachers Overestimate:** This is the core reminder. What seems obvious to an educated adult is often a significant challenge for these students.

**Refined Estimation Process:**

*   **Who *could* get it?** Only students who have a strong enough grasp of English to understand the question and articulate the full definition. They would need to have:
    *   Understood the concept of a fable thoroughly when taught.
    *   Remembered all three key components.
    *   Been able to translate that understanding into accurate English sentences.
    *   Not been too anxious to respond.
*   Given the 29% average pass rate, a significant portion of the class is already struggling with the *entire* curriculum. This is a specific, somewhat academic, English-based definition task.
*   Even among those who "pass," many might scrape by without mastering every concept.
*   I'd expect a very small fraction to get the *full* definition as per the rubric. Many might mention "animals" or "story" but miss the "moral lesson" or struggle with the phrasing.

Let's think about percentages:
*   Perhaps 10-15% might know *parts* of the definition (e.g., animals in a story).
*   However, getting *all three* key components and expressing them adequately in English, under exam conditions, is a much higher bar.
*   If the average pass rate is 29%, it means a lot of students are failing or barely passing. This question is not a simple recall of facts; it requires conceptual understanding and expressive English.

Considering the strong cautions against overestimation:

*   Could a student who barely reads English define "fable"? Highly unlikely for the full rubric.
*   Could a student
