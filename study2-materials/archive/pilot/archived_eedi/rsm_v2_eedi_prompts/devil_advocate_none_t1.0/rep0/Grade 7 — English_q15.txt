Let's break down the challenge.

**Initial Instinct vs. Calibrated Thinking:**

My first instinct, based on the simplicity of the task for an average English speaker, might be to estimate a higher percentage, perhaps 40-50%. It's a very common, basic writing prompt.

However, applying the provided filters:

*   **Limited English:** This is the biggest hurdle. "Write a short paragraph" implies a certain level of sentence construction, vocabulary, and grammatical coherence. Many students, especially those from economically weaker sections, might struggle to form even simple sentences correctly in English. "My Favourite Hobby" might be understood, but articulating *why* they enjoy it, or *when* they do it, beyond one-word answers, could be very difficult.
*   **"Basic" isn't basic:** While "hobby" is a common word, structuring a 4-5 sentence paragraph with flow, mentioning specific details, and expressing reasons requires more than just knowing individual words. It requires basic writing mechanics.
*   **Exam anxiety:** Writing in a second language under timed conditions can amplify existing struggles. A student who might be able to construct a few sentences verbally could freeze when asked to write them down.
*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** Even if they've written sentences, has Class 7 in Indian government schools consistently practiced writing 4-5 sentence *paragraphs* with specific required elements in English? If not, this is a novel task.
*   **Absent for the topic:** If "paragraph writing" or even specific vocabulary related to hobbies wasn't covered, or if they missed those lessons, their ability to perform will be severely hampered.
*   **Average pass rate ~29%:** This is a strong indicator of overall academic performance. If the average pass rate for *all* subjects is 29%, a writing task requiring multi-sentence construction in English is unlikely to significantly exceed this, and might even be lower for the specific skill it tests.

**Re-evaluating the Rubric:**

*   "Student writes a complete paragraph": This means more than just a list of sentences. It implies some basic structure.
*   "clearly mentions the hobby, when it is done, and why it is enjoyable": Each of these elements needs to be present and understandable.

**Putting it all together for a calibrated estimate:**

*   A significant portion of students will struggle with the English vocabulary and grammar to express themselves adequately in 4-5 sentences.
*   Many might write 1-2 fragmented sentences but not a "complete paragraph."
*   Some might state the hobby but fail to elaborate on "when" or "why" in English.
*   The 29% average pass rate for all subjects sets a realistic upper bound, and writing in English is often a more challenging skill than, say, basic math.

Considering all these factors, and strongly challenging the "most students could do this" trap, the proportion of students who could meet *all* aspects of the rubric (complete paragraph, all three elements clearly stated) would be quite low.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **18%**
