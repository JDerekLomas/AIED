Here's my thought process to arrive at the estimate:

1.  **Analyze the question:**
    *   "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice." - This immediately signals a grammar transformation task.
    *   Sentence: "The wind blew the leaves away."
    *   Expected Answer: "The leaves were blown away by the wind."

2.  **Consider the target audience (Class 7, Indian government schools, economically weaker sections, limited English):**
    *   **English Proficiency:** This is the *biggest* hurdle.
        *   Do they understand "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" as grammatical terms *in English*? Many might not, even if they've heard them. They might understand the *concept* if taught in their local language, but the English terminology is a barrier.
        *   "Change the following sentence from..." - Do they understand this instruction fully?
    *   **Grammar Concepts:**
        *   **Identifying Subject/Object:** "The wind" (subject), "the leaves" (object). This is fundamental.
        *   **Verb Tense:** "blew" (simple past). They need to correctly identify this.
        *   **Past Participle:** "blown" (the past participle of "blow"). This is often a weak point. Irregular verbs are hard.
        *   **Auxiliary Verb (to be):** "were" (matching the new subject "leaves" and the past tense). This requires agreement and tense understanding.
        *   **Preposition "by":** "by the wind." This is a key marker of passive voice.
    *   **Exposure to this exact question type:** The prompt states "many students have never practiced this exact question type." This is crucial. Even if they've *learned* active/passive, applying it to an unfamiliar sentence or without specific practice is harder.
    *   **Exam Anxiety:** Can cause students to blank on even familiar concepts.
    *   **Absenteeism/Foundation:** "A student who was absent for this topic?" or "A student who barely reads English?" are key filters. If they missed the lesson, or if their foundational understanding of verbs, tenses, subjects, objects is weak, this is almost impossible.

3.  **Initial Instinct vs. Challenged Instinct:**
    *   **Initial Instinct (Teacher/Expert bias):** "Oh, active/passive voice is taught in Class 6/7. This is a basic transformation. Most students should get this, maybe 50-60%."
    *   **Challenged Instinct (Applying the filters):**
        *   **English Terminology:** If they don't understand "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice," they're lost from the start. This could eliminate a significant chunk.
        *   **Irregular Verb "blow/blew/blown":** Many will struggle with "blown." They might use "blowed" or keep "blew."
        *   **Auxiliary Verb "were":** Getting the correct form ("were" for plural "leaves" and past tense) is another point of failure. Some might use "is" or "was."
        *   **Word Order:** Even if they get the core elements, the exact word order ("The leaves were blown away by the wind") needs to be precise.
        *   **"Away":** Where does "away" go? It's part of the phrasal verb "blow away," so it needs to stick with "blown." Some might misplace it.
        *   **Lack of Practice:** If they haven't seen this specific sentence or a similar structure with a phrasal verb, it adds to the difficulty.
        *   **"Basic" isn't basic:** For struggling learners, remembering all the rules for active to passive transformation *and* applying them correctly in real-time, under pressure, with limited English, is far from basic.

4.  **Refining the Estimate based on the average pass rate (29%):**
    *   An average pass rate of 29% suggests that many students are struggling overall. This question is a specific grammar transformation, which often requires a higher level of precision and understanding than, say, a simple comprehension question.
    *   The complexities (irregular verb, auxiliary verb agreement, terminology barrier, precise word order) make this harder than "average."
    *   If 29% pass overall, a more complex grammar item like this would likely be *below* that average, unless it's a topic specifically drilled to death (which the prompt suggests isn't the case for "exact question type").

5.  **Final Calibration:**
    *   Could a student who barely reads English do this? No
