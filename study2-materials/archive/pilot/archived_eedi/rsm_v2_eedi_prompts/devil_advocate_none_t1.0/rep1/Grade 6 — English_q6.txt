Let's break down the question and the student profile.

**Student Profile:**
*   Class 6, Indian government schools.
*   Mostly economically weaker sections.
*   Limited English proficiency.
*   Average pass rate ~29%.
*   Prone to exam anxiety.
*   May not have encountered this exact question type or practiced similar open-ended responses extensively.
*   Potentially missed relevant lessons due to absenteeism.

**Question:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"
**Rubric:** "Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why." (Max score: 1.5)

**Analysis of Difficulty:**

1.  **Reading Comprehension (English):** The question itself is relatively simple in structure. "Which line... like most" is understandable, as is "why." However, if the poem itself is complex or uses unfamiliar vocabulary, understanding *any* line to *like* it becomes a hurdle. Assuming the poem isn't overly complex, they still need to process the question.
2.  **Accessing/Recalling the Poem:** Students need to have the poem in front of them or recall it accurately if it's a memory-based test. If it's a "read this poem then answer" type, the poem's length and complexity matter greatly.
3.  **Understanding "Like":** While a basic word, expressing *why* one likes something requires a slightly more nuanced understanding than just identifying content.
4.  **Identifying a Specific Line:** They need to be able to pick out a distinct line and either quote it or accurately refer to it. This assumes some level of literacy in identifying sentence structures within a poem.
5.  **Formulating a "Why" (English Expression):** This is the biggest hurdle.
    *   **Cognitive Load:** Even if they know *why* in their native language, translating that into basic English can be very difficult for students with limited English.
    *   **Vocabulary:** They might lack the specific vocabulary to articulate their reason (e.g., "it makes me feel happy," "it reminds me of X," "the words are beautiful").
    *   **Grammar/Sentence Structure:** Forming a coherent sentence in English to explain their preference.
    *   **Open-ended vs. Multiple Choice:** This is an open-ended question. Many students are more comfortable with rote answers or selecting from options rather than constructing their own responses.
    *   **Anxiety:** The pressure to articulate a complex thought in a foreign language can lead to blank responses or very simplistic, rubric-failing answers.
    *   **Lack of Practice:** It's unlikely they have extensive practice with "explain your feelings/preferences" questions in English.

**Revisiting My Instinct (and challenging it):**

My first instinct might be "Oh, picking a favorite line and saying why is easy, even in simple terms."

**Challenge:**
*   **"Easy" for whom?** Not for a student struggling with basic English. "It is good" might be their best shot, which likely wouldn't score full marks if the rubric implies more than just a two-word explanation.
*   **Poem complexity:** What if the poem itself is hard to understand? If they don't understand *any* line well, how can they *like* one?
*   **"Why" in English:** This is the core difficulty. Even if they feel something, articulating it in simple, grammatically sound English is a major challenge. Many might just write the line again, or write "because it is good" without further elaboration, which might not meet "mentions why" adequately for 1.5 marks.
*   **Partial Credit:** The rubric allows for 1.5 marks. "Denotes a line" is easier than "mentions why." Some might get the line, but fail the "why." Does "It is good" count as "mentions why"? Likely yes for partial, but getting a *good* "why" is harder. We are estimating *correct* meaning achieving the rubric criteria fully or almost fully.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for this group, an open-ended question requiring subjective expression and justification in a limited second language is going to be exceptionally challenging. Even identifying a line and saying "it is good" might be a stretch for some. For 1.5 marks, the "why" needs to be more than just "good" to fully satisfy.

I'd expect a significant number to just quote a line without explanation, or give a one-word answer for "why" that isn't elaborated enough. A smaller group might manage a basic explanation.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Given the extreme limitations in English, the open-ended nature, and
