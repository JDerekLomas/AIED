Let's break down the question and the likely student performance based on the provided context.

**Analyzing the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Content:** "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "British power in India," "expansion." These are standard historical topics covered in Class 8.
*   **Key Concept:** The direct consequence of Plassey – establishment of political dominance/control over Bengal, often through a puppet ruler.
*   **Vocabulary:** "Contribute," "expansion," "dominance," "puppet nawab." While "contribute" and "expansion" are fairly common, "dominance" and "puppet nawab" might be less frequently used or understood in English by struggling students.
*   **Complexity:** It requires understanding cause-and-effect and linking a specific event to a broader trend (expansion of power). It's not just recall of a date.

**Challenging Initial Instincts (Applying the Expert Warnings):**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "How did... contribute to..." might be tricky for students with limited English. They might know *what* Plassey was, but struggle to articulate its *contribution* or *how* it led to expansion, especially if they are trying to formulate an answer in English.
    *   Keywords like "dominance" or "puppet nawab" might not be in their active vocabulary, even if they've heard the concept in their local language. They might know "Mir Jafar became ruler," but not "puppet nawab."

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   While Plassey is fundamental, understanding *political dominance* and *how* a battle establishes it (rather than just winning land) requires a higher level of comprehension. A student might recall "British won" but not connect it to "they controlled Bengal's government."
    *   Many students might only have a superficial understanding: "British fought, British won, Mir Jafar became ruler." Connecting this to the *expansion of British power* as a *political* rather than just *territorial* phenomenon is harder.

3.  **Exam Anxiety:**
    *   A student who is shaky on the concept or struggling with English might simply draw a blank under pressure, even if they have some fragmented knowledge.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   They might have practiced "When was the Battle of Plassey?" or "Who fought in the Battle of Plassey?" but not necessarily "How did X contribute to Y?" which demands a more analytical and explanatory answer.

**Revisiting the Average Pass Rate (29%):** This is a critical anchor. It suggests that a significant majority of students are struggling learners.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Considering all the factors:

*   A *few* students will have mastered the topic, understood the English, and can articulate the answer perfectly.
*   Many will have *some* knowledge (e.g., "British won," "Mir Jafar"), but will struggle to connect it clearly to "expansion of British power" or use the precise vocabulary required for a full mark.
*   A significant portion will struggle with the English, the conceptual leap, or recall under pressure.

I initially might think 30-40% if I only focused on "it's a core topic." But applying the expert warnings, especially the limited English and the "how did it contribute" aspect, significantly reduces this.

I'm leaning towards the lower end of what one might consider for a "core topic" that requires a specific conceptual understanding and articulation in English for a population with a 29% average pass rate.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 18%**
