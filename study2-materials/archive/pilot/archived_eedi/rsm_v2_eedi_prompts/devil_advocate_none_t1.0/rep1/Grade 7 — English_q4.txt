Let's break down the question and the context.

**The Question:** "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."

**The Rubric:** "The king wanted to answer (based on the reading passage) the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with. Any valid reason."

**Key Challenges for Students:**

1.  **English Comprehension:**
    *   "Important in real life": This phrase itself requires understanding of abstract concepts. "Important" can be tricky, and "real life" might not be immediately clear to someone primarily learning in a different language, especially if their daily life is quite structured and doesn't involve much abstract reflection.
    *   "Give one reason": This requires not just agreement/disagreement but justification.

2.  **Connecting to the Passage (Implicitly):** The rubric explicitly states the king's questions are "based on the reading passage." This means students need to have understood the core of the passage: the king's three questions and why he sought answers. If they didn't fully grasp the passage, they won't understand *what* the questions were, making it hard to comment on their real-life importance.

3.  **Abstract Thinking/Critical Thinking:**
    *   The question asks for an opinion and a justification. This moves beyond rote recall. Students need to *evaluate* the questions' relevance.
    *   "The right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with" – these are fundamental life questions. While universally relevant, expressing *why* they are important requires a level of abstract reasoning and articulation that might be difficult for struggling learners, especially in a second language.

4.  **Cultural/Educational Background:**
    *   Students from economically weaker sections often have less exposure to abstract discussion or critical thinking exercises in their daily lives or even in school, where the focus might be more on memorization.
    *   The concept of a "king" might be somewhat distant from their direct experience, making the questions feel less immediately "real."

5.  **Exam Anxiety:** As noted, anxiety can cause blank responses even if a student has some idea.

6.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While "importance" seems basic to an educated adult, for a struggling learner, distinguishing between "important," "good," "necessary," etc., can be challenging, let alone formulating a reason.

7.  **No Prior Practice:** Many students might not have practiced this exact type of "opinion + justification" question.

**Challenging My Instinct:**

My first instinct might be: "Well, these are fundamental life questions, so most students should recognize their importance."

*   **Counter-argument 1:** Recognition is one thing, articulation in English with a valid reason is another. They might *feel* it's important but struggle to express *why* in a way that meets the rubric.
*   **Counter-argument 2:** "Limited English" isn't just about vocabulary; it's about grammar, sentence structure, and expressing complex ideas. A simple, grammatically correct reason like "Yes, because it helps us make good choices" might be difficult to construct for many.
*   **Counter-argument 3:** The average pass rate is 29%. This implies a significant portion struggle with even more straightforward questions. This question requires more advanced comprehension and expression.
*   **Counter-argument 4:** The rubric is "Any valid reason." This seems forgiving, but a student still needs to produce *a reason* that logically links to the importance of the questions. Simply saying "yes" or "it's good" might not be sufficient if not elaborated.

**Re-evaluating based on the challenges:**

*   **Understanding the passage:** A significant hurdle. If they didn't get the king's questions from the passage, they are lost.
*   **Understanding "important in real life":** Abstract.
*   **Formulating a reason in English:** Requires vocabulary and grammatical construction.
*   **Lack of practice:** For this type of question.

Given the low average pass rate (29%) and the multi-layered difficulty of this specific question (comprehension, abstract thinking, justification, articulation in a second language), it's highly likely that a substantial number of students will fail to provide a complete and valid answer according to the rubric. Many might give a "yes" without a reason, or a very vague reason that doesn't quite hit the mark.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

I believe the difficulty of formulating a coherent reason in English, combined with the need to grasp the abstract nature of the king's questions and their "real-life" relevance, will significantly depress the success rate
