Let's break down the thought process for this estimation, taking into account the given constraints and common misjudgments.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**

*   "Area of a triangle? That's a fundamental concept taught in middle school. Most students would know this."
*   "The numbers are simple (8 and 6). No complex calculations."
*   "The question is direct and doesn't require multi-step reasoning."

**Challenging the Instinct based on the Provided Information:**

1.  **Limited English (Economically Weaker Sections):**
    *   "Find the area..." - "Find" might be understood, "area" could be tricky if not explicitly taught with a visual.
    *   "...base is 8 cm and height is 6 cm." - "Base" and "height" are specific mathematical terms. A student with limited English might struggle to differentiate these from general English words, or might not associate them with the sides of a triangle in the correct context without a diagram or clear prior instruction.
    *   The formula itself (`Area = 1/2 × base × height`) uses English words.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   Is the *concept* of area itself understood? Do they know *why* we measure it?
    *   Is the *derivation* of the formula (`1/2 * b * h`) understood, or is it just memorized? If it's just memorized, retention will be lower.
    *   The fraction `1/2` can be a conceptual hurdle. Do they understand multiplying by `1/2` as dividing by 2? Or will they try to multiply `1/2 * 8 * 6` as `1 * 8 * 6 / 2` or even struggle with the `1/2` part entirely?

3.  **Exam Anxiety:**
    *   Even if they know it, anxiety can cause a blank. The pressure of an exam for a struggling student is immense.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   They might have practiced finding the area *with a diagram*.
    *   They might have practiced with different numbers.
    *   They might have practiced with shapes other than triangles (e.g., rectangles).
    *   A purely textual question without a visual aid can be a significant barrier if they're used to visual cues.

5.  **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is a crucial anchor. If the *average* pass rate for *all* questions is 29%, a question needs to be significantly easier than average to exceed that. Is this "significantly easier"?

**Re-evaluation:**

*   **Formula Recall:** Many might have seen the formula, but recalling it accurately (especially the `1/2` part) under pressure, *and* understanding what "base" and "height" refer to *without a diagram*, is harder than it seems.
*   **Conceptual Understanding vs. Rote Learning:** If it was rote memorization, retention will be poor.
*   **Language Barrier:** This is probably the biggest factor. "Base" and "height" are technical terms. If a student's English is limited, these words might not trigger the correct mathematical concept.
*   **Common Errors:**
    *   Forgetting the `1/2`. (Common even for stronger students!)
    *   Multiplying base and height and stopping there (thinking it's a rectangle).
    *   Confusing it with perimeter.
    *   Simply not knowing the formula at all.
    *   Being unable to interpret the question due to language.

Given the constraints, especially the limited English, the high likelihood of rote learning without deep understanding, and the lack of a visual, this question is *much harder* than it appears to a fluent English speaker who understands the math. It's not just about knowing the formula; it's about interpreting the question in a specific linguistic and mathematical context.

If the average is 29%, this question, while fundamental, is presented in a way that creates multiple barriers for the target group. I would expect it to be *above* the average due to its foundational nature, but not drastically so because of the execution challenges.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

I'm aiming for something that acknowledges it's a core concept but is heavily impacted by the barriers.

*   Could 10% get it simply by rote recall of the formula and understanding the words by chance? Yes.
*   Could another 15% figure it out if they've had good instruction and can parse the language somewhat? Maybe.
*   Could another 5-10
