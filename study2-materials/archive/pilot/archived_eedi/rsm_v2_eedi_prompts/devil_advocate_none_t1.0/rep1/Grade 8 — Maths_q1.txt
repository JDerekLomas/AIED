Let's break down the thought process, challenging initial assumptions:

**Initial Instinct (before challenging):**
"This is a simple linear equation. Most students in Class 8, even struggling ones, would have been taught how to isolate 'y' by subtracting 9 from both sides. They might make a sign error, but the concept is basic. Maybe 50-60%."

**Challenging the Assumptions - The "Why my first instinct is probably wrong" checklist:**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "Find the value of y in the equation:" - While "find the value" is common, "equation" itself might be a slightly more formal term than what a struggling student processes. They might focus on the numbers and symbols more than the full sentence.
    *   The *problem itself* is numbers and symbols, which helps. But understanding the *instruction* is key.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   **Negative Numbers:** This is the *biggest* trap. While taught, the concept of negative numbers, especially when resulting from a subtraction that "goes past zero" (4 - 9), is a major hurdle for many. They might intuitively think "9-4 = 5" and forget the sign or struggle with "4-9" itself. Many might not be comfortable with negative numbers as a *solution* in a practical sense.
    *   **Balancing Equations:** The idea of doing the same operation to both sides (subtracting 9 from 4) is foundational but can be shaky. Some might try to move the 9 over as +9 instead of -9 if their understanding of "opposite operation" is weak.
    *   **Order of Operations/Inverse Operations:** They need to identify that the operation is addition (+9) and the inverse is subtraction (-9).

3.  **Exam Anxiety:**
    *   A student who sees "y + 9 = 4" might immediately feel overwhelmed if they struggle with math. This simple problem can *look* intimidating if their core skills are weak.
    *   Anxiety can lead to simple errors like transposing numbers, mixing up signs, or just freezing.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   While they've done linear equations, have they frequently encountered ones where the result is a negative number from a smaller number minus a larger number? Often, textbook examples might stick to positive integer solutions initially.
    *   If they haven't seen "4 - 9" in the context of solving for 'y' specifically, it can feel new and confusing, even if the individual steps were taught.

**Re-evaluation considering the challenges:**

*   **Sign Error:** Many will likely get '5' but miss the '-5'. This is a very common error.
*   **Misunderstanding Inverse Operation:** Some might add 9 to 4, getting 13. Or subtract 4 from 9, getting 5, but not linking it to 'y'.
*   **Blank Response:** Anxiety or a complete lack of understanding of negative numbers/equation solving could lead to a blank.
*   **Class 8 Pass Rate 29%:** This is a *critical* piece of information. If the overall pass rate is so low, it implies a significant proportion of students are struggling across the board. This specific question is foundational, but if the foundation is weak, even "basic" questions are hard.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Given the high likelihood of sign errors, difficulty with negative numbers as a solution, and the overall low pass rate for this demographic, the percentage will be significantly lower than what a teacher or expert (who is fluent in these concepts) would assume. Many will likely get +5, which is incorrect according to the rubric.

*   A student who barely reads English might still process the symbols but then stumble on the actual math.
*   A student who was absent for "solving equations involving negative integers" is at a major disadvantage.

Considering all this, the initial instinct of 50-60% is far too high. The crucial aspect is the *negative number result*.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:** 20%
