Let's break this down, keeping the given constraints firmly in mind:

1.  **Student Profile:** Class 6, Indian government schools, mostly economically weaker sections, *limited English*. Average pass rate ~29%.
2.  **Teacher/Expert Bias:** Overestimate performance due to forgetting limited English, "basic" not being basic, anxiety, and lack of specific practice.
3.  **Question:** "Choose the correct word. There are (some/any) apples in the basket."
4.  **Rubric:** Selects 'some'.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):**
My first thought might be, "This is a very basic English grammar rule for 'some' vs. 'any' in affirmative sentences. Most Class 6 students *should* know this." This is the expert bias at play.

**Challenging the Assumption:**

*   **Limited English:** A student who "barely reads English" might struggle even with the words "choose," "correct," "word," "apples," "basket." They might recognize "are" but not the subtle difference between "some" and "any." They might also associate "any" with questions or negatives, but *only if they were taught and practiced it sufficiently*. Given the average pass rate, a significant portion likely has not.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** For a struggling learner, the distinction between "some" and "any" isn't basic. It requires understanding sentence type (affirmative vs. negative/interrogative) and common usage. This is a grammatical concept that needs explicit teaching and regular practice.
*   **Absent for the Topic:** If a student was absent when "some/any" was taught, they would be completely lost. Given school attendance issues in some areas, this is a real possibility.
*   **No Practice:** While "some/any" is common, this *exact question type* (multiple choice with parentheses) might not be. They might be used to filling in blanks, or identifying errors.
*   **Exam Anxiety:** Even if they vaguely recall the rule, anxiety can cause them to freeze or second-guess themselves. They might pick 'any' randomly because it looks similar or they've heard it before.
*   **Focus on 'Apples in the basket':** Some might just focus on the core meaning and not the grammatical nuance.

**Revisiting the 29% average pass rate:** This means that for a typical Class 6 exam, only about 3 out of 10 students pass. A grammar question like this, while seemingly simple to a native speaker or well-taught student, is still a grammatical concept that requires specific learning and recall.

Given the constraints:
*   Limited English proficiency means some might not even fully grasp the sentence structure or the difference between the two options beyond rote memorization.
*   The negative bias on expert judgment suggests we should lean towards a lower estimate.
*   The 29% average pass rate for *all* subjects implies that only a minority are grasping fundamental concepts across the board.

For a specific grammar point like "some/any," which is relatively common but still requires a nuanced understanding for correct application, I would expect it to be accessible to slightly more than just the very top students, but still far from a majority. Perhaps those who grasp basic sentence construction and some common word usage.

Let's consider that the "some/any" distinction is fundamental enough that it *might* be covered more thoroughly than very obscure grammar points. However, its application in a simple affirmative sentence still requires a level of English comprehension that many students, as described, likely lack.

I'd expect a noticeable percentage to get this wrong due to the "any" trap (e.g., they might think "any" means "any number" of apples, not understanding its interrogative/negative usage).

Considering all factors, especially the "limited English" and the "average pass rate is about 29%", I need to be conservative. It's a simple sentence structure, but the 'some' vs 'any' is a specific rule.

If 29% is the pass rate, this question is likely *easier* than average, but not by a huge margin for this demographic. It's a binary choice, which might slightly increase random chance, but the incorrect option is a common distractor.

I'd estimate that about half of the students who pass the average exam, plus a small fraction of those who struggle, might get this.

Let's try to calibrate:
*   If 29% pass *overall*, then getting this specific grammar point right would likely fall within the ability of those passing students and maybe a few others.
*   It's not a complex problem, but it demands a specific grammatical rule recall
