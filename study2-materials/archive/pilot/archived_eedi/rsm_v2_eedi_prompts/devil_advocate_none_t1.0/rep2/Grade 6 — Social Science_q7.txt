Let's break this down based on the provided guidelines.

**Initial Instinct vs. Challenged Assumption:**

*   **Initial Instinct:** "Rajasthan, natural resources... most students would know water is a big one. Maybe minerals too like marble or copper. Explaining influence shouldn't be too hard." This would lead to a higher estimate.
*   **Challenged Assumption (applying the "forget" points):**
    *   **Limited English:** "Mention any two natural resources" might be okay, but "explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there" is a multi-step instruction with more complex vocabulary ("influences"). Many will struggle to form coherent sentences in English, even if they grasp the concept in their mother tongue.
    *   **"Basic" isn't basic:** While water is fundamental, articulating its *influence* beyond "it's for drinking" requires a level of conceptual understanding and expression that many struggling learners lack. "Natural resources" itself might be a concept not fully internalized by all.
    *   **Exam Anxiety:** The multi-part nature of the question (identify *two*, then *explain the influence of one*) can be overwhelming. Some might just list two resources and stop, missing the explanation.
    *   **Never practiced this exact question type:** Many government school exams are rote-learning focused. A question demanding both identification and *explanation of influence* might be new territory for many. They might be able to list resources but struggle with the "how it influences" part.
    *   **Absent for topic:** Natural resources of Rajasthan might be covered, but the *depth* of discussion on their influence could vary greatly.

**Specific Considerations for Class 6, Rajasthan, Government Schools, EWS, Limited English:**

*   **Resource Identification:** Water, sand, sunlight (for solar) are quite obvious. Marble, copper, gypsum are also well-known but might require more specific recall. Listing *any two* is the easier part.
*   **Explanation of Influence:** This is the critical barrier.
    *   For *water*: Beyond "drinking," can they articulate its scarcity leading to specific lifestyles (e.g., migration, reliance on wells, traditional water harvesting, impact on agriculture)?
    *   For *marble/minerals*: Can they explain it leads to mining jobs, local industries, or construction?
    *   For *sunlight*: Can they link it to solar power plants, but also the harsh climate?
    *   Even if they know the *concept* in Hindi, expressing it accurately and completely in English for a full mark is a significant challenge. Many will give one-word answers or very short, incomplete sentences.
    *   The rubric states "Mentions two correct natural resources... Max score: 1". This implies *both* parts are needed for the 1 mark, or that merely mentioning two resources is enough. Given "Max score: 1", it's likely they need *some* attempt at explanation, or at least the identification of two resources is enough for the single point. However, the phrasing "explain how one of them influences..." suggests the explanation is crucial. If merely listing two resources gets the point, the pass rate would be higher. But given the *average pass rate is 29%*, it implies a higher bar for "correct." Let's assume the explanation part is expected for a "correct" answer leading to the single mark.

**Revisiting the 29% Average Pass Rate:** This question is likely harder than the average question that contributes to a 29% pass rate, especially considering the explanation component.

**My Calibrated Estimate:**

Given the high bar set by the constraints (limited English, EWS, anxiety, never practiced, expert overestimation) and the multi-part nature requiring not just recall but *explanation* in English, I anticipate a significant drop-off for the explanation part.

*   Many might correctly identify two resources.
*   Fewer will provide a comprehensible explanation in English.
*   Even fewer will provide an explanation that fully addresses "influences the lives of the people."

If the question truly requires *both* parts to be correct for the 1 mark, then the percentage will be very low. If identifying two resources is sufficient for the point, it would be higher. Assuming "correctly" means meeting the spirit of the question, including the explanation:

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **15%**
