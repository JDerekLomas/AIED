Let's break down the question and the target audience.

**The Question:** "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

**Key Concepts Required:**
*   **Harappan Civilization:** Recognition of the term, knowing it's an ancient Indian civilization.
*   **Urban Planning:** Understanding what this phrase means (how cities were designed and built).
*   **Key Feature:** Identifying something important and distinct.
*   **Specific Features:** Recalling actual details like grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town.

**The Audience:**
*   **Class 8 students, Indian government schools.**
*   **Mostly economically weaker sections.**
*   **Limited English.** (This is HUGE)
*   **Average pass rate ~29%.** (This suggests a high baseline of struggle)
*   **Exam anxiety.**
*   **Potential for missed lessons.**
*   **Lack of practice with this *exact* question type.**

**Challenging Initial Instincts:**

My first instinct might be: "Harappan Civilization is in the Class 8 syllabus. Urban planning is a major topic. Most students should know *something*."

Now, let's apply the challenges:

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "Describe" - Can they articulate a coherent sentence in English?
    *   "Key feature" - Do they understand "key"?
    *   "Urban planning" - This is a relatively advanced phrase for someone with limited English. They might understand "city" but "urban planning" implies a more abstract concept of design. They might recall "drainage system" but struggle to link it to "urban planning."
    *   They might know facts *in their native language* but fail to translate them into a correct English sentence.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   While Harappan is in the syllabus, the depth of understanding and retention varies wildly.
    *   "Grid layout" or "drainage system" are concepts, but applying them precisely to "urban planning" and describing them concisely is harder than just recalling "Harappa had good drains."

3.  **Exam Anxiety:** Even if they know it, anxiety can cause them to blank, misinterpret, or rush their answer.

4.  **No Practice with *this exact question type*:** They might have filled in blanks, matched columns, or answered short questions like "What was a feature of Harappan cities?" But "Describe one key feature of X" requires a more structured, descriptive response. They might just list a word or two, which wouldn't fully satisfy "describe."

**Re-evaluation:**

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for *all subjects*, and the significant English language barrier, this question becomes quite difficult.

*   A student needs to recall specific historical facts.
*   They need to understand the relatively abstract concept of "urban planning."
*   They need to be able to articulate that concept in grammatically sound English.

Many might know "drains" or "bricks" but fail to connect it to "urban planning" or "describe" it properly. Some might know it but simply not be able to form a sentence in English.

If only 29% pass *everything*, then the proportion who can perform this specific, multi-faceted task (recall content, understand abstract term, articulate in English) will be lower than that average. It's not just a content recall question; it's a language and conceptual application question.

My initial instinct would be perhaps 35-40%, but applying the constraints, especially limited English and the "describe" component, brings it down significantly.

**Calibrated Estimate:** 18%
