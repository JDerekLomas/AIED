Let's break down the difficulty.

**Factors for lower performance:**

*   **English proficiency:** While "mountain ranges" might be somewhat recognizable, "major" and "located in India" require a certain level of comprehension. Students might know a mountain name but not associate it with "major" or specifically "India" in an English question.
*   **Vocabulary:** Even if they know the Hindi names for mountains, recalling the English equivalents can be a barrier.
*   **Geographical knowledge:** Class 6 students might have been introduced to these concepts, but retention varies wildly. Many students will struggle to recall *any* specific geographical feature, let alone two major ones.
*   **Focus on memorization vs. application:** Indian education often emphasizes rote learning. If they haven't specifically memorized a list of "two major mountain ranges in India" for an exam, they might struggle to recall it on the spot.
*   **Lack of exposure to question type:** "Name any two" might be straightforward for a fluent student, but for struggling learners, it can be confusing if they haven't practiced similar open-ended recall questions.
*   **Anxiety:** "Blank responses" are a real issue for students who are not confident in their English or their knowledge.
*   **Absenteeism/Uneven teaching:** Many students will have missed relevant lessons or received inadequate instruction on this topic.
*   **Rubric:** The rubric requires *one* correct mountain range for 0.5 points. This helps, as they don't need two.

**Factors for higher performance (but still likely limited):**

*   **Himalayas:** This is by far the most famous mountain range in India and often taught very early. Most students, even if weak, might recall "Himalayas."
*   **Aravalli/Vindhya/Satpura:** These are also quite well-known regionally, especially in central/western India.
*   **Visual learning:** If they've seen maps extensively, they might have a visual recall.

**Challenging the first instinct:**

My first instinct might be "Himalayas is so obvious, almost everyone will get that." However, the prompt specifically warns against this. "Could a student who barely reads English?" For such a student, even "Himalayas" might not be spelled correctly or recognized as the correct answer in an English question. "Could a student who was absent for this topic?" Absolutely not. Many students will have a very fragmented understanding of geography.

Considering the average pass rate is 29% for *all* questions, and this is a specific recall question in English, it's not a "gimme." Even recalling one specific name in English is a challenge.

Let's imagine the distribution:
*   **Strong students (say, top 10%):** Will easily get Himalayas and likely another one.
*   **Mid-tier students (next 20%):** Many will recall Himalayas. Some might get Aravalli or another, but it's not guaranteed.
*   **Lower-tier students (remaining 70%):** Most will struggle significantly. Some might vaguely remember "Himalayas" but not be confident enough to write it down, or spell it correctly. Many will draw a blank.

Given the rubric only needs *one* correct range for 0.5 points, that slightly increases the proportion. However, the hurdle of identifying *any* major mountain range *in English* by a Class 6 student from economically weaker sections with limited English and high anxiety is significant.

I'd expect a noticeable drop-off after "Himalayas." Many students won't even think of Aravalli or Vindhya in an English context.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

I think the proportion of students who can successfully name *at least one* mountain range correctly (e.g., Himalayas) will be higher than for a more complex question, but still significantly less than "most."

If 29% is the average pass rate, this question might be slightly easier than average due to the prominence of the Himalayas, but not by a huge margin for the *entire* population. A significant chunk will still get zero.

I'm going to estimate that around half of the students will be able to recall "Himalayas" and write it down legibly enough. Very few beyond that will recall a second or even a first less obvious one.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **35%**
