Let's break down the question and the context for Class 8 students in Indian government schools.

**Question:** "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"

**Rubric:** "For explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)."

**Student Profile:**
*   **Economically weaker sections:** Often means limited access to supplementary resources, private tuition, or a supportive home learning environment.
*   **Limited English:** This is a *huge* factor. "Contribute to the expansion," "political dominance," "puppet nawab" are not simple terms. Even "establishment" can be tricky.
*   **Average pass rate ~29%:** This is a critical baseline. It indicates that a large majority of students are struggling generally.
*   **Exam anxiety:** A known factor for lower performance.
*   **Lack of practice with exact question type:** Many government school exams might be more rote memory-based (e.g., "When was the Battle of Plassey?" or "Who fought in the Battle of Plassey?"). A question asking about *contribution* and *expansion* requires a higher level of analytical understanding and articulation.
*   **Absent for topic:** Given attendance issues and teacher shortages, many students might have missed this lesson entirely, or it was taught poorly.
*   **"Basic" concepts are not basic:** Even if they remember Plassey was a British victory, linking it to "political dominance" and "expansion of power" requires understanding cause-and-effect in history, which is an abstract concept.

**Challenging First Instincts:**

My first instinct might be: "Plassey is a fundamental event in Indian history. They must have studied it. They know Mir Jafar was put in place."

Now, let's challenge that:
1.  **English:** Can they *understand* "contribute to the expansion of British power"? They might know "Plassey" and "British won," but can they articulate the *impact* in English, especially using terms like "political dominance" or "puppet nawab"?
2.  **Rote vs. Understanding:** They might have memorized "Battle of Plassey, 1757, Clive defeated Siraj-ud-Daulah, Mir Jafar became Nawab." But can they *explain* how that *contributed to power expansion*? Many might just write down the basic facts they memorized, not the specific *contribution*.
3.  **Specific Rubric:** The rubric requires "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal." Can they connect Mir Jafar's puppet status directly to *British political dominance*? They might just state "Mir Jafar became Nawab" without explaining the implication.
4.  **Overall Difficulty:** Given an average pass rate of 29% for *all* questions, this question is arguably harder than a simple recall question. It requires comprehension and synthesis.

Considering all these factors, particularly the limited English, the need for analytical understanding beyond rote facts, and the overall low performance base, I expect a significant drop from what a well-prepared student might achieve. Many will struggle to form a coherent sentence in English that directly addresses the "how it contributed" aspect, even if they know some facts about Plassey. They might give partial answers like "British won" or "Mir Jafar became Nawab," but fail to link it to the *expansion of British power* or *political dominance*.

My calibrated estimate takes into account that maybe a small percentage of students will have a good grasp and articulation, some will have partial understanding but poor English, and many will simply not know or give irrelevant answers.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **12%**
