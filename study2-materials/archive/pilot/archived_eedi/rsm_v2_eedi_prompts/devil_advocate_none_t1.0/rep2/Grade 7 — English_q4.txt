Let's break down the question and the context.

**The Question:** "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."

**The Rubric:** "The king wanted to answer (based on the reading passage) the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with. Any valid reason."

**Key Factors for Class 7 Indian Government School Students (EWS, Limited English, Low Pass Rates):**

1.  **English Comprehension:**
    *   "Important in real life?" - This phrase requires understanding "important," "real life," and the ability to connect it to a personal perspective. "Real life" might be understood literally or abstractly.
    *   "Give one reason." - This requires formulating a coherent, simple sentence in English.

2.  **Passage Recall/Understanding (Implicit):** The question assumes students have read a passage about a king asking these specific questions.
    *   Even if they recall the questions, do they understand the *implication* of those questions in the context of the story?
    *   Do they understand *why* the king asked them? (The rubric provides this context, but students won't have it explicitly.)

3.  **Abstract Thinking/Personal Opinion:**
    *   This isn't a direct recall question. It asks for an opinion ("Do you think...") and a justification.
    *   Connecting the king's abstract quest for "right time, right thing, right people" to their own "real life" is a significant cognitive leap for students who might struggle with basic concepts.
    *   They might not see the direct relevance of a king's philosophical queries to their own daily struggles.

4.  **Formulating a "Valid Reason" in English:**
    *   Even if a student understands the question and has an opinion, can they articulate a "valid reason" in simple, grammatically acceptable English?
    *   "Because it helps us make good decisions." (Simple but requires linking the king's questions to decision-making.)
    *   "Yes, we need to know what to do." (More basic, but still requires a connection.)
    *   Many might just say "Yes" without a reason, or a reason that is too vague or grammatically incorrect to be scored.

5.  **Exam Anxiety/Novelty:**
    *   Open-ended opinion questions with justification might be less common than direct recall. This format itself can be intimidating.
    *   If they haven't practiced this exact type, they might freeze.

**Challenging Initial Instincts:**

My first instinct might be: "Of course, these questions *are* important, and students should be able to see that."

*   **Counter-argument (English):** A student barely reading English might understand "king," "questions," but "important in real life" and "give one reason" could be a stumbling block. They might not grasp the nuance.
*   **Counter-argument (Basic Concepts):** "Right time, right thing, right people" seems basic to *us*, but for a struggling learner, connecting those abstract ideas to their own "real life" and then articulating a reason is far from basic.
*   **Counter-argument (Absenteeism):** If they were absent for the passage, the question is effectively meaningless. Even if present, did they *understand* the passage, or just read it?

**Re-evaluating based on low pass rates (29% average), EWS background, and limited English:**

*   Many will likely fail to grasp "important in real life" or "give one reason" adequately.
*   Even if they understand, formulating a *scoreable* reason in English will be a significant barrier. A simple "Yes" or a very poorly worded reason won't score.
*   The connection between a king's philosophical quest and their own mundane "real life" is abstract and might not resonate.

Considering the 29% average pass rate for *all* questions, and this being a question requiring interpretation, opinion, and articulation, it's likely harder than a simple recall.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Given the hurdles, I expect a significant drop from the "most students" feeling. Many will not provide a *valid reason* in English, or will not understand the question fully.

If 29% is the *average*, this specific question, requiring both comprehension and written articulation of an opinion, feels like it would be below average. Perhaps only the stronger students in the 29% group would get this, plus a few others who manage a simple, scoreable response by luck.

I'd lean towards the lower end of the average, perhaps slightly below, because of the
