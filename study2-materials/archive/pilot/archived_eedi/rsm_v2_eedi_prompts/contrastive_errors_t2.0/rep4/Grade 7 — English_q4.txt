Let's break down the question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason." using the provided context and common error examples.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Passage Comprehension:** The most significant prior knowledge is comprehension of the *The Three Questions* story by Leo Tolstoy, which the "king's questions" refer to. This passage would have been a recent reading assignment. Students need to understand what the king's questions *were* (what is the right time to begin everything, who are the most important people, what is the most important thing to do).
    *   **Basic Understanding of "Importance" and "Real Life":** Students need to grasp these common English phrases. This is generally within the Class 7 vocabulary, but conceptual understanding can vary.
    *   **Formulating an Opinion:** The question asks for "Do you think...", requiring the student to form and articulate an opinion.

*   **Language Demands for Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Direct Question Format:** "Do you think...?" is a relatively straightforward question format.
    *   **Abstract Nouns:** "Importance" is an abstract noun, which can be harder to grasp than concrete nouns. "Real life" is also a conceptual phrase.
    *   **Giving a Reason ("Give one reason"):** This is a key language demand. Students need to use causal conjunctions (because, for, since) or implied causation to link their opinion to a reason. This can be challenging for limited English speakers.
    *   **Simple Sentence Structure Expected:** A simple affirmative ("Yes, they are.") followed by a simple reason ("because...") is likely sufficient for the rubric.
    *   **Compared to "Describes the poet’s writing style":** This question is *significantly* easier in terms of abstract conceptual understanding and vocabulary. "Writing style" is highly abstract and nuanced for Class 7. "Important" and "real life" are more directly relatable.
    *   **Compared to "Write a theme or central idea...":** This question is arguably slightly easier. "Theme" and "central idea" also require abstract thought and synthesizing information. "Importance" is a more direct, yes/no opinion, even if the reason requires some justification.
    *   **Compared to "Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'":** This question is different. While 'My Favourite Hobby' asks for personal experience, it demands sustained writing (4-5 sentences) and coherent paragraph structure, which are common weaknesses (as shown by "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy"). The current question only asks for *one reason*, reducing the writing load substantially.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily a **Reasoning/Application** question. It requires:
        1.  **Recall/Comprehension:** Understanding what the "king's questions" were.
        2.  **Application:** Applying the abstract concepts from the story to their own understanding of "real life."
        3.  **Reasoning:** Formulating a logical justification for *why* these questions are important.

*   **How it Compares to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Many Class 7 textbook exercises involve "Think and discuss" or "Do you agree/disagree?" type questions following a story. So, the *format* is somewhat familiar.
    *   However, the *depth* of reasoning for the "one reason" can vary. Simple reasons like "it helps you live better" or "everyone wants to know these things" would likely suffice. This is not asking for deep philosophical analysis.

**Analysis of Difficulty based on Common Errors:**

*   **"Describes the poet’s writing style" (4% pass rate):** This question is orders of magnitude harder due to its highly abstract nature and specific literary vocabulary. "I am reading" indicates a complete misunderstanding of the question.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate):** Still very difficult, requiring synthesis and abstract thought. "The last bargin they about a child and labour..." shows partial understanding of content but poor formulation of a "theme."
*   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'" (10% pass rate):** The low pass rate here despite being a personal topic indicates struggles with sustained writing, sentence formation, and staying on topic. The current question only requires *one* sentence for the reason.

**Specific Advantages of the Current Question:**

1.  **Familiar Context:** The king's questions are direct plot points from a story they recently read, making recall easier.
2.  **Opinion-Based:**
