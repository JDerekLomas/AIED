Let's break down the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering the context of their English proficiency and common errors.

**Analysis of the Question:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **The Poem:** Students must have read and understood the *poem* to select a line and explain why. This is the biggest dependency. If they haven't understood the poem at all, the rest is moot.
    *   **Basic Opinion Expression:** The ability to form a preference ("I like this line") and articulate a simple reason for it.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "line," "poem," "like," "most," "why." These are generally high-frequency words, but "line" referring to a sentence in a poem might need clarification for some if their exposure is limited.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   **Identifying and Citing:** Students need to accurately identify and write down a "line from the poem." This requires attention to detail and transcription skills, not necessarily composition.
    *   **Expressing Preference:** "I like..." or "My favourite line is..."
    *   **Providing a Reason (Simple Causality):** "because..." This is the core challenge.
        *   **Lexical Demands:** Students need some vocabulary to describe *why* they like a line (e.g., "it is beautiful," "it is sad," "it makes me happy," "it reminds me of X," "it teaches me Y"). The simplicity of the explanation is key here. They don't need complex literary analysis.
        *   **Grammatical Demands:** Simple sentence structures (subject-verb-object) for both the preference and the reason. Coordinating conjunction "because."
    *   **Concision:** The question doesn't ask for a long explanation, implying a simple, direct answer is sufficient.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall (Partial):** Recalling a specific line from the poem.
    *   **Application (Limited):** Applying their understanding of the poem to form a personal connection.
    *   **Reasoning (Simple):** Justifying a personal choice. This is *not* deep analytical reasoning, but rather simple cause-and-effect reasoning for their preference.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Harder than Recall (e.g., "Who is the main character?"):** Requires more than just finding a fact.
    *   **Easier than Composition (e.g., "Write a paragraph about 'My Favourite Hobby'"):**
        *   The content of the answer (the line itself) is *provided* in the text, reducing the burden of original sentence construction for the first part.
        *   The "why" is personal and allows for simple expression, unlike thematic analysis or creative writing from scratch.
        *   The "paragraph" question required 4-5 *original sentences* on a broad topic, whereas this needs a sentence for the line and one or two for the reason.
    *   **Similar to "Describe the poet's writing style?" in structure but crucially different in content:** "Writing style" is an abstract concept requiring higher-order thinking and specialized vocabulary. "Which line do *you* like?" taps into personal opinion and simple descriptive language, making it far more accessible. The previous example's low pass rate (4%) highlights the difficulty of abstract literary concepts.
    *   **More forgiving than "Write a theme or central idea...":** Identifying a theme requires synthesizing information and expressing an abstract idea concisely, which is a major hurdle. Liking a line and saying *why* can be much more concrete (e.g., "I like it because it talks about trees," or "I like it because it is beautiful to read"). The 'Last Bargain' question pass rate of 5% reflects this difficulty.

**Contrastive Analysis Summary:**

*   **What makes it harder than average (29% baseline)?**
    *   Crucial dependency on *comprehension of the specific poem*. If the poem itself was hard or poorly understood, this question immediately becomes impossible for a 'correct' answer.
    *   Requires *original thought* and simple expression, even if personal. "Empty Response" is a common outcome when students don't know what to write or are overwhelmed.
    *   Bridging the gap between a line and *why* it's liked requires some vocabulary and grammatical fluency (using "because," simple adjectives/verbs).

*   **What makes it easier than the low-pass examples (4-10%)?**
    *   **Concrete over Abstract:** It asks about a concrete
