Let's break down the question "Describes the poet's writing style" for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their profile and common error patterns.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** The core words are "describes," "poet's," and "writing style." "Poet" might be understood. "Writing style" is an abstract concept. Students need to know what "style" refers to in this context (how something is written, not *what* is written). "Describes" implies providing a characteristic or feature.
    *   **Conceptual Understanding of Style:** This is the biggest hurdle. Do Class 7 students, especially those learning English as a foreign/second language, have a framework for analyzing literary style? Even in their native language, "writing style" is a more advanced concept than merely understanding the plot or characters. They might confuse it with the *content* of the poem or their *feelings* about it.
    *   **Exposure to Different Styles:** To identify a style, they would ideally have encountered and perhaps been explicitly taught about different styles (simple, narrative, complex, figurative, etc.). It's unlikely they've had extensive exposure to this in an explicit analytical way in Class 7 English, especially in an ESL context.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Abstract Nouns/Concepts:** "Writing style" is highly abstract. Concrete nouns are easier. Verbs describing actions are easier. This abstract concept is hard to grasp.
    *   **Lack of Familiar Sentence Structure:** While "Describes the poet's writing style" is grammatically simple, it's not a common instruction format for these students. They are more likely to encounter "Write about..." or "What is..."
    *   **Producing an Analytical Word:** The rubric asks for a "suitable and relevant word." This requires:
        *   Understanding the question.
        *   Analyzing a poem (which is not provided in the question itself, implying it's a follow-up or a standalone skill assessment).
        *   Having an English vocabulary of *analytical adjectives* that describe literary qualities (e.g., "simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct"). This kind of vocabulary is sophisticated. Their vocabulary might be limited to common adjectives for people, objects, or basic emotions.
    *   **"Describes" vs. "Write":** Students are more familiar with instructions like "Write about..." If they interpret "describes" as "write *what* it describes," they might describe the poem's *content* rather than its *style*.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application** and **Reasoning**. It's not recall, as they aren't memorizing a style. It's not pure application if they haven't been taught specific stylistic categories.
    *   It requires:
        1.  Understanding the concept of "writing style."
        2.  Reading a poem (implied).
        3.  Analyzing the poem for *how* it's written.
        4.  Selecting an appropriate analytical adjective in English.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 7 English textbook exercises for these students focus on:
        *   Comprehension of basic stories/poems (who, what, when, where).
        *   Vocabulary building (matching words, synonyms, antonyms, filling blanks).
        *   Simple grammar (tenses, prepositions, articles).
        *   Basic paragraph writing on familiar topics ("My Pet," "My School").
    *   Asking to "describe writing style" is a higher-order thinking skill and an advanced literary analysis concept that is usually introduced much later, or with significant scaffolding, in an ESL curriculum.
    *   The examples of "COMMON ERRORS" (Q: "Describes the poet's writing style." (pass rate: 4%) Wrong answer: "I am reading." / Empty Response) clearly show students are not even understanding the question, let alone providing an analytical answer. "I am reading" suggests they might interpret "describes" as "what am I doing?" or the entire phrase as an action.

**Conclusion based on Analysis:**

This question is extremely difficult for the target student population.

*   The concept of "writing style" is abstract and likely not explicitly taught or well-understood.
*   The required vocabulary for describing style is advanced.
*   Students frequently misunderstand the question itself, as evidenced by "I am reading."
*   It's a high-level analytical task, far beyond typical Class 7 English proficiency in these schools.
*   The actual pass
