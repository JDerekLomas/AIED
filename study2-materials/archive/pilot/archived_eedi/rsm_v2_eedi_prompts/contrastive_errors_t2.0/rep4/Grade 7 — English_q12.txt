Let's break down the question "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away." to estimate the proportion of Class 7 students in Indian government schools who would answer it correctly.

### Contrastive Analysis of Difficulty:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Concept of Voice (Active/Passive):** This is the core grammatical concept being tested. Students need to have been *taught* active and passive voice. If it hasn't been explicitly covered, or covered only superficially, they will struggle immensely. Given the context of government schools and general curriculum, it's *plausible* it's introduced, but mastery is another question.
    *   **Subject/Verb/Object Identification:** Essential for rearranging the sentence. "The wind" (subject), "blew" (verb), "the leaves" (object), "away" (adverbial phrase).
    *   **Tenses (Past Simple):** The original sentence is in past simple ("blew"). Students need to know how to form the passive voice for past simple (auxiliary verb "to be" in past tense + past participle).
    *   **Irregular Verbs (Blow - Blew - Blown):** "Blow" is an irregular verb. Students need to know its past participle form ("blown"). This is a significant hurdle.
    *   **Preposition "by":** Understanding that the agent (the wind) is introduced by "by" in passive voice.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** The vocabulary is quite simple ("wind," "blew," "leaves," "away"). No obscure words. This is a positive point.
    *   **Grammatical Terminology:** The instruction itself, "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice," requires understanding these specific grammatical terms in English. If they primarily learn grammar in Hindi, mapping these concepts to English terminology can be challenging. Many might just understand "change the sentence" rather than the *how* and *why* of the voice change.
    *   **Syntactic Transformation:** This requires understanding the rules of English syntax for voice change. It's not just swapping words; it involves changing verb forms, adding auxiliaries, and repositioning elements. This is a higher-order language skill.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application** of learned grammatical rules. Students need to *recall* the rules of active/passive transformation for the past simple tense, including irregular verb forms, and then *apply* them to a new sentence. It involves minimal reasoning beyond rule application.

4.  **How Does it Compare in Difficulty to Typical Textbook Exercises?**
    *   **Similar to standard textbook exercises:** Active/passive voice transformation is a common grammar exercise in English language textbooks at this level.
    *   **Difficulty level within topic:** This particular sentence is a straightforward example (Subject-Verb-Object). It's not overly complex (e.g., with multiple clauses, phrasal verbs that change meaning in passive, or imperatives).
    *   **Irregular verb "blow":** This adds a layer of difficulty. Many textbook exercises might start with regular verbs to ease students in. Mastery of common irregular verb participles is expected at Class 7, but consistent recall can be an issue.

### Comparison with Provided Common Errors:

*   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%)** This is a much higher-order thinking question, requiring analytical skills, vocabulary related to literary criticism, and abstract understanding. The English required to *describe* (not just identify) style is very demanding. Our current question is purely grammatical application.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."" (pass rate: 5%)** Similar to the above, this is about literary analysis, inference, and articulation of abstract ideas. Again, much harder due to content and expressive demands.
*   **"Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what" (pass rate: 10%)** This is a basic paragraph writing task. The low pass rate here points to significant challenges with sentence construction, coherence, vocabulary, spelling, and meeting the length requirement even for a personal topic. Students often provide fragmented thoughts or very short, simple sentences, indicating a foundational weakness in expressing themselves in written English.

**Implications for our question:**

The very low pass rates on writing tasks like "My Favourite Hobby" are concerning. If students struggle to write 4-5 sentences about a personal topic, their command over complex grammatical transformations will be severely tested.

The active/passive voice requires:
1.  Understanding the grammatical terms (active/passive voice).
