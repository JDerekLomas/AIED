Let's break down this question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school.

**Contrastive Analysis**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Time:** Students need to understand am/pm and be able to calculate time differences spanning noon (10 am to 4 pm). This is typically covered by Class 4 or 5.
    *   **Numbers:** Basic addition and multiplication.
    *   **Temperature:** Understanding degrees Celsius and that temperature can increase. They don't need to know *what* 30 degrees Celsius feels like, just how to manipulate the number.
    *   **Word Problems:** The ability to extract numerical information and operations from a written scenario.

*   **Language Demands:** This is the biggest hurdle for Hindi-medium students with limited English proficiency.
    *   "At 10 am in the morning": Fairly straightforward.
    *   "temperature": Could be a barrier. They might know "tapa-maan" in Hindi.
    *   "Jodhpur": A place name, not an issue.
    *   "30^0 C": Numerical value.
    *   "If the temperature increases by": "increases by" is a crucial phrase. If they miss this, they might not know to add. "Per hour" is also important.
    *   "then what will be the temperature": Standard question phrasing.
    *   "at 4:00 in the evening": Understanding "evening" (sham) and its relation to pm.

    **Specific Difficult English Words/Phrases:**
    *   "temperature"
    *   "increases by"
    *   "per hour"
    *   "evening" (in contrast to morning)

    If the student relies heavily on pattern recognition or key numerical information, they might just pick out 10, 30, 2, and 4. The *relationship* between these numbers conveyed by the English is critical.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily an **application** question. It's not rote recall of a fact. It requires applying learned operations (time calculation, addition/multiplication) to a given scenario.
    *   It also involves a mild degree of **reasoning** to link the rate of increase to the duration.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Mathematical Concept:** The math itself (addition, simple multiplication, calculating time difference) is *very* typical for Class 6 and often introduced earlier. Many textbook problems would involve similar concepts but often with less linguistic complexity.
    *   **Linguistic Complexity:** This question, being entirely in English, would be significantly *harder* than a problem presented in their mother tongue (Hindi) or even a bilingual version in a typical textbook. Textbooks might break down word problems more, use simpler sentence structures, or use more common, visual examples.
    *   **Combined Difficulty:** The mathematical logic is not hard. The "problem solving" aspect comes mostly from parsing the language, which then leads to applying the math. The *rubric* highlights the crucial first step (calculating time elapsed), which itself is a multi-step operation (10 am to 12 pm is 2 hours, 12 pm to 4 pm is 4 hours, total 6 hours).

**Factors influencing performance:**

*   **Understanding "time elapsed":** A student who struggles to calculate 10 am to 4 pm will fail immediately. This isn't just basic subtraction but understanding how to count hours across noon.
*   **Understanding "per hour":** Do they grasp the concept of rate and multiply the rate by the hours? Or do they simply add 2 to 30?
*   **English proficiency:** As discussed, this is paramount. Many Class 6 students in government schools may have rudimentary English, making a full understanding of the prompt very challenging. They might recognize numbers and a few keywords and guess.

**Breakdown of steps and potential error points:**

1.  **Understand 10 am and 4 pm:** Error if they misinterpret am/pm or cannot calculate across noon. (e.g., just do 4-10, get -6 or fail to understand time past 12).
2.  **Calculate time elapsed (10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours):** This is the core time calculation step. If they get this wrong, the rest is wrong.
3.  **Understand "increases by 2^0 C per hour":**
    *   If they understand "increases by" -> addition.
    *   If they understand "per hour" and know the number of hours ->
