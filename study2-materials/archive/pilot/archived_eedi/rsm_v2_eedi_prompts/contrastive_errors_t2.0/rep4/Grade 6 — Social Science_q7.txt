Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis:

**What makes this SPECIFIC question easy or hard compared to similar Social Science content at the Class 6 level?**

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Difficulty Level: Medium-Low.**
    *   **Ease:** Basic geographical knowledge of India (identifying Rajasthan) and understanding of "natural resources" are fundamental concepts. Class 6 curriculum usually introduces states and their general features, including prominent resources. Many of these resources (water, sand, sunlight) are very common and observable.
    *   **Hardship:** Identifying *specific* resources unique or significant to Rajasthan beyond the most common ones might be challenging for some, though common examples like "marble" or "copper" are often mentioned in regional contexts. Connecting a resource to its influence on people's lives requires a step beyond simple recall, touching on basic cause-and-effect in human geography.

**Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
*   **Difficulty Level: Medium-High.**
    *   **Key Terms:** "Mention," "natural resources," "influences," "lives of the people." While "natural resources" is a core social science term often introduced early, students with limited English might struggle with the nuances of "influences" and articulating that impact.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The question uses two clauses ("Mention any two..." and "explain how one of them influences..."). This can be harder to deconstruct than single, direct questions.
    *   **Open-ended explanation:** "Explain how..." requires constructing a descriptive sentence or two, which is significantly more demanding than just listing. Students might know the facts in Hindi but struggle to translate and articulate them effectively in English.
    *   **Comparison to common errors:** The "Empty Response" common for other questions indicates significant English comprehension and production issues. While this question isn't abstract like "colonial rule" or historically distant like "Ashoka," the explanatory part will still pose a significant hurdle.

**Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
*   **Recall:** Listing two natural resources (low-to-medium difficulty).
*   **Application/Reasoning:** Explaining the influence of one resource (medium-to-high difficulty). This moves beyond simple memorization to a basic understanding of geographical impact. For example, water influencing farming, or marble influencing construction/livelihoods of miners/craftsmen.

**How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
*   **Easier aspects:** "List two natural resources of Rajasthan" is a very common type of recall question found in textbooks.
*   **Harder aspects:** "Explain how one of them influences the lives of the people" elevates it beyond a basic recall question. Textbook questions sometimes ask for this, but often with more scaffolding or examples provided. For a Class 6 student with limited English, articulating this explanation would likely be harder than many simple textbook exercises that are primarily recall-based.
*   **Typical Textbook Passages:** Many Class 6 textbooks for EWS students might use simpler language or offer prompts in a question that guide the student to specific effects. This question requires more independent thought and articulation.

**Overall Contrastive Analysis Summary:**

*   **Content knowledge:** Generally accessible for Class 6, focusing on basic geography and resources. Common examples are easy to recall.
*   **Language and articulation:** This is the primary hurdle. The need to *explain* and use terms like "influences" in English will be a significant barrier, especially given the observed "Empty Response" rate on other social science questions. Even if they know the facts, expressing them will be hard.
*   **Cognitive demand:** Simple recall is easy, but the explanatory part moves into basic application/reasoning, which, combined with language difficulties, makes it quite challenging.
*   **Rubric:** The rubric is very generous – any two correct resources and a simple explanation of one influence grant full marks. This flexibility might boost the score for those who can manage basic articulation.

**Common Error Relevance:**

The common errors ("Empty Response," broken English, incorrect facts for historical figures) are very relevant.
*   **Empty Response:** Suggests a large proportion either don't understand the question, don't know the answer, or can't formulate one in English. This question has clearer and more immediate connection to daily life (resources), potentially reducing "empty response" for simple recall of resources, but it will still be a factor for the explanation part.
*   **Broken English/Misspellings:** Even if they know "marble" and "water," expressing "marble used in buildings, water helps farming" will likely come out with errors. The rubric doesn't penalize language errors as long as the core idea is conveyed.
