## Contrastive Analysis of "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

Let's break down this question's difficulty for a Class 8 student in an Indian government school, considering the common errors and general context.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Harappan Civilization:** Students are expected to have been introduced to the Harappan Civilization as a significant ancient Indian civilization. This is standard Class 8 Social Science (History) curriculum in India, often covered under "Early States and Empires" or similar units.
*   **Key Features:** They should recall specific details about the civilization, particularly its unique urban characteristics.
*   **Vocabulary:** Words like "urban planning," "civilization," "grid layout," "drainage system," "baked bricks," "citadel," and "lower town" are crucial.

**Language Demands (English):**

*   **"Describe one key feature":** This is a direct command that requires factual recall and synthesis into a coherent English sentence. While not overly complex, it demands understanding the individual words and how they combine to form the instruction.
*   **Rubric vocabulary:** The suggested correct answers ("well-planned grid layout of streets," "advanced drainage system," "use of baked bricks," "division of the city into a citadel and a lower town") all involve specific, academic English terms. Students need to not only *know* the concept but also be able to express it using appropriate terminology.
*   **Comparatively Easier than Previous Examples:** The phrasing here is much more direct and less abstract than "Explain how colonial rule under the British affected..." or "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign...". There's no need for causal reasoning or multiple explanations; just one descriptive point.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   **Primarily Recall:** This question is almost entirely about factual recall. Students are expected to remember specific attributes of Harappan urban planning as taught in their textbooks.
*   **Limited Description:** It asks to *describe* a feature, not to *analyze* or *evaluate* it. This means they don't need to explain *why* it was significant, just *what* it was.

**Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Standard Textbook Question:** This is a very common type of question found in Class 8 history textbooks after covering the Harappan Civilization. "List features of Harappan cities," "What was unique about Harappan drainage systems?", or "Mention key aspects of Harappan town planning" are typical variations.
*   **Not a High-Order Thinking Question:** It doesn't require complex critical thinking, synthesis of multiple sources, or applying knowledge to a new scenario. It's a foundational understanding check.

**Factors making it easier than the provided common errors:**

*   **Specificity:** Unlike "colonial rule" (broad, complex) or "Ashoka's reign" (requiring broader historical understanding), "Harappan Civilization's urban planning" is a quite specific, self-contained topic.
*   **Concrete Examples:** The features (grid, drainage, bricks, citadel) are concrete and visually easy to grasp (and are often depicted in textbooks). This contrasts with the abstract "significance" of a ruler's reign or the multifaceted "effects" of colonial rule.
*   **Single Point Required:** "One key feature" simplifies the task considerably compared to broader "explain how" or "explain the significance" questions that implicitly demand multiple points or deeper elaboration. This reduces the burden on both content recall and English expression.
*   **Less Scope for Misinterpretation:** The prompt is quite clear about what it's asking for, reducing the chances of irrelevant answers like the "Asher' stand" for the lions question.

**Factors still posing a challenge:**

*   **Limited English Proficiency:** Even though the prompt is direct, constructing a correct sentence in English ("The Harappan cities had a well-planned grid layout of streets" or "They had an advanced drainage system") can still be a hurdle for students struggling with basic sentence structure and vocabulary. They might *know* the answer in Hindi but struggle to articulate it in English.
*   **Precise Terminology:** While simpler than the "significance" of Ashoka, terms like "grid layout," "advanced drainage system," "citadel," "lower town" still require specific English recall. A student might write "good road system" instead of "grid layout of streets," which might be marked as partially correct or incorrect depending on strictness.
*   **Recall of specific details:** While it's a key topic, students' memory of specific features might vary. Some might remember "well-planned" but struggle to give a specific example.
