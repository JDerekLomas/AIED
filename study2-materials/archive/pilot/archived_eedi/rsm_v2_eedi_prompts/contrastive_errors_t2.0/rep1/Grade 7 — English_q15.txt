Let's break down the question "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it." for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering the provided context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Concept of "Hobby":** This is a fairly common and relatable concept, likely introduced in earlier English classes or general knowledge. It's a concrete idea.
    *   **Basic Sentence Structure (SVO):** Assumed ability to form simple sentences.
    *   **Vocabulary:** Words like "favourite," "when," "why," "enjoy" are basic, high-frequency English words typically encountered by Class 7. "Paragraph" might be a new term for some, but the sentence count provides clarity.
    *   **Personal Expression:** Assumed comfort in talking about personal experiences, which is often a feature of early language learning (e.g., "My family," "My school").

2.  **Language Demands for Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Concrete Topic:** "My Favourite Hobby" is a concrete, personal, and readily accessible topic. Students don't need to infer meaning from abstract concepts or complex narratives. They can draw directly from their own lives.
    *   **Simple Question Structure:** The question is broken down into clear, direct prompts ("what it is," "when you do it," "why you enjoy it"). This acts as scaffolding, guiding their response.
    *   **"Paragraph (4-5 sentences)":** This provides explicit structural guidance, reducing ambiguity compared to open-ended "describe" questions. It allows for shorter, simpler sentences rather than requiring complex conjunctions or subordinating clauses.
    *   **Relies on high-frequency vocabulary:** As noted, the key terms are basic.
    *   **Grammatical Complexity:** While requiring more than single words, it allows for relatively simple sentence structures. For example: "My favourite hobby is playing cricket. I play it after school. I enjoy it because it is fun and I like running." This avoids complex tenses, passive voice, or intricate relative clauses.
    *   **Minimal Abstract Reasoning:** The "why you enjoy it" part requires a basic explanation, but it can be simple (e.g., "it is fun," "I like it," "it keeps me active"). It doesn't require deep analytical thought.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Application:** Students are applying their existing vocabulary and grammatical knowledge to a new, personal context.
    *   **Reasoning:** Only basic reasoning for "why" they enjoy it.
    *   **Not pure recall:** They're not recalling facts from a text.
    *   This is a form of **productive writing** focused on personal experience, which often encourages engagement.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Similar to "Self-Introduction" or "Describe My Friend/Family" tasks:** These are very common in early English textbooks to build foundational writing skills and personal expression.
    *   **Simpler than text-based comprehension/analysis:** Unlike tasks requiring understanding nuances of poetry (like the "poet's writing style" or "theme of The Last Bargain"), this question doesn't depend on understanding complex literary devices or abstract interpretations.
    *   **Less ambiguous than open-ended descriptive prompts:** The bullet points clearly outline the required content, making it easier for students to know what to write about.
    *   **Lower linguistic burden than summarizing/paraphrasing:** Students are generating original content based on personal experience, not transforming existing complex text.
    *   **Slightly more demanding than single-sentence answers:** It requires linking a few ideas, but the sentence count provides clear boundaries.

**Comparing with common errors provided:**

*   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%)**: This is highly abstract, requires understanding of literary analysis, and specific English vocabulary related to style. "I am reading" shows complete misunderstanding. This hobby question is concrete and personal.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."" (pass rate: 5%)**: Also highly abstract, requires interpretation, and potentially cultural understanding of themes. "The last bargin they about a child and labour. many people tried to force the la" shows some topic recognition but very poor structure and grammar for conveying a "theme." The hobby question doesn't require such sophisticated comprehension or abstract thought.
*   **Previous errors on "My Favourite Hobby" examples (pass rates 10% - presumably overall task not individual responses):**
    *   "My fau
