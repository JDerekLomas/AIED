Let's break down the question "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away." for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their common errors and profile.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **What prior knowledge is assumed?**
    *   **Grammatical concepts:** Understanding of "active voice," "passive voice," "subject," "verb," "object."
    *   **Verb forms:** Knowledge of past tense ("blew") and past participle ("blown") forms.
    *   **Prepositions:** Understanding the function of "by."
    *   **Sentence structure:** Ability to identify the components of a simple sentence.

2.  **What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
    *   **Vocabulary:** The vocabulary in the original sentence ("wind," "blew," "leaves," "away") is relatively simple and common for this age group, likely encountered in earlier grades.
    *   **Grammatical terminology:** The instructions themselves ("Active Voice," "Passive Voice") are the main linguistic hurdle here. These are abstract grammatical concepts. While taught, the understanding and retention can be weak, especially if the instruction isn't thoroughly reinforced.
    *   **Syntactic transformation:** This requires re-ordering sentence elements and changing verb forms, which is a higher-level linguistic skill than simply understanding words.
    *   **Correct form recall:** Remembering that "was/were + past participle" is used for passive voice, and then correctly identifying "were" for "leaves."

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of a learned grammatical rule.
    *   It requires **recall** of the passive voice rule (be + past participle) and the past participle form of "blew."
    *   It requires **reasoning** to correctly identify the new subject, adjust the verb tense and form, and add "by the agent."

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Similar to textbook exercises:** Transforming sentences from active to passive voice is a very common grammatical exercise found in English textbooks from Class 6/7 onwards in India. It's a standard topic.
    *   **Simpler than some "common errors" examples:**
        *   "Describes the poet’s writing style": This requires a much higher level of comprehension, analytical ability, and creative writing to formulate an answer, which is evident from the extremely low pass rate.
        *   "Write a theme or central idea...": Similar to the above, requiring interpretive and summarization skills.
        *   "Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'": While seemingly simple, students struggle with constructing multiple coherent sentences and proper paragraph structure. The errors show basic word recall ("My fauourite game is Badminton") rather than paragraph development.
    *   **Relatively formulaic:** Unlike the comprehension or descriptive writing tasks, the active-to-passive transformation follows a relatively strict formula, which can be an advantage for students who have memorized it.
    *   **Key difficulty points:**
        *   Recognizing the instructions ("Active Voice to Passive Voice"). If they don't know what these terms mean, they're lost.
        *   Correctly identifying the subject and object in the original sentence.
        *   Forming the past participle "blown" (blew/blown can be tricky for some irregular verbs).
        *   Choosing "were" instead of "was" (plural subject).

**Why this question might fare slightly better than the 4-10% range for complex tasks, but not drastically better:**

The errors presented in the examples ("Empty Response," "I am reading," simple lists, short incorrect phrases) highlight a severe lack of fundamental English skills – comprehension of instructions, sentence construction, and often basic vocabulary and grammar.

While active-passive voice is taught, the conceptual understanding and ability to apply it consistently might be limited given the overall low pass rates and typical errors. Many students might struggle even to comprehend "Change the following sentence..." or recognize "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice." If they do recognize the task, they still need to accurately apply the rule.

However, "The wind blew the leaves away" is a relatively simple sentence structurally. The irregular verb "blow" is common, but "blown" as the past participle might be a stumble for some.

**Potential Obstacles for this Specific Question:**

*   **Understanding the terminology:** Many will simply not know what "Active Voice" or "Passive Voice" mean, even if they've been taught. They might guess or leave it blank.
*   **Irregular verb form:** "Blew" -> "blown" can be a specific error point.
*
