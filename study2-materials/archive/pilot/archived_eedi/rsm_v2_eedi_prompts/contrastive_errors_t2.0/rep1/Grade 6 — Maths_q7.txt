Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and an estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis:

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Reading Time (Analog and Digital):** Students need to understand how time progresses from AM to PM and accurately count hours across noon. This is a fundamental concept typically covered in earlier grades (Class 3-4).
*   **Addition and Multiplication:** Basic addition ($30 + 2 + 2...$ or $30 + (6 \times 2)$) is required. Multiplication (a simpler step) is typically introduced around Class 3-4 and should be familiar by Class 6.
*   **Concept of Temperature:** Understanding that temperature increases/decreases is expected, but the specific unit "$^0 C$" isn't critical for the calculation itself.
*   **Word Problems:** The ability to extract numerical information and the operational command (increase by) from a descriptive text is crucial.

**2. Language Demands (for students with limited English):**

This is where the question poses significant challenges:

*   **"At 10 am in the morning... temperature of Jodhpur was 30^0 C":** This phrasing is fairly direct, but "in the morning" reinforces "am," which might be redundant or confusing depending on previous instruction.
*   **"If the temperature increases by 2^0 C per hour":** "Increases by" is a common mathematical term for addition. "Per hour" indicates repeated addition or multiplication. These are standard English mathematical keywords, but for students with limited exposure, "increases" might be known, but "per hour" might be more difficult to correctly interpret as "for each hour."
*   **"then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?":** "Evening" clarifies "pm," but "what will be" clearly asks for a future state (calculation needed).
*   **Overall sentence structure:** The sentences are relatively straightforward subject-verb-object structures, but their length and the number of distinct pieces of information require careful parsing.

*Specific Vocabulary Challenges:*
    *   "increases by" - might be interpreted as just 'plus' or 'added', but 'per hour' is key for the repetition
    *   "per hour" - critical for understanding the operation
    *   "morning," "evening" - straightforward but contribute to the overall English text load.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

*   **Application:** This question is primarily an application of basic arithmetic (addition/multiplication) and time calculation to a real-world scenario.
*   **Implicit Reasoning:** There is an element of multi-step reasoning required:
    1.  Determine the time difference.
    2.  Calculate the total temperature increase based on the per-hour rate and time difference.
    3.  Add the total increase to the initial temperature.
    *It's not pure recall, as the specific numbers are not memorized facts. It's not advanced abstract reasoning, but practical problem-solving.*

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Moderate Difficulty:** It's more complex than a simple "30 + 12 = ?" or "How many hours from 10 am to 4 pm?". It combines these two distinct skills.
*   **Similar to Word Problems:** Indian textbooks at the Class 6 level would definitely have multi-step word problems involving time, rates, and addition/subtraction. However, the linguistic complexity (even in a simplified Hindi translation) would often be calibrated for the specific medium. The *English medium* version here introduces a higher hurdle due to vocabulary.
*   **Key Challenge for the Cohort:** The greatest difficulty lies in the *combination* of mathematical steps with the *English language demand*. A student might understand each mathematical component in isolation but struggle to parse the problem description in English to synthesize the steps correctly. Many Class 6 students might correctly identify the "30" and the "2" and even "increases," leading them to perhaps just add 30 + 2 = 32, failing to grasp the "per hour" and "time difference" components if the English is not clear.

## Estimated Proportion Correct:

Considering all factors:

*   Average pass rate for *all items* is 29%. This specific item requires multiple steps and careful interpretation.
*   Basic arithmetic is assumed, but multi-step application within a word problem context is harder.
*   The primary hurdle is the *English language demand* coupled with extracting multiple pieces of information and sequencing the operations. Students might correctly find the time difference (6 hours) but struggle with the "per hour" rate, or vice versa, or fail to combine
