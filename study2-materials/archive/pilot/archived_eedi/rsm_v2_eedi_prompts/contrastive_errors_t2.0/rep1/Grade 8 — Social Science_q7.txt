Let's break down the question "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?" based on the given context of Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Core Event:** Students are expected to know *about* the Battle of Plassey (1757) itself, its date, and its general significance in the context of British expansion. This is a standard topic in Class 8 Social Science/History textbooks in India.
    *   **Key Players:** Knowledge of the British East India Company, Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah, and Mir Jafar would be helpful but might not be strictly necessary to answer *how* it contributed if they understand the outcome.
    *   **Concept of "Contribution to Expansion":** This requires understanding cause-and-effect and the concept of how one event can lead to a broader outcome like "expansion of power." This is generally a basic historical concept.

2.  **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   **"How did... contribute to..."**: This phrasing is quite direct and common in question formulation. It's not overly complex English. "Contribute" might be slightly less common than "lead to" or "resulted in," but it should be comprehensible for someone at a Class 8 level even with limited English.
    *   **Keywords:** "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "expansion," "British power," "India" are all critical terms likely encountered in their English textbooks (even if the medium of instruction is Hindi, these historical proper nouns and concepts often retain their English forms in study materials).
    *   **Rubric Phrases:** "establishment of British political dominance/control," "placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab." These are specific historical concepts that students might struggle to articulate precisely in English if their vocabulary is weak, even if they grasp the underlying idea in Hindi.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Primarily recall of historical facts and consequences taught in the textbook. Students need to remember what happened *after* Plassey.
    *   **Reasoning (Simple Cause-and-Effect):** It requires a simple cause-and-effect understanding: Battle of Plassey (cause) -> British power expansion (effect). They need to bridge these by identifying the immediate consequences of the battle. This isn't complex, analytical reasoning.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question is a **very typical** short-answer or conceptual question found in Class 8 Social Science textbooks after the chapter on "Expansion of British Power" or "Company Rule." It directly addresses a major turning point.
    *   It's generally **easier** than the examples of "Common Errors" provided:
        *   **"Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi"**: This is more open-ended, requires understanding a broader impact across various dimensions (economic, social, political, cultural), and needs detailed examples. This requires synthesis and more complex reasoning, hence the very low pass rate.
        *   **"Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes? Explain"**: This tests general knowledge and symbolic understanding which might not be explicitly taught in history class. It's more of an analytical or cultural reasoning question, potentially outside the strict curriculum.
        *   **"Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign..."**: While a core history topic, "significance" again demands a broader, multi-faceted explanation (e.g., Dhamma, spread of Buddhism, administrative achievements), requiring synthesis rather than a single direct consequence. The common "Empty Response" suggests students struggled to articulate *any* points in English.

**Factors Making This Question Relatively Easier:**

*   **Direct Link:** Plassey's consequence for British power is a direct, causal link prominently discussed in textbooks. It's not a nuanced or abstract concept.
*   **Key Event:** It's a foundational event, not a peripheral one. Students are very likely to have studied it in detail.
*   **Limited Scope for Explanation:** The answer primarily involves stating that it led to control over Bengal (political, economic dominance, puppet Nawab). It doesn't require an extensive list of impacts.

**Factors Making This Question Potentially Difficult:**

*   **Articulation in English:** While they might know the *fact* in Hindi, expressing "establishment of British political dominance" or "puppet nawab" precisely in English could be challenging for students with limited English proficiency. They might know the *idea* but struggle with the specific vocabulary.
*   **Vague Answers:** Instead of specific consequences, students might give vague answers like "British became
