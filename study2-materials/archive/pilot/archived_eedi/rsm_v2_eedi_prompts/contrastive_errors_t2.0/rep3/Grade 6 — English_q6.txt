Let's break down the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and common errors.

**Contrastive Analysis of Difficulty:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Requires:** The student needs to have read and *understood* the poem, at least enough to identify individual lines and their general meaning.
    *   **Requires:** The student needs a basic concept of "liking" something and being able to articulate a reason.
    *   **Compared to other questions:** Less specific content knowledge about poetry *terms* (like "writing style" or "theme") is required, which is a significant advantage. The prior questions (style, theme) demand abstract conceptual understanding of poetry analysis. This question is more about personal response.

2.  **Language Demands for Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Keywords:** "Which line," "like the most," "why." These are relatively common and basic English terms for expressing preference and providing a reason. "Line" is simple. "Most" is a common superlative. "Why" is fundamental for giving reasons.
    *   **Output Demand:**
        *   **Selecting a line:** This is a direct recall/identification task from the poem itself. Copying a line is syntactically straightforward.
        *   **Explaining "why":** This is where it gets harder.
            *   Students need to generate a reason, even a simple one (e.g., "it is nice," "it shows friendship").
            *   They need to express this reason in English. This moves beyond simple recall and requires basic sentence construction ("I like it because...").
    *   **Compared to other questions:**
        *   "Describes the poet's writing style" requires understanding of abstract descriptive terms in English and applying them to a poet's technique – very high linguistic demand. "I am reading" shows complete misunderstanding of "describe" and "style."
        *   "Write a theme or central idea" requires understanding "theme/central idea" (abstract concepts) and expressing a complex idea succinctly in English. "The last bargin they about a child and labour..." shows an attempt but struggles with grammar and precise articulation of the *theme* vs. the *plot*.
        *   "Write a short paragraph about 'My Favourite Hobby'" also requires paragraph structure and multiple sentences, which is hard. The common errors show simple list-like responses or very short, ungrammatical phrases.
        *   This question's "why" component is simpler than writing a paragraph or explaining abstract concepts. A single, short reason could suffice.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Identifying the line is direct recall/identification from the text.
    *   **Reasoning/Application:** Explaining "why" involves basic personal reasoning and applying that reason to the selected line. It's not high-level critical analysis, but rather expressing a personal preference. It falls into the "application" category in a simpler form.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 6 English textbooks often have "comprehension" questions that are factual recall ("Who said what?").
    *   They might have questions asking "What do you think...?" but usually with a more guided structure or simpler answers.
    *   This question, asking for a personal preference and a reason, is relatively common but can be challenging due to the free-response nature. However, the expectation for *why* might be very low. A simple "because it is nice" might still get points if they identify the line.

**What makes this SPECIFIC question easier:**

*   **Personal Response:** It doesn't require "correct" analytical answers about literary devices or themes. A student can choose any line and offer a simple personal reason. This removes the pressure of having the 'right' interpretation.
*   **Simple Vocabulary:** "Like," "most," "why," "line" are basic words.
*   **Identification is the first step:** Students can potentially earn partial credit just by correctly quoting a line from the poem, even if their "why" is poor or absent.
*   **No complex paragraph structure required for the 'why'**: A single sentence for the 'why' part would likely suffice.

**What makes this SPECIFIC question harder (compared to just recall):**

*   **Generating a reason:** While the language for expressing "why" is simple, some students may still struggle to articulate *any* reason, even a basic one. They might not be used to being asked for personal opinions on text in a formal setting.
*   **Formulating the reason grammatically:** "I like it because..." requires
