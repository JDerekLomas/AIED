Let's break down the question "Who lived inside the book?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering the context provided.

**Contrastive Analysis of Difficulty:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Low Assumption (Text-Dependent):** This question doesn't require outside knowledge or world experience, other than perhaps the general concept of "living inside" something and understanding characters in a story. The answer *should* be directly stated or very clearly implied in a preceding text (which is not provided here, but is a crucial context for this *type* of question).
    *   **Crucial Missing Piece:** The most significant "prior knowledge" missing in our current analysis is the *story itself*. Without the accompanying text from which this question is drawn, evaluating its difficulty precisely is challenging. We must assume the answer "a magical fairy" is explicitly or implicitly available in the text these students have just read.

2.  **Language Demands for Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Who": A basic interrogative pronoun, usually introduced early.
        *   "lived": Past tense of "live," also generally basic.
        *   "inside": Common preposition, fairly basic.
        *   "the book": Very common nouns.
        *   "a magical fairy": "Magical" might be a slightly higher-level adjective, but "fairy" is a very common fantasy concept, even in Indian folklore adapted to English. Many children would recognize it.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure in the question. "Who" acts as the subject being asked about. This is relatively straightforward.
    *   **Common Errors Relevance:**
        *   The errors "I am reading," "Empty Response" (for descriptive questions) suggest issues with comprehension, expression, and potentially lack of a specific answer to retrieve.
        *   "The last bargin they about a child and labour. many people tried to force the la" shows an attempt to articulate a theme but struggles with grammar, spelling, and completeness.
        *   "My hobby is cricket play" indicates difficulty with full sentences and correct word forms.
    *   **This question:** Requires retrieval of a specific noun phrase ("a magical fairy"). It doesn't demand descriptive writing, thematic analysis, or paragraph construction. The answer is short and direct.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall (Direct Information Retrieval):** This is purely a recall question. The answer should be found directly in the text they've read. It does not require application of a concept to a new scenario or complex inferential reasoning. This generally makes it easier than descriptive or analytical questions.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   "Who" questions (identifying characters) are incredibly common and foundational comprehension questions in Class 3-5 textbooks, let alone Class 6. They are often among the *easiest* types of comprehension questions designed to check if a student has simply followed the narrative.
    *   It's significantly easier than "Describes the poet’s writing style," "Write a theme or central idea," or "Write a short paragraph about 'My Favourite Hobby'," which require higher-order thinking, sustained writing, and more complex vocabulary/grammar. The other examples highlight common *difficulties* with descriptive or extended responses, which this question avoids.

**Why this question is comparatively *easier* than the examples given:**

*   **Direct Answer:** The expected answer "a magical fairy" is likely a direct lift or very close paraphrase from the text.
*   **Minimal Writing:** Requires only a short phrase or two words, minimizing grammatical and spelling errors associated with longer responses.
*   **Basic Vocabulary:** "Who lived inside the book?" uses very fundamental English words and sentence structure.
*   **Focus on Factual Retrieval:** Does not demand complex interpretation, stylistic analysis, or personal elaboration. It's a character identification question, a very early reading skill.
*   **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Students don't have to formulate a coherent paragraph or describe abstract concepts; they just need to find and state a piece of information.

**Factors that might still cause errors:**

*   **Total lack of comprehension of the story:** If the story itself was too complex or completely misunderstood.
*   **Failure to understand "who" or "lived inside":** Unlikely for Class 6 for these very basic words, but possible for some.
*   **Missing "a magical fairy" in the text:** If the story uses a much more complex phrase or heavily implies rather than states it (less likely for a direct "who" question at this level).
*   **Simple oversight/lack of focus:** Missing the specific detail
