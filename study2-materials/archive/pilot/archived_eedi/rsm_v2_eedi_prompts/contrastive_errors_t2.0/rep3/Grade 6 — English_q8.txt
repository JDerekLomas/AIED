Let's break down the question "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence: book/reading/a/is/he" with the given context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic understanding of word order in simple English sentences (Subject-Verb-Object).
    *   Recognition of common English words (book, reading, a, is, he).
    *   Awareness that a sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a period (though not explicitly required for a full score by the rubric, it's good practice for "meaningful sentence").

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** All words are highly frequent and likely to be encountered early in English learning. "He," "is," "a," "book," "reading" are fundamental.
    *   **Grammar:** This tests basic sentence structure (SVO). It requires understanding that "he" is the subject, "is reading" is the verb phrase, and "a book" is the object. This is a core grammatical concept taught at this level.
    *   **Complexity:** The sentence is short and contains only five words. There are no complex clauses, conjunctions, or advanced vocabulary.
    *   **Instructions:** "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence" is a clear and direct instruction. "Meaningful" implies grammatically correct and semantically sensible.

3.  **Is this Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application** of grammatical rules. Students aren't just recalling facts; they are applying their understanding of English sentence structure to a given set of words. There's a minor element of **reasoning** to determine the most logical and grammatically sound order, but it's not a high-level critical thinking task.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Easier:**
        *   The *vocabulary* is simpler than questions like "Describe the poet's writing style."
        *   It doesn't require *composition* from scratch, unlike "Write a theme..." or "Write a short paragraph about 'My Favourite Hobby.'" Students are given all the words.
        *   It doesn't require complex comprehension or inference from a poem/text.
        *   The errors seen in other examples (like "I am reading" for "poet's writing style") suggest a fundamental lack of comprehension for abstract instructions or more nuanced vocabulary. This question avoids that.
    *   **Comparable/Standard:** Rearranging words to form simple sentences is a very common type of exercise found in primary and middle school English textbooks. It directly tests basic grammar without extraneous demands.

**Factors for High Performance on THIS Question:**

*   **Fixed set of words:** Students don't need to generate words, only order them.
*   **Simple sentence structure:** SVO is foundational.
*   **High-frequency vocabulary:** Words like "he," "is," "book," "reading" are typically among the first learned.
*   **Concrete concept:** "He is reading a book" is a very tangible action and subject.

**Reasons for Potential Errors (even with the above):**

*   **Lack of Exposure/Instruction:** If the curriculum or teaching hasn't sufficiently covered basic SVO order, students might struggle.
*   **Literal Word-by-Word Translation/Confusion with L1 structure:** Students from Hindi-medium schools might default to Hindi word order, which is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) often. So, "He book is reading" might be a common incorrect response if they directly map L1 structure to English. This is the biggest hurdle for Hindi-speaking students.
    *   *Hindi Example:* वह किताब पढ़ रहा है। (Wah kitaab padh raha hai.) -> He book reading is.
*   **Random Guessing/Cognitive Load:** For students with extremely limited English, even common words might not form a coherent meaning, leading to random arrangements or "Empty Response."
*   **Mistaking "a" for a separate noun/verb:** Unlikely given the other common words, but possible for extremely low proficiency.

**Conclusion based on analysis:**

This question is significantly *easier* than the examples provided (describing style, writing a theme, writing a paragraph) which all required a much higher level of comprehension, composition, and abstract thought. The "average pass rate across items on this exam is about 29%" is driven down by those complex items.

The main challenge for these students will be overcoming their native language's (Hindi's) SOV structure and applying SVO in English. However, SVO is explicitly taught in even basic English lessons. Given
