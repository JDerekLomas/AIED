Let's break down the question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason." for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their typical profile.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Passage Comprehension:** The most crucial assumption is that students have read and understood the preceding passage, which presumably features a king grappling with specific questions (e.g., what is the right time, who are the right people, what is the most important thing). Without this context, the question is unanswerable.
    *   **Basic Understanding of "King's Questions":** The phrase itself might be a direct reference from the passage or a commonly used term in it. Assuming they understood the *content* of the king's questions from the story is key.
    *   **Concept of "Importance in Real Life":** This requires students to relate a fictional scenario to their own world/understanding. This is a common cognitive task but can be tricky if their understanding of "real life" is limited to very concrete experiences or if the concepts are abstract.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Important": Likely known, but possibly not in the nuanced sense of philosophical/strategic importance.
        *   "Real life": Very common phrase, probably understood.
        *   "Give one reason": Standard instruction.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** "Do you think... Give one reason." is a relatively straightforward question structure for an English prompt. It's direct.
    *   **Open-ended vs. Closed-ended:** This is an open-ended question requiring a subjective answer and justification. This is a higher-order thinking skill than simple recall.
    *   **Compared to Common Errors:**
        *   The common errors cited ("Describes the poet's writing style," "Write a theme or central idea," "Write a short paragraph...") often struggle with **abstract concepts**, **summarization**, and **extended writing**.
        *   "Describes the poet's writing style" is highly abstract and uses challenging vocabulary. The provided question "Do you think..." is more concrete in its ask, even if the "reason" could be abstract.
        *   "Write a theme or central idea" also requires abstraction. "Do you think..." simplifies the cognitive load by asking for an *opinion* rather than an analytical summary.
        *   "Write a short paragraph" struggles with length and topic coherence. Our target question only asks for "one reason," significantly reducing the writing burden. The errors show basic grammar and sentence construction issues, but "one reason" can often be expressed in a single, simple sentence.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily a **reasoning** and **application** question, building upon **recall** of the story's content.
    *   **Recall:** Students must remember what the king's questions were about from the passage.
    *   **Application:** They apply the meaning of those questions to their understanding of "real life."
    *   **Reasoning:** They must formulate a coherent "reason" for their belief in the questions' importance. This involves connecting the abstract concepts of the king's questions to practical benefits or relevance.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical textbook exercises for this level often focus on:
        *   **Literal comprehension:** Who did what? Where did it happen?
        *   **Vocabulary matching/fill-in-the-blanks.**
        *   **Simple grammar tasks.**
        *   **Very guided writing prompts.**
    *   This question is more demanding than literal comprehension, as it requires inference, personal opinion, and justification. However, compared to *identifying a writing style* or *summarizing a theme*, it is less abstract. The phrase "Give one reason" keeps the writing requirement minimal. Many textbooks *do* have "think and discuss" or "value-based" questions that are similar in nature.

**Strengths/Ease:**

*   **Direct Question:** "Do you think...?" is a clear prompt for an opinion.
*   **Minimal Writing:** "Give one reason" is far less demanding than a paragraph or even "describe." Students might be able to articulate a single relevant sentence despite common writing struggles.
*   **Relevance:** The king's questions (e.g., right time, right thing, right people) are universal themes that most students can intuitively grasp as important. This makes forming a "reason" somewhat accessible.
*   **Passage Context:** The question *explicitly references* "the king's questions," implying the context comes directly from the story. If the story was well-understood, the connection is
