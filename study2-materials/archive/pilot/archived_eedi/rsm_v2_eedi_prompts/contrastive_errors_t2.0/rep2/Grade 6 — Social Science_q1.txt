Here's a breakdown of the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" and a contrastive analysis:

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Basic Geography of India:** Students are expected to know the names of prominent physical features of India, specifically mountain ranges. This is foundational Class 6 Social Science (Geography) content.
*   **Definition of "mountain range":** Implicitly, students should understand what a mountain range is.

**2. Language Demands:**
*   **"Name":** A straightforward directive, common in exam questions.
*   **"two":** Clearly indicates the required number of responses.
*   **"major":** While "major" can be subjective, for Class 6, this broadly refers to the prominent ranges taught in textbooks (Himalayas, Aravallis, etc.).
*   **"mountain ranges":** Key geographical term.
*   **"located in India":** Clearly defines the scope.

**Contrast with "Explain how colonial rule..." or "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign...":**
*   Those questions require **conceptual understanding, analysis, and synthesis** of information. They often demand explaining cause-and-effect or significance, which is a much higher cognitive load than naming.
*   This question is a **direct recall** task. The answer is a specific fact, not an explanation.
*   The language is far simpler. There are no abstract terms like "colonial rule," "significance," "tribal communities," which are challenging for students with limited English.

**3. Cognitive Demand (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
*   This is primarily a **recall** question. Students either know the names of two major Indian mountain ranges or they don't.
*   It does not require application of knowledge to a new scenario or complex reasoning.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   This is a very **typical and fundamental recall question** for Class 6 Geography. Textbooks often have "Name the following..." or "List two..." questions related to physical features. It's likely among the first types of questions encountered in this unit.

**Why this question is EASIER than the example common errors:**

*   **No "Empty Response" due to lack of English comprehension:** While "empty response" is possible due to lack of content knowledge, it's far less likely to be due to misunderstanding the question itself, unlike questions with complex vocabulary and instructions.
*   **No abstract concepts:** "Colonial rule," "significance," and even "explain" itself pose language barriers that are absent here.
*   **Direct recall of factual information:** This contrasts sharply with requiring explanations, cause-and-effect, or justifications. Geography facts like mountain names are often explicitly drilled.
*   **Limited vocabulary:** "Name," "two," "major," "mountain ranges," "India" are all relatively basic terms expected to be understood.
*   **Common knowledge within the curriculum:** Mountain ranges of India are a core part of the Class 6 geography syllabus.
*   **Rubric leniency:** Naming just *one* correct range still yields 0.5 points, further lowering the bar for partial credit.

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

Considering the average pass rate for Social Science items is 29% and the cited common errors, this question stands out as significantly easier due to its direct recall nature, simple language, and foundational content. While limited English and overall academic weakness are factors, this particular question is a very basic "knowledge check." Students are likely to have learned these names, even if rote memorization. The hurdle is knowing *two*, but partial credit is given for *one*.

Therefore, I'd expect a significantly higher proportion of correct responses than the average or the complex "explain" questions.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **55%**
