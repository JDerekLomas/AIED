Let's break down the question "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence: book/reading/a/is/he" with the context of Class 6 Indian government school students.

### Contrastive Analysis

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Vocabulary:** All words are extremely common, high-frequency words likely introduced early in primary English education. "Book," "reading," "a," "is," "he" are fundamental building blocks.
*   **Basic Sentence Structure:** The core knowledge required is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) sentence structure. This is typically the very first sentence pattern taught and drilled when introducing English sentence formation.

**2. Language Demands for Students with Limited English:**
*   **Minimal Comprehension Needed:** Unlike "describes the poet's writing style" or "write a theme," there's no complex instruction or abstract concept to understand. The instruction "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence" is a standard task and even if the exact words are new, the *concept* of putting jumbled words in order to form a sentence is often introduced in Hindi as well ("shabdon ko sahi kram mein rakhen" - put words in the correct order). The words themselves are simple and concrete.
*   **No Original Production:** Students do not need to generate *any* new language. They are given all the components. This dramatically reduces the burden compared to writing a paragraph or explaining a style.
*   **Context Independence:** The words are presented in isolation, but they form a universally understandable and very common simple present continuous sentence. There's no specific context they need to understand from a text.
*   **Repetitive Practice:** Sentence rearrangement exercises are extremely common in English language learning curricula at this level in India, often serving as a foundational exercise to reinforce SVO order.

**3. Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
*   **Application:** It primarily requires the *application* of known vocabulary and a very basic grammatical rule (SVO structure).
*   **Low-Level Reasoning:** There's a minimal element of reasoning to find the correct order, but it's constrained by very few words and a highly probable, natural-sounding outcome. It's not abstract reasoning like understanding a poetic theme.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   **Relatively Easy:** This question represents one of the *easier* types of English exercises found in textbooks for Class 6. Sentence rearrangement often starts with even simpler structures (e.g., "is/a/it/table") before moving to present continuous.
*   **Contrast with Common Errors:**
    *   **"Describes the poet’s writing style":** This demands understanding abstract concepts ("style"), critical analysis, and expressing it in their own words, a highly advanced skill.
    *   **"Write a theme or central idea":** Again, abstract understanding and original production are required, along with potentially nuanced vocabulary. "The last bargin they about a child and labour. many people tried to force the la" shows an attempt to grasp meaning but severe struggles with grammar and expression.
    *   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'":** This requires original sentence construction, sequencing ideas, paragraphing, and using a variety of vocabulary and sentence structures – far more complex than rearranging existing words. "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho" or "My hobby is cricket play" demonstrates that while they know some relevant vocabulary, they struggle immensely with basic sentence formation even when producing their own simple thoughts.

**What Makes *This* Specific Question Easier:**
*   **Fixed Words:** All words are provided, reducing the cognitive load.
*   **High Frequency Vocabulary:** No obscure or difficult words.
*   **Common Sentence Structure:** SVO for present continuous is fundamental.
*   **Clear S-V-O Path:** "He" is the obvious subject. "is reading" is the logical verb phrase. "a book" is the only logical object phrase. There's little ambiguity once a student identifies "He" as the starter.
*   **No Grammar Rules Beyond Word Order:** They don't need to conjugate verbs, choose tenses (other than using "is reading" as a fixed unit), or deal with punctuation other than implied capitalisation of the first word.

Given the common errors seen (failure to answer, extreme grammatical errors in simple self-generated sentences, misunderstanding complex prompts), this question bypasses many of those core difficulties by:
1.  Not requiring abstract comprehension.
2.  Not requiring original language production beyond arranging given elements.
3.  Using extremely common vocabulary and a fundamental sentence structure.

While "Empty Response" still exists even for easier questions, the nature of this task (physical arrangement of tangible words) can feel more like
