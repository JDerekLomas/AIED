Let's break down this question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school.

**Contrastive Analysis**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Time:** Students need to understand am/pm and be able to calculate time differences, specifically elapsed hours over a 12-hour cycle (e.g., from 10 am to 4 pm). This is usually covered by Class 5 or 6.
    *   **Temperature:** Understanding of Celsius units ($^0 C$) and what "increases" means in relation to temperature. This is standard Gk/Science content.
    *   **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition and multiplication. Adding 2 repeatedly or multiplying 6 x 2.
    *   **Units:** Understanding that $^0 C$ is a unit of temperature and that hours are a unit of time.

*   **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   "10 am in the morning": Fairly straightforward. 'am' and 'morning' reinforce each other.
    *   "temperature": Likely a cognate or well-understood word.
    *   "Jodhpur": A proper noun, not relevant to the math.
    *   "30^0 C": The number and unit are clear.
    *   "increases by 2^0 C per hour": This is the most crucial part.
        *   "increases": Key verb for addition. Could be difficult if they don't know it well, but 'increase' is often taught early.
        *   "per hour": This means 'for each hour'. This is vital for understanding multiplication or repeated addition. This might be a stumbling block. Students might misinterpret it as a total increase for the whole duration, not per unit time.
    *   "what will be the temperature": Standard question phrasing.
    *   "4:00 in the evening": Similar to "10 am in the morning". 'pm' would be less common, so 'in the evening' is helpful.

    *Potential Language Bottlenecks:* "increases by... per hour." If this phrase isn't understood precisely, the whole problem falls apart.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily an **application** problem. It takes standard arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication) and applies them to a real-world scenario (temperature change over time).
    *   There's a mild **reasoning** component in breaking down the problem:
        1.  Calculate time elapsed.
        2.  Calculate total temperature change.
        3.  Add the change to the initial temperature.
    *   It's not pure recall, as they need to structure their steps.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Many Class 6 math textbooks have similar word problems involving time, temperature, or other rates (e.g., distance-speed-time, cost per item).
    *   The "per hour" concept for calculating a total change is a standard application of multiplication.
    *   Calculating time differences from 'am' to 'pm' is also a common exercise.
    *   The numbers (30, 2, 10 am to 4 pm) are small and simple, requiring no complex calculations.
    *   The main challenge would be integrating these three separate skills (time calculation, rate application, final addition) in one problem, and *crucially*, understanding the English phrasing for "increases by... per hour." If the question was in Hindi, it would likely be considered moderate-easy. In English, it's slightly harder due to vocabulary.

**Thinking through student approaches/errors:**

1.  **Time Calculation Error:**
    *   10 am to 4 pm: 10->11 (1hr), 11->12 (2hr), 12->1 (3hr), 1->2 (4hr), 2->3 (5hr), 3->4 (6hr). This requires careful counting. A student might count 10 and 4, or get confused by the 12. They might also mistakenly subtract (4-10) which gives -6, or add them up without logic.
    *   Rubric: "Calculates the time elapsed from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm as 6 hours." This implies getting the time elapsed is *the* core requirement for Max Score 1. It doesn't ask for the final temperature, only the calculation of elapsed time. This changes the focus dramatically.

2.  **Rate/Calculation Error (if the rubric included final answer):**
    *   If they get 6 hours, then 6 hours *
