Let's break down the question "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it."

**Contrastive Analysis:**

**Compared to Q1: "Describes the poet's writing style." (4% pass rate)**

*   **Difficulty Comparison: SIGNIFICANTLY EASIER.**
*   **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   **"Poet's writing style":** Assumes advanced literary analysis skills (identifying imagery, metaphor, rhythm, tone, etc.), abstract thinking, and a sophisticated understanding of English literary terms. Class 7 students, especially with limited exposure, are unlikely to possess this.
    *   **"My Favourite Hobby":** Assumes personal experience. Every child has hobbies or activities they enjoy. This is concrete and relatable. No specialized prior knowledge is needed beyond basic personal experience.
*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **"Poet's writing style":** Requires a robust descriptive vocabulary, the ability to formulate complex analytical sentences, and potentially the use of abstract concepts. "I am reading" demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the question, indicating the sheer complexity.
    *   **"My Favourite Hobby":** Requires basic descriptive language (e.g., "I like," "I play," "It makes me happy"), simple sentence structures (subject-verb-object), and a vocabulary within their personal domain. The command "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences)" is clear. "Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it" breaks down the required content into three clear, concrete points, guiding the student.
*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   **"Poet's writing style":** Primarily *reasoning* and *application* of literary analysis frameworks, with recall of literary terms. It's high-level cognitive work.
    *   **"My Favourite Hobby":** Primarily *recall* of personal information and *application* of basic paragraph writing structure. It requires expressing existing ideas rather than forming new complex analytical ones.
*   **Textbook Exercises:** "Describe yourself," "Talk about your family," "My favorite animal/teacher/food" are common Class 7 introductory writing exercises. "Poet's writing style" is typically seen in much higher grades or specialized literature classes.

**Compared to Q2: "Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."" (5% pass rate)**

*   **Difficulty Comparison: MUCH EASIER.**
*   **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   **"Theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain'":** Requires reading and comprehending a specific poem (which might be challenging itself), then abstracting its underlying message or meaning. This involves interpretive skills and understanding allegorical or symbolic elements. The student's answer about "child and labour" suggests an attempt at interpretation but likely missing the core abstract theme (freedom, unconditionality, true worth, etc.).
    *   **"My Favourite Hobby":** As above, relies on personal, concrete experience. No prior text comprehension or abstract interpretation is required.
*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **"Theme or central idea":** Requires summarizing complex ideas concisely and accurately, using appropriate vocabulary to express abstract concepts.
    *   **"My Favourite Hobby":** Relies on basic descriptive vocabulary for personal activities and feelings. The structure is given.
*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   **"Theme or central idea":** Primarily *reasoning* and *interpretation* based on text comprehension.
    *   **"My Favourite Hobby":** Primarily *recall* of personal experience and basic *application* of paragraph structure.
*   **Textbook Exercises:** Analyzing literary themes is generally introduced and practiced, but achieving mastery for complex poems is challenging at this level. Autobiographical writing is more foundational.

**Compared to Q3: "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what" (pass rate: 10%) - *This is essentially the same question for comparison!***

*   The reported pass rate of 10% for what is likely the exact same or a very similar question gives us direct evidence.
*   The "Common Errors" observed are insightful:
    *   "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy" - Shows recognition of the topic "favorite," but struggles with *focus* (introduces food), *paragraph structure* (list format instead of sentences), and *elaboration* (doesn't say *why* or *when*). This student has vocabulary for hobbies but not the writing skill requested.
