Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis:

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Knowledge of Rajasthan:** Students need to know basic geography/natural resources of Rajasthan. This is foundational for Social Science in Class 6. They should be aware of things like its desert climate, associated scarcity of water, and some common minerals or features.
*   **Definition of "natural resources":** This is a core concept taught early in Social Science (Geography section).
*   **Cause-and-effect relationship:** Understanding how a resource "influences" lives requires a basic grasp of cause-and-effect, e.g., "lack of water leads to X lifestyle choices."

**2. Language Demands (English):**
*   **"Mention any two natural resources":** This is relatively straightforward vocabulary. "Natural resources" is a common phrase taught.
*   **"explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":**
    *   "Influences" is a slightly more complex verb, but contextually, "how it affects/changes/shapes" their lives is usually understood.
    *   "Lives of the people there" is simple.
*   **Compared to other questions:**
    *   "Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi" – "Colonial rule," "tribal communities," "affected" are all more abstract and specific historical terms.
    *   "Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes? Explain" – While "currency notes" is easy, linking lions to Ashok is very specific historical recall and symbolism, requiring more precise language to explain.
    *   "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign in Indian history, mentioning at leas" – "Significance," "reign," "Indian history" are all higher-level academic vocabulary.
*   **Overall language impact:** The language here is *less* of a barrier than in the common errors provided. The core concepts are quite direct.

**3. Type of Cognitive Task (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
*   **Recall (70%):** Naming two natural resources in Rajasthan is direct recall. Many students would associate Rajasthan with "desert," and thus "sand," "water (scarce but vital)," or "sunlight" easily. Mineral names might be harder.
*   **Application/Reasoning (30%):** Explaining *how* one resource influences lives requires a simple application of cause-and-effect reasoning based on their general knowledge of Rajasthan. For example:
    *   Water scarcity -> reliance on wells, nomadic lifestyle, limited agriculture.
    *   Sunlight -> potential for solar energy.
    *   Sand/Minerals -> mining as an occupation.
*   **Compared to other questions:**
    *   "Colonial rule" question requires deeper historical reasoning and understanding of social impact.
    *   "Lions on currency" requires very specific recall of symbolism and a higher level of explanation.
    *   "Ashoka's reign" requires higher-order historical analysis and synthesis of significance.
*   **Overall task difficulty:** This question combines basic recall with very simple, almost intuitive, reasoning/application. It's not a complex historical or social analysis.

**4. Difficulty compared to typical textbook exercises:**
*   This is a fairly standard type of question found in Class 6 geography chapters related to regions of India and natural resources.
*   "Name resources of a region" and "Explain impact of a resource" are common exercise patterns.
*   It's likely *easier* than many of the higher-level "explain the significance" or "analyze the impact" questions that often appear as end-of-chapter tasks in Social Science.
*   The "empty response" for other questions indicates either total lack of knowledge or severe difficulty comprehending the prompt/formulating an answer. This question is less likely to result in a complete "empty response" for someone with even minimal relevant knowledge. They might at least name one resource.

**Factors making it easier:**
*   Relatively simple and direct language.
*   Combines common recall (natural resources) with simple application.
*   Rajasthan is a prominent Indian state; some knowledge is almost universally absorbed, even outside formal schooling (e.g., desert = sand, less water).
*   The rubric allows for a wide range of correct resources and doesn't demand very deep explanation for "influence."

**Factors making it harder (relative to some simple recall items):**
*   Still requires knowing two resources, not just one.
*   The "explain how it influences" part demands a sentence or two of coherent thought, not just a list.
