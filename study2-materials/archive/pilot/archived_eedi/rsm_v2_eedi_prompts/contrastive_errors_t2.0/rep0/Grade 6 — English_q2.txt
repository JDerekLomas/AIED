Here's a breakdown of the question "Who lived inside the book?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, followed by the estimated proportion correct.

## Contrastive Analysis

**1. What prior knowledge is assumed?**

*   **Story Comprehension:** The most significant prior knowledge is understanding the story from which this question is drawn. The question isn't a standalone vocabulary or grammar item; it directly probes content learned through a reading. Assuming "The Magical Fairy in the Book" (or a similar story) is part of their curriculum and they have engaged with it.
*   **Basic vocabulary:** "Who," "lived," "inside," "the," "book" are all fundamental English words likely introduced in earlier grades or at the Class 6 level.
*   **Concept of "fairy":** The concept of a fairy (and its magical attributes) is often introduced in children's literature, even in translated forms, making it a familiar concept for many children.

**2. What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**

*   **Interrogative "Who":** This is a basic "wh-question" that students should have practiced extensively. It directly asks for a person/character.
*   **Simple past tense ("lived"):** The past tense verb "lived" is relatively simple and commonly encountered. Students just need to recall who the subject of that verb was in the story.
*   **Relatively short and direct:** The question is very short and unambiguous. There's no complex sentence structure, figurative language, or abstract concepts.
*   **Single, concrete answer:** The answer ("a fairy" or "a magical fairy") is a direct, concrete noun phrase. It doesn't require a long explanation, sentence construction, or a paragraph.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

*   **Primarily Recall:** This is a direct recall question. If the student has read and understood the story, the answer should be readily available from their memory. It doesn't require inferencing, critical analysis, or application of a skill beyond basic comprehension.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Easier than most typical textbook comprehension questions:**
    *   **Less Complex "Wh-" type:** Questions like "Why did the character feel sad?" or "How did the character solve the problem?" demand more inference and often require explaining reasons or sequences, which are harder. "Who lived..." is the simplest form.
    *   **Direct Answer:** Unlike questions asking to "describe" (pass rate 4%) or "write a theme" (pass rate 5%) or "write a paragraph" (pass rate 10%), this requires only a short phrase. The common errors show that open-ended descriptive or explanatory tasks are extremely difficult.
    *   **Low Vocabulary Barrier:** The vocabulary of the question itself is simple.
    *   **No "style" or "idea" abstractness:** The common errors provided demonstrate a major difficulty with abstract concepts like "writing style" or "theme." "Who lived inside the book?" is highly concrete.

**Compared to the common errors provided:**

*   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%) - Very high linguistic and abstract concept demand. Students resort to generic answers or "Empty Response."
*   "Write a theme or central idea of the poem..." (pass rate: 5%) - Again, abstract concept and demands sentence construction. The partial answer "The last bargin they about a child and labour..." shows an attempt at content but very poor English expression.
*   "Write a short paragraph...about 'My Favourite Hobby'." (pass rate: 10%) - Requires extended writing, grammatical accuracy, and organizing ideas. The errors ("My hobby is cricket play") show severe difficulties with sentence structure.

"Who lived inside the book?" completely avoids these pitfalls. It's concrete, short, asks for a direct factual recall, and only requires a noun phrase.

**Potential Difficulties:**

*   **Story exposure/understanding:** The biggest barrier will be whether they truly comprehended the source material in the first place, or even read it. If the story was never taught, or poorly taught, no student would know. However, we're assuming the *story itself* is part of their curriculum.
*   **Recalling "magical":** While "fairy" is core, some students might just say "fairy" and miss "magical," which is still acceptable by the rubric.

Given its directness, simplicity, and low linguistic load, this question should perform *significantly* better than the 4-10% pass rates shown for more complex tasks. It aligns more with basic comprehension check often found at the end of story chapters.
