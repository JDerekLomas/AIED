Let's break down the question "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence: book/reading/a/is/he" with the given context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **What prior knowledge is assumed?**
    *   **Basic English Sentence Structure (SVO):** The most fundamental assumption is that students have been exposed to and understand the typical Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order in English.
    *   **Common sight words:** All words ("book," "reading," "a," "is," "he") are very common, high-frequency words that Class 6 students should ideally recognize and understand in isolation.
    *   **Meaning of "meaningful sentence":** Students need to grasp that the rearranged words must make sense grammatically and semantically.

2.  **What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
    *   **Low Vocabulary Demand:** As noted, all words are common. There are no unfamiliar abstract nouns, complex verbs, or challenging adjectives/adverbs.
    *   **Low Grammatical Complexity:** The sentence structure itself ("He is reading a book") is a very basic present continuous tense, a staple of early English instruction.
    *   **Recognition vs. Production:** This is primarily a **recognition and rearrangement** task rather than a free production task. Students don't need to generate new words or complex ideas. They just need to manipulate existing familiar words.
    *   **Visual Cues:** The individual words are provided, reducing the burden of recalling them from memory.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Application/Reasoning (Light):** It's not pure recall, as the students need to actively combine and sequence the words. However, the reasoning involved is quite basic: identifying the subject, then the verb, then the object, which often feels more like applying a learned pattern (SVO) than complex logical deduction.
    *   **Heavily dependent on pattern recognition:** Students who have frequently practiced sentence construction exercises will likely approach this as a familiar pattern-matching task.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Easier than most typical textbook exercises presented in the "COMMON ERRORS" section:**
        *   The "Describes the poet’s writing style" question (4% pass rate) demands abstract understanding, vocabulary related to literary criticism, and free-form sentence production – vastly more difficult.
        *   "Write a theme or central idea" (5% pass rate) requires complex comprehension, inference, and paragraph construction, again much harder.
        *   "Write a short paragraph about 'My Favourite Hobby'" (10% pass rate) requires sustained original writing, coherence, and correct grammar over multiple sentences, making it far more challenging.
    *   **Easier than the "average pass rate across items on this exam (29%)" implies for open-ended questions.** That 29% likely encompasses a broad range of question types, including those requiring more elaborate answers, creative writing, or higher-order thinking in English.
    *   **Typical in primary/early secondary English workbooks:** Sentence reordering is a very common type of "drill" exercise found in English language learning materials for beginners. If Class 6 students have had *any* exposure to formal English instruction, they would likely have encountered such exercises.

**Factors making it easier for students from economically weaker sections/Hindi-medium schools (relative to the other examples):**

*   **Concrete words:** All words refer to concrete objects/actions, making them easier to conceptualize even with limited English.
*   **Minimal need for inferencing or abstract thought:** It's about constructing a basic factual statement.
*   **Simple sentence structure is foundational:** Even if their exposure is limited, the SVO structure is usually the very first grammatical pattern taught.
*   **Low stakes for individual word meaning:** If a student knows "he," "is," and "book," even if "reading" is slightly less firm, the combination often clarifies the meaning within this specific context.

**Potential Pitfalls/Reasons for Incorrect Answers:**

*   **Pure lack of exposure:** Students with truly minimal exposure to *any* English sentence construction drills might struggle to form any coherent sequence beyond "book reading he is a."
*   **L1 Interference (SVO in Hindi vs. English):** Hindi uses SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). So, "He a book reading is" (वह एक किताब पढ़ रहा है - *वह एक किताब पढ़ रहा है* is He a book reading is/present tense helping verb). While the English helping verb "is" precedes the main verb, the fundamental difference in the placement of the main verb can sometimes lead to "He a book reading
