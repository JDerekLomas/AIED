Let's break down the question for a Class 7 student in an Indian government school, considering the context provided.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Geometric Shapes:** Recognition of a triangle and its components (base, height).
*   **Formula Recall:** Knowledge of the formula for the area of a triangle. This would typically be introduced in Class 6 or 7.
*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Multiplication of whole numbers and fractions (specifically multiplying by 1/2 or dividing by 2).
*   **Units:** Understanding of units of length (cm) and area (cm²).

**Language Demands:**

*   **"Find the area":** Common mathematical terminology, likely familiar.
*   **"triangle":** Common word.
*   **"whose base is `8` cm and height is `6` cm":** Clear and direct phrasing, identifying the two necessary parameters.
*   The vocabulary is relatively simple and direct. The only potential hurdle might be "whose," but its meaning is deducible from context. There are no complex sentence structures or idioms. This is significantly less demanding than many other word problems.

**Type of Task:**

*   This is primarily an **application** task, directly applying a memorized formula.
*   It requires **recall** of the formula itself.
*   It does *not* require complex **reasoning** (e.g., decomposing shapes, deriving the formula, solving for an unknown variable when area is given).

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Easy:** This is a very standard, direct application problem, often found as the first or second example when the topic of "Area of a Triangle" is introduced. It's the most basic type of problem involving this formula.
*   Textbooks often start with similar questions, then progress to finding missing dimensions, areas of composite shapes, or problems requiring more multi-step calculations. This problem is at the entry-level of difficulty for the topic.

**Contrastive Analysis Summary:**

*   **Ease:** The *mathematical content* (applying a simple formula with given numbers) is straightforward for a Class 7 student who has been taught the concept. The *language demand* is very low, which is a significant advantage for students with limited English proficiency. There are no tricks, extra information, or missing information.
*   **Hardness:** The main difficulty will stem from either:
    1.  **Not knowing the formula:** If the student has not learned or remembered `Area = 1/2 × base × height`. This is a common point of failure for formula-based questions.
    2.  **Basic arithmetic errors:** Forgetting to divide by 2 or miscalculating the product `8 × 6`.
    3.  **Language Barrier (Minor):** While low, a complete inability to understand "base" and "height" in English could be an issue, though these terms are usually taught visually alongside the Hindi equivalents. Given the simplicity, direct translation of key terms might have been provided in instruction.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%) across items:** This implies many questions are quite challenging. However, this specific question is at the foundational end of mathematics problem types. It's direct formula application, with simple numbers and clear language.

The formula `1/2 * b * h` is a core concept taught usually in Class 6 or 7. Students who understand geometry at this level should at least be exposed to it. The simplicity of the language will greatly reduce the cognitive load compared to more complex word problems.

If the student remembers the formula and can perform basic multiplication and division by 2, they will get this right. The language demands are minimal.

**Estimate:**

Given that this is a foundational application problem with very low language demands, it should perform significantly better than the overall average for questions involving more complex reasoning or higher language demands. However, "formula recall" is still a hurdle. Many students might multiply 8 x 6 but forget the 1/2.

*   Students who remember the formula and perform calculations correctly: This is a direct application.
*   Students who multiply `base × height` but forget `1/2`: This is a common error in such questions.
*   Students who are completely unaware of the formula or make significant calculation errors.

I'd expect a substantial number of students to recall the formula and execute it. The low language barrier is a huge plus.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%**
