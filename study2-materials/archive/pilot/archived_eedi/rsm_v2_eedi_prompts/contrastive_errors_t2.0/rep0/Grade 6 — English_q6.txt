Here's a breakdown of the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" and its estimated pass rate for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering the common errors and context provided:

**Analysis of the Question:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** Understanding "line," "poem," "like," "most," "why." These are generally high-frequency words, likely introduced by Class 6, especially "like," "why," "most." "Poem" and "line" in the context of poetry are crucial.
    *   **Reading Comprehension:** The ability to understand the poem well enough to pick a line and identify *why* it resonates with them. This is the biggest hurdle. If the poem itself is complex or has difficult vocabulary, understanding any specific line's meaning will be a challenge. We are *not* provided the poem itself, which makes assessing comprehension difficulty harder.
    *   **Self-reflection/Opinion:** The ability to express a personal preference and provide a reason. This requires some abstract thought and a link between their internal feelings and the text.

*   **Language Demands (on students with limited English):**
    *   **Retrieval:** They need to identify a *specific line* from the poem. This might involve copying it verbatim or remembering it well enough. Copying is easier than recalling.
    *   **Sentence Construction (Output):** They need to formulate a sentence like "I like the line '...' because..."
    *   **Vocabulary for "Why":** Depending on their understanding of the poem and their emotional response, they might need vocabulary to express things like "it's beautiful," "it's sad," "it describes X," "I can relate to it," etc. This can be very basic ("good," "nice") or more elaborate.
    *   **Grammar:** Basic subject-verb-object structure, correct use of "because."

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall/Identification:** Identifying a line from the poem. (Relatively low cognitive load if the poem is provided).
    *   **Reasoning/Application (of personal opinion):** Explaining *why* they like it. This is the higher-order thinking component. It's not factual recall, but rather expressing a personal connection and justifying it.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical Textbook Exercises:** Often involve direct comprehension questions (who, what, when, where), fill-in-the-blanks, matching, true/false, or answering questions based on explicit information in the text.
    *   **This Question:** "Which line... and why?" is more open-ended and requires personal interpretation and justification. This type of question is common in higher-level English classes or for developing critical thinking/response-to-text skills. For Class 6, it pushes beyond basic comprehension towards analysis and personal engagement. This is generally more challenging than typical rote exercises.

**Contrast with Common Errors & Other Questions:**

*   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%):** This question is extremely difficult due to the abstract nature of "writing style" and the need for meta-linguistic understanding. Students are unlikely to have the vocabulary or conceptual framework to describe literary style. Their common errors ("I am reading," "Empty Response") highlight this lack of understanding. Our target question is *much* easier than this.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem..." (pass rate: 5%):** "Theme" and "central idea" are abstract literary concepts. While they might grasp the main story, articulating an abstract theme requires higher-order thinking and specialized vocabulary. The provided error "The last bargin they about a child and labour. many people tried to force the la" shows some attempt at interpretation but struggles with academic language. Our target question avoids these abstract concepts directly, focusing on personal preference.
*   **"Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'..." (pass rate: 10%):** This question, while familiar in topic, demands *paragraph writing* (length and coherence) and specific detail ("Mention what"). The errors show an inability to form coherent paragraphs or fulfill the sentence count, and often devolve into lists or very short, simple sentences. Our target question only asks for *one line* and *one reason*, not a full paragraph, which significantly reduces the writing burden.

**Specific Advantages/Disadvantages for the Target Question:**

*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Personal Connection:** Students can choose a line that genuinely appeals to them, even for simple reasons. This might make them more motivated to answer.
    *   **Basic Language Output:**
