This question requires a higher level of thinking than simple recall. Students need to:
1.  **Understand the King's Questions:** This relies on having correctly answered the previous question (or remembered the context from the passage) or being able to recall them in this moment. The question (pass rate 50%) "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" suggests that a good chunk of students already struggled with recalling *what* the questions were.
2.  **Connect to "Real Life":** This requires an abstract connection, moving beyond the literal text.
3.  **Provide a "Reason":** This is where English comprehension and expression become critical. Even if they grasp the concept, articulating a valid reason in English can be challenging.

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

*   **Misunderstanding of "important in real life":** Students might not grasp the abstract nature of "real life importance" and struggle to bridge the gap between a story and personal relevance. They might just reiterate the questions without providing a "why."
*   **Recalling the King's Questions (Carry-over Error):** If a student couldn't answer the "What were the three questions" (50% pass rate), they are highly unlikely to be able to answer this question correctly either, as it builds upon that knowledge. This immediately eliminates a large portion.
*   **Limited English Expression:** Even if they understand *why* the questions are important, many students from this demographic struggle with constructing coherent sentences and paragraphs in English. They might provide fragmented thoughts, single words, or incomplete sentences that don't fully articulate a valid reason according to the rubric.
    *   *Example of a failed attempt due to poor English/incomplete thought:* "Yes it helps good decisions." (Might not score 1 due to lack of specificity/development).
    *   *Example:* "Yes king important" (Insufficient reason).
*   **Irrelevant Answers:** Students might understand "important" but then just write something generic about the king or the story, without directly linking it to the utility of *those specific questions*.
*   **Lack of Attempt/Blank Answers:** Students who find the "connect to real life" too abstract or their English too limiting might leave it blank, as seen in other items.
*   **Vague/Circular Reasoning:** "Yes, it is important because it is important to know."
*   **Simply answering "Yes" without a reason:** Many will get "yes," but fail on the "give one reason" part due to either difficulty articulating or not understanding that the "yes" itself is not the full answer.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources...** This requires definition recall and categorization. Our question here needs critical thinking, not just recall.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season."** This is a creative, personal response, allowing for simpler English. While this question asks for a "reason," it's not "free" like "favorite season." It's constrained by the king's questions. The quality of written English required for a valid *reason* might be higher. The "Winter / Sweater" example scored 3, suggesting even very simple English can pass. However, a "reason" often requires more logical connection than just listing attributes.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is pure recall from the passage. Our current question requires taking *those questions* and then applying them to "real life" with a justification. The 50% for recalling them indicates a significant barrier *before* even getting to the critical thinking step.

**Revised thought process:**

Given that only 50% can accurately *recall* the questions, it's highly improbable that many more will then be able to successfully make the abstract connection *and* articulate a reason in sufficient English. Those who struggle with recall likely won't even attempt the second part meaningfully.

*   Roughly 50% will struggle with *identifying* the questions.
*   Of the remaining 50% who might know the questions, a significant portion will struggle with the abstract "real-life importance" and/or the English required to formulate a coherent "reason." The "favorite season" example (30% pass rate) suggests that short, list-like answers can score, but giving a *reason* for importance often needs more cohesive thought. A simple "Yes it helps us make good decisions" would score 1, which isn't a very high bar for language.
*   The hurdle here is mainly *comprehension of the task* (abstracting importance + providing a reason) coupled with *linking
