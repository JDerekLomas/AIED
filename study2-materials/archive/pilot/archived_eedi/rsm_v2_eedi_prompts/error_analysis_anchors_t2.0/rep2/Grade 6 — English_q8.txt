This question tests basic sentence structure in English. Given the demographic and average pass rates for similar questions, let's break down the potential student performance.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

*   **Grammar/Syntax Misconceptions (Major Factor):**
    *   **Incorrect word order:** Many students will struggle with the SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure common in English, especially if their native languages have different common word orders. They might prioritize other patterns, or just try to put words together somewhat randomly.
    *   **Misplacing articles/prepositions:** 'a' might be placed incorrectly.
    *   **Subject-verb inversion:** Some might put "Is he reading a book?" (turning it into a question) or "Reading a book is he."
    *   **Missing or adding words (less likely here as it's rearranging):** While not adding words, they might simply list the words without making a cohesive sentence.

*   **Vocabulary/Meaning Misunderstanding (Minor Factor):**
    *   The words are very basic: "book," "reading," "is," "he," "a." It's highly unlikely that a Class 6 student would not know the individual meanings of these words.
    *   The overall meaning is straightforward ("He is reading a book."). The difficulty is in forming the *sentence*, not understanding the *concept*.

*   **Language Transfer:** Students' first languages might have very different sentence structures. For example, some Indian languages might place the verb at the end of the sentence, or use postpositions instead of prepositions/articles in a similar way, which could lead to confusion.

*   **Attempt Rate:** Almost all students will attempt this. It's short, uses familiar words, and appears accessible. The challenge will be in getting the *correct* order.

*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   "He reading is a book." (Common error with verb placement)
    *   "Reading a book he is." (Misplaced subject, or an attempt at "a book he is reading")
    *   "A book he is reading." (This is a grammatically plausible, though less common, construction for emphasis, but probably not the *intended* standard SVO answer for "make a meaningful sentence". Depending on the strictness of marking, it *could* be considered correct if it's explicitly "meaningful," but typically these questions look for the most direct SVO.) Given the context of a basic grammar test, it would likely be marked wrong if the desired answer is "He is reading a book."
    *   "Is he reading a book?" (If they incorrectly make it a question)
    *   Simply listing the words: "book reading a is he" or "he is reading book a."

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, deeper comprehension, and nuanced English expression. Much harder.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate sources with examples):** Requires understanding two concepts, distinguishing them, recalling examples, and articulating both clearly. Much harder.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on favorite season):** Requires generating content, structuring multiple sentences into a paragraph, using appropriate vocabulary, and adhering to specific prompts (what to do, eat, wear). More complex English output than sentence rearrangement.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Requires recalling specific facts from a story and listing them. This is largely about memory and recognition, not complex sentence formation. This question is arguably closer, as it requires retrieving and perhaps phrasing information correctly. Students might remember parts but struggle to form complete sentences if their English is weak. The provided question "the right time to do everything, the right thing to do and the right people to work with he will nev" shows students getting the core info but struggling with full grammatical completeness, still scoring 1.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Name two Fundamental Rights):** Similar to the 50% anchor, this is recall. Students need to remember the *names* of the rights. The wording of the rights themselves might be complex, but simply naming them is simpler. The example "Viser to epumat" shows a struggle with complex words, leading to a 0. If they can recall two basic rights, it's easier.

**Conclusion for this specific question:**

The task is to rearrange 5 very common words into a standard English sentence. It directly tests foundational English grammar.

*   Compared to the 30% anchor, it's much simpler. Students don't need to generate ideas or form a paragraph, just order existing words.
*   Compared to the 50% and 66% anchors, it doesn
