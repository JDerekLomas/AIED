I will analyze the question, rubric, and calibration anchors to estimate the pass rate.

**Question Breakdown:**
*   "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan"
*   "and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."

**Key Challenges for Students:**

1.  **Recall Specific Resources for Rajasthan:** Rajasthan is a specific Indian state. Students need to know at least two resources particular to its geography (e.g., desert, mineral-rich areas). General resources like "trees" or "air" might be correct but not specific enough if not framed in the context of their importance/uniqueness to Rajasthan.
2.  **Explanation of Influence:** This is the more complex part. Students need to connect a resource to a *consequence* or *impact* on human lives. This requires a bit of cause-and-effect reasoning.
3.  **Language (English):**
    *   "Mention": List or name.
    *   "Natural Resources": Might be translated or understood, but the specific examples need to be recalled.
    *   "Influences the lives of the people": Requires articulating a relationship.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

*   **Incorrect Resources:**
    *   Listing resources not found in Rajasthan (e.g., rice, rubber).
    *   Listing man-made resources.
    *   Listing resources that are too generic and don't highlight Rajasthan's specific context (though technically correct, they might miss the *spirit* of the question for full credit, especially if the explanation isn't strong).
*   **Poor Explanation of Influence:**
    *   Simply stating the resource without explaining *how* it influences lives.
    *   Vague explanations ("it's important").
    *   Misunderstanding the impact (e.g., saying water makes them swim, rather than irrigate crops).
*   **Language Barrier:**
    *   Difficulty expressing the connection between the resource and its influence in grammatically correct and understandable English.
    *   Trouble with vocabulary related to natural resources and their uses (e.g., mining, irrigation, drought, electricity generation).
*   **Partial Answers:** Many students might get one part right but miss the other:
    *   List two resources but fail to explain influence.
    *   List one resource and explain, but miss the second resource.
    *   List a resource and give a very poor or incorrect explanation.
*   **Not Attempting/Blank:** As seen in anchors, this is a significant factor.
*   **Misunderstanding "natural resources":** Some might list cities, crops (without mentioning soil/water as resources), or animals without linking them to being a *resource*.

**Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"Theme of poem" (5%):** Requires abstract thinking and interpretation of text. This question is more factual recall and simple explanation.
*   **"Differentiate sources" (15%):** Requires definitions and examples, comparing two concepts. This is closer, involving definitions/examples (resources) and a simple explanation. The 'differentiation' aspect of that question is perhaps harder than the 'explanation' here.
*   **"Favorite season" (30%):** Requires writing a paragraph on a personal topic with some structure. This involves basic writing skills and personal reflection, which can be easier than factual recall and logical explanation.
*   **"King's three questions" (50%):** Direct recall of a specific detail from a story. This question also requires recall (resources) but adds an explanatory component. Many would remember some details, hence 50%.
*   **"Fundamental Rights" (66%):** Direct recall of common Civics knowledge. High pass rate suggests this is relatively simple memorization.

**Hypothesized Student Responses and Scoring (based on rubric, max 1 mark):**

*   **0 Marks:**
    *   Blank.
    *   Incorrect resources/no explanation.
    *   Lists one resource, no explanation.
    *   Vague or entirely wrong explanation despite naming resources.
*   **1 Mark:**
    *   Two correct resources named AND a reasonable explanation for one's influence (even if grammatically flawed but understandable).
    *   *Example: "Rajasthan has marble and salt. Marble is used to build houses."* (Simple but correct)
    *   *Example: "Water and solar energy. Water is less in Rajasthan so people have to save it and irrigate less land."* (Good explanation for a limited resource's influence)

**Revisiting the Rubric's leniency:** "Max score: 1" and the listed resources (water, Marble, Copper, Sandstone, Gypsum, mica, limestone,
