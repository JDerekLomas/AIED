Here's an analysis of the question and likely student errors, leading to the estimated pass rate:

**Analysis of the Question:**

*   **Content:** Social Science (Geography/Economics related to Indian states). It requires specific factual knowledge about Rajasthan's rural economy.
*   **Cognitive Demand:** Low-to-medium. It requires recall of facts and a brief descriptive sentence for one.
*   **Language Complexity:** Simple and direct ("main occupations," "rural areas," "Rajasthan," "describe in brief"). No complex sentence structures or vocabulary.
*   **Familiarity:** Rajasthan is a prominent Indian state. The concept of "occupations" is basic. "Rural areas" is a common term.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Lack of Specific Knowledge (Core Issue):**
    *   Many students, especially if not directly from Rajasthan or taught extensively about its specifics, might lack the precise knowledge. They might know general Indian rural occupations but fail to specify for Rajasthan or pick the *main* ones.
    *   **Common wrong answers:** Naming generic jobs (e.g., "labor work," "shopkeeping") that exist everywhere but aren't necessarily the *main* distinguishing occupations of rural Rajasthan. Some might mention tourism but that's more urban/specific pockets, not the *main* rural occupation.

2.  **General vs. Specific (Subtlety):**
    *   The question asks for "main occupations *of people in rural areas of Rajasthan*." Students might give occupations of India generally, or simply "farmer" without qualifying for Rajasthan, or only one occupation when at least two are implicitly asked for by "main occupations" and "describe any one."

3.  **Language Misunderstanding (Less Likely for this question):**
    *   "Occupations": This term should be generally understood as "jobs" or "work."
    *   "Rural areas": Likely understood as villages/countryside.
    *   "Describe in brief": Simple instruction, likely understood as a short explanation.

4.  **Attempt vs. Failure:**
    *   Most students will attempt this question. They know what jobs are. Even if they don't know specifically for Rajasthan, they will try to write *something* related to farming or labor.
    *   Failure will primarily stem from providing inaccurate or overly generic answers that don't meet the "main occupations in rural Rajasthan" criteria. For instance, just "farming" (correct but only one) or "labourer" (too general and not necessarily a *main* distinct occupation in the way agriculture is).

5.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   Listing "farming" (correct but only one, if not paired with another)
    *   Listing very general labor work ("mazdoori") or small businesses without being specific enough.
    *   Mentioning things like "mining" or "tourism" which are relevant to Rajasthan but not the *main* occupations of the *general rural population*.
    *   Completely unrelated occupations or a blank response due to lack of knowledge.

**Calibration Comparison:**

*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** This requires conceptual understanding, examples, and differentiating. Many might understand the general idea but struggle with articulation or specific examples. The current question requires recall and brief description.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Write a short paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This is a personal creative writing task, which gives students more freedom. However, the quality of English writing often limits scores, as seen in the examples. This question is factual and less reliant on sustained good English writing, just correct recall.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?):** This requires recall of specific details from a story, similar to recalling facts about Rajasthan. Many students are likely familiar with popular stories.

**Synthesizing and Estimating:**

The question asks for specific factual recall for a particular region (Rajasthan). While agriculture is a common response across India, distinguishing other *main* occupations specific to rural Rajasthan (like animal husbandry/pastoralism, handicrafts specific to rural areas) might be challenging for students who haven't specifically studied it.

Students will attempt this because the language is simple. Many will write "farming" (correct but possibly not sufficient for two) and then struggle for a second specific and main occupation for Rajasthan. Those who can name "animal husbandry" or specific handicrafts (even if vague like "handicrafts") alongside farming would score.

Given that it's specific factual recall, similar to the "king's questions" but about geography/economy rather than a common story, the pass rate might be lower than the 50% one if the specific second occupation (
