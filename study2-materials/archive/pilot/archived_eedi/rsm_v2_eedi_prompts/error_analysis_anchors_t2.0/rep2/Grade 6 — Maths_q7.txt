## Analysis of Likely Errors for Temperature Question:

This question tests basic time calculation and multiplication/addition. Given the context of Class 6 students from economically weaker sections with limited English, several types of errors are highly probable.

**1. Misconceptions about Mathematics:**

*   **Time Calculation Difficulty:** This is the most significant hurdle.
    *   **Counting on fingers incorrectly:** Students might count `10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4` and miscalculate `6` hours. A common mistake would be to just subtract `4-10` directly (if they understand negative numbers) or simply get confused by the switch from `am` to `pm` and `12` as the transition point.
    *   **Ignoring the 12 o'clock transition:** They might subtract `10` from `16` (if they understand `4` pm as `16:00` in 24-hour format), but that's a higher-level concept. More likely, they will just get confused with `12`.
    *   **Simple subtraction mistake:** Even if they recognize `10` am to `12` pm is `2` hours and `12` pm to `4` pm is `4` hours, adding `2+4` might be an error-prone step for some.
*   **Multiplication Error:** Once they have the hours (`6`), multiplying by `2` might lead to errors if their basic multiplication facts are weak. (e.g., `6 * 2 = 10` or `14` instead of `12`).
*   **Addition Error:** Adding the initial temperature `30` to the increase (`12`) might result in errors. (`30 + 12 = 40` or `41`).
*   **Order of Operations/Missing Steps:** Some might correctly calculate the increase (`12`) but forget to add it to the initial temperature. Conversely, they might only provide the initial temperature or just the time elapsed.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Increases by 2^0 C per hour":** "Per hour" might be interpreted literally as only for *one* hour, or misunderstood entirely.
*   **"4:00 in the evening":** "Evening" clearly means `pm`, but combined with the numerical `4`, the change from `am` to `pm` could be confusing. "Morning" (10 am) and "evening" (4 pm) are clear, but the intervening hours (especially `12` pm) are the critical points.
*   **"What will be the temperature":** Straightforward, but if the preceding calculations are incorrect, the answer will also be.

**3. Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**

*   Most students will likely attempt this question because it involves numbers and a real-world scenario. The difficulty is in getting all the steps correct.
*   Partial attempts are highly likely:
    *   Correctly calculating `6` hours but wrong subsequent math.
    *   Correctly calculating `2^0 C * 6 hours = 12^0 C` but failing to add it to the initial `30^0 C`.
    *   Simply providing an initial temperature or a random guess.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **`32^0 C` (if they only consider 1 hour or make a quick guess).**
*   **`30^0 C` (if they don't do any calculations or misunderstand "increases").**
*   **`40^0 C`, `41^0 C`, `43^0 C`, `44^0 C` (due to multiplication/addition errors, especially `6*2=10` leading to `30+10=40`).**
*   **`12^0 C` (correct increase, but not added to the initial temperature).**
*   **`6^0 C` (just the number of hours).**
*   **A completely unrelated number.**
*   **Blank/No attempt (though less likely than incorrect attempts).**

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain"** - Very high-level conceptual understanding, abstract. Our question is concrete math.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiating archaeological vs. literary sources** - Requires factual recall AND understanding of differences with examples. More complex conceptual and recall than our question.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Paragraph on "My favorite season"** - Creative writing, grammar
