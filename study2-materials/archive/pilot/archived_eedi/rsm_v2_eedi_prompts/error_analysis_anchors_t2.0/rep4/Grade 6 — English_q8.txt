This question assesses basic sentence structure in English, specifically Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order. Given the calibration anchors and student profile, let's break down potential errors and estimate the pass rate.

**Likely Errors and Considerations:**

1.  **Limited English Proficiency:** Many students, especially from EWS backgrounds, might have limited exposure to spoken and written English outside of school. Their internal grammatical rules might be influenced by their native languages, which might not strictly follow SVO.

2.  **Vocabulary Recognition:** All words ("book," "reading," "a," "is," "he") are common and should be recognizable. Vocabulary is unlikely to be a barrier here.

3.  **Basic Sentence Structure Understanding:** This is the core challenge.
    *   **Subject Identification:** "He" is clearly the subject, but some might struggle to place it first if their native language allows more flexibility.
    *   **Verb-Auxiliary Verb Confusion:** "is reading" is the verb phrase. Students need to understand "is" acts as an auxiliary here.
    *   **Article Placement:** "a book" needs "a" before "book."
    *   **Prepositions/Articles:** While "a" is an article, misunderstanding its role and placement is a potential error.

4.  **Attempt vs. Failure to Attempt:** Given the simplicity of the words and the explicit instruction ("Rearrange... to make a meaningful sentence"), most students will attempt this. However, many might fail to produce the *correct* meaningful sentence.

5.  **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   **Verb-Subject Order:** "Is he reading a book?" (interrogative structure, common confusion for non-native speakers struggling with declarative sentence formation). This would be incorrect for "making a meaningful sentence" in a declarative context.
    *   **Random Orderings:** "Book is he reading a," "Reading a book he is," etc. – indicating a lack of understanding of English word order.
    *   **Incomplete Sentences:** Less likely, as all parts are given, but some might only put a few words together if they completely don't understand.
    *   **Misplacing 'a':** "He is reading book a."
    *   **Ignoring 'is':** "He reading a book." (More common error in spoken English among non-natives)

6.  **Comparison to Anchors:**
    *   **Pass Rate 50% ("What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"):** This requires recalling specific information from a text. Our question requires applying a fundamental linguistic rule. Both are relatively straightforward if the base knowledge is there. However, *recall* (50%) is often easier than *application of a rule* if the rule isn't internalized.
    *   **Pass Rate 66% ("Name any two Fundamental Rights..."):** This is a factual recall. If taught, many students will likely get this right. It doesn't involve complex understanding of English structure.
    *   **Pass Rate 30% ("Write a short paragraph on 'My favorite season'"):** This involves creative writing, sentence construction, and idea generation, making it much harder. Our question is constrained.

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

*   **Low Barrier for Individual Words:** All words are common.
*   **Fundamental Skill:** Rearranging words to form a simple SVO sentence is a very basic skill tested relatively early in English language learning. However, for students from disadvantaged backgrounds with limited exposure, this *fundamental* skill might still be underdeveloped.
*   **Cognitive Load:** The sentence is short and doesn't introduce complex tenses or vocabulary. The main task is order.
*   **Prevalence of SVO:** English is a fairly strict SVO language. While some might make common errors (like "Is he reading a book?" or dropping "is"), a significant portion, having studied English for several years by Class 6, should have encountered and practiced this.
*   **Contrast with Creative/Recall:** It's more demanding than mere factual recall but less demanding than creative writing or in-depth textual analysis.

I expect a significant proportion to get this right because the sentence is short and comprises highly familiar words, and the SVO order is central to basic English instruction. Errors will largely stem from *not fully internalizing* this basic grammatical rule rather than a complete lack of understanding or vocabulary issues. Compared to the 50% anchor, which involves recalling specific plot points, arranging a very simple sentence *should* be somewhat easier, or at least comparable, for a cohort at this level who have had some basic English instruction. Many schools would explicitly teach SVO as "Subject + Verb + Object."

However, the "Average pass rate is about 29%" overall is a
