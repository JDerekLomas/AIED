Students in Class 7 from economically weaker sections with limited English skills will likely struggle with transforming active voice to passive voice, especially given the historical context of their exposure to such grammar concepts. The average pass rate is 29%, so complex grammatical transformations will likely be lower.

Here's an analysis of potential errors:

*   **Misconceptions about English grammar/Passive Voice:**
    *   **Lack of conceptual understanding:** Many students might not explicitly understand what "active voice" or "passive voice" means. Even if taught, the application might be weak due to rote memorization rather than conceptual grasp.
    *   **Confusion with other tenses:** They might incorrectly change the tense while attempting the transformation. For example, "The leaves are blown away" or "The leaves blew away."
    *   **Incorrect auxiliary verb:** Difficulty choosing the correct form of "to be" (were instead of was/is/are). Since "leaves" is plural and the original is past tense, "were" is required.
    *   **Incorrect past participle:** "Blown" is an irregular verb. Students might incorrectly use "blowed." This is a very common error with irregular verbs.
    *   **Missing or misplaced "by the wind":** They might omit "by the wind" entirely, or place it incorrectly in the sentence. While "The leaves were blown away" is technically passive, for a full transformation, "by the wind" is generally expected in early learning. However, the rubric might consider "The leaves were blown away" as correct if the primary focus is the main structure. Given it's a 1-point question, partial credit is unlikely for this type of grammatical transformation, so they would likely need the complete, grammatically sound sentence.
    *   **Word order confusion:** Simply rearranging the words without understanding the grammatical rules, e.g., "Away the leaves the wind blew."

*   **Language misunderstandings:**
    *   The prompt itself ("Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice") might be challenging to fully comprehend if they are unfamiliar with the terminology.
    *   Understanding the vocabulary within the sentence ("wind," "blew," "leaves," "away") is likely not an issue.

*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   Most students will likely attempt the question, even if their attempt is flawed. Grammar questions are often seen as "fill-in-the-blank" or "rearrangement" types, encouraging an attempt rather than leaving it blank, unlike an essay where they might struggle to start.
    *   Some might write the original sentence again if they don't know how to change it, or just reverse the subject and object without other changes.

*   **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   "The leaves blowed away by the wind." (Incorrect past participle)
    *   "The leaves are blown away by the wind." (Incorrect tense)
    *   "The leaves was blown away by the wind." (Subject-verb agreement error with auxiliary)
    *   "The leaves blown away by the wind." (Missing auxiliary verb)
    *   "The leaves blew away the wind." (Completely incorrect structure)
    *   Simply swapping "wind" and "leaves": "The leaves blew the wind away."

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **5% item (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, inference, and articulation, which is very hard for this group. Grammar rules are more concrete.
*   **15% item (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires recall of definitions and examples, often memorized, but also an understanding of the difference. The examples provided suggest a partial understanding.
*   **30% item ("My favorite season" paragraph):** Requires creative writing and organization, but with a simple topic. Pass implies basic sentence formation but often with significant grammatical errors, as seen in the samples.
*   **50% item (King's three questions):** Straight recall of factual information from a text. Requires good comprehension but not complex synthesis. The answers show they remember parts but struggle with complete recall.
*   **66% item (Fundamental Rights):** Pure recall of two memorized facts. Highest pass rate for this reason.

The question "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice" requires not just recall of rules, but the *application* of multiple rules simultaneously (tense, auxiliary verb, past participle, agent phrase). This is more complex than simple recall but less abstract than interpreting a poem's theme or generating an organized paragraph. It's similar in cognitive demand to the "differentiate" question, but perhaps a bit harder because grammar transformation has more pitfalls in a single correct answer. The issue of irregular verbs ("blow/blew/blown") is a significant trap.
