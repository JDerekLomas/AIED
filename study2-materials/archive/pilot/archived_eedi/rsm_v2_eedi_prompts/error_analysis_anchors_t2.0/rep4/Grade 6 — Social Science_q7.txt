Let's break down the likely student performance on this question.

**Analysis of the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Difficulty:** This is a Social Science question testing knowledge of geography/resources specific to Rajasthan, combined with an understanding of impact. It requires both factual recall and a basic level of analytical thought.
*   **Keywords:** "natural resources," "Rajasthan," "explain how one of them influences the lives of the people."
*   **Rubric:** Fairly generous. Two resources are needed for the first part (but the max score is 1, implying partial credit might not be granted, or if it is, the 'pass' threshold needs two resources AND an explanation). *Self-correction: The max score being 1 means the whole task needs to be completed correctly for a "pass." Students need both parts correct.*

**Likely Errors and Performance Factors:**

1.  **Lack of Specific Knowledge (Rajasthan):**
    *   Many students might know "natural resources" generally (e.g., water, air, soil), but not specifically what's *prominent* in Rajasthan.
    *   They might list resources common across India, but not particular to Rajasthan (e.g., "forests" when Rajasthan is largely arid).
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "Water, soil, trees." (Could be right for water and sometimes soil, but often too generic).
    *   **Misconception:** Thinking generic resources apply everywhere with equal significance.

2.  **Difficulty with "Influence Lives":**
    *   This requires a slightly more abstract thinking than simple recall. Students need to link a resource to a direct impact on people's daily activities, economy, or lifestyle.
    *   They might list a resource but fail to explain its influence, or give a very weak, unconvincing explanation.
    *   **Example Failure:** "Water is important." (Not explaining *how* it influences lives in Rajasthan, e.g., scarcity leading to specific water conservation practices, agriculture being dependent on limited sources, etc.).
    *   **Language Barrier:** Explaining "influence" requires specific vocabulary and sentence structure, which can be challenging for students with limited English.

3.  **Partial Knowledge / Incomplete Answers:**
    *   Some might correctly identify two resources but completely miss the "explain influence" part. Given the rubric, this would likely lead to a 0.
    *   Others might get one resource right and then struggle with the second or the explanation.

4.  **No Attempt/Misunderstanding the Question:**
    *   Some might find the question too difficult due to lack of knowledge about Rajasthan's geography or the analytical component, leading to no response or a very off-topic answer.
    *   **Connection to Calibration Anchors:**
        *   The 5% "Theme of the poem" is abstract. Our question is less abstract but still requires *some* analytical explanation beyond recall.
        *   The 15% "Differentiate archaeological/literary sources" requires two distinct facts and a differentiating thought. Our question similarly asks for two facts *and* an explanation.
        *   The 30% "Favorite Season" is highly personal and relatively easy, but requires a structured paragraph. Our question is factual but requires structuring the answer to explain an influence.
        *   The 50% "King's questions" is pure recall. Our question is part recall, part explanation.
        *   The 66% "Fundamental Rights" is direct recall. Our question is definitely harder than this.

**Estimating Performance:**

*   **Direct Recall (Resources):** Many students will be able to name *some* natural resources. Identifying two specific to Rajasthan that are commonly known (like water scarcity, marble, maybe sand) might be achievable for a segment.
*   **Explanation of Influence:** This is where the pass rate will drop significantly. Connecting a resource (especially one specific to Rajasthan, like water or marble) to a coherent explanation of its influence on daily life requires a good grasp of the subject matter and language.
    *   For example, explaining water's influence might involve discussing droughts, agricultural practices, unique water harvesting systems, or impact on livelihoods.
    *   Explaining marble might involve quarrying, jobs, income, famous buildings, etc.
*   Given the "average pass rate about 29%" for the overall exam, and comparing it to the anchors:
    *   It's harder than simple recall (50% for "King's questions," 66% for "Fundamental Rights").
    *   It's comparable in complexity to "Differentiate between sources" (15%), which also requires two pieces of info and a distinguishing thought, but potentially slightly harder because "influence" can be open-ended for
