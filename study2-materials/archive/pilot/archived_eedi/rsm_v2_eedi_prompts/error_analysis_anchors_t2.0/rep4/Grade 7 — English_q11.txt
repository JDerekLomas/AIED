I'll analyze the question and calibrate my estimate based on the provided anchor items.

**Analysis of the Question:**
"Identify the adjective phrase in the sentence: A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony."

**Rubric:** The student correctly identifies "tiny" as an adjective.

**Key Issues for Class 7 Indian Government School Students (Limited English, Economically Weaker Sections):**

1.  **Understanding "Adjective Phrase":** This is the biggest hurdle.
    *   Many students might know what an adjective *is* (e.g., 'tiny' describes 'bird').
    *   However, the term "adjective *phrase*" implies more than a single word. A true adjective phrase modifies a noun and contains an adjective, but usually includes other words (e.g., "very tiny," "tiny but fast"). In this specific sentence, "tiny" itself acts as the adjective, but to call it an "adjective phrase" is a simplification or a slight misnomer in a more strict grammatical sense for a single word. The rubric clarifies that simply identifying "tiny" is sufficient, but the *question itself* asks for an "adjective phrase," which will confuse students.
    *   Students who are aware of the "phrase" part might look for something more complex, even though "tiny" is the expected answer per the rubric.
    *   Some might misinterpret "phrase" to mean *any* group of words, leading to answers like "in our balcony" (adverbial/prepositional phrase) or "a tiny bird."

2.  **Vocabulary/Grammar Knowledge:**
    *   "Adjective" is a fundamental part of speech, often taught in Class 6-7. Many students might have encountered it.
    *   "Phrase" might be less firmly understood, especially its distinction from a clause or simply an adjective.

3.  **Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**
    *   Most students will likely attempt this question because it asks for a specific identification, not a creative response.
    *   If they don't know "adjective phrase," they might guess based on familiar words or choose what they perceive as a "describing word."

4.  **Likely Errors/Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   **"In our balcony":** This is a very common type of "phrase" students might pick, often confusing prepositions and adjectives. They see a group of words describing "where."
    *   **"A tiny bird":** Identifying the entire noun phrase as the adjective phrase, failing to isolate just the descriptive element.
    *   **"Built its nest":** Focusing on the verb or action.
    *   **"Tiny bird":** Getting closer, but still including the noun.
    *   **Empty Response:** If they genuinely don't understand "adjective phrase."
    *   **Correctly identifying "tiny" by instinct:** Some might just pick the most obvious descriptive word, even if they aren't clear on "phrase."

**Calibration against Anchor Items:**

*   **5% "Theme of The Last Bargain":** This requires analytical thinking, synthesis, and expressing a abstract idea. Very hard.
*   **15% "Differentiate archaeological/literary sources":** Requires understanding two concepts and articulating differences with examples. Grammar and clarity are crucial. Hard.
*   **30% "My favorite season" (short paragraph, 6-8 lines):** This is a creative writing task within a specified length and with prompts. Many students can do *some* writing, but fulfilling all criteria with acceptable English to get a high score is challenging for the majority. Pass rate reflects partial credit given for even basic attempts ("Winter / Sweater" got 3/3 in example, suggesting high tolerance for errors, just content presence).
*   **50% "Three questions the king wanted to answer":** This is a direct recall question from a specific text. If they read the story and remembered, it's easy. If not, it's impossible. Higher success indicates reasonable reading comprehension among half the cohort.
*   **66% "Two Fundamental Rights":** Another direct recall question, likely from civics/social studies. This is often rote learned. If they memorized them, it's easy. It's a fundamental civics concept taught in these grades. This suggests that over half can recall specific factual information if taught directly.

**My Estimation Rationale:**

The key here is "adjective phrase" versus "adjective." The rubric explicitly says "student correctly identifies 'tiny' as an adjective." This simplifies the task considerably from what the question title might imply.

*   Many students *will* know "adjective" and can identify "tiny" as describing the bird.
*   The term "
