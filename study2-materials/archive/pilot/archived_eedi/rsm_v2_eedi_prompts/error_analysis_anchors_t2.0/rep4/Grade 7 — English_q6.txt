Let's break down the likely errors for the question "Describe the poet's writing style."

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

*   **Misunderstanding "writing style":** This is a relatively abstract concept, especially for students with limited English exposure. They might confuse it with:
    *   **The poet's *mood* or *feelings*:** (e.g., "The poet is sad," "The poet is happy") rather than *how* the poem is written.
    *   **The *story* or *content* of the poem:** (e.g., "The poem is about bargaining," "It's about happiness").
    *   **Literary devices without description:** They might say "figurative language" but not *describe* the style, or just list a device.
*   **Limited Vocabulary:** Even if they understand "writing style," they might lack the English vocabulary to describe it accurately. Words like "simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct," "figurative," "philosophical," "evocative" might be beyond their regular working vocabulary. They might struggle to find a precise adjective.
*   **Difficulty with Abstraction:** Indian government school students from economically weaker sections often have rote learning approaches and struggle with analytical or abstract questions that require higher-order thinking and sophisticated vocabulary. Describing a *style* is more abstract than recalling facts (like fundamental rights or parts of a story).
*   **Generic/Vague Answers:** They might try to answer but give extremely vague responses like "good," "nice," "easy to understand" which may not meet the "suitable and relevant" criteria for a full score. "Easy to understand" could sometimes pass, but depends on context.
*   **Translating Incorrectly:** They might try to translate a nuanced Hindi concept into English and lose precision.
*   **Attempt but Fail:** This is a strong possibility. Many students will *attempt* this question because it seems relatively short, but their attempts will likely be off-target due to the reasons above. Unlike an empty response, an attempt signals engagement but misunderstanding.
*   **Not Attempting:** Some students will likely leave it blank if they simply don't understand "writing style" or have no vocabulary to answer.

**Common Wrong Answers Would Look Like:**

*   "The poet talks about finding job." (Focus on content)
*   "Poet feels sad." (Focus on emotion)
*   "He is Rabindranath Tagore." (Irrelevant information)
*   "Good." / "Nice." / "Very beautiful." (Too vague, not descriptive of *style*)
*   "Simple." (Could be correct, but depends on poem and might be given without real understanding of what it means as a style)
*   "About freedom." (Theme, not style)

**Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% ("Write a theme or central idea..."):** This is abstract and requires analytical thought. Many students give irrelevant info or misunderstand "theme." "Writing style" is similar in abstraction level and requires even more specific vocabulary.
*   **Pass rate 15% ("Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..."):** This requires two distinct pieces of information and specific vocabulary. It's factual but requires differentiation, which is slightly higher order.
*   **Pass rate 30% ("Write a short paragraph on "My favorite season."..."):** This is more personal and requires sustained writing, but it's familiar. "Writing style" is less familiar.
*   **Pass rate 50% ("What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"):** This is a direct recall question, which many students can do even with limited English, by picking out keywords.
*   **Pass rate 66% ("Name any two Fundamental Rights..."):** Very direct recall of factual information, a common GK topic, thus higher pass rate.

**Conclusion:**

The question "Describes the poet’s writing style" is highly challenging due to its abstract nature and the need for specific, higher-level vocabulary. It demands analytical thought rather than mere recall. While "simple" might be accepted, discerning an appropriate adjective for *style* is harder than identifying a *theme* (5% anchor) or differentiating sources (15% anchor). Many students will attempt but fail due to misinterpretation or lack of vocabulary.

I expect the pass rate to be **lower** than the "differentiate" question (15%) because "style" is a more advanced concept than defining sources, and students generally struggle with this kind of abstract literary analysis. It's more complex than identifying a "theme" or "central idea," where simple rephrasing of the main point might pass. Here, you need to describe *how*
