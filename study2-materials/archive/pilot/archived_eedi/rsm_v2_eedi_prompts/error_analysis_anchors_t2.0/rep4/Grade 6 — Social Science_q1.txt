Let's break down the potential errors and student responses for "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."

**Likely Errors and Student Responses:**

1.  **Not knowing any mountain ranges (Failing to Attempt or Incorrect Guess):**
    *   Many students, especially from economically weaker sections, might have limited exposure to advanced geography beyond their immediate surroundings.
    *   They might have learned about them in class, but without sufficient reinforcement, recall could be poor.
    *   Some might simply leave it blank.
    *   Others might make a wild guess (e.g., name a river, a city, or a state).
    *   *Example wrong answer:* "Ganga river," "Delhi," "Rajasthan."
    *   *Prevalence:* High, similar to not knowing facts for history or science.

2.  **Knowing only one mountain range:**
    *   The **Himalayas** are by far the most prominent and frequently mentioned mountain range in India. It's very likely that if a student knows *any* range, they will know the Himalayas.
    *   Other ranges like Aravallis, Vindhyas, or Satpuras might be known, but less universally.
    *   *Example wrong answer (partial credit according to rubric):* "Himalayas" (if the rubric awards 0.5 for one, but 1 for two, which is slightly different here. Given the prompt is 0.5 max for "one correct mountain range", this is a strong partial. If the question implicitly asks for two but the rubric scores for one, this is key). *Given "Max score: 0.5" for "Names one correct mountain range", it implies they only need to name one for full credit if the full question's max score is 0.5, or for half credit if the question is worth 1. I will assume the prompt *wants* two, but full credit is given for *one*. This makes it a slightly easier question if that's the case. If it explicitly states 0.5 for *one* and there's another point for the *second*, it becomes a 1-mark question where getting one is 0.5.* I will proceed assuming *naming at least one* correctly gets 0.5 (full credit for *this* rubric segment).

3.  **Language Misunderstanding (Less likely to be a *primary* error here):**
    *   "Major" and "mountain ranges" are relatively straightforward English terms that are likely taught alongside geographical concepts.
    *   A student might misinterpret "major" as "largest" but this wouldn't typically lead to an incorrect name.
    *   They might confuse "mountain ranges" with "mountains" (e.g., Mt. Everest, Kanchenjunga), but even those are generally in the Himalayas, so it might not prevent them from listing a correct range if they know it.
    *   *Prevalence:* Low for this specific question, as the core vocabulary is basic geography.

4.  **Recalling an incorrect geographical feature:**
    *   Confusing mountain ranges with plateaus, plains, deserts, or rivers.
    *   *Example wrong answer:* "Deccan Plateau," "Thar Desert."

**Applying Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract understanding and articulation. Very difficult.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** Requires conceptual understanding, differentiation, and examples. Moderate difficulty.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on favorite season):** Requires creative writing, basic structure, and personal expression. Common ground for students, but writing a good paragraph is hard for some.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Requires specific recall of details from a story, likely taught in class. High recall, simple comprehension.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Name any two Fundamental Rights):** Specific factual recall. Relatively common knowledge from Civics/Social Science, though some details can be tricky. Getting *any two* increases the chance.

**Comparison to the current question:** "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."
Rubric: Max score 0.5 for naming one correct range. This simplifies it greatly to "Name at least one major mountain range in India."

*   This question is purely **factual recall** from geography.
*   It's comparable in type to "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66% pass rate) but potentially *slightly harder* if general geographical knowledge is less strong than basic civics or if students struggle to name *two* for full credit if the question implicitly asks for two despite the rubric
