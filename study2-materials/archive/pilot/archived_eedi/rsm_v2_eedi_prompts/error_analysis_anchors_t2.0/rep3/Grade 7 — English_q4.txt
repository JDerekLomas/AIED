This question is simpler than many of the calibration anchors, specifically the higher pass-rate ones, as it doesn't require a deep understanding of complex literary themes or precise historical differentiation.

**Analysis of Errors:**

*   **Misconceptions about English:**
    *   **"Do you think..." vs. Factual Recall:** Some students, especially those struggling with English comprehension, might focus solely on recalling information about the *king's questions* rather than engaging with the "Do you think... Give one reason" part. They might just list the questions without providing a reason for their importance in real life.
    *   **Difficulty with "real life":** While a common phrase, some might struggle to connect the abstract idea of the king's questions to their personal or observable reality. They might struggle to articulate a relevant "reason."
    *   **Syntactic errors/poor sentence structure:** Even if they have the right idea, expressing a coherent "reason" in English can be challenging. Many correct answers might be grammatically imperfect but still convey a valid point.
    *   **Vocabulary limitations:** Finding the right words to explain *why* these questions are important could be an obstacle.
*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **Understanding "important":** Most students at this level would likely understand "important."
    *   **Understanding "reason":** They should also understand "reason."
*   **Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**
    *   This is a "low-effort high-reward" question. Even if unsure, a student could write "yes" and attempt a very basic reason (e.g., "because it helps us"). This encourages attempts.
    *   However, if they struggled with the previous question about *what* the king's questions were (the 50% pass rate item), they might be completely lost here and leave it blank. Given the prompt that they know *what* the questions are (from the rubric), the challenge is primarily articulating *why* they are important.
*   **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   "Yes." (No reason provided)
    *   "Yes, because the king wanted to know them." (Circular reasoning, not linking to "real life.")
    *   "The king wanted to know what is the right time, right thing, right people." (Just reiterating the questions, no reason for *importance* in real life).
    *   Simple affirmation without a coherent reason, or a reason that is very vague or tangential.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%):** This question builds directly on that one. Students who answered that correctly are in a better position. Assuming they can *identify* the questions, this task is about abstract thought and articulation.
*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights..." (66%):** This requires factual recall but minimal explanation. Articulating a *reason* for the king's questions' importance is a slightly higher cognitive demand than just listing facts, but arguably simpler than explaining differentiating historical sources.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... My favorite season." (30%):** That required more extended writing and personal detail. This requires a single, concise reason.
*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15%):** This requires analytical thinking and specific factual knowledge, making it much harder.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" (5%):** Requires deep comprehension of literature and abstract expression, significantly harder.

**Conclusion:**

The question asks for a subjective opinion ("Do you think...") and requires a single reason. Students might struggle with articulating a *good* reason, but "yes" and even a very rudimentary justification ("because it helps to make good decisions") would likely score a point. The threshold for scoring 1 is likely low.

The prompt ensures students know the king's questions. The task is to connect them to "real life" importance. Given the low English proficiency, many might provide grammatically flawed but semantically correct answers.

It's easier than identifying themes (5%), differentiation (15%), or detailed paragraph writing (30%). It's comparable to or slightly easier than listing fundamental rights (66%), as it's more open-ended and forgiving of minor inaccuracies, relying less on perfect factual recall and more on common sense reasoning. However, articulating a *reason* for something's importance is slightly more demanding than simple recall. The slight jump from just recalling the questions (50%) to providing a simple reason suggests a pass rate between 50% and 66%. Many who struggle with articulation might provide very minimal answers that still pass the bar.

Given the average pass rate of
