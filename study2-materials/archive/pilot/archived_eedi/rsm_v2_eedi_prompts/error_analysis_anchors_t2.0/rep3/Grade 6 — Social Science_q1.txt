## Analysis of Likely Errors for "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."

This question assesses basic geographical knowledge of India. Given the student demographic and past performance on similar questions, here's an analysis of potential errors:

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science/Geography:**

*   **Lack of Specific Geographical Knowledge:** This is the most significant factor. Many students from weaker economic backgrounds, especially in rural areas, might not have been adequately exposed to or had the resources to learn specific geographical features like mountain ranges. Their curriculum might be theoretical or their learning environment might not include visual aids like maps frequently.
*   **Confusing with Rivers/Plateaus/Deserts:** Students might vaguely remember "big geographical features of India" and confuse mountain ranges with other prominent features like rivers (Ganga, Yamuna), plateaus (Deccan Plateau), or deserts (Thar Desert).
*   **Difficulty Differentiating "Major":** Even if they know a few mountains, they might struggle to identify *major* ones, though the rubric only requires naming *any* two, implying even lesser-known but still major ranges would be accepted if truly a mountain range. However, for a Class 6 student, *major* often implies those explicitly taught and emphasized.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Major":** While generally understood, some students might interpret "major" as requiring very specific, internationally renowned ranges, causing them to doubt less prominent but still "major" Indian ranges. However, this is less likely to be a significant barrier.
*   **"Located in India":** This is fairly straightforward, but in a multi-topic geography context, some might struggle to filter for India-specific features only. Unlikely to be a major error for this question specifically.

**3. Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**

*   **High Attempt Rate:** This is a direct recall question with a simple expected answer (a list of two names). Students are likely to attempt it even if unsure, often guessing. Unlike comprehension or writing tasks, there's less perceived effort barrier.
*   **"Blank Out":** For those who genuinely don't know, a blank response is possible, or a highly incorrect guess if they try to write *something*.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **Rivers:** Ganga, Yamuna, Brahmaputra. (Most likely)
*   **Deserts:** Thar Desert.
*   **Plateaus:** Deccan Plateau.
*   **Capital Cities/States:** New Delhi, Mumbai, Uttar Pradesh (if they completely misinterpret "major" and "location").
*   **General terms:** "hills," "big mountains" (without specific names).
*   **One correct, one incorrect:** E.g., "Himalayas and Ganga." This would get 0.5 points.

**Calibration against Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'"** This requires abstract thinking, literary interpretation, and a good grasp of English for expression. Much harder than naming.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each."** This requires understanding abstract historical concepts, comparative analysis, and examples. Significantly harder than naming mountains.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'"** This requires sustained writing, self-expression, and structured thought, but is familiar and less factual. More forgiving due to subjective nature.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"** This requires recall of specific details from a story, a relatively common type of question. If students paid attention to the story, this is a direct fact recall.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India."** This is the most comparable. It requires recall of two specific names from Civics. The names (e.g., Right to Equality, Right to Freedom) are longer and might be perceived as slightly more complex or formal than "Himalayas" or "Aravalli." However, Fundamental Rights are typically *heavily* emphasized in Civics education in India.

**Comparing to Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate):**

*   **Simplicity of names:** Mountain names like "Himalayas" are very common and visually distinct on a map. "Aravalli" or "Vindhya" are also relatively short and specific. "Right to Freedom" involves a concept and multiple words.
*   **Visual learning:** Geography, especially mountain ranges, is often reinforced through maps. Fundamental Rights are primarily abstract concepts.
