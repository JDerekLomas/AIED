ERRORS:

1.  **Language Misunderstanding (Ascending Order):** This is a primary concern given the student demographic. "Ascending order" might not be immediately understood.
    *   **Common error:** Arranging in descending order (highest to lowest) if they misinterpret "ascending" or simply remember one type of ordering without the specific instruction.
    *   **Common error:** Ordering based on the *first digit only* if they're not careful or understand the concept of place value thoroughly. E.g., `3367, 4799, 5492, 736` (because 7 is higher than 5, 4, 3, etc. This is less likely but possible for students with very weak conceptual understanding).
    *   **Common error:** Random arrangement due to complete lack of understanding of "ascending order."

2.  **Misconception about Place Value/Number Magnitude (Specifically with varying digit counts):** The inclusion of a three-digit number (`736`) among four-digit numbers is a key distractor/test of understanding.
    *   **Common error:** Overlooking `736` as the smallest because all other numbers are 'larger' (having more digits), but then incorrectly comparing 4-digit numbers. Or, students might be accustomed to questions with all numbers having the same number of digits. They might see `7` in `736` and automatically compare it to `3` in `3367` and incorrectly place it. This specific item tests if they understand that a three-digit number is always smaller than a four-digit number.
    *   **Common error:** Even if they identify 736 as smallest, they might struggle to correctly order the three four-digit numbers if their comparison skills are weak.

3.  **Attempt but Failure:** Most students will likely attempt this question. It's a standard mathematical operation taught early on. The failure will stem from misunderstanding the prompt ("ascending order") or misjudging the relative size of the numbers, especially the `736`.

4.  **Not Attempted:** Less likely for a basic ordering task, unless the student has very low confidence in English/Math or if they completely do not understand the words "arrange" or "ascending order." However, given the nature of the task (simply writing numbers), it's easy to make an attempt.

**Likely Common Wrong Answer Examples:**

*   **Descending Order:** `5492, 4799, 3367, 736` (Most plausible if they misunderstand "ascending"). This would *not* get the 0.5 for placing 736 first.
*   **Missing 736 initially or placing it incorrectly later:** `3367, 4799, 5492, 736` (if they compare first digits only, seeing 736 as 'biggest' first digit).
*   **Minor error in sorting the 4-digit numbers:** `736, 4799, 3367, 5492` (getting 736 correct but mixing up others).

**Analysis against calibration anchors:**

*   The question requires very little original writing or interpretation of complex text (unlike "The Last Bargain" theme or "Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources").
*   It's closer to the 50% "Three questions the king wanted to answer" or 66% "Fundamental Rights" in terms of direct recall/application, but requires numerical comparison rather than simple factual recall.
*   The hurdle is "ascending order" and the trap of the 3-digit number.
*   The fact that they only need to identify and place *one* number correctly (the smallest) for 0.5 marks significantly lowers the bar for partial credit compared to a full correct ordering. Many students who misinterpret "ascending" as "descending" would *not* get the point, but those who understand "smallest first" would.
*   Identifying the smallest number is generally easier than identifying all numbers and then sorting them perfectly. The `736` is visually distinct as the shortest number. Students might latch onto that first.

Considering these points, the most common mistake will be reversing the order due to "ascending order" misunderstanding or incorrectly placing the 3-digit number. However, identifying `736` as the smallest visually (it has fewer digits) is a fairly robust cue, even for weaker students.

Given that partial credit is awarded *solely* for identifying `736` and placing it first, this makes the task considerably easier. Even students who struggle with the full concept of "ascending order" might intuitively identify the
