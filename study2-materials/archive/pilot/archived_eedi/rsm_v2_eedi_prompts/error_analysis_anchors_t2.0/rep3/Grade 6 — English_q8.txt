The question requires rearranging five common English words to form a simple, grammatically correct sentence in the subject-verb-object (SVO) format.

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

*   **Understanding the Task:** The phrase "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence" is straightforward. Students are familiar with sentence formation from early English lessons.
*   **Vocabulary:** All words are extremely common (book, reading, a, is, he). There should be no vocabulary issues.
*   **Grammar/Syntax:** This is the core challenge.
    *   **Incorrect Subject-Verb Order:** A common mistake, especially when learning English, is to place the verb before the subject or to disrupt the SVO order.
    *   **Misplacing "a":** While "a book" is a common phrase, some might separate it or place "a" incorrectly (e.g., "reading a he is book").
    *   **Confusion with Auxiliary Verb:** Some might not correctly identify "is" as part of the continuous tense and might place it in an odd position (e.g., "book a he reading is").
    *   **Omitting words:** Very unlikely, given the simplicity of the task.
    *   **Incomplete sentences/Phrases:** Students might struggle to form a *complete* and *meaningful* sentence. For example, "Reading a book he is" or "A book he is reading" might be considered, which, while *partially* comprehensible, is not the most natural SVO construction expected from this type of question. However, the rubric explicitly states "He is reading a book." for a score of 1.
*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   "Reading a book he is." (Likely common, as students might focus on "reading a book" as a unit and then place "he is".)
    *   "He reading a book is." (Misplaced auxiliary verb).
    *   "Is he reading a book?" (While grammatically correct as a question, the instruction implies forming a declarative sentence. Given the simplicity, this would likely be considered incorrect as per the implied intent.)
    *   "A book he is reading." (This is grammatically okay but less natural than the target SVO, and likely not the target answer).
*   **Attempt Rate:** Almost all students will attempt this. It's too simple to leave blank, even for low-proficiency students.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 66% (Name two Fundamental Rights):** This requires specific factual recall but in a simple, short answer format. The vocabulary and concept (Fundamental Rights) might be specific to civics lessons but the answer format is very easy. This task, while about English grammar, involves even more common words and a very basic sentence structure, similar to tasks they'd practice frequently.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer?):** This requires understanding a story and recalling specific details. Similar to the 66% anchor, it's about factual recall.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Write a short paragraph on "My favorite season."):** This requires free-form writing, organization, and a broader vocabulary. The question here is much more constrained and simple.

The task of rearranging words into a basic SVO sentence is a fundamental skill taught early in English. Even students with limited English exposure would have practiced this form repeatedly. The challenge isn't vocabulary or understanding complex ideas, but basic grammatical structure.

Many students might get close but not precisely achieve the target "He is reading a book." However, the target is the *most natural* and *standard* English sentence construction. Students will often default to SVO when asked to form a sentence.

Given the commonality of the words, the simplicity of the SVO structure, and the repeated practice of such tasks in early English education, a substantial proportion of students, even with weak English skills, would be able to perform this. The target is one of the very first sentence patterns taught.

While some might struggle with the exact "He is reading a book" due to slight misplacement (e.g., "Reading a book he is"), the simplicity and basic nature push the success rate higher than a detailed recall question. The barrier here is structural accuracy, not content.

I'd place it higher than the "two fundamental rights" as it requires very fundamental pattern recognition rather than specific recall which might have varied teaching emphasis. It's almost a rote exercise.

Let's consider students with a 29% average pass rate. They pass *some* questions. Questions testing basic, mechanical understanding often fare better than those requiring abstract thought or extensive writing. This is a very mechanical question.

Estimating the percentage that would get "
