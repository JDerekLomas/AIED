Here's a thinking process to arrive at the estimated pass rate:

1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**
    *   "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan."
        *   Requires specific factual knowledge.
        *   Focuses on a particular state (Rajasthan).
    *   "Explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."
        *   Requires understanding of cause and effect/application.
        *   Again, specific to Rajasthan and its context.
        *   Implies a slightly more complex thought process than just naming.

2.  **Analyze the Rubric (Max score: 1):**
    *   The rubric indicates that even *partial* correctness can get a score of 1. "Mentions two correct natural resources..." implies that if they *only* mention two correct resources and don't explain, they *might* still get the point, depending on precise scoring rules. However, the question *asks* for an explanation, so ideally, both parts should be there.
    *   Given the other items (e.g., differentiate, write a paragraph), a single point for "mention two AND explain one" suggests a relatively lenient marking for a correct attempt.
    *   Examples provided are diverse (minerals, water, solar/wind). This gives students many options.

3.  **Consult Calibration Anchors & Identify Key Factors:**

    *   **"The Last Bargain" (5%):** Deep literary interpretation. Very hard.
    *   **"Archaeological vs. Literary" (15%):** Differentiating concepts, examples. Requires good recall and structured thinking. Many get 0 for empty or very vague responses.
    *   **"My Favorite Season" (30%):** Paragraph writing, personal experience. Relatively accessible in concept, but writing well is a challenge. Many get some score, even if partial.
    *   **"Three Questions" (50%):** Factual recall from a story. Simpler recall, but still needs precision. High chance of partial credit.
    *   **"Fundamental Rights" (66%):** Factual recall, direct answer. Most accessible as it's a core Social Science concept. High pass rate for naming *any two*.

4.  **Evaluate Question Difficulty against Anchors:**

    *   **Factual Recall (Resources):** This part is similar to "Fundamental Rights" (66%) or "Three Questions" (50%). Students *should* know some basic resources if they've studied Rajasthan's geography/economy. Common ones like "water," "minerals" (like marble or copper, for which Rajasthan is famous), or "sand" (desert state) come to mind immediately. Even "sunlight" (for solar) or "wind" could be valid. This part alone seems relatively easy.
    *   **Explanation of Influence:** This part is harder than mere recall. It's more akin to the "differentiate and give examples" (15%) or requiring a short explanation like in "My Favorite Season" (30%), though shorter.
        *   If they pick water, they could say "lack of water affects agriculture" or "people have to walk far for water."
        *   If they pick minerals (e.g., marble), they could say "provides jobs in mining/crafts" or "used for construction."
        *   If they pick sand/desert, they might talk about difficulties in farming, specific animals (camels), or tourism.

5.  **Predict Common Errors and Success Paths:**

    *   **Errors:**
        *   **Lack of Specific Knowledge:** Naming resources not found in Rajasthan, or generic resources not linked to the state.
        *   **One Resource Only:** Students might only remember one, failing to get the "two" requirement.
        *   **Generic Explanation:** Explaining *what* the resource is, rather than *how it influences lives*. For example, "Water is important" instead of "Water scarcity forces people to adopt drought-resistant crops."
        *   **No Explanation:** Naming two resources but failing to provide the explanation.
        *   **Language Barrier:** Difficulty articulating the explanation clearly in English, even if they know the concept in their local language. This is a significant factor given "limited English."
        *   **Non-attempt/Irrelevant Answer:** This happens, especially with complex questions or if the student hasn't studied the topic.
    *   **Success Paths:**
        *   Students who have studied Social Science/Geography for Rajasthan specifically will likely know a couple of key resources (water scarcity, various minerals, desert features).
        *   Even a simple, slightly clunky explanation could suffice given the "max score 1" and likely lenient marking
