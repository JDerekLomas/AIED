I will break down the thought process for estimating the pass rate for the given question.

**1. Understand the Target Audience and Context:**

*   **Class 6, Indian government schools:** This immediately signals limited exposure to English, particularly spoken/conversational English and higher-level comprehension/expression.
*   **Economically weaker sections:** Often implies less access to supplementary English learning resources, tutors, or an English-speaking environment outside school.
*   **Average pass rate ~29%:** This is a crucial baseline. It means most questions are challenging for them, and basic English proficiency is low.
*   **"The Last Bargain" poem:** This is a Rabindranath Tagore poem, typically taught in schools. Familiarity with the poem's content is assumed.

**2. Analyze the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"
*   **Rubric:** "Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why." (Max score: 1.5 - This is a simple binary correct/incorrect for practical estimation, assuming any reasonable mention counts).
*   **Key components required:**
    1.  **Identify a line from the poem:** Requires recalling/copying a line. This tests memory or transcription skill if the poem is provided. (Assuming the poem is provided or students have access).
    2.  **State *why* they like it:** This is the critical part, requiring some level of personal expression and explanation in English.

**3. Analyze Calibration Anchors and Infer Error Patterns:**

Let's look at the given calibration anchors to understand what kind of errors students make at different pass rate levels:

*   **5% Pass Rate (Theme/Central Idea):**
    *   *Errors:* Highly abstract concept, difficult to articulate in English. Misunderstanding "theme" vs. "summary" or just random thoughts related to the poem. Very few successful attempts, and even those are often fragmented.
    *   *Implication:* Expressing complex ideas or abstract concepts is extremely difficult for almost all students.

*   **15% Pass Rate (Differentiate Archaeological/Literary Sources):**
    *   *Errors:* Knowledge recall *plus* differentiation *plus* example. It's multi-layered. Students often provide incomplete definitions, fail to differentiate, or give irrelevant examples. Simple lists (e.g., "Archaeological sources | Literary") indicate an attempt at structure but often lack full articulation.
    *   *Implication:* Recalling factual information is hard. Articulating differences or complex relationships is even harder. Attempts are often terse, fragmented.

*   **30% Pass Rate (Paragraph on "My Favorite Season"):**
    *   *Errors:* Simple sentences, lists of words (e.g., "Winter, Sweater, Baju, Hot water"), very basic reasons. Focus is often on *what* they like, but not deep *why*. Sentence structure can be broken. The prompt *guides* them (what they like to do, eat, wear).
    *   *Implication:* Students *can* write short, simple sentences about personal preferences, especially when prompted with categories. Lack of coherence/flow. "Gever feali" shows spelling issues and phonetics attempts.

*   **50% Pass Rate (Three Questions the King Wanted to Answer):**
    *   *Errors:* Direct recall from a story. Some copy parts of sentences but may not extract the three distinct questions clearly or fully. The skill is mostly recall/transcription.
    *   *Implication:* Direct recall of information from a story is much easier. The English challenge is mainly transcribing accurately.

*   **66% Pass Rate (Name two Fundamental Rights):**
    *   *Errors:* Simple naming (e.g., "Right to equality", "Right to freedom"). A common source of errors is misspelling or confusing terms ("Viser to epumat"). Some might only list one.
    *   *Implication:* Direct recall of names/phrases is the easiest, especially for specific, known terms. The main hurdle is exact wording/spelling.

**4. Apply Error Analysis to the Target Question:**

"Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"

*   **Component 1: Denotes a line from the poem.**
    *   *Difficulty:* Similar to recalling facts (50% King's questions, 66% Fundamental Rights), but specific lines rather than general facts. Students *should* be able to locate and write a line if the poem is present, or recall one if they've memorized it (common in Indian schools). This part is relatively easy.
    *   *Potential Errors:* Misremembering the line, misspelling it, quoting a
