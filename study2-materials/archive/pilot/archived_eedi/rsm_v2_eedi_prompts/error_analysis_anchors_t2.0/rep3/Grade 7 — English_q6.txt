I will analyze the question, the target demographic, and the provided calibration anchors to estimate the pass rate.

**Question Analysis:** "Describes the poet’s writing style."
*   **Target skill:** Identifying and describing a characteristic of literary style. This requires reading comprehension, critical thinking (to infer style from an implied poem or a given context), and vocabulary to articulate the description.
*   **Difficulty:** This is relatively abstract. Students need to understand what "writing style" means and then extract that information from a text (which is not provided in this specific question, implying it's based on a poem previously read by students). Without the poem, I'm assuming it's from a well-known poet taught in Class 7 or a passage from a text where style would be an obvious point of discussion.
*   **Max score: 1** – This implies a single word or short phrase is sufficient.

**Target Demographic Analysis (Class 7, Indian government schools, EWS, limited English):**
*   **Limited English:** This is a major factor. While they can understand basic questions, complex or abstract vocabulary might be an issue. "Writing style" itself might be understood literally but not conceptually (e.g., they might think it refers to handwriting).
*   **Economically Weaker Sections:** Often means less exposure to English outside of school, less access to supplementary materials, and potentially less focus on nuanced literary analysis in a curriculum that prioritizes basic literacy.
*   **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This tells us the overall difficulty level of the exam. The calibration anchors confirm that conceptual understanding and articulate expression in English are major hurdles.

**Likely Errors and Considerations:**

1.  **Misunderstanding "writing style":**
    *   **Literal interpretation:** Students might describe the *handwriting* or the *format* (e.g., "neat," "ugly," "like a paragraph").
    *   **Confusing with genre/theme:** They might describe the poem's theme (e.g., "love," "happiness") or genre (e.g., "story," "poem") instead of the style of writing.
    *   **Describing the poet's personality:** (e.g., "The poet is good," "The poet is wise").
    *   **"Empty Response":** If they don't understand the question at all.

2.  **Lack of appropriate vocabulary in English:** Even if they grasp the concept of style, finding a single, appropriate English word like "simple," "descriptive," "evocative," "direct," "figurative" might be difficult. They might use an inaccurate or overly simplistic word.

3.  **Difficulty extracting style from text (if poem were present):** Analyzing how a poet uses language (sentence structure, word choice, imagery) to identify a style requires higher-order thinking which is challenging with limited language proficiency. Given the average pass rates, I don't expect most students to excel at abstract analysis.

4.  **"Attempt but fail" vs. "No attempt":** Given that "Empty Response" leads to 0, I expect many to *attempt* but get it wrong due to misunderstanding the question or lack of vocabulary.

**Calibration Anchors Comparison:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% ("Write a theme..."):** This is conceptually similar in abstractness (identifying "theme" vs. "writing style"). The examples show attempts but often tangential answers or simple descriptions rather than proper themes. This question, "Describes the poet's writing style," is *at least* as hard, if not harder, than identifying a theme. "Theme" is a common term. "Writing style" is slightly more abstract.
*   **Pass Rate 15% ("Differentiate...archaeological/literary"):** This requires definitions and examples, testing factual recall and basic explanation. It's more concrete than describing a writing style.
*   **Pass Rate 30% ("Write a paragraph on My favorite season"):** This is a personal response, requiring basic paragraph construction and self-expression, which is often easier as students can draw from personal experience.
*   **Pass Rate 50% ("What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"):** This is direct recall of facts from a story, usually a lower-level cognitive skill than inferring writing style.
*   **Pass Rate 66% ("Name any two Fundamental Rights"):** Direct recall of civics facts, again relatively straightforward if memorized.

**Initial Placement based on conceptual difficulty and abstractness:**
The question on "writing style" seems to align most closely with the difficulty of "theme or central idea," which has a 5% pass rate. Both require abstract thinking and appropriate vocabulary. "Writing style" might be marginally more complex than
