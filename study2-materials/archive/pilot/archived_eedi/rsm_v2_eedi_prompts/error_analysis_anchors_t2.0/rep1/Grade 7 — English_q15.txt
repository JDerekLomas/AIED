I'll break this down by first analyzing the question and then the likely student responses and errors.

**Analysis of the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Task:** Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'.
*   **Key Information Required:**
    1.  What is it?
    2.  When do you do it?
    3.  Why do you enjoy it?
*   **Format Constraint:** 4-5 sentences, a complete paragraph.
*   **Max Score:** 1 (Pass/Fail) - this means even a basic correct response is sufficient.

**Likely Errors and Student Behaviors (based on Calibration Anchors and general knowledge of this demographic):**

1.  **Sentence Structure/Grammar/Spelling Issues:** This is a pervasive issue evident in all the anchors, especially in more open-ended writing tasks. Students struggle with constructing grammatically correct sentences, subject-verb agreement, tenses, and spelling.
    *   *Example Error:* "My hobby is read book. I read every day after school. I enjoy very much this because I like stories." (Shows good content but poor grammar).
2.  **Paragraph Structure/Sentence Count:** The prompt specifically asks for 4-5 sentences in a paragraph. Students might:
    *   Write fewer than 4 sentences.
    *   Write a list of bullet points rather than connected sentences.
    *   Write too many sentences but still fail to articulate the 'why' or 'when'.
    *   *Example Error (like the 'My favorite season' pass rate 30% anchor):* "My hobby. Play cricket. Every evening. I like it." (Fails paragraph structure, too short).
3.  **Missing Components:** Students might mention the hobby but forget to include *when* they do it, or *why* they enjoy it, or express it so poorly that it's unclear.
    *   *Example Error:* "My hobby is playing cricket. I love to play cricket. I am happy when I play it." (Missing 'when').
    *   *Example Error:* "My favourite hobby is playing games on mobile phone. I play at night. It is fun." (Just about makes it for the content, but barely).
4.  **Limited Vocabulary/Expression:** The students often have a restricted English vocabulary, making it difficult to articulate nuances, especially for "why I enjoy it." They might resort to simple words like "fun," "good," "happy." This won't necessarily lead to a fail if the meaning is conveyed, but it will impact quality.
5.  **Difficulty with "Favourite":** While "favourite" is common, some students might struggle with identifying a *singular* favourite, or describing why *that specific one* is their favourite.
6.  **"Empty Response" / Non-Attempt:** As seen in anchors, a significant portion of students will leave the question blank or provide utterly incoherent responses, either due to lack of understanding, confidence, or time management. This typically accounts for a certain percentage of failures across most open-ended questions.
7.  **Misunderstanding "Hobby":** Though "hobby" is a fairly common word, some might interpret it more broadly than intended, leading to answers like "studying" or "sleeping," which might make it harder to fulfill the "why I enjoy it" criteria in a way that sounds authentic. However, if they follow the prompt, even these might score.

**Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 30% - "My favorite season" (6-8 lines):** This is the *most* similar anchor.
    *   *Differences:* The current question asks for 4-5 sentences, slightly shorter. "My favorite season" also had specific prompts for what they "eat or wear," whereas 'My Favourite Hobby' is about *activity* and *reason*.
    *   *Learnings from 30% anchor:* Many students could identify a favorite season but struggled with paragraph structure or hitting all the requested points while maintaining coherent English. The passing examples were basic, showing content, but very poor English in many cases ("Winter Sweater Baju Hot water Tea Gever feali Hat" → Score: 3 / "Rainy season is my favorite season. I am so enjoy the Rainy season. fastly Growing plants and " → Score: 3). The current question asks for "1" mark for success, meaning lower quality prose than what was allowed in the "3" mark 'My Favourite Season' would pass *if it fulfills the criteria*.

*   **Pass Rate 50% - "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?":** This was factual recall, simpler than original composition.
*   **Pass Rate 6
