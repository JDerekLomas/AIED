ERRORS analysis:
1.  **Lack of Specific Geographic Knowledge (Content Misconception):**
    *   Many students might know "mountains" exist in India, but struggle to name specific *ranges*. They might just say "North mountains" or "Southern hills" without providing a name.
    *   They might name a famous peak (e.g., Mount Everest, Kanchenjunga) instead of a *range*, although Everest is technically part of the Himalayas so if they mention it as part of a range it would be counted as correct.
    *   Confusion with other geographical features: They might name rivers, deserts, or plains.
    *   Confusion with international ranges if their general knowledge is not specifically India-focused (e.g., Alps, Andes). While this is unlikely given the context of "Class 6 students in Indian government schools," it's a possibility if they are simply recalling general geography facts without precise linkage to India.

2.  **Language Misunderstanding (Minimal impact):**
    *   The question is quite direct: "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India." The English is simple.
    *   "Major" might be overlooked, but generally, the well-known ranges are also the major ones.
    *   "Range" is the key word here, which might be slightly advanced for some, leading them to list individual mountains or just general "hills." However, the term "mountain range" is common in Social Science curriculum.

3.  **Attempt Rate vs. Success Rate:**
    *   This is a recall question based on factual knowledge from their geography curriculum. Most students will attempt it if they recognize the terms "mountain" and "India."
    *   Even if they only know one range (like the Himalayas, which are very prominent in Indian geography education), they might still get 0.5 points for naming one, or they might write the name of one mountain (peak) thinking it's a range.
    *   It's plausible many will know at least the Himalayas. The second range might be harder. Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, and the Ghats are also covered.

4.  **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   "Himalayas" (correct, but they need two for full points under the full rubric; for this 0.5-point question, it's sufficient for one)
    *   Listing one correct and one incorrect.
    *   Naming specific mountains/peaks within a range (e.g., "Kanchenjunga," "Nanda Devi") instead of the range itself. If the specific mountain is given but linked to the larger range (e.g., "Mount Everest in Himalayas"), it could be correct. However, if they just say "Mount Everest" that is technically a peak not a range.
    *   Listing cities, states, or rivers by mistake.
    *   Empty response if they genuinely don't know any.

**Pass Rate Analysis based on Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and expression. Very high cognitive load.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate sources):** Requires conceptual understanding, comparison, and example-giving. Medium cognitive load.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires personal expression, coherent writing, and adherence to specific prompts (what to do, eat/wear). Moderate cognitive and language load. Students can often write something, but coherence/detail drops it.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted):** Recall of specific details from a story. Similar to the current question in being fact-based recall, but for *three* specific items. The detail "three questions" guides them well.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Recall of two specific factual items. This is very close to the current question's structure: "Name any two X." The difficulty depends on the memorization effort for "Fundamental Rights" vs. "Major Mountain Ranges." Rights might be more emphasized in civics/political science.

**Comparison with "Fundamental Rights" (66% pass rate):**
*   "Fundamental Rights" is a core concept in civics and frequently reiterated in Indian education.
*   "Major mountain ranges" is a core concept in geography.
*   Both require recall of two specific named items.
*   The vocabulary "mountain ranges" is perhaps slightly more specific than just "rights."
*   However, geographical features are visually strong and easily reinforced by maps. The Himalayas are virtually universally known. Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, and the Western/Eastern Ghats are also common in state-level curricula.
