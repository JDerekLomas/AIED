### Analysis of likely errors for "The wind blew the leaves away" (Active to Passive Voice):

**1. Misconceptions about English/Grammar:**

*   **Difficulty identifying Subject/Object/Verb:** Many students from this demographic struggle with basic grammatical identification, which is fundamental to voice transformation. They might not clearly distinguish "the wind" as the subject, "blew" as the verb, and "the leaves" as the object.
*   **Lack of understanding of "passive voice":** This concept is often taught mechanically (e.g., "be verb + past participle") without a deep understanding of its purpose or structure. If students don't grasp the underlying principle of the object becoming the subject, they will fail.
*   **Incorrect tense of "to be" verb:** "Blew" is past tense. Students might forget to change "is/are" to "was/were." This is a very common error in past-tense passive voice transformations.
*   **Incorrect past participle:** The past participle of "blow" is "blown." Students might use "blowed," "blewed," or even just "blow." This is a significant hurdle for irregular verbs.
*   **Forgetting "by the agent":** While technically "by the wind" is optional in some passive constructions, it's explicitly required by the rubric for a full score. Many might just write "The leaves were blown away."
*   **Keeping the original subject:** Students might try to combine active and passive elements, for example, "The leaves were blown away, the wind did it." or "The wind was blowing the leaves away."

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **Vocabulary for "blown away":** While "wind" and "leaves" are common, "blew away" might be treated as a single unit or misinterpreted, leading to awkward constructions.
*   **Understanding "change" and "voice":** The instruction itself, "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice," could be confusing if "active voice" and "passive voice" are not firmly established vocabulary terms for them.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **High attempt rate:** This is a short, direct question with no complex thought required beyond grammar. Most students will attempt it.
*   **Low success rate on attempts:** Even with attempts, the likelihood of getting all elements correct is low given the grammatical challenges.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   "The leaves was blown away by the wind." (Common error: "was" for plural "leaves")
*   "The leaves were blowed away by the wind." (Common error: incorrect past participle)
*   "The leaves were blown away." (Common error: omitting "by the wind")
*   "The wind was blown away by the leaves." (Common error: misidentifying subject/object)
*   "The leaves blew away by the wind." (Common error: missing "to be" verb)
*   "The leaves are blown away by the wind." (Common error: incorrect tense)
*   Completely unrelated answers if they don't understand the task.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** This requires conceptual understanding and examples. Many struggle with definitions and giving coherent examples.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This requires basic sentence construction, coherence, and following instructions. Many struggle to form more than a few fragmented sentences, despite it being a common topic.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is factual recall, but still requires understanding the prompt and articulating the points.

Voice change is a specific grammatical transformation. It's often rote-learned, but application can be tricky due to irregular verbs, auxiliary verbs, and subject-object reversal. Given the "average pass rate is about 29%" for the exam and the known struggles with fundamental English grammar:

*   The need to identify the object as the new subject.
*   The correct choice of the 'be' verb (was/were).
*   The correct past participle (blown, an irregular verb).
*   The inclusion of "by the agent."

Each of these steps presents a significant hurdle. Missing even one would result in a score of 0 according to the rubric's "correctly transforms" standard.

Students who can manage the "favorite season" paragraph (30%) might grasp sentence structure, but the specific grammatical rules of voice change are more demanding and error-prone than simply recounting facts or writing descriptive sentences. It's closer in complexity to the "Differentiate sources" question, which requires precise knowledge, but without the "giving examples" part which also often
