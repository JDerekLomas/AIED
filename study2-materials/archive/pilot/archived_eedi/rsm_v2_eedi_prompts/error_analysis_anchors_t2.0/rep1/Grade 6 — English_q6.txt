The student population consists of Class 6 students in Indian government schools, mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English. The average pass rate on this exam is about 29%.

Let's break down the likely errors for the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"

**Question Analysis:**

*   **Part 1: "Which line from the poem do you like the most"**
    *   Requires recall of a line from a *specific* poem (not provided, but assume it's one they've studied).
    *   Requires subjective preference.
    *   **Potential difficulties:**
        *   **Memory:** Students might struggle to recall specific lines accurately, especially if their English vocabulary or reading comprehension is weak. They might remember the gist but not the exact wording.
        *   **Identifying "a line":** Some might pick a phrase, a stanza, or a general idea rather than a distinct *line*.
        *   **No specific poem:** If the poem isn't explicitly linked or assumed to be common knowledge, this immediately becomes impossible. For the purpose of this estimation, I'll assume the poem was provided as part of the broader context of the exam/unit.

*   **Part 2: "and why?"**
    *   Requires explanation and reasoning.
    *   **Potential difficulties:**
        *   **Expressing reasons in English:** This is the most significant hurdle. Even if a student knows *why* they like a line, articulating that reason in coherent English, especially with limited vocabulary and grammatical structures, will be challenging.
        *   **Lack of vocabulary for abstract concepts:** They might struggle to explain *emotions*, *imagery*, or *deeper meanings*. They might resort to simple adjectives (good, nice) or descriptive words that don't fully explain *why*.
        *   **Brief/undeveloped explanations:** Even if they attempt an explanation, it might be too brief or unspecific to meet the "mentions why" part of the rubric sufficiently.

**Rubric:** "Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why." (Max score: 1.5 - implies that even partial answers might get a 0.5 or 1, but for "pass rate" we usually consider *correctly* answered). I will interpret "correctly" as earning the full 1.5, or at least a passing threshold that reflects a meaningful attempt at both parts.

**Likely Errors/Common Wrong Answers:**

1.  **Partial Answer (Line but no "why" or very weak "why"):**
    *   "I like the line 'The world is mine' because it is good." (Could score low, possibly not full pass)
    *   "The line 'Work is worship' is my favourite." (Missing "why")
    *   This is very common when the explanation is harder than identification.

2.  **Incorrect Line/Quote:**
    *   Recalling a similar-sounding line, or a general idea from the poem that isn't an exact line.
    *   Making up a line they *wish* was in the poem.

3.  **Grammar/Spelling Issues Obscuring Meaning:**
    *   Attempts at explanation are rendered unintelligible due to severe grammatical errors or lack of appropriate vocabulary.
    *   "I like this line because the word make happy and it is nice for heart." (Grammar is broken, meaning is hard to extract cleanly).

4.  **Misunderstanding "Line" or "Poem":**
    *   Naming the poet.
    *   Summarizing the poem's theme (e.g., "I like the poem because it talks about friendship").

5.  **No Attempt/Empty Response:**
    *   Some students might be overwhelmed by the "why" part and not attempt it at all.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'"** This requires abstract understanding and articulation of a complex idea. The target question asks for a personal preference and a *reason*, which is less abstract but still requires articulation. This 5% seems like a lower bound for very challenging writing/comprehension tasks.

*   **Item (pass rate 15%): "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each."** This requires factual recall, understanding of two distinct concepts, and providing examples for *each*. The target question has a subjective component ("which line do you like") which can be easier than factual recall, but the "why" requires more personal expression. Articulating differences is likely harder than explaining a preference.

*   **Item (pass rate 30%): "Write
