**Analysis of likely errors for "Choose the correct word. There are (some/any) apples in the basket."**

Given the demographic (Class 6 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections with limited English) and the calibration anchors, here's an analysis of potential errors:

*   **Understanding "some" vs. "any" in a positive statement:** This is the core grammatical rule being tested.
    *   **Misconception:** Many ESL learners, especially at this early stage, struggle with the specific contexts of "some" and "any." They might associate "any" with general existence or just not have a clear understanding of its common use in questions and negative statements, or its specific positive contexts (e.g., "Any student can do it.").
    *   **Common Error:** Choosing "any" because they see it as meaning "there are *any* apples at all," without understanding the nuanced distinction for a positive declarative sentence. This is a very common overgeneralization in early English learning.
*   **Vocabulary Recognition:**
    *   **"apples":** Likely known.
    *   **"basket":** Likely known.
    *   **"There are":** Common and probably understood.
*   **Instruction Comprehension:**
    *   "Choose the correct word": Simple enough.
    *   "some/any": The words themselves are simple monosyllables.
*   **Attempt Rate:** Students will almost certainly attempt this. It's short, has clear options, and no complex sentence structure to parse beyond the core grammar point. There's a 50/50 chance of getting it right even if they don't fully understand.
*   **Common Wrong Answer:** "There are any apples in the basket." This would be the most prevalent incorrect choice due to the fundamental misunderstanding of "some" vs. "any" in positive declarative sentences.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 66% (Name any two Fundamental Rights...):** This requires recalling specific facts, which can be hard, but the vocabulary is direct. This question is arguably simpler conceptually.
*   **Pass rate 50% (What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?):** This requires recall of a specific story's details, often taught in English classes. Students would likely have read the story. Again, conceptually more involved than a simple grammar fill-in.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Write a short paragraph on "My favorite season."):** Requires free production, organization, and a wider range of vocabulary and grammatical structures, which is much harder.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources...):** This is a conceptual definition task from Social Studies/History, requiring understanding and expression, very difficult for this group.
*   **Pass rate 5% (Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."):** Abstract thinking, literary analysis, and expressing a nuanced idea in English - extremely difficult.

This "some/any" question is a direct test of a specific, relatively basic grammatical rule. It's a binary choice. Students who have *any* exposure to simple English sentence construction in class might have come across this, but rote memorization of rules can be hit-or-miss. Many will default to "any" without a clear understanding of the nuance.

Given that even questions requiring recall of specific facts from stories (like the king's questions) have a 50% pass rate, and basic recall (Fundamental Rights) is at 66%, this grammar question sits in a similar tier regarding cognitive load but might be slightly harder due to a common, specific misconception. However, the 50/50 chance from guessing pushes the lower bound up.

Many students will have been exposed to "some" in positive contexts and "any" in negative/question contexts. The directness of the sentence, coupled with only two options, should make it accessible. It doesn't require complex sentence formation or deep vocabulary.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55-65%**

I'm leaning towards the higher end of this range (closer to 60-65%) for these reasons:
1.  **Binary Choice:** Even without knowing, there's a 50% chance of guessing correctly.
2.  **Frequent Exposure:** "Some" and "any" are very common words, and this particular positive declarative usage of "some" is foundational. They likely encounter "There are some..." frequently.
3.  **No Complex Vocabulary/Syntax:** The sentence itself is extremely simple.
4.  **Analogous Pass Rates:** The 50% and 66% pass rates for recall questions suggest students *can* perform well
