Here's an analysis of the likely errors and an estimated pass rate for the question about the Battle of Plassey:

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

*   **Social Science Misconceptions:**
    *   **Lack of historical context:** Many students might know *that* the British eventually ruled India but lack the specific historical knowledge about *how* it happened, especially key battles like Plassey. They might not connect specific events to broader outcomes like "expansion of power."
    *   **Focus on individual details vs. significance:** Students might remember snippets about the battle (e.g., betrayal by Mir Jafar, Clive) but fail to articulate its larger historical significance in terms of British dominance or control over Bengal.
    *   **Understanding "political dominance":** The concept of establishing political dominance or control over a region, particularly through a puppet ruler, might be too abstract for some, especially if their history curriculum focuses more on rote memorization of dates and names.
    *   **Confusion with other battles/events:** India's colonial history is complex. Students might confuse Plassey with other Anglo-Indian conflicts (e.g., Carnatic Wars, Mysore Wars) or later British conquests.

*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Contribute to the expansion":** This phrase requires understanding causality and the role of one event in a larger process. Students might struggle to articulate this nuanced relationship. They might simply state "The British won the Battle of Plassey" without linking it to expansion of power.
    *   **Keywords like "dominance," "control," "puppet nawab":** These are more advanced vocabulary. Students might know the facts but lack the precise English terms to express the rubric's requirements. They might use simpler terms that don't quite hit the mark.
    *   **Grammar and sentence structure:** Even if they have the right idea, poor English sentence construction might make their answer unintelligible or prevent them from getting credit.

*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt/Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   **No Attempt:** Due to a complete lack of knowledge about the Battle of Plassey or its significance, many students might leave it blank, similar to the "Empty Response" in calibration items. This is a very real possibility given the low average pass rates.
    *   **Partial/Vague Attempts:**
        *   "The British won the Battle of Plassey." (Lacks connection to expansion of power)
        *   "The British became powerful after this battle." (Too vague, doesn't explain *how* or *where*)
        *   "Mir Jafar helped the British." (Correct detail, but needs to be linked to the outcome of control over Bengal)
        *   "It was a big battle." (Lacks specific historical insight)
    *   **Completely Incorrect Information:** Mentioning other unrelated historical events or figures.
    *   **"Copied text":** If any reference text is provided, some students might attempt to copy phrases related to British power or battles without understanding the specific link to Plassey.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** This requires abstract thinking and nuanced language, which is hard. Our question requires specific historical knowledge and connecting cause to effect, which is similarly challenging if the specific connection isn't clear.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** This requires definitions and examples, often a more rote-learned type of knowledge. While the concept isn't highly abstract, the differentiation aspect adds complexity. Our question is less about defining and more about explaining impact.
*   **Pass Rate 30% ("My favorite season"):** This is a personal response, largely allowing students to draw on their own experience with simple language. Even with weak English, a response can often get some points for content. Our question is purely knowledge-based.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is a recall question of specific facts from a story, likely a recent one. If remembered, it's easy. Our question requires understanding of *consequence* and *impact*, which is a step beyond simple recall.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is specific factual recall from Civics/Political Science. If learned, it's straightforward. Many students might successfully recall *names* of rights even if they don't fully grasp their implications.

**Conclusion:**

The question "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?" requires not just knowing *that* the battle happened but also understanding its *political outcome* – the establishment of control over Bengal through a puppet ruler. This demands:
