Students from economically weaker sections with limited English skills often struggle with sentence structure and subject-verb agreement, even for seemingly simple sentences. Let's analyze the potential errors:

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) Order Difficulty:**
    *   **Misconception:** While basic SVO is taught, reinforcement might be lacking. Students might be used to less rigid sentence structures in their native languages or simpler declarative sentences.
    *   **Common Wrong Answers:**
        *   "Reading a book he is." (attempting to keep 'reading a book' together)
        *   "A book he is reading." (object first, sometimes seen in questions or more complex structures they might overgeneralize)
        *   "Is he reading a book?" (turning it into a question, perhaps recognizing "is he" as a common pairing)
        *   "Book reading is he." (random placement)

2.  **Lack of Understanding of Auxiliary Verbs and Continuous Tense:**
    *   **Misconception:** The combination "is reading" for continuous tense might not be fully solidified. They might separate 'is' and 'reading'.
    *   **Common Wrong Answers:**
        *   "He reading a book is."
        *   "He is a book reading."

3.  **Capitalization of "He":**
    *   **Misconception:** Knowing that a sentence starts with a capital letter, they might capitalize 'Book' or 'Reading' if they perceive it as the start, even if 'He' is available. However, 'he' is provided lowercase, so they would ideally infer it needs to be capitalized, but not all students might remember or apply this rule consistently. The rubric is generally about the word order, not capitalization, but it hints at basic sentence construction.

4.  **No Attempt vs. Attempt and Fail:**
    *   This is a fundamental sentence construction task. Most students will attempt it. Complete non-attempts would likely be from those with extremely low English proficiency, or simply not understanding the instructions. The pass rates for even complex English items (like theme writing, 5%) show some attempts. For a rearrangement task, almost everyone will try *something*.

5.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:** Given the components, I expect many attempts to keep 'reading a book' together and 'he is' together, but not necessarily in the correct global SVO order. "Reading a book he is" or "A book he is reading" seem like strong candidates for common errors. Others might just place words semi-randomly if they have very weak understanding.

**Comparison with Anchors:**

*   **5% item (theme):** Requires deep understanding, synthesis, and creative expression. Much harder than sentence rearrangement.
*   **15% item (differentiate sources):** Requires conceptual understanding, factual recall, and structured comparison. Still significantly harder.
*   **30% item (short paragraph):** Requires content generation, organization, basic grammatical coherence, and sentence construction. This is a good upper bound. Students are asked to *write* 6-8 lines. For that, they need to form multiple sentences correctly.
*   **50% item (three questions the king wanted to answer):** Requires specific recall from a text, often literal transcription. Easier as it's just extracting information.
*   **66% item (Name two Fundamental Rights):** Requires factual recall of names (which can be memorized) and simple listing. Very direct and involves less "creation" or "structuring" of English sentences.

**Analysis for "book/reading/a/is/he":**

This question tests a very basic sentence structure (SVO) and the present continuous tense (subject + auxiliary verb + main verb + object).

*   It's simpler than writing a paragraph (30% pass rate) as it only requires correct ordering of given words, not generating new content or complex sentences.
*   It's harder than simply recalling facts (50%, 66%) because it requires *application* of grammar rules.
*   The presence of 'is' and 'reading' together suggests the present continuous. 'He' is a clear subject. 'A book' is a clear object.

The main challenge will be placing "He" first, "is" after "He", and then "reading a book" correctly. For students with limited English, forming this standard SVO structure, especially with the auxiliary verb, is not trivial. Many might prioritize keeping "reading a book" together or put the "is" in the wrong place. However, it's also a foundational skill usually covered early.

Considering the 30% pass rate for writing a short paragraph, which requires multiple correct sentences, a single
