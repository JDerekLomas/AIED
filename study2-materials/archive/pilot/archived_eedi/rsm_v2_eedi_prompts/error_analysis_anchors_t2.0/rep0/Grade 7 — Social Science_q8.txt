The average pass rate for Class 7 students from economically weaker sections with limited English is around 29%. Let's analyze the given question and calibrate it against the anchor items.

**Question Breakdown:** "What are the main occupations of people in the rural areas of Rajasthan? Describe any one in brief."
**Rubric:** Names at least two main occupations correctly (e.g., Agriculture/farming, Animal Husbandry/pastoralism, handicrafts). Max score: 1.

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

*   **Social Science Misconceptions/Lack of Knowledge:**
    *   Many students might not know the specific economic activities of Rajasthan's rural areas. Their general knowledge of "rural" might be limited to agriculture, but the "Rajasthan" specificity adds a layer of difficulty.
    *   They might list occupations common to *any* rural area (e.g., farmer, shopkeeper) without the specific nuance for Rajasthan (animal husbandry due to the desert landscape, handicrafts as a traditional art form).
    *   Students might struggle to distinguish between primary occupations and tertiary services or other general jobs.

*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   "Occupations": Most students would likely understand this, as it's a common term for "jobs" or "work."
    *   "Rural areas": This term is fundamental to the question and should be understood.
    *   "Rajasthan": While they are Indian students, knowledge of specific state geography/economy can vary widely, especially for those in different states or with limited exposure beyond their immediate surroundings.
    *   "Describe any one in brief": This requires not just naming, but providing a very short explanation, which might be challenging for students with limited English. They might just list without description.

*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   This is a factual recall question. Students who don't know the answer are unlikely to guess effectively beyond "farming."
    *   The prompt to "describe any one in brief" encourages an attempt, even if the description is poor or only one occupation is named.

*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   Listing only one occupation (e.g., "Farming").
    *   Listing occupations not specific to Rajasthan's rural areas, or very generic rural jobs.
    *   Providing a list of occupations without any description.
    *   Listing occupations but with spelling errors that make them unrecognizable.
    *   Simply stating "agriculture" without any other valid occupation.
    *   Completely unrelated answers if they lack any understanding of "Rajasthan" or "rural occupations."

**Calibration against Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking and expressing complex ideas. Much harder. This question is more factual recall.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate sources):** Requires conceptual understanding and examples. Also quite demanding. This question is simpler in its requirement for naming and brief description.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires personal expression, coherent sentence formation, and adherence to structural guidelines (6-8 lines). This involves more productive writing than the Rajasthan question. Students often manage to write something simple about seasons. The rubric allowed 3 marks for short, simple, broken phrases as well, showing a high leniency.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Pure factual recall from a specific story/text. If they read and remembered the story, this is relatively straightforward. Similar to the current question in its "recall and list" nature.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Factual recall of two out of several important concepts taught in Social Science. Very common and relatively easy for students who have studied civics. Many options for correct answers.

**Comparison and Estimation:**

The question asks for specific knowledge about a particular Indian state's rural economy. This is more specific than "Fundamental Rights" (66% pass rate) but less demanding than complex differentiations (15% pass rate). It's comparable to recalling details from a story (50% pass rate) in terms of recall, but the *specificity* of Rajasthan's occupations (beyond just "farming") adds a layer of difficulty.

Given the rubric's simplicity (names at least *two* and *describes any one in brief* for 1 mark), students who just manage to list "agriculture" and "animal husbandry" would get a mark. The description can be extremely basic ("Farmers grow crops" or "People keep cows").

The difficulty stems primarily from specific factual knowledge about *Rajasthan*. Many students might only know "agriculture" and might miss "animal husbandry" or "handicrafts." If they only name one, they get
