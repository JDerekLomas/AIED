I will analyze the question and the rubric, considering the students' background and the calibration anchors, to estimate the pass rate.

**Question Breakdown:**
* **"Describe one key feature"**: Requires recalling specific information about urban planning and articulating it clearly.
* **"Harappan Civilization's urban planning"**: A specific topic in history/social science, likely covered in their curriculum.
* **"key feature"**: Implies something distinct and important, not just a minor detail.

**Likely Errors and Considerations:**

1.  **Subject Matter Knowledge (Social Science Misconceptions):**
    *   **Lack of recall:** Students might simply not remember any features of Harappan urban planning, especially if history is not their strongest subject or if this particular topic was covered quickly.
    *   **Confusing with other civilizations:** They might recall features from other ancient civilizations (e.g., Egyptian or Mesopotamian cities) and incorrectly attribute them to Harappan.
    *   **Focusing on non-urban planning aspects:** They might remember Harappan Civilization, but focus on other aspects like trade, crafts, or religion, failing to connect to *urban planning*.
    *   **Vague answers:** They might provide general descriptors like "they had good cities" without mentioning a specific feature.
    *   **Incomplete answers:** Mentioning part of a feature but not enough to count (e.g., "they had bricks" without specifying "baked bricks" or their widespread use in construction).

2.  **Language Misunderstandings (English Comprehension/Expression):**
    *   **"Describe"**: Some students might just list rather than describe, which could still get them a point if the list is a single feature. However, "describe" implies a bit more detail.
    *   **"key feature"**: Could be misinterpreted as just "any feature" or lead to listing too many, or just not understanding the importance implied by "key."
    *   **Vocabulary:** Words like "urban planning," "grid layout," "drainage system," "citadel," "baked bricks" are fairly common in Social Science texts but might be challenging for students with limited English to recall and use accurately in their own words.
    *   **Articulation:** Even if they know the answer in their local language, expressing it precisely in English can be a hurdle. The low average pass rate (29%) and the writing samples suggest difficulties in clear, concise English writing.

3.  **Attempt Rate vs. Failure Rate:**
    *   **Not attempting at all:** Students who have no knowledge of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning or find the English too daunting might leave it blank, similar to the 0 scores on the "Archaeological/Literary sources" item or "King's questions" (where a third left it blank).
    *   **Attempting but failing:** This is very likely. Students might remember "Harappa" but struggle to articulate a specific urban planning feature. Their answers might be too vague, incorrect, or incomplete, similar to the "theme of poem" item where attempts are made but often scored 0 or 1 with minimal credit.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   "They had a big city." (Too vague)
    *   "They used bricks." (Not specific enough – *baked* bricks for a *systematic construction* or a feature *of urban planning*).
    *   "They were ancient." (Irrelevant)
    *   Something vaguely related to Indus Valley but not urban planning (e.g., "They farmed," "They had seals").
    *   A garbled or partly correct answer due to poor English expression.

**Rubric Analysis:**
*   "Correctly describes **one** key feature." Max score 1. This is fairly lenient. Even a phrase like "grid-patterned streets" or "advanced drainage" would likely pass.
*   The examples provided (grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town) are quite distinct and commonly taught.

**Calibration Anchors Comparison:**

*   **"Theme of poem" (5%):** Requires interpretation and abstraction, and expressing a subjective idea. Very difficult. Our question requires factual recall and description.
*   **"Differentiate between archaeological/literary sources" (15%):** Requires recalling definitions and examples for *two* distinct concepts, and articulating a *differentiation*. More complex than our question.
    *   *Self-correction*: Our question asks for "one key feature" which is simpler than differentiating two distinct categories with examples.
*   **"Short paragraph on 'My favorite season'" (30%):** Requires sustained writing, personal expression, and following specific prompts. The passing answers are often simple lists or short, grammatically flawed sentences. Our
