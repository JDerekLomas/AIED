ERRORS leading to incorrect answers:

*   **Misconception about "major" / Geographic Knowledge:**
    *   **Specificity issues:** Students might know "mountains" exist but struggle to name *specific* ranges within India, confusing them with individual peaks or just "hills."
    *   **Regional focus:** They might know a mountain range near their immediate region (if applicable) but not broader, "major" ones from across India.
    *   **Limited general knowledge:** Given the background, general geographical knowledge of India's major features might be limited. They might only be familiar with general concepts like "hills" or "mountains" from stories, but not formal names.
*   **Language Misunderstanding:**
    *   "Major mountain ranges": The word "major" might be an issue. They might just list any mountain they've heard of, not necessarily the most prominent.
    *   "Located in India": Could be misinterpreted to mean *near* India or generally in the Indian subcontinent, leading to naming ranges that are partially or mostly outside (though Himalayas are obviously correct for this).
*   **Attempt but Fail (Partial knowledge/Recall issues):**
    *   **Single correct answer:** Many might remember "Himalayas" as it's the most prominent and frequently mentioned. However, naming a *second* major range could be difficult.
    *   **Confusing with states/cities/rivers:** Students might accidentally name a state, city, or major river due to a lack of precise geographical distinctions.
    *   **Incorrect spelling:** While the rubric is forgiving for names (e.g., "Himalay"), entirely unrecognizable names would likely get 0.
*   **Not attempt at all:** This question requires specific factual recall, unlike an essay or story retelling. If a student genuinely doesn't know any, they might leave it blank. However, "Himalayas" is a very high-frequency term, so many will likely try that.
*   **Common wrong answers:**
    *   Just "Himalayas" (leading to 0.5 score, but not 1.0 which would require two).
    *   Randomly listed states, cities, or rivers.
    *   Generic "mountains."
    *   Completely incorrect but vaguely "nature-y" terms.
    *   A single, less prominent local range they might know.

**Comparison with Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."** This requires abstract thinking and interpreting text, which is very hard for this demographic. Naming two ranges is purely factual recall, easier.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources...** This requires understanding definitions and giving examples, implying a slightly higher cognitive load and formal learning than naming two geographic features. The "differentiate" part is also a barrier.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season."** This is creative writing on a personal topic. Students can leverage personal experience even with poor English, as seen in the examples where broken English still scores points for effort. Naming two mountain ranges requires specific knowledge, not creativity.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is direct recall from a story they likely read in class. It's still specific recall but from a text rather than general knowledge. This is somewhat similar to our question's demands. If they remember 1 or 2, they get full points, which is slightly more generous than our 0.5 for one.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India.** This is very similar in structure: "Name any two X." The success rate suggests that *two* Fundamental Rights are relatively high-frequency factual recall, probably due to civics lessons. "Himalayas" is a strong candidate for one of the mountain ranges, but the *second* might be harder for general knowledge than a second fundamental right, which is part of specific curriculum.

**Considering these factors:**

*   "Himalayas" is almost certainly known by a good percentage of students. This guarantees a score of 0.5 for many.
*   Getting a *second* major mountain range (Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western/Eastern Ghats) would be the differentiator for full points (which would be 1.0 in a typical 1-point system, but 0.5 as per the rubric max score).
*   The pass rate of "Name any two Fundamental Rights" at 66% indicates that "name
