Students are being asked to describe the poet's writing style. The average pass rate is 29%, and the students are from economically weaker sections with limited English.

Likely errors and analysis:

*   **Understanding "writing style":** This is a somewhat abstract concept. Students might confuse it with the poet's mood, the poem's theme, or simply not grasp what "style" refers to in the context of writing.
*   **Vocabulary for description:** Even if they understand "writing style," many students may lack the English vocabulary to describe it effectively (e.g., simple, evocative, metaphorical, direct, formal). They might resort to very basic or inaccurate adjectives.
*   **Poem comprehension:** If students struggled to understand the poem's content or theme (as suggested by the 5% pass rate for "Write a theme..."), they will certainly struggle to articulate its style. They might identify elements but fail to synthesize them into a descriptive word.
*   **Attempt vs. failure:** This question is likely to be attempted by many students, but their answers might be very vague, irrelevant, or simply rephrase parts of the poem without describing the *style*. Many will write something that doesn't fit the rubric for a score of 1.
*   **Common wrong answers:**
    *   Referring to the poem's *topic* instead of its style ("It's about happiness," "It's a poem about a job search").
    *   Describing their *feelings* about the poem ("I liked it," "It was a good poem").
    *   Vague and uninformative adjectives ("nice," "good," "bad").
    *   Reiterating parts of the poem's plot.
    *   Attempting to use complex words incorrectly or nonsensically.
    *   Leaving it blank if they don't understand the question.

**Calibration comparison:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme...** This is harder as it requires synthesis and abstract thinking. Describing style is also abstract.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources...** This requires specific factual recall and comparison, which is generally harder than describing a subjective element of a text, but here, the specific terminology ("writing style") adds a layer of difficulty.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph on "My favorite season."** This is a personal response, low-cognitive load, and generally easier. This question is much harder due to the abstract nature and requirement for specific descriptive vocabulary.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is direct recall from a story, usually much easier. This question is not direct recall.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights...** This is direct factual recall, and often memorized. This question requires interpretation and critical thinking.

The concept of "writing style" is sophisticated, especially for students with limited English exposure to literary analysis. While some might identify simple characteristics (e.g., "simple words"), others will completely miss the mark, confusing style with theme or opinion. The challenge here is both conceptual and lexical. It's harder than recall questions, but potentially easier than the 5% theme question because it only asks for "a suitable and relevant word," not a full explanation. However, getting that one *suitable* word requires both comprehension of the concept and adequate vocabulary.

Considering the students' background and the abstract nature of "writing style" and the need for appropriate vocabulary, this question leans towards the lower end of the difficulty spectrum for interpretative questions, but still significantly challenging. Many will attempt, but few will hit the specific criterion for a '1'.

I'd place it closer to the 15-20% mark. The "theme" question is harder because it requires more extensive phrasing, but "writing style" still demands abstract thinking and appropriate vocabulary. Many students might identify an aspect (e.g., "simple language") but fail to condense it into a single descriptive word or may provide a word that isn't sufficiently "suitable and relevant."
