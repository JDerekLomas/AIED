Let's break down the likely errors for the question: "What are the main occupations of people in the rural areas of Rajasthan? Describe any one in brief."

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the context (Class 7, economically weaker sections, limited English, low average pass rate, common errors from similar questions):

1.  **"Empty Response" / Non-Attempt:**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a dominant error type in the provided examples (9%, 12%). Students might not know *any* occupations or feel overwhelmed by the "describe any one in brief" part. They might also lack confidence in their English to formulate an answer.
    *   **Impact:** Significantly lowers the pass rate.

2.  **Misconceptions about Social Science/General Knowledge:**
    *   **Reasoning:** Students might have limited exposure to specific regional geography and economy. They might list general occupations (e.g., "doctor," "teacher," "shopkeeper") that are not *main* rural occupations, or list occupations from urban areas or different regions. They might also mix up "occupations" with "leisure activities" or "needs."
    *   **Example Wrong Answer:** "They do farming and play games." (Partially correct, but "play games" isn't an occupation). "They work in offices." (Incorrect for rural Rajasthan). "They make things." (Too vague, might not be specific enough for "handicrafts").

3.  **Language Misunderstandings (English):**
    *   **"Occupations":** While a common word, some students might struggle with it, especially in the context of academic questioning. They might interpret it as "things people do" rather than "jobs for earning a living."
    *   **"Rural areas":** Could be confused with urban areas, or simply interpreted as "everywhere."
    *   **"Rajasthan":** Some students might struggle to recall or distinguish specific details about Rajasthan.
    *   **"Describe any one in brief":** This part adds complexity. Even if they name an occupation, describing it briefly in English can be challenging. They might give a single word or a very short, unclear phrase.
    *   **Example Wrong Answer:** "Farming." (Correct, but misses the "at least two" and "describe" part). "Farmers farm in Rajasthan." (Correct occupation, but likely insufficient for "describe").

4.  **Attempt but Fail (Partial Credit Issues):**
    *   **Reasoning:** Many students might identify *one* correct occupation (e.g., "farming") but fail to name a second, or fail to describe one in brief. The rubric requires *at least two* and then a description.
    *   **Example Wrong Answer:** "Farming." (Only one occupation, fails rubric). "Agriculture. They grow crops like wheat." (Good for one, but misses the second occupation requirement for full marks).

5.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   Given the prevalence of "Empty Response" and the difficulty with forming full sentences in English, a high proportion will likely be **"Empty Response"** or **a single, insufficient word/phrase like "Farming."**
    *   Other common wrong answers would be listing an incorrect occupation or a too-general activity.

**Considerations for Pass Rate Estimation:**

*   **Direct Recall:** This question relies on direct recall of geographical/economic facts about Rajasthan.
*   **Two-Part Question:** Naming two *and* describing one increases the difficulty.
*   **"Economically weaker sections with limited English":** This demographic struggles with both content knowledge (potentially less access to resources) and language expression.
*   **Pass Rate of Similar Questions:** The 9-12% pass rates for explanation-based Social Science questions are a strong indicator that this question, which requires both recall and description, will be low. However, this question might be slightly *easier* than explaining complex historical impacts or symbolic meanings, as "farming" and "animal husbandry" are quite common and basic concepts.

**Revised thought process:** While "farming" is a very common answer and many might get that part, the "at least two" and "describe one in brief" hurdles are significant. The "Empty Response" will still be high. Some might just write "agriculture" and "animal," failing the description. The bar for full credit is not just naming, but also briefly describing.

Let's consider that "Agriculture" and "Animal Husbandry" are quite fundamental to rural life and might be taught. However, expressing them correctly in English and then describing one, while also remembering *two*, is the challenge.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for the exam generally, and the lower rates for *explanation* questions
