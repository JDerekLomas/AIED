Let's break down the question and potential errors for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and common mistakes.

**The Question:** "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."

**Understanding the Question (Breakdown for Students):**

*   **"Do you think..."**: Requires a personal opinion (Yes/No).
*   **"the king's questions"**: Refers to the specific questions asked by the king in the passage (What is the right time to do everything? Who are the most important people? What is the most important thing to do?). Students need to recall these.
*   **"are important in real life?"**: Connects the fictional context to their own reality. This is crucial.
*   **"Give one reason."**: Requires justification.

**Common Errors & Analysis:**

1.  **Misunderstanding "important in real life" / Abstraction:**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might not fully grasp the abstract concept of "importance" beyond a concrete, immediate context. They might struggle to connect the king's philosophical questions to their daily lives.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** "Real life" might be interpreted too literally, or they might not see the relevance of a *king's* questions to *their* lives.
    *   **Attempt/Fail/Not Attempt:** They might attempt but give a very superficial or irrelevant reason, or not attempt at all if they can't make the connection.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "Yes, because the king is important." "Yes, because he is a king." "Yes, they are in the story." (Focuses on the story's literal context rather than real-world applicability).

2.  **Difficulty Recalling/Summarizing the King's Questions:**
    *   **Misconception:** Poor reading comprehension or retention of the main plot points. If they don't remember *what* the king asked, they can't answer if it's important.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** The question assumes they've read and understood the preceding passage about the king's questions.
    *   **Attempt/Fail/Not Attempt:** They might try to answer "yes/no" but fail to give a relevant reason, or simply write "Empty Response."
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "Yes." (No reason given). "Yes, the king wants to know." (Doesn't link to real life).

3.  **Struggling with Expressing a Reason in English:**
    *   **Misconception:** Even if they understand the concept, forming a coherent, grammatically correct sentence or two to express the *reason* is a major hurdle. This is evident in the examples provided ("My hobby is cricket play").
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** Limited vocabulary, grammatical structures (e.g., using "because," explaining cause and effect).
    *   **Attempt/Fail/Not Attempt:** They will likely attempt but fail to articulate a clear reason.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "Yes, they are good." "Yes, it is true." "Yes, we should know." (Reasons are too vague or grammatically incomplete). "Yes, because the king wants a answer." (Fails to connect to "real life").

4.  **Literal Interpretation / Focus on the King as a Person:**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might focus on the king's personal desire for answers rather than the universal nature of the questions themselves.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** Missing the implied universality of "the right time," "right people," "right thing."
    *   **Attempt/Fail/Not Attempt:** They will attempt but provide a reason focused on the king.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "Yes, because the king is wise." "Yes, because the king needs to know how to rule."

5.  **Difficulty with "Give one reason":**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might simply state "yes" or "no" without providing any justification, or provide a justification that isn't really a "reason."
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** Not fully grasping the requirement for explanation.
    *   **Attempt/Fail/Not Attempt:** Will likely attempt but miss the "reason" part.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "Yes." or "No."

**Likely Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   "Yes." (No reason)
*   "Empty Response."
*   "Yes, because the king asked them." (Focuses on the story's literal event)
*   "Yes, the king is important." (Focuses on the king's status)
