Let's break down the potential errors for Class 7 students in Indian government schools tackling the active to passive voice transformation.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Fundamental Lack of Understanding of Voice:** This is the most significant hurdle. Many students, especially at this level and with limited exposure, might not have a solid grasp of what "active" and "passive" voice even mean, let alone how to transform them. They might learn it as a rule, but not truly understand the underlying concept.
    *   **Misconception:** They might not understand the shift in focus from the doer (wind) to the receiver of the action (leaves).

2.  **Confusion with Tense:** The most common error in passive voice transformations is incorrect tense usage, especially with irregular verbs.
    *   The original sentence is Past Simple: "blew"
    *   The passive requires "was/were" + Past Participle.
    *   **Misconception:** Students might use the present tense ("are blown"), the future tense, or even fail to use the correct form of "to be" (e.g., "the leaves blown away").
    *   **Specific Irregular Verb Issue:** "Blew" is an irregular verb (blow-blew-blown). Many students struggle with irregular past participles. They might use "blowed," "blew," or simply omit the correct form.

3.  **Subject-Object Confusion:** They might struggle to identify the subject and object in the active sentence and reverse them correctly for the passive.
    *   **Misconception:** They might keep "the wind" as the subject or misplace "the leaves."

4.  **Omitting "by the..." phrase or Misplacing it:** While technically sometimes optional, at this learning stage, including "by the wind" is usually expected for a full transformation.
    *   **Misconception:** Students might forget it, or place it in an awkward position.

5.  **Direct Translation/Literal Approach:** They might try to directly translate word-for-word without understanding the grammatical rules of transformation. This often leads to grammatically incorrect structures.

6.  **"Empty Response" or "Not Attempted":** Given the low pass rates on other complex English questions, a significant number of students will likely not attempt it at all or provide a very minimal, incorrect response if they don't understand the core concept. The complexity of "voice" compared to simply writing about a hobby means more will likely give up.

**What the Most Common Wrong Answers Would Look Like:**

Based on the above, here are probable common wrong answers, ranked by likelihood:

1.  **Incorrect Tense/Verb Form (especially irregular verb):**
    *   "The leaves **are blown** away by the wind." (Present instead of past)
    *   "The leaves **blowed** away by the wind." (Incorrect past participle for "blow")
    *   "The leaves **blown** away by the wind." (Missing "were")

2.  **Missing "were/was":**
    *   "The leaves blown away by the wind." (As above, very common)

3.  **Subject-Object Misplacement/Confused Structure:**
    *   "The wind were blown the leaves away." (Confusing the subject)
    *   "Away were blown the leaves by the wind." (Awkward structure)

4.  **Minimal Attempt/Partial Understanding:**
    *   "The leaves away." (Just identifies the object)
    *   "The leaves away blew." (Some words, but no structure)

5.  **Completely Irrelevant/Empty Response:**
    *   "Empty Response" (High probability, similar to other complex questions)
    *   "I like wind." (Completely off-topic)

6.  **Omission of "by the wind":**
    *   "The leaves were blown away." (Technically correct, but often expected to include "by the wind" in an exercise unless specified.) I'll assume for max score, "by the wind" is required.

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

Considering the average pass rate of 29%, and the specific challenges of this question:

*   **Complexity:** "Voice" is a higher-order grammatical concept compared to describing a hobby or even understanding a poem's theme (which also saw very low rates).
*   **Irregular Verb:** "Blow" is irregular, adding another layer of difficulty.
*   **Pre-requisite knowledge:** Requires understanding of verbs, tenses, subject/object, and the concept of transformation.
*   **English Proficiency:** Limited English proficiency means many won't even start to grasp the rules.
