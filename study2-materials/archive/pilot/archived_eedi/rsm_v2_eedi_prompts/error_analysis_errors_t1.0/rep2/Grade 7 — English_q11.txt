Let's break down the likely errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the context of Class 7 students from economically weaker sections with limited English, and the common errors observed in other questions, here's what we can expect:

*   **Misconception about "Adjective Phrase" vs. "Adjective":** This is the most critical error. The rubric states "The student correctly identifies 'tiny' as an adjective." This implies that *identifying the adjective itself* is sufficient, not necessarily the *phrase*. However, the question *asks* for an "adjective phrase."
    *   **If students interpret "adjective phrase" literally:** They will look for a group of words modifying a noun. "A tiny bird" (or part of it), "in our balcony," etc. This is where most will fail.
    *   **If students simplify "adjective phrase" to just "adjective" (or a single word that *is* an adjective):** They might get "tiny" correct. This is the only path to success, as "tiny" on its own isn't an adjective *phrase*.
    *   **Common error for "Adjective Phrase":** Many might try to identify other phrases they *do* recognize, such as prepositional phrases. "in our balcony" is a very strong contender for a wrong answer if they are looking for *any* phrase.

*   **Limited Vocabulary/Grammar Understanding:**
    *   Students might not know what "adjective" means, let alone "adjective phrase." They might guess based on the words they recognize or find prominent.
    *   They might confuse it with verbs (built), nouns (bird, nest, balcony), or prepositions (in).

*   **Word Recognition without Grammatical Understanding:**
    *   They might pick "bird" because it's a prominent noun.
    *   They might pick "built" because it's an action word.
    *   They might pick "balcony" as it's a distinct object.

*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   Given the other questions' "Empty Response" rates, there will be a significant number of non-attempts if they don't understand "adjective phrase" at all.
    *   However, if they try to pick *any* phrase or important word, they will attempt it. The format (identify) encourages an attempt, even if it's a guess.

*   **Common Wrong Answers (and the thinking behind them):**
    1.  **"in our balcony"**: Strong contender. Students are often taught about prepositional phrases, and this one clearly functions as a unit. They might mistake *any* phrase for an "adjective phrase."
    2.  **"A tiny bird" / "a tiny"**: If they understand that the adjective modifies the noun, but aren't precise about "phrase." "A tiny bird" could be seen as the "phrase" related to the bird.
    3.  **"bird" / "nest" / "balcony"**: Picking a key noun, assuming the question is asking to identify a part of the sentence or a subject.
    4.  **"built"**: Identifying the action word (verb).
    5.  **"tiny bird"**: Similar to "A tiny bird," but focusing on the noun + modifier. This is closer to the correct understanding of what "tiny" is modifying.
    6.  **"Empty Response"**: If the concept of "adjective phrase" is completely alien.
    7.  **"its nest"**: Possessive pronoun phrase.

**The Crucial Rubric Interpretation:**

The rubric says: "The student correctly identifies 'tiny' as an adjective." This is key.
*   If a student writes "tiny," they get it right.
*   If a student writes "a tiny bird" and the examiner *only* focuses on "tiny" being present and correct, they *might* get it right. But if the examiner is strict about "phrase," then it's wrong.
*   The most direct way to satisfy the rubric is "tiny."

Given the students' background and common errors, it's highly unlikely they *correctly* understand "adjective phrase" as a multi-word unit modifying a noun, which would be something like "very tiny" or "tiny and brown." Since "tiny" is a single word, the question itself is slightly misleading if it expects a *phrase* but accepts a single *adjective*. This discrepancy will cause significant confusion.

**Refined Analysis considering "adjective" vs "adjective phrase":**

*   Students who *do* know what an adjective is might pick "tiny." These are the
