Let's break down the likely errors for the question: "What are the main occupations of people in the rural areas of Rajasthan? Describe any one in brief."

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the student profile (Class 7, Indian government schools, economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate 29%) and common errors in Social Science:

1.  **Lack of Specific Knowledge about Rajasthan:**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might not have specific geographical/socio-economic knowledge about Rajasthan. Their general understanding of "rural India" might be vague or apply to their own region, which may differ significantly from Rajasthan.
    *   **Result:** They might list occupations common in *any* rural area (e.g., "laborer," "shopkeeper," "teacher") rather than those *main* to Rajasthan. They might also confuse it with other states.
    *   **Likely Wrong Answer:** "Farming, shopkeeper, daily wage." (Farming is correct, but "shopkeeper" or "daily wage" aren't *main* occupations in the same way agriculture and animal husbandry are for rural Rajasthan).

2.  **Language Misunderstanding (English):**
    *   **Difficulty with "occupations":** While "occupation" is a fairly common word, combined with "main" and "rural areas," it might be a bit much for some.
    *   **Difficulty with "describe in brief":** Students might struggle with the English phrasing to elaborate, even if they know the occupation. They might list it but not describe it, or describe it very poorly.
    *   **Result:** They might list occupations but fail to describe any, or their description might be too short/irrelevant.
    *   **Likely Wrong Answer:** "Farming, cattle rearing." (Correct occupations, but no description provided). Or "Farming. They grow crops." (Too brief for a description, might not be enough to get full marks if the rubric is strict on "briefly describe").

3.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt & "Empty Response":**
    *   As seen in common errors, "Empty Response" is very frequent. This indicates either a complete lack of knowledge, an inability to formulate an answer in English, or simply giving up.
    *   **Result:** A significant number of students will likely leave it blank.

4.  **Generic Answers & Lack of Detail:**
    *   Even if they attempt, they might give very generic answers that don't specifically apply to *Rajasthan* or aren't considered "main" occupations.
    *   **Result:** Answers like "Work hard," "Doing jobs," "Getting money."

5.  **Spelling/Grammar Issues:**
    *   While not directly impacting correctness of the *content*, very poor spelling or grammar might obscure their intended answer, making it difficult for the marker to ascertain if they truly knew.
    *   **Likely Wrong Answer:** "Farming. They grew krrops like wheet and bazra." (Content is mostly right, but spelling might hinder clear understanding or be marked down if the rubric includes language quality).

6.  **Focus on Only One Occupation:**
    *   The question asks for "main occupations" (plural) and then "describe any one." Students might only list one and describe it, missing the requirement to name at least two.

**Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **Empty Response:** A substantial portion, reflecting lack of knowledge or ability to articulate.
*   **Listing only one correct occupation (e.g., "Farming") without another, or without description.**
*   **Listing correct occupations but failing to describe any.**
*   **Listing generic rural occupations that aren't *main* in Rajasthan or aren't specific enough (e.g., "laborer," "shopkeeper," "coolie").**
*   **Listing some correct but mixed with incorrect ones, or with very poor descriptions.**
*   **"Farming. They grow crops." (Potentially too brief description to count for the "describe in brief" part, depending on marker leniency).**

**Factors Favoring Correctness:**

*   **"Farming/Agriculture" is relatively common knowledge for rural India.** Many students will at least get this one right.
*   **"Animal Husbandry/Cattle Rearing" is also quite common in dry/semi-arid regions like Rajasthan.**

**Estimation of Pass Rate:**

Considering the challenges:

*   The "Empty Response" rate for similar questions is very high (9-12%). I expect a significant portion to not attempt or write very little.
*   The requirement to name *two* correct occupations *and* briefly describe one adds complexity. Many might get one occupation right but fail
