Let's break down the likely errors and then estimate the pass rate for "Describes the poet's writing style."

Given the context:
* Class 7 students in Indian government schools.
* Mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English.
* Average pass rate ~29%.
* Exemplar pass rates for similar questions are very low (4-10%).

**Analysis of Likely Errors for "Describes the poet’s writing style."**

1.  **Misunderstanding of "Describes"**:
    *   **Concrete vs. Abstract:** Students often struggle with abstract concepts. "Describes" might be understood as "tells what the poet is doing" rather than "tells about the *qualities* of the writing."
    *   **Focus on the Poet, not the Style:** They might interpret it as "What does the poet do?" or "Tell me about the poet" rather than specifically about their *writing style*.
    *   **Action vs. Description:** They might think "describes" means they should *describe something the poet wrote*, rather than describing the *style* itself.
    *   **Example Wrong Answer:** "The poet writes poems." "The poet uses words." "The poet is a good writer." (These are too general and don't describe *style*.)

2.  **Misunderstanding of "Writing Style"**:
    *   **Lack of Vocabulary:** This is the biggest hurdle. Words like "simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct," "figurative," "narrative," "lyrical," "eloquent" are likely beyond their productive vocabulary. Even if they understand the concept, they lack the specific words to articulate it.
    *   **Confusion with "What the poem is about":** They might conflate the style with the *theme* or *subject matter* of the poem.
    *   **Focus on Mechanics:** They might think "style" refers to handwriting, neatness, or basic grammar.
    *   **Example Wrong Answer:** "The poem is about nature." "The poet writes about life." "The poet writes neatly." "The poet uses big words." (The last one is a partial attempt but still likely too vague or inaccurate without a specific style word.)

3.  **General English Limitations:**
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Even if they have a word, forming a coherent sentence to express it will be a challenge.
    *   **Spelling and Grammar:** This will further obscure any correct intent.
    *   **Limited Exposure to Literary Terms:** They are unlikely to have been explicitly taught literary terms for "writing style" in depth.

4.  **Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**
    *   Given the low pass rates on similar questions, many will likely **not attempt at all** or provide an "Empty Response."
    *   Those who attempt will often fall into the errors described above.

**Most Common Wrong Answer:**

Based on the provided examples and analysis:

*   **"Empty Response" / No Attempt:** This is consistently high for abstract questions.
*   **"The poet writes." / "The poet writes poems."** (Too general, not specific to style)
*   **"The poet is good." / "Good writing."** (Vague, lacks specific descriptors)
*   **"I am reading."** (As seen in the exemplar, indicating a complete misunderstanding of the prompt)
*   **"The poem is about [topic]."** (Confusing style with theme)

**Revisiting the Example Errors for Context:**

*   "Q: 'Describes the poet’s writing style.' (pass rate: 4%)" - This is the exact question we're analyzing, and its pass rate is *already provided as 4%*.
*   "Wrong answer: 'I am reading.'" - Shows a complete misinterpretation of "describes."
*   "Wrong answer: 'Empty Response'" - High non-attempt rate.

**Conclusion for Estimation:**

The question "Describes the poet’s writing style" is highly abstract and requires specific vocabulary ("simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct") that Class 7 students with limited English are unlikely to possess or apply correctly. The examples of common errors (misunderstanding "describes," "empty response") confirm this.

Given that the pass rate for *this exact question* is already stated as 4%, and other similar analytical/descriptive questions have similarly low rates (5-10%), my estimation must align with this data.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 4%**
