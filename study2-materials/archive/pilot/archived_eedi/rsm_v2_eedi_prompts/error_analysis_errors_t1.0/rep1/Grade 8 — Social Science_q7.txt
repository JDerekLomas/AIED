Here's an analysis of the likely errors and an estimated pass rate for the given question:

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

1.  **Empty Response/No Attempt (Very High Probability):**
    *   **Reasoning:** Similar to the examples provided, a significant portion of students, especially those with lower overall pass rates and from economically weaker sections, might not attempt questions they don't understand or feel confident answering. The historical nature of the question (specific date, event) can be intimidating if not adequately covered or recalled.
    *   **Misconceptions:** Lack of basic historical knowledge about the event.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** While the question's English is relatively straightforward, the complexity of historical concepts can still be a barrier if the underlying knowledge is weak.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "Empty Response"

2.  **Confusion with Other Battles/Events (High Probability):**
    *   **Reasoning:** Indian history is vast, and students might confuse the Battle of Plassey with other significant battles or events involving the British (e.g., Battle of Buxar, Anglo-Mysore Wars, various revolts). They might know *something* about British expansion but attribute it to the wrong event.
    *   **Misconceptions:** General understanding of British expansion without specific event knowledge. Lack of chronological understanding.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** Not directly a language issue, but a knowledge recall issue where the specific trigger (Plassey 1757) leads to incorrect historical retrieval.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** Mentions "revolt," "freedom struggle," "other wars," or general statements about British gaining control without linking it to Plassey. Example: "British fought many wars and took over India."

3.  **Vague or Generic Answers about British Power (Medium Probability):**
    *   **Reasoning:** Students might remember that the British gained power, but not the *how* or the *specific contribution* of Plassey. They might give answers like "British became powerful," "they started ruling," "they got rich," without detailing the political dominance in Bengal or the puppet nawab. The rubric specifically asks for "political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)," which requires a specific level of detail.
    *   **Misconceptions:** Superficial understanding of the consequences, lacking the specific mechanism or immediate impact.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** Understanding the words "contribute" and "expansion of power" but failing to provide the specific historical context required.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "British became strong," "They started ruling India," "They collected taxes."

4.  **Misremembering Details of Plassey (Low-Medium Probability):**
    *   **Reasoning:** Even if they remember Plassey, they might get details wrong. They might mention trade benefits, military strength, or other general outcomes without hitting the core point of political control over Bengal via a puppet ruler.
    *   **Misconceptions:** Incorrect recall of specific historical facts or emphasis on less relevant outcomes.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** Not a primary language issue, but difficulty in articulating the precise historical impact.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "British started trading more," "They got lots of money," "They showed their power." (These are too general or misdirected from the core political control aspect).

**Comparison to Example Errors:**

*   The "Empty Response" error is highly likely, mirroring the tribal communities and Ashoka questions.
*   The generic/vague answers are similar to the "Asher' stand" or "Ashok seamb" where students attempt but provide something nonsensical or not relevant to the core question, albeit Plassey might elicit more historically *related* but incorrect answers.
*   The complexity of "explaining how colonial rule affected tribals" (9% pass rate) suggests that explaining the specific contribution of *one battle* to *British expansion* will also be challenging for many.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**

Considering the average pass rate of 29%, the difficulty of historical questions (9-12% for specific historical explanations), and the specific nature of the rubric requiring a precise understanding of Plassey's political impact on Bengal:

*   A large chunk will leave it blank or give irrelevant answers (40-50%).
*   Another significant portion will give vague answers about British power without the required detail (25-30%).
*   A smaller group might confuse it with other events (10-15%).
*   Only a small minority will accurately recall the political control over Bengal/puppet nawab aspect.

Given the depth required by the rubric for a single mark, which goes beyond mere recognition
