Let's break down the potential errors for Class 7 Indian government school students on this Active to Passive voice transformation question.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Fundamental Lack of Understanding of "Voice":**
    *   Many students simply won't know what "Active Voice" or "Passive Voice" means. These are grammatical terms that might not have been adequately taught or grasped, especially given the general low pass rates.
    *   **Misconception:** They might interpret "change the sentence" as needing to rephrase it in their own words, add more information, or simply make it longer.

2.  **Vocabulary/Concept Misunderstanding:**
    *   "Active" and "Passive" themselves could be confusing. "Active" might suggest "doing something" and "Passive" might suggest "doing nothing" or being inactive, without the grammatical context.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** The instruction "Change... from Active Voice to Passive Voice" might be too abstract. They might understand "change the sentence" but not the *specific type* of change required.

3.  **Difficulty with "Blown":**
    *   The past participle of "blow" ("blown") is irregular. Students often struggle with irregular verbs. They might use "blowed" or simply keep "blew."
    *   **Misconception:** Assuming all past tense verbs are formed by adding "-ed."

4.  **Incorrect Subject/Object Identification and Switching:**
    *   Even if they dimly understand the concept, identifying the subject ("the wind") and object ("the leaves") and then correctly swapping them to make the object the new subject will be a major hurdle.
    *   **Misconception:** Not understanding that the object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive one.

5.  **Auxiliary Verb Error (especially "were"):**
    *   Using the correct form of "to be" (in this case, "were" because "leaves" is plural and the original sentence is past tense) is critical. Students might use "was," "is," "are," or omit it entirely.
    *   **Misconception:** Not grasping the concord rule (subject-verb agreement) or the need for an auxiliary verb in passive voice.

6.  **Omission of "by the wind":**
    *   While not strictly required in all passive constructions, for a direct transformation like this, including "by the agent" is the expected correct answer. Students might omit it. This would still be *mostly* correct but might lose a partial mark if strictness is applied. However, the rubric implies its inclusion.

7.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   Given the common "Empty Response" errors on other questions, a significant number will likely not attempt it at all if they have no idea what "Active Voice" or "Passive Voice" means.
    *   Those who attempt it are likely to make a fundamental error.

**What the Most Common Wrong Answer Would Look Like:**

Based on the above, here are some likely wrong answers, in order of commonality/severity:

*   **Empty Response:** (Most common due to complete lack of understanding)
*   **"The leaves blew away."** (Attempts to make leaves the subject but doesn't transform to passive voice or use correct verb form)
*   **"The leaves was blew away by the wind."** (Subject-verb agreement error, incorrect past participle)
*   **"The leaves blowed away by the wind."** (Incorrect past participle, incorrect tense/auxiliary verb)
*   **"The leaves were blowed away by the wind."** (Incorrect past participle)
*   **"The wind blown the leaves away."** (Trying to use "blown" but not changing the voice structure)
*   **"The leaves were blowing away by the wind."** (Incorrect tense/aspect)
*   **"The leaves are blown away by the wind."** (Incorrect auxiliary verb tense)
*   **"The leaves was blown away by the wind."** (Incorrect auxiliary verb for plural subject)
*   **"The wind was blown the leaves away."** (Complete misunderstanding of subject/object swap and passive structure)

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

Considering the severe and fundamental errors seen in other English questions (4-10% pass rates), and the specific challenges of irregular verbs, abstract grammatical terms, and structural changes required for voice transformation:

*   The concept of "voice" itself is likely alien to many.
*   The irregular verb "blown" is a significant hurdle.
*   The multiple steps (identify object, make new subject, use 'to be', use past participle, include 'by agent') increase chances of error.
*   The high incidence of
