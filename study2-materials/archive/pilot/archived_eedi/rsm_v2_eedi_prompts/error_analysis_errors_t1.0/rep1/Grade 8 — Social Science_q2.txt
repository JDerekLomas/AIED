Here's an analysis of the likely errors and an estimated pass rate for the given question:

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

1.  **"Empty Response" / Not Attempted at All (High Probability):**
    *   **Reasoning:** Similar to the observed pass rates and common errors for other Social Science questions, a significant portion of students, especially those from economically weaker sections with limited exposure and English proficiency, might simply leave it blank. This could be due to:
        *   Lack of knowledge about the Harappan Civilization altogether.
        *   Understanding that they don't know the specific *features* of urban planning, even if they've heard of Harappa.
        *   Difficulty comprehending the question "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning" due to the specific vocabulary ("urban planning," "feature").
        *   General test anxiety or a feeling of being overwhelmed by the paper.
    *   **Connection to Common Errors:** This aligns perfectly with the "Empty Response" common error seen in the examples.

2.  **Misconceptions about Harappan Civilization/Social Science (Medium Probability):**
    *   **Wrong Answer Examples:**
        *   "Harappan people ate grain." (Focus on daily life, not urban planning)
        *   "They lived near a river." (Basic geographical fact, not urban planning)
        *   "Harappa was a very old city." (Too general, not a *feature* of urban planning)
        *   "They had a great king." (Incorrect or misremembered detail, not urban planning)
        *   "They made pottery." (Focus on artifacts, not planning)
    *   **Reasoning:** Students might recall *some* fact about Harappa but struggle to connect it specifically to "urban planning." They might throw out a general piece of information they remember from their textbook, hoping it's relevant, or confuse it with other aspects of the civilization. Their understanding of "urban planning" might be rudimentary or non-existent.

3.  **Language Misunderstanding / Difficulty with Specific Vocabulary (Medium Probability):**
    *   **Wrong Answer Examples:**
        *   "Harappan city was very big." (Focus on size, not planning *features*)
        *   "They built houses." (Too generic, doesn't describe a *key feature* of their planning)
        *   "The city was good." (Subjective, not descriptive of planning)
        *   "They had a wall." (Partial truth, but usually the "citadel" is the planned division, not just *any* wall)
    *   **Reasoning:** The terms "key feature" and "urban planning" might be difficult for students with limited English. They might understand "Harappan Civilization" and "city" but struggle with the precise demand of the question. They might describe something vaguely related or too general.

4.  **Attempt but Fail to be Specific Enough (Low to Medium Probability):**
    *   **Wrong Answer Examples:**
        *   "They made their houses in a line." (Getting close to grid layout, but not specific enough about "grid" or "streets")
        *   "They had water pipes." (Getting close to drainage, but not "advanced drainage system")
        *   "They used strong bricks." (Close to baked bricks, but missing the "baked" or "uniformity" aspect)
    *   **Reasoning:** A smaller subset of students might have some glimmer of the correct information but lack the precise vocabulary or detailed understanding to articulate it clearly enough to meet the rubric's standard. This often happens when rote memorization is incomplete.

**Most Common Wrong Answer:**

Based on the observed trends, the most common wrong answer would likely be **"Empty Response."** If a student attempts an answer, it would likely be a general, vague, or somewhat incorrect statement about Harappa that doesn't specifically address urban planning, like "They lived near a river" or "It was a very old city."

**Estimating the Pass Rate:**

Considering the average pass rate of 29% in Social Science for these students, and the specific difficulties of this question:

*   **Complexity of Concept:** "Urban planning" is a somewhat abstract concept, requiring more than just recalling names or dates.
*   **Vocabulary:** "Key feature," "urban planning" can be challenging.
*   **Specific Detail Required:** The rubric demands a *specific* feature (grid, drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town).
*   **Historical Distance:** Harappan Civilization might be covered early in the syllabus and could be easily forgotten or confused.

Given these factors, and the strong tendency for "Empty Responses" or general, unrelated answers, this question is likely to have a lower
