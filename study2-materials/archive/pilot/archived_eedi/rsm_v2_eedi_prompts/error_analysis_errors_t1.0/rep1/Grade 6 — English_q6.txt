Let's break down the question and the likely errors to estimate the pass rate.

**Question:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"
**Rubric:** Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why.
**Max score:** 1.5

**Analysis of the Question and Potential Difficulties:**

1.  **"Which line from the poem..."**:
    *   **Requires Recall/Identification:** Students need to remember lines from the poem, or at least be able to locate them if the poem is provided (often it is, but they still need to *choose* one).
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Line" is a fairly common word, but "from the poem" specifies the source.
    *   **Error Potential:**
        *   Not remembering/identifying *any* specific line.
        *   Quoting something that isn't a line from the poem.
        *   Just writing "I like the poem" without a specific line.

2.  **"...do you like the most..."**:
    *   **Subjectivity/Personal Opinion:** This is a subjective question, which can be both a help and a hindrance. It doesn't require "correct" literary analysis, but rather personal preference.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Like," "most" are common words. "Do you" forms a simple question.
    *   **Error Potential:**
        *   Understanding "like" but struggling with "most" (e.g., just saying "I like this line" without the comparative).
        *   Misunderstanding that they need to express *their own* preference.

3.  **"...and why?"**:
    *   **Reasoning/Elaboration:** This is the most challenging part. It requires students to provide a justification for their choice.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Why" is a fundamental question word.
    *   **Grammar/Sentence Structure:** Expressing a reason requires more complex sentence structures (e.g., "because," "it shows," "I feel"). This is where most students are likely to falter.
    *   **Error Potential:**
        *   Not answering "why" at all.
        *   Giving a very generic or unspecific "why" (e.g., "because it is good," "because I like it").
        *   Giving a reason that is grammatically incorrect or makes no sense.
        *   Repeating the line itself as the "why."
        *   Providing a reason that is off-topic or misinterprets the line.

**Likely Errors leading to incorrect answers:**

1.  **Empty Response/No Attempt (Significant):** Given the pass rates for other questions, many students might simply leave this blank, especially if they find the "why" part too daunting or don't remember any specific lines. This is a very common error (see "Empty Response" examples).
2.  **Quoting a Line, but No "Why" (Very Common):** This is the most probable partial attempt. Students might successfully identify and write down a line they like (e.g., "I like the line 'Walk on water, even though it's raining.'"), but then struggle to articulate *why* they like it, or provide a very simplistic "why" that doesn't meet the rubric's standard for mentioning *why*.
    *   *Common wrong answer:* "I like the line 'The last bargin.' No reason." or "I like the line 'The sun shine.' Because it is good."
3.  **Generic/Insufficient "Why" (Common):** Students might attempt to answer "why" but provide a reason that is too vague, repetitive, or doesn't demonstrate any real understanding or elaboration.
    *   *Common wrong answer:* "I like the line 'He lived in a small hut.' Because I like it." or "I like 'The birds sing.' It is beautiful." (might get partial credit depending on strictness, but often marked down if the reason is not specific enough to the line).
4.  **Grammar/Spelling Errors Making the "Why" Unintelligible (Common):** Even if they have an idea, their limited English proficiency might make their explanation unreadable or nonsensical.
    *   *Common wrong answer:* "I like the line 'The king was powerful.' Becouse he very good for country."
5.  **Misunderstanding "Line from the poem" (Less Common, but possible):**
    *   *Wrong answer:* "I like the story of the poem." (misses "line")
    *   *Wrong answer:* "I like the poem 'The Last Bargain'." (doesn't pick a specific line)
