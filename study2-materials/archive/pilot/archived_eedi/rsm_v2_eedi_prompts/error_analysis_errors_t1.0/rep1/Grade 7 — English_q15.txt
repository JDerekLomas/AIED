Let's break down the likely errors for the question: "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it."

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

*   **Understanding "Paragraph":** This is a significant hurdle. Many students, as seen in the examples, will list things or write very short, fragmented sentences, not a cohesive paragraph. They might understand "write sentences" but not "connect them into a paragraph."
    *   *Misconception:* A paragraph is just a collection of sentences, not necessarily on one topic or with a flow.
*   **Understanding "Short Paragraph (4-5 sentences)":** While the sentence count is explicitly given, the concept of a paragraph and the requirement for *4-5 connected sentences* is likely to be missed. They might write 1-2 sentences, or a list, or exceed the count without coherence.
    *   *Misconception:* Quantity of sentences is the only measure, not quality or connection.
*   **Addressing All Prompts (What, When, Why):** Students often focus on just one aspect (e.g., "what it is") and neglect the others. They might state the hobby but not elaborate on *when* they do it or *why* they enjoy it, or they might give a very simplistic "I like it."
    *   *Misconception:* Only the most prominent instruction needs to be followed, or a single detail is sufficient.
*   **Vocabulary/Sentence Structure Limitations:** Even if they understand the task, their limited English vocabulary and grammar will hinder their ability to express themselves clearly and elaborately enough for a 4-5 sentence paragraph.
    *   *Misconception:* Simple, declarative sentences are enough, regardless of flow or detail.
*   **Spelling and Basic Grammar:** Common errors in spelling, subject-verb agreement, and basic sentence construction will make answers difficult to understand, even if the intent is there.
*   **Translating Directly from Mother Tongue:** They might think in their native language and translate word-for-word, leading to awkward or incorrect English phrasing.

**Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**

Given the topic ("My Favourite Hobby"), this is generally a relatable and less intimidating question than analytical or descriptive tasks (like "describes the poet's writing style"). Therefore, **most students would attempt it.** The failure would largely stem from the inability to meet the *structural* and *detail* requirements of the rubric, rather than a complete lack of understanding of the core topic.

**What would the most common wrong answer look like?**

Based on the provided examples and analysis:

*   **Single-sentence or two-sentence answers:**
    *   "My hobby is cricket. I play everyday." (Fails on paragraph length and detail)
    *   "My favorite hobby is reading. I like it." (Fails on paragraph length, "when," and "why" is too vague)
*   **List-like answers:**
    *   "My hobby is playing. I play cricket. I like cricket. I play in evening." (Better, but still fragmented and not fully developed into a paragraph structure, might miss the "why")
*   **Answers fulfilling "what" but lacking "when" or "why":**
    *   "My favourite hobby is drawing. I draw many pictures." (Missing when and adequate why, too short)
*   **Answers with significant grammatical/spelling errors making it unintelligible or barely coherent, even if the intent is there.**
    *   "My hobby is crike. I go field play. I am very happy." (Shows attempt, but poor English)
*   **Focusing on "favourite" items beyond hobbies (as seen in the example):**
    *   "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles" (Completely off-topic after the first line, doesn't form a paragraph)

**Comparison to Example Pass Rates:**

*   "Describes the poet's writing style" (4%): Highly abstract, very difficult vocabulary/concept.
*   "Write a theme or central idea..." (5%): Requires analytical thinking, understanding literary concepts.
*   "Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby" (10% provided): This is an existing data point, suggesting the difficulty.

My analysis for *this specific question* leads me to believe the existing 10% is probably quite accurate, but if I were to estimate without that prior knowledge, I'd land in a similar range. The prompt is concrete, but the *execution* of a multi-sentence, coherent paragraph meeting all criteria is very challenging
