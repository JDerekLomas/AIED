Let's break down the potential errors for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and common challenges with English.

**Analysis of Likely Errors for "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away."**

**1. Misconceptions about English / Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **Lack of understanding of "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" concepts:** This is the most fundamental barrier. Many students will simply not know what these terms mean, even if they can vaguely understand the individual words. The grammatical terminology itself is complex.
*   **Difficulty identifying Subject and Object:** To change voice, one needs to correctly identify the subject ("the wind") and the object ("the leaves"). This might be a challenge.
*   **Confusion with Tense:** The original sentence is in Simple Past. Students might struggle to maintain the correct tense in the passive voice (using "were blown" instead of "are blown" or "is blown").
*   **Incorrect use of "be" verb:** Understanding that the passive voice requires a form of "to be" (is, am, are, was, were) plus the past participle is a major hurdle. They might just add "by the wind" without changing the verb form.
*   **Incorrect use of Past Participle:** "Blown" is an irregular verb. Students might incorrectly use "blew" again or create a non-existent past participle like "blowed."
*   **Prepositional phrase "by the wind":** While some might grasp this, others might omit it or use an incorrect preposition.

**2. Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**

*   **Attempt and fail:** Given the nature of the question (a specific instruction), most students who read the question will likely attempt *something*, even if it's completely wrong. They won't leave it blank as often as a descriptive question, because it *looks* like a transformation they *might* have learned.
*   **Not attempt at all (Empty Response):** A significant number, particularly those with very low English proficiency, will not understand the instruction "Active Voice to Passive Voice" and might leave it blank. This is a common pattern for questions with specific grammatical terminology.

**3. What would the most common wrong answer look like?**

Based on the above, here are probable common wrong answers, ranked by likelihood:

*   **(Most Common 1) Partial understanding, incorrect verb form/tense:**
    *   "The leaves blew away by the wind." (Keeping the original verb, just adding "by the wind"). This shows recognition of "by the wind" but no understanding of voice change.
    *   "The leaves blow away by the wind." (Changing to simple present).
    *   "The leaves blown away by the wind." (Using past participle but no "be" verb).
*   **(Most Common 2) Completely confused/No understanding of terms:**
    *   "The wind blows the leaves away." (Just re-writing with minor changes or keeping active voice).
    *   "The leaves are blowing the wind." (Flipping subject/object incorrectly).
    *   "The wind was blowing the leaves away." (Changing tense but not voice).
*   **(Most Common 3) Leaving the "by the wind" part:**
    *   "The leaves were blown away." (Correct passive voice, but omitting the agent). While technically passive, the rubric specifies the full transformation. This would be considered partially correct but likely not full marks if strict.
*   **(Common 4) Incorrect Past Participle:**
    *   "The leaves were blowed away by the wind."
*   **(Common 5) Empty Response:**
    *   As observed in other questions, this will still be a significant category for those who find the terminology impenetrable.

**Comparison with "Common Errors" examples:**

*   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%):** This is a much more abstract, interpretative question. "I am reading" suggests a complete misunderstanding of the question's intent. "Empty Response" is high here.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (pass rate: 5%):** Again, interpretive. "The last bargin they about a child and labour..." shows an attempt at content but very poor English and structure.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'..." (pass rate: 10%):** This is a more personal, descriptive task. Errors here are mainly about lack of sentence structure, grammar, and coherence.

The Active/Passive voice question is a *direct grammatical transformation*. It requires specific knowledge, not interpretation or creative writing.
