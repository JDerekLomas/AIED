Here's an analysis of the likely errors and an estimated pass rate for the given question:

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the context (Class 6, Indian government schools, economically weaker sections, limited English, low average pass rates, and common error patterns), here's a breakdown of why students might struggle:

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science:**

*   **Difficulty with "Natural Resources":** While "natural resources" is a fundamental concept, students might struggle with applying it specifically to a region like Rajasthan. They might know general resources but not be able to recall specific ones for Rajasthan.
*   **Lack of Specific Regional Knowledge:** Many students, especially at Class 6, might not have in-depth geographical knowledge of Rajasthan beyond its basic location or a few well-known facts. Recalling two *specific* natural resources for one state can be challenging.
*   **Connecting Resources to Livelihoods:** The second part of the question, "explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there," requires analytical thinking and connecting abstract concepts (resources) to concrete impacts (livelihoods). This is a higher-order thinking skill that Class 6 students, particularly in this demographic, often struggle with, as seen in the "explain how colonial rule..." example. They might list a resource but fail to articulate its influence.
*   **Overgeneralization/Stereotypes:** Students might give very general answers about "water" or "agriculture" without linking it specifically to the *influence* on lives.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Natural Resources":** While "natural resources" might be taught in Hindi (प्राकृतिक संसाधन), the English term might still cause some confusion or limit their ability to retrieve relevant information.
*   **"Influences the lives":** This phrase requires understanding causality and impact, which can be tricky for students with limited English proficiency. They might interpret it too broadly or too narrowly.
*   **"Mention" vs. "Explain":** They might just list resources without explaining, or try to explain without mentioning two distinct resources. The distinction between these two verbs can be subtle for learners.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **High Probability of Attempt:** Unlike "Explain how colonial rule..." which is abstract and complex, "natural resources" is a more tangible concept. Students are likely to attempt this question, even if their answers are vague or incorrect. They might know *some* resource related to Rajasthan (e.g., desert -> sand/water scarcity).
*   **Partial Credit Potential:** The question has two distinct parts (mention two resources, explain influence of one). Students might get one part right and the other wrong, which, given the rubric's "Max score: 1," means they need both.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **Listing only one resource:** "Water." (Fails to mention two).
*   **Listing two resources, but failing to explain influence:** "Water and sand. Water is important." (Fails to explain *how* it influences lives).
*   **Vague explanation of influence:** "Water is very important for people." (Lacks specificity).
*   **Incorrect resources:** "Trees" or "animals" without further context (while natural, not typically highlighted as primary *natural resources* of economic/social significance in Rajasthan in the way minerals or water are).
*   **General geographical facts about Rajasthan, not resources:** "It is a desert." or "There are camels."
*   **Empty Response:** While less likely than for the more complex questions, it's still possible if they are completely lost or overwhelmed. However, given the nature of the question, a vague attempt is more probable.
*   **Misspelled Resources:** "Marbal" instead of "Marble," or similar phonetic spellings. The rubric allows for identification, but severe misspelling might cause issues.

**Likely Path to Failure:**

Students are likely to:
1.  Name one resource correctly (e.g., water, sand).
2.  Struggle to name a *second* specific resource for Rajasthan.
3.  Even if they name two, they will often fail to adequately *explain* how one of them influences the lives of people, offering a very superficial or generic statement instead of a specific impact (e.g., "Water is used for drinking and farming" without linking it to their economic activities, migration patterns, or cultural practices).

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**

Given the challenges in recalling two *specific* resources for a state, the difficulty in articulating the "influence" on lives, and the limited English proficiency in this demographic, the pass rate will be significantly lower than a simple recall question. The common errors on other questions (empty responses, vague attempts, severe language issues) suggest a
