Let's break down the likely errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the context (Class 6 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections, limited English, low average pass rates, and common errors observed), here's what we can expect for "Choose the correct word. There are (some/any) apples in the basket.":

1.  **"Some/Any" is a tricky concept, even for native speakers learning the nuances.**
    *   **Misconception about "some":** Students might associate "some" primarily with *some amount* or *some quantity* in general, not specifically with affirmative statements.
    *   **Misconception about "any":** They might see "any" as simply meaning *some* or *a certain amount*, without understanding its typical use in questions or negative statements.
    *   **Lack of exposure to specific grammar rules:** The explicit rule of "some" in affirmative sentences and "any" in negative sentences/questions might not have been taught or sufficiently practiced. Their exposure to English is likely through very basic texts and conversations, where these subtle distinctions might be overlooked or not explicitly highlighted.

2.  **Lack of understanding of the sentence structure itself:**
    *   The structure "There are..." is common, but if their understanding of basic sentence types (affirmative, negative, interrogative) is weak, they won't be able to apply the "some/any" rule correctly.
    *   They might not recognize "There are... in the basket" as a straightforward affirmative statement.

3.  **Vocabulary/Word Association (less likely to be the primary error here, but possible):**
    *   Could they simply not know the meaning of "some" or "any" in a basic sense? This is less likely given they are Class 6, but their understanding of nuance will be limited. They probably know "some" means "a few" and "any" means "any."

4.  **Influence of Mother Tongue (L1 interference):**
    *   Many Indian languages do not have a direct, simple, and consistently applied equivalent for the "some/any" distinction that English has. This can lead to direct translation errors or a lack of sensitivity to this particular grammatical point. They might use a single word that translates to "a few" or "some" in both affirmative and interrogative contexts in their L1.

5.  **Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**
    *   Unlike the "Describes the poet's writing style" or "Write a theme..." questions where "Empty Response" is common, this is a *multiple-choice-like* selection between two words. Students are highly likely to *attempt* an answer because it's a forced choice and relatively simple in its presentation. They will pick one.

6.  **What would the most common wrong answer look like?**
    *   The most common wrong answer would be **"any."**
    *   Reasons for choosing "any":
        *   They might simply guess.
        *   They might not distinguish between "some" and "any" and see them as interchangeable in this context.
        *   They might have heard "any" used in other contexts (e.g., "Do you have any brothers/sisters?") and incorrectly generalize its use.
        *   Lack of specific knowledge regarding the affirmative context.

**Connecting to Observed Error Patterns:**

*   **"Empty Response":** Less likely here, as it's a simple choice.
*   **Misunderstanding of core English concepts:** Similar to misunderstanding "writing style" or "theme," this demonstrates a lack of understanding of a core grammatical rule (quantifiers).
*   **Simple, direct errors:** Similar to "My hobby is cricket play," where the construction is slightly off, picking "any" would be a simple grammatical error.

---

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**

Considering all the factors:

*   It's a foundational grammar point, but one that is commonly confused.
*   The options are only two, forcing a choice.
*   The sentence structure is relatively simple.
*   The general low pass rate on more complex tasks.
*   The likelihood of L1 interference.

I believe this question is slightly easier than the "writing style" or "theme" questions because it doesn't require complex sentence construction or abstract thinking. It's a binary choice based on a specific rule. However, it's still a point of common confusion.

If students are primarily guessing, it would be 50%. But there will be some who know the rule and some who consistently get it wrong due to misconceptions.

I'd estimate that a significant portion will fall into the "wrong guess" or "consistent misconception" category.
