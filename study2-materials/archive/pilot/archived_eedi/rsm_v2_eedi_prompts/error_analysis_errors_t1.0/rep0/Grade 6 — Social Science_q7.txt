Here's an analysis of the likely errors and an estimated pass rate for the question: "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the context of Class 6 students in Indian government schools from economically weaker sections with limited English, and the common error patterns observed, here's a breakdown:

**1. Content/Social Science Misconceptions:**

*   **Limited Geographical Knowledge of Rajasthan:** While Rajasthan is a prominent state, students might not have a strong grasp of its specific natural resources, especially if their curriculum emphasizes broader concepts or other regions. They might know it's a desert but struggle to name *specific* resources beyond sand/water.
*   **Difficulty Differentiating Natural Resources from Other Features:** Students might confuse natural resources with man-made structures, crops grown, or even famous landmarks.
*   **Lack of Understanding "Influence on Lives":** Even if they name a resource, explaining its *influence* requires a cause-and-effect understanding that might be challenging. For example, they might name "water" but struggle to articulate how its scarcity affects agriculture, daily life, or migration.
*   **Focus on the Obvious, Missing the Less Obvious:** They might correctly identify "sand" or "water" but miss important mineral resources like marble, copper, or gypsum, which are crucial to Rajasthan's economy.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Natural Resources":** While "prakritik sansadhan" might be known in Hindi, the English term itself could be a barrier for some. They might interpret it more broadly as "things found in nature."
*   **"Influence":** This word might be abstract. They might understand "use" but struggle with "influence" which implies a deeper impact on lifestyle, economy, culture, etc.
*   **"Explain how one of them influences":** The two-part nature of the question (list *and* explain) adds complexity. They might answer one part but miss the other.

**3. Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**

*   **High Attempt Rate for Listing:** Naming two things "found in Rajasthan" is relatively straightforward, so most students would likely attempt to list something.
*   **Lower Attempt/Success Rate for Explanation:** The "explain how it influences" part is significantly harder and would lead to many blank responses or very superficial answers.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **Listing Only One Resource:** "Water," "Sand."
*   **Listing Incorrect Resources:** "Camels" (animal, not natural resource), "Forts" (man-made), "Desert" (a landscape, not a resource in itself).
*   **Vague/General Explanations:** "Water is important," "Sand is everywhere." (Doesn't explain *how* it influences lives).
*   **Circular Reasoning:** "Water influences lives because people need water."
*   **Empty Response for Explanation:** Many would simply list two resources and leave the explanation blank.
*   **"Empty Response" (Overall):** As seen in other examples, a significant number of students might still leave the entire question blank due to a combination of lack of knowledge and language barriers, or simply feeling overwhelmed.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%) and Common Errors:**

The other questions (Colonial Rule, Lions on Currency, Ashoka's Reign) are more conceptual, requiring deeper historical understanding or abstract reasoning. This question, "Natural Resources in Rajasthan," is somewhat more concrete, which might slightly increase the *attempt* rate.

However, the "explain how it influences" part is the crucial hurdle for earning the point. Many will list resources but fail the explanation.

*   **Students who correctly list two resources but fail the explanation:** Zero points.
*   **Students who list only one correct resource:** Zero points.
*   **Students who list incorrect resources:** Zero points.
*   **Students with "Empty Response":** Zero points.

The requirement for *two* correct resources *and* a relevant explanation for one makes this question quite demanding for the target group. While "water" and "sand" are very common, explaining their *influence* precisely (e.g., scarcity of water impacts agriculture and migration; sand is used in construction and shapes traditional housing) requires thought.

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

Given the difficulty of the explanation, the common "empty response" pattern, and the typical pass rates for similar questions, I estimate the pass rate for this question would be slightly higher than the 9-12% observed for the more abstract historical/political questions, but still significantly below the average pass rate.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 18%**
