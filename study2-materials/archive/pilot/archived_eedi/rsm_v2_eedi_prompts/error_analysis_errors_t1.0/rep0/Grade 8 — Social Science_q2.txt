Let's break down the likely errors for the question: "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

*   **Misconceptions about Social Science (History):**
    *   **Lack of Specific Knowledge:** Harappan Civilization is typically covered in Class 6/7 history. By Class 8, without strong reinforcement, many students might have forgotten the specifics. They might know "Harappan Civilization" but lack the detailed knowledge of its urban planning.
    *   **Confusion with other ancient civilizations:** Students might confuse Harappan features with those of other ancient civilizations they've studied (e.g., Egyptian pyramids, Mesopotamian ziggurats). While less likely for urban planning, it's possible.
    *   **Focus on broad statements rather than specific features:** Instead of describing a *feature* of urban planning, they might say "it was a great civilization" or "they were good at building." This shows a lack of depth.
    *   **Limited understanding of "urban planning":** They might not fully grasp what "urban planning" entails beyond just "buildings."

*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Key Feature":** Students might struggle to identify *one specific* and *important* feature. They might list something minor or generic.
    *   **"Urban Planning":** While "urban" and "planning" are relatively common words, the combined term might be slightly formal. However, the concept is usually taught with examples. The biggest language barrier here is likely in articulating the *specific* features.
    *   **English Proficiency:** Given the limited English proficiency, even if they have the knowledge, articulating it clearly and correctly in English is a major hurdle. They might use broken English, single words, or incomplete sentences that don't fully convey the feature.

*   **Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**
    *   **High Non-Attempt Rate:** Based on the examples provided (9-12% pass rates for questions like "colonial rule," "lions on notes," "Ashoka's reign"), the "Empty Response" is a very common wrong answer. This suggests a significant proportion of students either don't know the answer at all or cannot articulate it.
    *   **Attempt but Fail:** Some students will attempt it but fail due to:
        *   Incorrect information.
        *   Vague answers.
        *   Language issues preventing a clear description.
        *   Listing something correct but not a "key feature of urban planning" (e.g., "they had pottery," "they grew wheat").

*   **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   **"Empty Response":** Given the trends, this is highly probable for a significant chunk.
    *   **Vague/Generic Answer:** "They built good cities." / "They were advanced." / "They had houses." (Doesn't describe a *key feature of urban planning*).
    *   **Incorrect/Irrelevant Information:** Listing features of other civilizations, or just general facts about Harappan civilization that aren't about urban planning (e.g., "They worshipped nature," "Indus Valley people").
    *   **Single words/phrases (unclear):** "Drainage." (Potentially correct but too brief without context, depends on leniency of marking). "Bricks."

**Connecting to Provided Examples:**

The pass rates for the example questions are very low (9-12%). The Harappan Civilization question is historical, similar to "Ashoka's reign." The "lions on notes" question is also history/civics related, requiring specific knowledge and explanation.

The common errors ("Empty Response," vague/incorrect answers) are highly likely here too. "Ashok a second," "Asher' stand" for the lion question suggest students are grasping at straws, trying to relate something vaguely similar or misspelling known figures. This indicates a very weak knowledge base and inability to recall or construct a coherent answer.

**Pass Rate Estimation:**

The question is fairly straightforward if the student has retained the knowledge. "Grid layout," "drainage system," "baked bricks," "citadel/lower town" are distinct and usually emphasized points. However, the low average pass rate for Class 8 (29%) and the extremely low pass rates for similar specific-knowledge questions (9-12%) are major indicators.

While "urban planning" is a core concept for Harappan civilization, the challenges are:
1.  **Recall:** Remembering these specific features from previous classes.
2.  **Articulation:** Describing them clearly in English.

Considering the high frequency of "Empty Response" and vague answers for similar questions, I anticipate the pass rate will be on the lower side, similar to the specific historical questions provided. It'
