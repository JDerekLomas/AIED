Let's break down the likely errors for the question: "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it."

**Common Errors & Misconceptions:**

*   **Paragraph Structure Misunderstanding:** This is a major one. Students are taught to write sentences, but the concept of a cohesive "paragraph" with related ideas is often not well-understood, especially when the prompt explicitly asks for 4-5 sentences. They might write isolated sentences about the hobby.
*   **Lack of Elaboration/Detail:** Even if they identify a hobby, describing *when* they do it and *why* they enjoy it requires more complex sentence structures and vocabulary than they typically possess. They might state "I play cricket" but struggle to articulate "I play cricket after school with my friends because it makes me happy."
*   **Direct Translation/Grammar Issues:**
    *   **Tense Confusion:** They might use present continuous ("I am playing cricket") instead of simple present ("I play cricket").
    *   **Subject-Verb Agreement:** "My hobby are cricket."
    *   **Prepositional Errors:** "I play cricket on evening."
    *   **Simple Sentence Reliance:** Stringing together very short, choppy sentences without conjunctions or flow.
*   **Vocabulary Limitations:** Describing *why* they enjoy something requires a more nuanced vocabulary ("relaxing," "challenging," "fun," "learn new things"). They might default to very basic terms like "good" or simply omit the "why" altogether.
*   **Focus on Listing vs. Describing:** The examples given ("My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho") show a tendency to list hobbies or related items rather than elaborating on a single one. They might list several things they like, without focusing on *one* "favourite hobby."
*   **Incomplete Responses/Not Meeting Sentence Count:** The prompt specifically asks for 4-5 sentences. Many will likely write 1-2 sentences and stop, either due to inability to elaborate or simply not understanding the sentence count requirement for a "paragraph."
*   **"My Favourite Hobby *is*..." Trap:** Students might start with this phrase and then struggle to move beyond it or elaborate.
*   **"Empty Response":** As seen in other questions, some students will not attempt the question at all, possibly due to intimidation by the length requirement or complete lack of comprehension.

**What the Most Common Wrong Answer Would Look Like:**

1.  **Too Short & Lacking Detail:**
    *   "My hobby is cricket. I play everyday." (Fails to meet sentence count, doesn't explain *why* enjoyed).
    *   "I like drawing. It is fun." (Too short, lacks detail on *when* and insufficient *why*).
2.  **Listing, Not Paragraph:**
    *   "My favourite hobby is playing. I play badminton. I play cricket. I like to read books." (Lists multiple activities instead of focusing on one and elaborating in a paragraph format).
3.  **Grammatically Awkward & Choppy:**
    *   "My favorite hobby is reading. I read book in evening. I like read. It make me happy." (Attempts all parts but very poor grammar and flow, barely meets sentence count).
4.  **Misinterpretation of "Paragraph":**
    *   "My hobby is reading books. I read them after dinner. Reading makes me feel calm. It helps me to learn new things. I really enjoy it." (This would actually be a good answer, but many would struggle to achieve this level of coherence and detail).

**Analyzing Against the Rubric:** "Student writes a complete paragraph that clearly mentions the hobby, when it is done, and why it is enjoyable."

*   "Complete paragraph": This is a significant hurdle. Many will fail here due to lack of cohesion or insufficient sentence count.
*   "Clearly mentions the hobby": Most will get this part.
*   "When it is done": Many will attempt this but might be vague or grammatically incorrect.
*   "Why it is enjoyable": This requires abstract thought and specific vocabulary, which is often lacking. Many will omit this or give a very simplistic answer ("it is good").

**Impact of Previous Pass Rates:**

*   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (4%): This is a much more abstract and analytical question, requiring higher-order thinking and sophisticated vocabulary. The low pass rate is expected.
*   "Write a theme or central idea..." (5%): Similar to the above, abstract and analytical.
*   "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what" (10%
