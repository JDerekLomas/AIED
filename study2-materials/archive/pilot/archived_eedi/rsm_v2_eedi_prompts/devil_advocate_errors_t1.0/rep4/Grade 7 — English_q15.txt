Here's my calibrated estimate, challenging my initial instinct.

Initial instinct: "This is a very common topic, many students would know how to write about their hobby. Maybe 30-40%."

Challenging assumptions:

*   **Limited English:** The common errors provided for similar questions are stark. "I am reading" for "describes the poet's writing style" shows an inability to even grasp the *type* of response required, let alone formulate it. "My hobby is cricket play" indicates a struggle with basic sentence structure and appropriate vocabulary for a simple topic. "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho" is a list, not a paragraph with reasons.
*   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic:** While "My Favourite Hobby" seems basic to a fluent English speaker, the *structure* of a paragraph (4-5 sentences, clear topic, when, why) is not inherently known. Many students struggle with linking ideas, expanding sentences, and organizing thoughts in English.
*   **Exam anxiety:** This often leads to blank responses or incomplete answers, as seen in the "Empty Response" examples for other questions.
*   **Lack of practice:** Even if the *topic* is familiar, the specific demand of "4-5 sentences," "mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it" might be a new or infrequently practiced task. Many might just list the hobby.
*   **Rubric strictness:** The rubric requires a *complete paragraph* that *clearly mentions* all three elements. This is a high bar for students struggling with basic English. "My hobby is cricket play" would not meet this. "My Favowrife Hobby cbaking\nMy Favowrife" clearly doesn't either.

Given the common errors observed for similar questions (especially the paragraph-writing prompt with a 10% pass rate) and the general low pass rates, my estimate needs to be significantly lower than my first thought. Even though the topic is "simple," the *execution in English under exam conditions with specific requirements* is not.

The 10% pass rate for a very similar "short paragraph" question is a strong indicator. This question asks for slightly more specific details within the paragraph ("what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it"), which could make it marginally harder to fulfill completely and correctly, even if the general topic is familiar.

**Calibrated Estimate:** 12%
