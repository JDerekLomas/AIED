Let's break down the thought process to arrive at a calibrated estimate.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**
My first thought, as someone with a strong educational background, is "This is a very basic geometry question. Most Class 7 students *should* know this." I recall learning this in late primary or early middle school. My internal voice says, "Maybe 60-70%."

**Challenging the Instinct based on the provided context:**

1.  **"Mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English."**
    *   **English:** The question is in English. While "find the area," "triangle," "base," "height," and "cm" are relatively common terms, a student with *limited* English might struggle with the syntax or even just the confidence to attempt it. "Whose" can be tricky.
    *   **Limited Exposure:** Students from economically weaker sections often have less exposure to books, supplementary learning materials, and home environments conducive to academic support.

2.  **"Average pass rate is about 29%."**
    *   This is a crucial data point. If the *average pass rate* for all subjects/questions is 29%, then a *single* question isn't going to have a significantly higher success rate unless it's exceptionally easy. While this question isn't *exceptionally* hard, it's not a simple recall of a fact.

3.  **"Teachers and experts consistently MISJUDGE item difficulty."**
    *   This explicitly tells me to doubt my initial assessment. I am an "expert" in the sense of having a strong grasp of the concept.

4.  **Specific Challenges for Struggling Learners:**
    *   **"How limited many students' English actually is":** Even if they know the *concept* in their native language, translating "area," "base," "height" into a formula and then executing it in English can be a barrier.
    *   **"That 'basic' concepts aren't basic for struggling learners":** For a student who struggles with mathematics generally, even the concept of area, let alone the specific formula for a triangle, might not be firmly grasped. They might confuse it with the area of a rectangle or square.
    *   **"That exam anxiety causes blank responses":** A student who is unsure might just skip it, especially if they are intimidated by the English or the numbers.
    *   **"That many students have never practiced this exact question type":** While they might have learned the formula, they might not have practiced it with concrete numbers in this specific sentence structure.

**Re-evaluation of the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question:** "Find the area of a triangle whose base is `8` cm and height is `6` cm."
*   **Rubric:** "States or uses the correct formula for the area of a triangle: `Area = 1/2 × base × height`."
    *   This means *just recalling/writing the formula* gets the point, even if they mess up the calculation. This makes it slightly easier than if they had to get the final numerical answer correct.
    *   However, they need to *identify* that it's a triangle, identify "base" and "height," and recall the specific fraction (1/2). Many might recall "base x height" but forget the 1/2.

**Calibrating the Estimate:**

*   Considering the low overall pass rate (29%).
*   Considering the English language barrier.
*   Considering that "1/2" is a common error point even for students who know base x height.
*   Considering the general struggle level described.
*   The fact that they only need to *state or use* the formula, not calculate the final answer, is the only factor pushing the estimate *up* slightly.

If the average pass rate is 29%, this question is likely somewhat *above* the average recall task, as it involves recalling a specific formula and applying it to given terms. However, the common errors (English, forgetting 1/2) will pull it down significantly.

*   Could 50% get this? Probably not, given the context.
*   Could 40% get this? Still feels high.
*   Could 30% get this? This is close to the average pass rate. If it's a "standard" question, it might be around there.
*   Could 20% get this? This accounts for the struggles.

Let's think about a student who *might* get this. They would need to:
1.  Understand "area," "triangle," "base," "height" in English.
2.  Recall the correct
