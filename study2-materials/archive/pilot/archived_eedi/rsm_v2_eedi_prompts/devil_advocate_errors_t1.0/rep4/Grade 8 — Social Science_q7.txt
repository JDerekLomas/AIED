Let's break down the question and the context before estimating.

**Understanding the Question:**
"How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"

*   **Key terms:** Battle of Plassey, 1757, British power, India, contribute, expansion.
*   **Core concept:** The *consequence* of Plassey, specifically its role in *increasing* British influence.
*   **Expected answer (from rubric):** Victory led to British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., puppet nawab Mir Jafar).

**Student Profile & Challenges:**

1.  **Economically Weaker Sections, Limited English:**
    *   "Contribute to the expansion of" is moderately complex English for a struggling learner. "Expansion" itself might be understood, but "contribute to" adds a layer of abstraction.
    *   Many will struggle to formulate a coherent sentence in English, even if they grasp the core idea.

2.  **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is a strong indicator of overall difficulty across the Social Science exam. Our question needs to be viewed through this lens.

3.  **Common Errors (as provided):**
    *   **"Empty Response":** Dominant error for conceptual questions, indicating either no understanding, inability to articulate, or exam anxiety.
    *   **Gibberish/Partial Answers:** "Asher' stand," "ashok a second," "Ashok seamb" for the Lion question. This shows an attempt but a complete lack of grasp of the topic or English.
    *   **Factual Recall vs. Explanation:** The "lions on currency" and "Ashoka's reign" questions are about explaining *why* something is significant or *how* something is depicted. Our question is similar: *how* did Plassey *contribute*. This requires more than just knowing Plassey happened; it requires connecting it to a larger trend (British expansion).

4.  **Teachers' Misjudgment:** This is the most crucial warning. My first instinct *might* be "Plassey is fundamental to modern Indian history, they must know it." But I must resist that.

    *   **"Basic" Concepts:** While Plassey is "basic" in the grand narrative, for a struggling student, remembering the *specific impact* (political dominance over Bengal, puppet nawab) rather than just "British won" is not basic.
    *   **Absent for Topic:** A student who missed the specific class or didn't pay attention would likely have no idea.
    *   **Exam Anxiety:** Leads to "Empty Response."
    *   **Never Practiced this Exact Question Type:** While they might have learned about Plassey, being asked "how it *contributed to the expansion*" might be subtly different from "what was the outcome of Plassey?" and trip them up.

**Revisiting the Rubric & Required Depth:**
The rubric is specific: "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)." This isn't just about winning; it's about the *political consequence*.

*   Could a struggling student articulate "political dominance" or "puppet nawab" in English?
*   Would they simply say "British won" or "British got more power," which might not fully meet the rubric's specific depth? (Though "British got more power" would likely get partial credit if they accepted "expansion of British power" as a direct answer). The rubric says "dominance/control over Bengal," suggesting a regional focus.

**Calibrating the Estimate:**

*   Given the *very low* pass rates for similar explanatory questions (9-12%), this question is in the same league.
*   The required nuance (political dominance, control over Bengal) combined with the English barrier and the prevalence of "Empty Response" is very concerning.
*   The "puppet nawab" detail is a key marker of deeper understanding.
*   Even if a student knows "British won Bengal," expressing "political dominance" in English is hard.

If the average pass rate is 29%, and conceptual questions are consistently in the 9-12% range, this question, which requires conceptual understanding and articulation in English, is likely to be on the lower end.

I'll start with an initial thought: 20-25% (still too high, fighting the bias).
Now, apply the teachers' misjudgment warning:
*   English barrier: significantly reduces ability to articulate the correct answer.
*   "Basic" concept: It's not basic to explain the *political implications* in detail.
*   Anxiety/Blank: A huge factor.
*   Never practiced: The
