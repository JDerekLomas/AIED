Let's break down the thought process for estimating the proportion correct for this question.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):**

My first instinct, looking at "book/reading/a/is/he", is "Oh, that's simple! He is reading a book." I'd think 70-80% would get this.

**Challenging the Instinct (applying the provided context):**

1.  **Limited English, Economically Weaker Sections:**
    *   This is *not* a trivial sentence structure for someone with very limited English. They might know individual words like "book" and "he," but the *grammar* for forming a complete, correct sentence is a higher-level skill.
    *   The examples of common errors show a fundamental misunderstanding of even basic question prompts and an inability to construct simple sentences. "I am reading" for "Describes the poet's writing style" is a huge red flag about grammatical comprehension. "My hobby is cricket play" shows subject-verb agreement and word order issues.

2.  **Average Pass Rate 29%:**
    *   This is a crucial anchor. If the *average* pass rate is 29%, then a question needs to be significantly easier than average to be much higher than that. Is "Rearrange words into a sentence" *significantly* easier than all other tasks on the exam, including comprehension and paragraph writing, especially given the English limitations? Probably not *that* much easier.

3.  **Common Errors Analysis:**
    *   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass rate) - This shows students struggle *immensely* with understanding even slightly abstract prompts and producing any meaningful English. The sentence rearrangement is concrete, but it still requires grammatical understanding.
    *   "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate) - Again, very low, indicating deep struggles with expressing ideas in English.
    *   "Write a short paragraph..." (10% pass rate) - Even forming basic sentences about a familiar topic is hard. Look at "My hobby is cricket play" – this is essentially the same grammatical structure as "He is reading a book," but they got it wrong. This is a *direct parallel* to the current question's difficulty.

4.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) is "basic" for native speakers or advanced learners. For students learning English from scratch, especially without consistent exposure or good quality teaching, it's a learned rule, and one that can easily be confused with other word orders (e.g., Verb-Subject-Object in some Indian languages, though Hindi generally uses SOV).
    *   The "is" placement (auxiliary verb) is also a point of potential confusion.

5.  **Exam Anxiety & Blank Responses:**
    *   The high number of "Empty Response" answers in the examples for other questions confirms this. Students who are unsure are likely to leave it blank rather than risk being wrong.
    *   If they don't *immediately* see the correct order, the anxiety might kick in.

6.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   While rearranging words is a common exercise, we can't assume they've practiced it enough or in a way that solidifies the SVO structure. Given the overall low English proficiency, gaps in teaching and practice are highly probable.

**Revisiting the Question's Specifics:**

*   `book/reading/a/is/he`
*   The words are common.
*   The target sentence `He is reading a book.` is a very common and simple SVO structure.

**Synthesizing the Information:**

*   It's simpler than the paragraph writing (10%), theme writing (5%), or style description (4%). So, it should be *higher* than those.
*   It's very similar in grammatical complexity to "My hobby is cricket play" (incorrect example from the 10% pass rate question), which suggests students *do* struggle with this fundamental SVO structure.
*   The average pass rate is 29%. This question is likely on the easier side of the overall exam, but probably not *massively* easier, given the deep-seated issues with English.
*   Many will likely get "He is book reading a" or "Reading he is a book" or similar incorrect permutations.
*   The "Empty Response" factor will pull the score down.
*   Even if they know the individual words, forming the *correct* SVO sentence requires a grammatical rule they might not have fully internalized or recalled under pressure.
