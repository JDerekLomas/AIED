Let's break down the challenge of this question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering the provided context.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**
My first instinct might be: "This is a basic grammar transformation. They learn active/passive voice. Maybe 20-30%."

**Challenging the Instinct based on the evidence:**

1.  **Limited English Proficiency (LEP):** The common errors show extremely basic struggles. "I am reading" for "describes the poet's writing style" indicates a severe disconnect between the question's language and the student's comprehension.
2.  **Specific Grammatical Transformation:** While "active/passive voice" might be covered, applying it requires:
    *   **Understanding the original sentence:** "The wind blew the leaves away." (Relatively straightforward, but "blew away" is a phrasal verb, which can sometimes trip up LEP students).
    *   **Identifying Subject, Verb, Object:** Wind (subject), blew (verb), leaves (object).
    *   **Knowing the rules for passive voice:** Object becomes subject, "be" verb + past participle, original subject becomes "by" phrase (optional).
    *   **Correctly forming the past participle:** "blew" -> "blown." This is an irregular verb, a common pitfall.
    *   **Choosing the correct form of "to be":** "were" (past tense, plural for "leaves").
    *   **Synthesizing the new sentence:** "The leaves were blown away by the wind."

3.  **Common Errors Data:**
    *   Pass rates for simple *comprehension* (like theme or writing style) are 4-5%. This question requires a *transformation* using specific grammar rules, which is arguably more complex than simply understanding a theme, especially with LEP.
    *   The "My Favourite Hobby" example shows students struggling with sentence structure and basic vocabulary even in personal narrative.
    *   Blank responses are a significant issue, indicating either lack of knowledge, inability to formulate an answer, or anxiety.

4.  **Teacher Overestimation Warning:** The prompt explicitly states teachers overestimate. This reinforces the need to be conservative.

5.  **Lack of Practice:** "many students have never practiced this exact question type." Even if they know the *theory*, practical application under exam conditions is different.

**Revisiting the Difficulty:**

*   **Past Participle of Irregular Verb:** "Blew" to "blown" is a significant hurdle. Many might write "was blowed" or similar.
*   **Correct "to be" verb:** "Were" vs. "was" vs. "is" vs. "are" is another decision point.
*   **Sentence Structure:** Rearranging the elements correctly.
*   **"by the wind" clause:** Some might omit it, others might place it incorrectly.

Given that students struggle with much simpler English tasks and provide "Empty Response" for even thematic questions, the cognitive load required for this specific grammatical transformation, including an irregular verb and correct auxiliary verb usage, is very high.

The 5% pass rate for "Write a theme or central idea..." is a good benchmark for a task that requires *some* understanding and formulation. This active/passive transformation requires specific rule application and correct verb forms, which might be even harder for a significant portion of these students.

I would expect a very small percentage to get this *perfectly* correct. Some might get partial credit if the rubric allowed for it (e.g., getting "the leaves were blown" but missing "by the wind" or using "was"). However, the rubric asks for the *exact* transformation.

Considering the extreme limitations in English and the high rate of "Empty Response" or completely off-topic answers for other questions, I anticipate a very low success rate for a perfect answer here.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 7%
