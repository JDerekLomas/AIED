Okay, let's break this down, keeping all the caveats in mind.

**Analyzing the Question:**

*   **"Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan"**: This part is relatively straightforward. Many students in India, even those struggling, learn about basic geography and resources in different states. Rajasthan is famous for its desert, minerals, and also issues with water. Common resources like sand, salt, marble, and even sunlight are pretty widely known.
*   **"and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."**: This is where the difficulty significantly increases.
    *   **"explain"**: This requires more than just naming. It requires articulating a cause-and-effect relationship.
    *   **"influences the lives of the people"**: This necessitates linking a resource to daily life, economy, culture, or challenges.
    *   **Language Barrier**: Explaining requires more sophisticated English than simply naming. "Influence" itself might be a slightly more abstract verb for students with limited vocabulary.
    *   **Conceptual Understanding**: Even if they know salt is found in Rajasthan, linking it to the economy of Sambhar Lake or the diet of people, or linking water scarcity to migration or agricultural practices, requires a deeper understanding and the ability to express it.

**Considering Common Errors and Teacher Overestimation:**

*   **"Empty Response"**: This is a huge factor. Anxiety, lack of understanding, or even just difficulty translating thoughts into English will lead to many blanks. The "explain" part is a prime candidate for this.
*   **Limited English**: "Explain how one of them influences" is a multi-clause sentence with a slightly abstract verb. Many will struggle to form coherent sentences, even if they have a vague idea. They might name two resources correctly but then fail completely on the explanation part, thus scoring 0.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic**: While resources are basic, the *explanation* of their *influence* on *lives* is not basic for a struggling learner. It moves beyond rote memorization into analysis.
*   **Absence/Lack of Practice**: This question format (identify + explain the impact) is common in Social Science but might not have been specifically practiced for *this exact combination* of resource and impact, leading to struggle.

**Challenging My First Instinct:**

My initial thought might be that many could name two resources (sand, water, marble). But then I recall the low pass rates on other "explain" questions (9-12%), which often also involved naming or identifying *something* before the explanation. The "lions on currency" question, for instance, is simpler in its initial identification, yet still very low. The "Ashoka's reign" question also asks for significance (similar to influence).

The key is that the *entire* question must be answered correctly to get the point. Naming two resources *without a correct explanation* gets 0.

Given the typical pass rate of 29% for the overall exam, and the particularly low rates for "explain" questions in Social Science, this question, which has *two parts* (identification and explanation), where the explanation part is conceptually more demanding and linguistically challenging, is likely to perform worse than the average.

The rubric says "Max score: 1" and the question asks for "proportion correct." This means a student either gets it fully right (two resources + correct explanation for one) or gets 0. Partial credit isn't implied for just naming.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Considering:
*   The "explain" component is very difficult for this cohort.
*   The "influence" concept is abstract.
*   The high likelihood of "Empty Response" or insufficient explanation due to language/anxiety.
*   The low pass rates on similar "explain" questions (9-12%).
*   The need for *both* parts to be correct for 1 point.

I would estimate this question's pass rate to be significantly lower than the average 29%. I'm leaning towards the lower end of the "explain" type questions.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **15%**
