Here's a breakdown of why the pass rate for "Describes the poet's writing style" is likely to be very low, leading to my calibrated estimate.

**Initial Instinct vs. Calibrated Reality:**

My initial instinct, as someone with a strong English background, might be: "This is a pretty straightforward question. They just need to pick an adjective." However, considering the context, this instinct is deeply flawed.

**Factors for Low Pass Rate (Challenging Assumptions):**

1.  **Limited English Proficiency:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** The word "describes" itself might be challenging for many. "Writing style" is an even more abstract and advanced concept. Students might know "write" but not "writing style."
    *   **Abstract Concepts:** "Style" is an abstract noun. Students are often more comfortable with concrete nouns and simple verbs. Understanding what "style" means in the context of writing (e.g., *how* someone writes, not *what* they write) is a significant hurdle.
    *   **Formulating an Answer:** Even if they grasp the concept, finding an *appropriate English word* (simple, descriptive, informal, direct) and spelling it correctly, or forming a simple sentence, is a high bar.

2.  **Lack of Exposure/Practice:**
    *   **Literary Analysis:** Discussing a poet's "writing style" is a basic element of literary analysis in higher-level English education. For students with limited exposure to English literature or even basic comprehension, this type of analytical question is likely completely new.
    *   **Specific Question Type:** As noted, many students have "never practiced this exact question type." They might be used to factual recall or simple comprehension questions, not analytical ones.

3.  **Common Errors Observed:**
    *   "Q: 'Describes the poet’s writing style.' (pass rate: 4%) Wrong answer: 'I am reading.'" This error confirms the lack of understanding of "describes" and "writing style." The student is likely latching onto "poet" and trying to connect it to a personal reading activity.
    *   "Q: 'Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."'" (pass rate: 5%) This is another analytical question, and the results are similarly abysmal, indicating a systemic difficulty with such tasks. The example incorrect answer ("The last bargin they about a child and labour...") shows an attempt to recall content but not to identify a "theme" or "idea."
    *   "Q: 'Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'.'" (pass rate: 10%) Even a more personal, less analytical task like this has a very low pass rate and shows students struggle with sentence structure and basic paragraphing, let alone abstract descriptions.

4.  **Exam Anxiety and Blank Responses:** The prevalence of "Empty Response" in the examples for similar questions further confirms that many students will simply not attempt it because they don't understand or feel capable.

5.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** What seems "basic" to an English-proficient person (like identifying a writing style) is a sophisticated concept for a struggling learner, especially when coupled with the language barrier.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Given the extreme difficulty of similar analytical questions (4-5% pass rate), the abstract nature of "writing style," the high English language demands, and the observed common errors, I would expect the pass rate for "Describes the poet's writing style" to be *extremely* low. The existing data point of 4% for this *exact question* is highly indicative and likely accurate. My estimate should not deviate much from that data.

My calibrated estimate, acknowledging all the challenges and forcing myself to ignore my own linguistic privilege, would be:

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 5%**
