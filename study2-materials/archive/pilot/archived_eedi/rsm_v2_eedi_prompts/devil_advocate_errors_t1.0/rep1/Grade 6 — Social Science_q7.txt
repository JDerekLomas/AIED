Here's my calibrated estimate, challenging initial assumptions:

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**
My first thought was "Rajasthan is known for deserts and minerals, so students should know sand and a mineral or two." I also thought mentioning the impact of water scarcity or solar energy would be relatively straightforward. This would lead to a higher estimate, perhaps 30-40%.

**Challenging Assumptions (based on provided context):**

*   **Limited English:** The question requires both *mentioning* and *explaining*. Even if they know the resources, articulating the "how it influences lives" in English will be a significant hurdle. They might list resources but fail the explanation.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While Rajasthan's resources might seem "basic" to an expert, remembering *two* specific natural resources *and* their influence, especially if they haven't rote-learned it or understood the concept well, is challenging.
*   **Common Errors - "Empty Response":** The extremely high rate of "Empty Response" in other Social Science questions (9-12% pass rate) is a huge red flag. This indicates many students simply cannot answer, perhaps due to comprehension, knowledge gaps, or anxiety.
*   **Common Errors - Vague/Incorrect Answers:** The example of "Asher' stand" for Ashoka's lions shows a complete misinterpretation or inability to recall. This question, while less abstract, still requires specific knowledge.
*   **Absence/Lack of Practice:** If a student was absent or didn't practice this specific *type* of question (name two, explain one's influence), they will struggle.
*   **"Influence on lives":** This requires a slightly more analytical step than just listing. They need to connect the resource to daily activities, economy, or culture. For example, knowing "water" isn't enough; they need to say "water scarcity leads to..." or "solar energy provides power for homes/pumps." This level of detail is difficult for the described demographic.
*   **Rubric:** The rubric requires *two correct natural resources* and then *explanation for one*. A student might get one resource right but not two, or get two but fail the explanation. This is a multi-part requirement.

**Recalibration:**

Given the low pass rates on other Social Science questions (9-12%), the high incidence of "Empty Response," the limited English proficiency, and the multi-part requirement of this question (list two, explain one), I expect a significant drop from an initial optimistic guess.

While Rajasthan's resources are prominent, the *articulation* in English, especially the "how it influences" part, will be the major blocker. Many might list one or two resources but fail to explain, or their explanation might be too basic or incorrect to score.

I need to factor in students who:
1.  Don't know any resources.
2.  Know only one resource.
3.  Know two resources but cannot explain.
4.  Know two resources and provide a poor explanation.
5.  Are simply overwhelmed and leave it blank.

Considering the average pass rate is 29% and the cited Social Science examples are much lower (9-12%), this question, while seemingly straightforward on the surface, involves multiple hurdles for this specific group. The need for an *explanation* elevates its difficulty significantly beyond just naming items.

My estimate will be closer to the lower end of the Social Science pass rates provided.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 15%**
