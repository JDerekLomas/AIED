Let's break down the question and the context.

**The Question:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"

**Rubric:** "Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why."

**Key Challenges for Students:**

1.  **Reading Comprehension (of the poem itself):** They first need to understand the poem to even *have* a favorite line. Given the pass rates on other comprehension questions, this is a significant hurdle.
2.  **Vocabulary:** "Denotes," "mentions," "most," "why" – while seemingly simple, these words can be tricky for students with limited English. "Why" in particular often trips them up, leading to descriptive answers instead of causal ones.
3.  **Syntactic Complexity:** The question combines two parts: identifying a line AND explaining the reason. This two-part command is more complex than a single-part command.
4.  **Recall/Selection:** They need to remember a specific line from the poem and then choose one. This assumes they've engaged with the poem sufficiently.
5.  **Expressing Preference and Justification:** This requires higher-order thinking and the ability to articulate a subjective opinion in English.
    *   **"Which line... do you like the most?"**: Requires personal reflection and selection.
    *   **"...and why?"**: Requires cause-and-effect reasoning and expressing a justification. This is a common weak point (e.g., "I like it because it's good" or simply rephrasing the line).
6.  **Writing Skills:** They need to write a coherent sentence or two. The common errors show fragmented sentences, lack of structure, and poor grammar even on simpler tasks.

**Considering Common Errors and Teacher Overestimation:**

*   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass):** This question is *much* harder, requiring abstract thinking and meta-analysis of language. The current question is more concrete (picking a line).
*   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass):** This is also abstract. The current question is more personal.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'." (10% pass):** This is similar in structure (describe something and give details/reasons) but the topic is *very* familiar and personal, potentially making it easier. Even then, the pass rate is very low. The poem context adds complexity.

**Challenging My First Instinct:**

My first instinct might be: "It's asking for personal preference, that's easy! They just need to pick a line and say 'I like it because it's nice' or something similar."

*   **Rebuttal 1: "Picking a line is easy."** No, it's not. They need to have understood the poem enough to *have* a favorite line, or at least a recognizable one. Many might just copy the first line or a random one. If they didn't understand the poem, they have nothing to choose from genuinely.
*   **Rebuttal 2: "Saying 'I like it because it's nice' is easy."** While simple, even this minimal justification might not occur to them, or they might struggle to formulate it correctly in English. The common errors show answers like "I am reading" or merely rephrasing the question. Many will just copy a line without explanation. Many will leave it blank because they don't know *what* to say for "why."
*   **Rebuttal 3: "It's about *them*, so it's engaging."** While true, the barrier of English comprehension and expression often trumps engagement. If they don't understand the question or the poem, engagement is irrelevant.

**Comparing to "My Favourite Hobby" (10% pass):**

*   **Familiarity:** "My Favourite Hobby" is extremely familiar. The poem and its lines are not.
*   **Lexicon:** They have a pre-existing internal vocabulary for their hobby. For the poem, they rely entirely on the text provided, which might contain unfamiliar words.
*   **Justification:** Justifying a hobby is natural. Justifying a preference for a poem line requires more abstract reasoning about language, imagery, or emotion, which is harder.

**Considering the "Average Pass Rate ~29%":** This is a general average across *all* questions. Questions requiring more than basic recall or direct transcription consistently perform far worse.

**Revised Estimate:**

*   The need to **comprehend the poem** to select a meaningful line is a major blocker.
*   The need to **articulate a "why"** in English is another significant hurdle, often leading to generic answers, repetition, or
