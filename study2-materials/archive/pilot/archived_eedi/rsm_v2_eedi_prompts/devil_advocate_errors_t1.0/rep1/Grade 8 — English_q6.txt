Let's break down the question "Define fable" considering the student profile and common errors.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):** My first thought might be "Fable is a fairly common word, they've probably encountered it. Maybe 30-40%?" This is the trap the experts fall into.

**Challenging the Instinct:**

1.  **Limited English:** "Define" itself might be challenging for some. "Fable" is a specific literary term. While it might be mentioned in textbooks, active recall of its *definition* is a higher-level task than simply recognizing the word.
2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** Even if they've heard of fables (e.g., "The Lion and the Mouse"), articulating a formal definition that includes "short story," "animals as characters," and "moral lesson" is complex. They might give examples, or a partial definition.
3.  **Common Error Patterns:**
    *   **Empty Response:** Given the low pass rates on other "define/describe" questions, a significant number will leave it blank. "Describes the poet's writing style" had a 4% pass rate, and many were empty. This question is similar in demanding a *definition*.
    *   **Partial/Incorrect Understanding:** They might say "story with animals" but miss the moral, or vice versa, or struggle to form a coherent sentence.
    *   **Tangential Answers:** Like the "My favourite hobby" example, they might write about a specific fable, or generally about "stories."
    *   **Anxiety:** Leading to blanks.
4.  **No Practice with *This Exact Question Type*:** While they might study fables, how often are they asked to *define* a literary term in this formal way, in English, without scaffolding? The low pass rates on similar questions suggest not often or not effectively.
5.  **Comparison to Other Questions:**
    *   "Describes the poet's writing style" (4%): Requires abstract understanding and articulation.
    *   "Write a theme or central idea" (5%): Requires understanding of a literary concept and articulation.
    *   "Define fable" falls squarely into this category. It's not a comprehension question about a specific text they just read, but a test of their understanding of a literary term.

**Revised Estimation:**

Considering the very low pass rates on comparable questions (4-5% for "describe" and "theme"), and the likelihood of empty responses or incomplete definitions due to limited English and lack of practice with this question type, "Define fable" is a very challenging question.

While "fable" itself might be slightly more concrete than "poet's writing style," the *act of defining it comprehensively* in English for a full score is highly difficult for this population. Many might give "stories with animals" but miss the "moral lesson" part, or vice-versa, thus not meeting the full rubric. A "max score of 1" implies a high bar for a complete definition.

I'd expect it to be slightly better than the 4-5% range, but not by much, because "fable" is a specific term they *might* have encountered in a lesson about stories. However, the *definition* itself is the hurdle.

My calibrated estimate: **8%**
