Here's my thought process for estimating the proportion correct:

1.  **Analyze the Target Audience:** Class 6 students in Indian government schools, mostly economically weaker sections, limited English proficiency. This immediately signals a *low* baseline for anything involving nuanced English grammar.

2.  **Examine Common Errors:** The provided examples are critical.
    *   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass rate) - This shows a complete lack of comprehension of abstract concepts and even basic instruction words. "I am reading" is a very literal, almost primitive response.
    *   "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate) - Again, difficulty with abstract concepts like "theme" and "central idea." The third wrong answer ("The last bargin they about a child and labour. many people tried to force the la") shows some keyword recognition but disastrous sentence structure and grammar.
    *   "Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'." (10% pass rate) - This is a more concrete task, yet the errors ("My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy", "My hobby is cricket play") demonstrate:
        *   Inability to follow multi-part instructions (paragraph length, mentioning *what*).
        *   Extremely poor sentence formation and basic grammar (verb tense, subject-verb agreement, articles).
        *   Tendency to list rather than write coherent sentences.

3.  **Analyze the Specific Question:** "Choose the correct word. There are (some/any) apples in the basket."
    *   **Grammar Point:** "Some" vs. "Any" for affirmative vs. negative/interrogative sentences. This is a fundamental grammar rule often taught early.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Apples," "basket" are very common words. "There are" is also common.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple, declarative.

4.  **Initial Instinct vs. Challenge:**
    *   *Initial Instinct:* "This is pretty basic! 'Some' for affirmative. Most students should know this." Perhaps 40-50%.
    *   *Challenging Instinct:*
        *   **Limited English:** If students struggle with "My hobby is cricket play," how well do they grasp "some" vs. "any" in a *grammatically correct* context? They might *recognize* both words but not know the rule.
        *   **"Basic" isn't Basic:** While fundamental, many of these students might have inconsistent exposure or forget specific rules. They learn by rote, and if they haven't rote-learned this exact phrase or rule recently, they might falter.
        *   **Exam Anxiety:** Could lead to guesses or blanks.
        *   **No Practice:** They might have done exercises where they *fill in the blank*, but "choose the correct word" between two options (especially if both look plausible) can be different.
        *   **The "Sound" Test:** A student with limited grammar knowledge might choose based on what "sounds right" to them. "There are any apples" might not sound *inherently wrong* to someone who's not proficient.
        *   **Other Examples' Low Pass Rates:** Why should a question about "some/any" be dramatically easier than forming a simple sentence about a hobby (10%) or identifying a theme (5%)? While this is a multiple-choice-like task, the underlying grammatical knowledge is still a hurdle.

5.  **Revisiting the Difficulty Scale:**
    *   4-10% for complex writing/comprehension.
    *   This "some/any" question is a *single grammatical choice* in a simple sentence. It's *definitely* easier than writing a paragraph or understanding a poet's style.
    *   However, it's not simply vocabulary. It's a rule-based application.

6.  **Calibrating the Estimate:**
    *   It *will* be higher than 10% because it's simpler and more direct.
    *   It *won't* be as high as 50% given the overall context of "limited English," "economically weaker sections," and the abysmal performance on other seemingly "basic" tasks.
    *   Consider a guess rate: If they just picked randomly, it'd be 50%. But they aren't completely random; some will have learned this.
    *   Many students might recognize that "some" is used for positive statements, but apply it incorrectly or forget when "any" is used.
    *   The "average pass rate is about 29%" for the overall exam. This question is likely
