Let's break down the problem using the provided guidelines.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**
My first thought might be, "This is a very basic formula. Most Class 7 students should know this." I might initially think 60-70%.

**Challenging Assumptions based on Guidelines:**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "Find the area of a triangle whose base is 8 cm and height is 6 cm."
    *   "Find the area" - "find" is a common verb, "area" should be known, but might be confused with perimeter by some.
    *   "triangle" - common enough.
    *   "whose base is 8 cm and height is 6 cm" - "base" and "height" are specific terms. Do all students remember them? Do they confuse them? Is their English strong enough to grasp "whose base is..." quickly under pressure?

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   The formula `Area = 1/2 × base × height` is indeed fundamental. However, for a student struggling with basic arithmetic or who missed the relevant classes, this formula might be completely alien or remembered incorrectly (e.g., just `base × height`, or even `base + height`).
    *   The concept of "area" itself can be tricky. Some might confuse it with perimeter.

3.  **Exam Anxiety:**
    *   Even if a student knows the formula, anxiety can cause them to forget it, mix up numbers, or simply freeze.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   While they would have practiced area of a triangle, the *exact wording* might be new, or the numbers might feel different. Some students only remember answers to specific examples.
    *   The rubric only asks for stating or using the correct formula. This is less about calculation and more about recall of the formula itself.

5.  **Average Pass Rate is 29%:** This is a crucial data point. If the overall pass rate is so low, it suggests that even "basic" questions are not universally aced. This question is arguably one of the easier math questions they might encounter, but it's not a *given* for everyone.

**Re-evaluating based on the challenges:**

*   **Formula Recall:** Many students will likely remember *a* formula involving base and height for a triangle. The `1/2` factor is the most common point of error or omission. Some might correctly recall `1/2 * b * h`.
*   **Understanding the Question:** The English is relatively straightforward for a math problem, but "whose base is... and height is..." might require a moment for those with limited English.
*   **Core Knowledge:** This is a fundamental concept from earlier grades (often Class 6 or early Class 7). Students who are struggling in Class 7 likely have gaps in these foundational topics.

Considering the low overall pass rate (29%), and the specific challenges for economically weaker sections with limited English, remembering a precise formula like `1/2 * base * height` is not a given for a large proportion. Many might write `base * height` or simply guess. However, it's also a question that *can* be answered by rote memory if taught well.

Let's think about the distribution:
*   Some will get it perfectly (know the formula and use it).
*   Some will get `base * height` (partial recall, missing `1/2`). This would *not* count for the rubric.
*   Some will write something completely irrelevant or leave it blank due to anxiety or lack of knowledge.

If 29% is the *average* pass rate for the entire paper, then an individual question's success rate can vary. This question is on the easier side, but not universally so. It's about remembering a specific mathematical formula.

I need to challenge my instinct that "most could do this." "Most" in a struggling population is very different from "most" in a well-resourced school.

If 29% is the *average* pass rate for the entire paper, then this question is probably above average in terms of expected correct responses, but not by a huge margin for the *rubric definition*. The rubric is strict: "States or uses the correct formula." Simply writing `b x h` doesn't count.

Given the strict rubric, the challenges for the demographic, and the overall low pass rate, I would estimate that a significant portion will miss the `1/2` or not know the formula at all.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

I'd lean towards the higher end of the struggling student's capability for a basic
