Let's break down the thought process for estimating the proportion correct.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**
My first instinct, as someone proficient in English, is that this is incredibly simple. "He is reading a book." Basic SVO structure. Most 6th graders *should* be able to do this. Maybe 70-80%?

**Challenging the Instinct based on the Provided Information:**

1.  **Student Profile:** "Mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English." This is a huge red flag. "Limited English" means exactly that.
2.  **Average Pass Rate:** "Average pass rate is about 29%." This immediately recalibrates expectations downward for *any* question. If the average is 29%, a "simple" question won't suddenly jump to 80%.
3.  **Common Errors Analysis:**
    *   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass rate):** This is a much higher-order thinking skill, requiring comprehension and descriptive vocabulary. The low pass rate is understandable.
    *   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate):** Again, high-level comprehension and abstract thinking. Low pass rate is expected.
    *   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'." (10% pass rate):** This one is closer to our target question in terms of requiring sentence construction and vocabulary application.
        *   *Wrong answers:* "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy" (demonstrates inability to form coherent sentences, ignores paragraph instruction, shifts topic). "My hobby is cricket play" (grammatically incorrect). "My Favowrife Hobby cbaking\nMy Favowrife" (spelling, incompleteness, lack of sentence structure).

    These errors clearly show fundamental weaknesses in:
    *   Sentence formation (SVO)
    *   Grammar (verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, articles)
    *   Spelling
    *   Understanding instructions (e.g., "4-5 sentences," "mention what")

4.  **Expert Overestimation Reminder:** "Teachers and experts consistently MISJUDGE item difficulty... they forget how limited many students' English actually is." This reinforces the need to be conservative.

5.  **Specific Question Analysis: "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence: book/reading/a/is/he"**
    *   **Keywords:** "Rearrange," "meaningful sentence."
    *   **Required Skills:**
        *   **Vocabulary Recognition:** Do they know "book," "reading," "is," "he," "a"? Likely yes for "book," "is," "he." "Reading" might be slightly less certain but common. "A" is fundamental.
        *   **Understanding Word Types:** Identifying "he" as a subject, "is reading" as the verb phrase, "a book" as the object. This is *not* explicit knowledge but an intuitive grasp.
        *   **Basic Sentence Structure (SVO):** This is the core challenge.
        *   **No Complex Grammar:** No tricky tenses, no conjunctions, no dependent clauses.
        *   **Limited Options:** With only 5 words, the number of permutations is finite, making it somewhat guessable, but a truly "meaningful" sentence narrows it down.

6.  **Considering the "Hobby" Question (10% pass rate) vs. This Question:**
    *   The hobby question requires *generating* sentences, vocabulary, and adherence to length/topic. The errors show they struggle with basic sentence generation.
    *   This question requires *rearranging* given words. It's arguably slightly easier than generation because the words are provided.
    *   However, the errors from the hobby question ("My hobby is cricket play") show they struggle even with simple SVO structures *when generating*.

7.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** This is a constant factor that pulls scores down.

**Recalibrating:**

*   If generating a simple sentence ("My hobby is cricket play") has a high error rate, then rearranging might not be dramatically better.
*   The "hobby" question's 10% is for a *paragraph*. Our question is for a single sentence. This implies it *should* be higher than 10%.
*   However, the fundamental SVO struggle is evident in the 10% question.
*   The 29% average pass rate is a strong anchor. A very basic sentence rearrangement might be above average, but not by a huge margin given the context.
*   What if a student puts
