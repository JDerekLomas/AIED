Here's a breakdown of the thought process to arrive at the calibrated estimate:

1.  **Analyze the Target Audience:**
    *   Class 8 students, Indian government schools.
    *   Mostly economically weaker sections.
    *   Limited English proficiency.
    *   Average pass rate for the *entire exam* is 29%. This is a crucial baseline.
    *   Common errors: "Empty Response," fragmented English, phonetic spellings, misinterpretations. This shows a deep struggle with comprehension and articulation.

2.  **Analyze the Question:**
    *   "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"
    *   Keywords: "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "contribute," "expansion of British power."
    *   Requires understanding a *causal link* (how A led to B). This is more complex than simple recall.
    *   Requires historical context: knowledge of the Battle of Plassey itself, its participants, and its immediate aftermath.

3.  **Analyze the Rubric:**
    *   "For explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)."
    *   Key concepts for a correct answer:
        *   Victory at Plassey (implied by the question).
        *   British political dominance/control.
        *   Over Bengal (specific region).
        *   *Example:* Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab (this is a good signifier of understanding).

4.  **Initial Instinct (and why to challenge it):**
    *   My first instinct might be: "Battle of Plassey is a pretty fundamental topic in Indian history. Most students would have covered it." I might think 20-30% could get it.
    *   **Challenge:** But *how* fundamental? Is it just rote memorization of the date and names, or understanding the *consequences*? The question asks for "how it *contributed*," which requires a deeper understanding than just "what happened."

5.  **Apply "Challenging Assumptions" Filters:**

    *   **Limited English:**
        *   Can a student with limited English understand "contribute to the expansion of British power"? "Expansion" and "contribute" might be challenging. They might recognize "Battle of Plassey" and "British power" and just write something vaguely related.
        *   Can they articulate "political dominance/control over Bengal" in coherent English? Phrases like "puppet nawab" might be too complex to recall or write correctly.

    *   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
        *   For a struggling learner, the *concept* of one event leading to political control, and the idea of a "puppet ruler," might be abstract. They might know "British won" but not "British *gained control over Bengal by installing a puppet*."

    *   **Exam Anxiety:**
        *   This can lead to "Empty Response" even if they have some knowledge. The fear of being wrong, or inability to form a coherent sentence, can result in a blank.

    *   **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
        *   They might have practiced "When was the Battle of Plassey?" or "Who fought in the Battle of Plassey?" but not "How did it *contribute* to X?" This requires analytical thinking beyond simple recall.

    *   **Absent for Topic/Poor Instruction:**
        *   Given the context of government schools in economically weaker sections, quality of instruction can be highly variable. Many students might have missed this topic or had it taught poorly.

6.  **Re-evaluate based on errors and general pass rate:**
    *   The sample errors for Social Science questions ("Empty Response," fragmented answers, phonetic spellings) are highly relevant. Students struggle even with direct recall or very basic explanations.
    *   The pass rates for similar "explain how/why" questions (9-12%) are extremely low. This question is arguably more complex than "Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes?" which only got 10%.
    *   The "Ashok seamb" error on "significance of Ashoka's reign" shows that even fundamental historical figures are not understood in depth, let alone their *significance*.

7.  **Calibrate the Estimate:**
    *   The question is specific (requiring understanding of *how* rather than *what*).
    *   It requires specific knowledge (Plassey, Bengal, political control).
    *   English proficiency is a major barrier.
    *   The historical pass rates for similar "explain"
