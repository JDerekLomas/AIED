Here's my calibrated estimate, taking into account the provided context and common errors:

**Estimated Proportion Correct: 3%**

Here's my reasoning:

1.  **Complexity of Transformation:** Active to Passive voice transformation, while seemingly "basic" to an expert, involves several steps that are challenging for struggling English learners:
    *   Identifying the object ("the leaves").
    *   Making the object the new subject.
    *   Using the correct form of "to be" (past tense plural: "were").
    *   Using the past participle of the main verb ("blown").
    *   Including "by the wind" (optional but standard for full credit).
    *   Understanding the *concept* of voice itself, which is abstract.

2.  **Observed Common Errors:**
    *   **"Empty Response":** This is a huge factor. The other examples show pass rates of 4-10% even for seemingly simpler tasks. A question requiring grammatical transformation and specific vocabulary will likely see a high percentage of blank or unintelligible responses due to anxiety, lack of understanding, or simply not knowing *how* to approach it.
    *   **Grammatical Breakdown:** The "My hobby is cricket play" error shows a fundamental lack of understanding of verb forms and sentence structure. "Blown" is an irregular past participle, which is notoriously difficult. Many might use "blowed."
    *   **Focus on Keywords, Not Structure:** Students might pick out "wind," "blew," "leaves" but fail to reconstruct the sentence correctly.
    *   **Limited Exposure/Practice:** The note about students not having practiced the exact question type is critical. Voice transformation might be covered, but regular, repeated practice for struggling learners is often missing.

3.  **Overall Pass Rate (29%):** This question is significantly more difficult than the average question achieving 29%. It's more aligned with the 4-5% pass rates seen for "Describes the poet's writing style" or "Write a theme..." which require abstract thinking and precise English expression. This question requires precise grammatical transformation.

4.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** For students who struggle with basic sentence construction, the rules of active/passive voice are highly advanced and abstract.

Considering all these points, a very small fraction of students would be able to execute this transformation correctly and completely, leading me to a very low estimate.
