Let's break down the question and the context.

**The Question:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"

**Rubric:** "Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why."

**Key Challenges for Class 6 Indian Government School Students:**

1.  **English Comprehension:**
    *   "Which line... do you like the most": This requires understanding "which," "line," "like the most." While "like" is common, "most" and "which" in this context might be tricky for students with limited English.
    *   "and why?": This is the crucial part. It demands explaining a reason, which is a higher-order thinking skill in English, requiring vocabulary for expressing preference and justification. The previous error examples ("Empty Response," "I am reading") show difficulty with abstract reasoning and explanation.

2.  **Accessing the Poem:** The question implies the poem is available. Even if it is, reading and comprehending the poem itself is a prerequisite to picking a line and understanding it enough to justify a preference. Given the 29% average pass rate, understanding a full poem is a major hurdle for many.

3.  **Specific Line Identification:** They need to literally copy or accurately paraphrase a *line* from the poem. This requires attention to detail and transcription skills.

4.  **Justification/Reasoning:** This is the biggest hurdle.
    *   The "Describes the poet's writing style" example with 4% pass rate shows extreme difficulty in analytical or descriptive tasks.
    *   The "theme or central idea" example with 5% pass rate further demonstrates the struggle with abstract concepts and expressing them in English.
    *   "My Favourite Hobby" (10%) shows difficulty even with personal, concrete topics, often resulting in lists or fragmented sentences, not a coherent paragraph of justification.

5.  **Vocabulary for Justification:** Even if they understand the prompt, do they have the English vocabulary to explain *why* they like a line? Words like "beautiful," "meaningful," "sad," "happy," "relatable," "strong imagery," etc., might not be readily available or correctly applied. They might resort to very simple, repetitive explanations like "I like it because it is good."

6.  **Exam Anxiety/Novelty:** As noted, exam anxiety can lead to blank responses. This question type – personal preference and justification – might be new to many, especially in an exam setting where "correct" answers are usually concrete.

**Challenging Initial Instinct:**

My first instinct might be: "It's a simple preference, they just pick a line and say 'I like it because it's nice'." But then I remember:
*   "I am reading" for "Describes the poet's writing style" – they don't even get the basic premise of explaining *about* something.
*   "Empty Response" is very common.
*   The "My Favourite Hobby" answers are basic and don't demonstrate justification for *why* it's a favorite, just *what* it is.
*   Many might not even grasp the poem well enough to form a genuine preference. They might just pick the first line or a line with simple words without a deeper understanding to justify.

To get *any* score (even partial for just denoting a line, though the rubric says "and mentions why"), they'd need to overcome multiple barriers. For a *full* score, they need both parts correctly.

Considering the extreme difficulty shown in similar tasks (4-10% pass rates for questions requiring explanation, description, or central idea), a question requiring both accurate recall/selection AND a coherent, albeit simple, justification in English is going to be very low.

A student who gets this correct would likely be one of the stronger students in the class, not the average.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Given the evidence, especially the extremely low pass rates for similar tasks involving explanation and abstract thinking, and the prevalence of "Empty Response," I would expect a very low proportion.

*   Maybe 5% can pick a line and give a *barely* acceptable, simple reason.
*   The vast majority will be "Empty Response," just picking a line without justification, or giving an incoherent justification.

I'm going to lean towards the lower end of the single digits, similar to the "theme or central idea" question, because "why" is the truly challenging part here.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **7%**
