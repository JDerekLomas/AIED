Here's a breakdown of the thought process to arrive at the calibrated estimate:

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**

* **"Important in real life?"** This feels like a simple "yes/no" question that relates to universal human concerns.
* **"Give one reason."** This requires a bit more, but not an essay. A student could just say "because we need to make good decisions" or "to live a good life."
* **Relatively straightforward vocabulary.** "King's questions," "important," "real life," "reason."

My initial gut might be 25-35%. However, the provided context *demands* challenging this instinct.

**Challenging Assumptions Based on Provided Data:**

1.  **Limited English Proficiency:** The examples are stark.
    *   "Describes the poet’s writing style" (4% pass rate) results in "I am reading." This shows a fundamental disconnect between the question and the student's ability to process and formulate a relevant answer, even if they understand individual words.
    *   "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate) shows "The last bargin they about a child and labour..." This is an attempt, but structurally and grammatically very weak, demonstrating difficulty in constructing a coherent sentence expressing an abstract idea.
    *   "Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'" (10% pass rate) yielding "My hobby is cricket play" is a common error type – an attempt, but not meeting the *structure* or *length* requirement.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** The example "Describes the poet's writing style" is a "basic" literary analysis concept for most curricula, but clearly not for these students. Our target question asks about the *importance* of abstract concepts (like finding the right time, people, actions). This is more abstract than "My Favourite Hobby."

3.  **Exam Anxiety & Blank Responses:** The prevalence of "Empty Response" (and implicitly, the very low pass rates) suggests a significant number of students are overwhelmed and simply don't answer or attempt anything meaningful.

4.  **No Practice with Exact Question Type:** While "give a reason" is common, the specific context and the level of abstraction might be novel.

**Applying Challenges to "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."**

*   **Understanding "important in real life":** A student might understand "important" and "real life" individually, but connecting the *abstract nature* of the King's questions (right time, right people, right thing) to *personal applicability* could be a hurdle. They might just default to a "yes," but struggle with the "reason."
*   **Formulating "one reason" in English:** This is the biggest hurdle. Based on the "Theme or Central Idea" and "Writing Style" examples, articulating a coherent, grammatically plausible *reason* that links to the importance of the questions in a general, real-life sense will be very difficult for many.
    *   They might give a reason like: "Yes, because king is big." (Simple, but not a valid reason for the *questions' importance* in real life).
    *   They might give a reason based on the story: "Yes, because the hermit told him." (Again, valid in context, but not a general "real-life" reason).
    *   They might struggle with sentence structure: "Yes, because people needs good time."
    *   Many will likely give an "Empty Response" or a completely off-topic answer, similar to the 4-5% pass rate questions.

*   **Passage Dependence:** The question *implies* knowledge of the King's questions from the reading passage. If a student struggled with comprehending the passage, they might not even remember what the questions *were*, let alone their general importance.

**Re-calibrated Estimate:**

Considering the extremely low pass rates for questions requiring abstract thought or basic sentence construction, and the high rate of non-responses or irrelevant answers:

*   **Understanding the question:** Probably doable for a higher percentage (maybe 30-40%) to grasp the gist.
*   **Formulating a *valid* reason in English:** This is where the pass rate will drop dramatically. Given that "describing writing style" is 4% and "theme/central idea" is 5%, and even "paragraph about hobby" is only 10% (and we saw the quality of those answers), articulating a *reason* for an abstract concept is a significant challenge.

If 4-5% can answer more abstract or specific literary questions, and 10% can manage a poor attempt at a
