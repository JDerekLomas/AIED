Let's break this down using the provided context and the common errors.

**Initial Instinct vs. Calibrated Approach:**

*   **Initial Instinct:** My first thought might be that "fable" is a relatively common literary term taught in schools. Students might have heard it or seen it. Perhaps 20-30% could define it.
*   **Challenging Assumptions:**
    *   **Limited English:** The prompt explicitly states "limited English." "Define" itself might be challenging for some. Even if they know what a fable is in their native language, translating that into a coherent English definition is a huge hurdle.
    *   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While "fable" seems basic to someone familiar with literature, for students with an average pass rate of 29% and struggling with much simpler English tasks (like describing a writing style or writing a theme), it's likely *not* basic.
    *   **Common Errors:**
        *   **"Empty Response":** This is a huge factor. With questions like "describes the poet's writing style" and "write a theme," a large proportion of students gave empty responses. "Define fable" is similar in that it requires a precise, conceptual answer rather than just a simple sentence construction.
        *   **Tangential/Incorrect Answers:** The "My Favourite Hobby" examples show students veering off-topic or giving very short, ungrammatical, or incomplete answers. A student might write "Fables are stories" or "Lion story" which wouldn't meet the rubric.
        *   **Complexity of Definition:** The rubric requires "a short story that typically uses animals as characters and imparts a moral lesson." This is a multi-part definition. Students need to recall *all* these elements in English.
    *   **Exam Anxiety:** Further contributes to blank responses.
    *   **Lack of Practice:** Many students might not have practiced defining literary terms in this specific format.

**Comparing to Other Questions:**

*   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (Pass rate: 4%) - Requires analytical thought and precise English. "Define fable" also requires precision.
*   "Write a theme or central idea..." (Pass rate: 5%) - Requires understanding and articulation in English.
*   "Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'" (Pass rate: 10%) - Even with a very personal topic, students struggled significantly. Defining a literary term is arguably harder than talking about oneself.

Given the extremely low pass rates on questions requiring even slightly complex English or conceptual understanding, and the prevalence of "Empty Response," defining "fable" coherently in English is going to be exceptionally difficult for this student population. A student who can barely string together a sentence about their hobby ("My hobby is cricket play") is highly unlikely to provide a multi-part definition of "fable."
