Here's my thought process for estimating the proportion correct:

1.  **Analyze the Question Type:** This is a grammar transformation question specifically about active-to-passive voice.

2.  **Consider the Target Audience:**
    *   Class 7 students in Indian government schools.
    *   Mostly economically weaker sections.
    *   Limited English proficiency.
    *   Average pass rate for the *entire exam* is 29%. This is a crucial baseline.

3.  **Examine Provided Common Errors & Pass Rates for *Other* Questions:**
    *   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass rate) - Requires comprehension and analytical English. Students are giving "I am reading" or "Empty Response." This shows a fundamental lack of understanding of *what* is being asked and how to formulate an appropriate answer.
    *   "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate) - Similar to above, even when attempting, the answer is garbled and shows limited English ("The last bargin they about a child and labour. many people tried to force the la").
    *   "Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'." (10% pass rate) - This is a very common, basic essay topic. Yet, students struggle to form coherent sentences, even giving lists ("My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho") or fragmented thoughts ("My hobby is cricket play"). This indicates a severe lack of basic sentence construction and paragraphing skills, even for *familiar* topics.

4.  **Evaluate "Active to Passive Voice" in this Context:**
    *   **Complexity:** Active-to-passive voice transformation is a specific grammatical rule. It requires understanding:
        *   Subject, verb, object identification.
        *   Changing the order of these elements.
        *   Using the correct form of "to be" (past tense here: "were").
        *   Using the past participle of the main verb ("blown").
        *   Adding "by" + original subject.
    *   **Reliance on Taught Grammar:** This isn't something one can guess or infer easily. It relies heavily on having been explicitly taught, understood, and practiced.
    *   **Comparison to "My Favourite Hobby":** If students struggle to write 4-5 sentences about a *personal, familiar topic* at a 10% pass rate, how will they fare with a more abstract grammatical transformation that requires specific rules? The "hobby" question tests basic sentence formation. This active-passive question tests a higher-level grammatical manipulation.
    *   **Common Pitfalls:**
        *   Many students will not know the past participle of "blow" ("blown"). They might use "blowed" or "blew."
        *   They might forget "were" or use "was" (incorrect subject-verb agreement for "leaves").
        *   They might forget "by the wind" or misplace it.
        *   They might simply rewrite the sentence as is, not understanding "change voice."
        *   They might confuse it with reported speech or other transformations.
        *   Many will simply leave it blank due to anxiety or not knowing the rule.

5.  **Apply the "Challenge Your Instinct" Rule:** My first instinct might be "Oh, active-passive is taught in Class 7, some students should get it." But then I re-read: "limited English," "struggling learners," "exam anxiety," "never practiced this exact question type." The low pass rates on *simpler-sounding* questions are alarming indicators.

6.  **Synthesize and Estimate:**
    *   The 10% pass rate for "My Favourite Hobby" is a critical benchmark. That's a *writing* task, not a *transformation* task.
    *   The "poet's writing style" and "theme" questions have pass rates of 4-5%. These require more abstract thinking but also more open-ended English production.
    *   Active-passive voice is a *specific rule-based* transformation. If students haven't mastered basic sentence construction, mastering specific transformations is highly unlikely for many.
    *   The probability of getting *all* parts correct (leaves, were, blown, away, by the wind) is low given the general English proficiency.

Considering the extreme difficulty students have with even basic writing tasks and comprehension, and the specific rules required for this transformation, a pass rate significantly lower than the exam average (29%) and even lower than "My Favourite Hobby" (10%) seems appropriate. It requires specific grammar knowledge that is often not solidified in this demographic, especially with limited practice. Many students will give blank responses, incorrect tenses, or simply rewrite the active sentence.

My calibrated estimate would
