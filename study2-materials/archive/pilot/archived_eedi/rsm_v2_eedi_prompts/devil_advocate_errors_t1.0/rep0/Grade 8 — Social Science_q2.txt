Here's a breakdown of the thought process to arrive at the calibrated estimate:

1.  **Initial Impression (and why it's probably wrong):** My first thought might be, "Harappan Civilization is a foundational topic in Indian history. They must have learned about it in Class 6 or 7. Urban planning is a key aspect. They should know this." If I stopped here, I might estimate something like 40-50%.

2.  **Applying the "Challenge Your First Instinct" Rule:** This is where the provided context becomes crucial.

    *   **"Economically weaker sections with limited English":** This is a huge red flag. While "Harappan Civilization" is an Indian history topic, the *question itself* is in English. "Urban planning," "key feature," "civilization" are not simple words for someone with limited English. They might know the *concept* in their vernacular, but struggle to articulate it in English.
    *   **"Average pass rate is about 29%":** This is a benchmark. The overall difficulty of this exam is low. A question that seems "easy" to an expert is likely to be harder for these students.
    *   **Common Errors - "Empty Response":** This is recurring. Exam anxiety, lack of understanding of the question, or simply not knowing the answer often leads to a blank. This *will* happen here.
    *   **Common Errors - Misinterpretations/Jumbled English:** The "Asher' stand," "ashok a second" examples show that even when students try, their English can be very broken, making it difficult to score. "Harappan Civilization's urban planning" might be partially recognized, but the articulation could be completely off.
    *   **Teachers/Experts Consistently Misjudge:** This explicitly tells me *not* to trust my initial feeling that "most students should know this."
    *   **"Could a student who barely reads English?":** "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning." Even if they know "Harappan" and "civilization," "key feature" and "urban planning" might be challenging. They might recognize "city planning" if phrased differently, but "urban planning" is more academic.
    *   **"Could a student who was absent for this topic?":** Yes, a significant portion likely were. Not just for a day, but for blocks of time, or simply inattentive during a lecture.
    *   **Rubric:** "Correctly describes one key feature..." This means they need to name *and* describe. Just saying "Harappan city" isn't enough. "Grid layout" is specific. "Advanced drainage system" is specific. These require recall of specific vocabulary and concepts.

3.  **Re-evaluating based on specific elements of the question and rubric:**

    *   **Topic:** Harappan Civilization is central, so *some* exposure is likely.
    *   **Key Phrase:** "Urban planning." This is a relatively specific term. Students might know "cities" or "towns" but "urban planning" implies a more structured understanding.
    *   **Requirement:** "Describe one key feature." This isn't just a yes/no. It requires articulation.
    *   **Acceptable Answers:** Grid layout, drainage system, baked bricks, citadel/lower town. These are all specific facts.

4.  **Comparing to example questions:**

    *   "Colonial rule... tribal communi" (9%): This is a more complex, analytical question. Our Harappan question is more factual recall. So it should be higher than 9%.
    *   "Lions on notes" (10%): This requires specific knowledge (Ashoka/Sarnath). Similar to recalling a specific feature of Harappan planning. The errors here are very telling about English proficiency.
    *   "Significance of Ashoka" (12%): Again, factual recall and explanation. The errors again highlight language issues.

    The Harappan question is likely *somewhat* easier than these, as it's a very visual and concrete topic (cities, bricks, drains). However, the language barrier and the need for specific recall are still major hurdles.

5.  **Calibrating the Estimate:**

    *   It won't be as low as 9-12% because it's a foundational, somewhat simpler recall question.
    *   It won't be as high as 40-50% because of the English barrier, blank responses, poor articulation, and the general low pass rate (29%).
    *   A student might vaguely remember "cities" or "bricks," but articulating "grid layout" or "advanced drainage system" in English will be tough for
