Here's a breakdown of the thought process to arrive at the calibrated estimate:

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**

My first thought might be: "Rajasthan is famous for its desert, so sand and water are obvious. They also have mining. Students should know at least two, and relate one to life." This would lead to a higher estimate, perhaps 40-50%.

**Applying the "Challenge Your Assumptions" Filter:**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "Mention any two natural resources..." - "Mention" might be tricky for some. "Natural resources" itself is a technical term. While taught, retention for struggling learners is low.
    *   "...found in Rajasthan..." - Geographic knowledge is required.
    *   "...explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there." - This is the most challenging part. "Influences" is a higher-order thinking verb. They need to connect a resource to daily life, economic activity, or challenges. This requires more than just recalling facts.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   While "natural resources" is a core concept, associating specific resources with a specific state *and* then explaining their *influence* is a multi-step cognitive process.
    *   Many students might know *what* natural resources are but struggle to recall *specific examples* for a particular region, especially if they haven't explicitly memorized that list.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** The common errors show a very high rate of "Empty Response." This suggests that if students don't immediately know the answer or find the question too complex, they default to blank. The explanation component significantly increases the cognitive load and thus the likelihood of a blank response.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   Students might have learned about natural resources, and they might have learned about Rajasthan.
    *   They might even have learned about specific resources in Rajasthan.
    *   But connecting *two* resources *and* explaining the *influence* of *one* on *lives* is a fairly specific and demanding task. If they've only practiced listing resources, they'll struggle with the "explain influence" part.

5.  **Average Pass Rate 29% & Specific Error Analysis:**
    *   The 29% average pass rate is a strong anchor.
    *   The examples provided (colonial rule, lions on currency, Ashoka) show questions that require slightly more abstract thinking or specific recall/explanation. Their pass rates (9-12%) are extremely low.
    *   This question is probably slightly *easier* than "colonial rule" or "Ashoka's reign" because natural resources are more tangible. However, it's significantly *harder* than just naming one resource. The "explain influence" part is the killer.

**Re-evaluating the Components:**

*   **Mentioning two resources:** Some students might get one, perhaps two simple ones like "sand" or "water" (though water is a critical *resource*, "sand" as a *resource* needs clarification for its use, e.g., for construction, glass). Marble, copper, zinc are more specific, requiring better recall. I'd estimate maybe 30-40% could *list* two plausible resources.
*   **Explaining influence:** This is where the vast majority will fail.
    *   Many might just say "it's used by people." That's not explaining influence on *lives*.
    *   They need to connect it to livelihoods, scarcity, economic activity, challenges, etc.
    *   For example, relating water scarcity to migration, crop choices, or daily struggles. Or marble to building construction and employment. This level of detail is high for a Class 6 student with limited English.

**Calibrated Estimate Derivation:**

Given the difficulty of the "explain influence" part, the high rate of "Empty Response" in similar explanation-based questions, and the limited English, the number of students who will fully satisfy the rubric (two correct resources *and* a decent explanation of influence) will be very low.

*   If 30-40% can list two resources, perhaps only a *fraction* of those can then articulate a meaningful explanation of influence.
*   Considering the 9-12% pass rates for similar explanatory questions, and the average 29%, this question sits somewhere in between. It requires factual recall *and* application/explanation.
*   The fact that it's worth *1 mark* suggests the bar for "correct" is relatively high for the *entire* answer. Simply listing two without explanation will likely get 0.

Therefore, the estimate needs to be significantly
