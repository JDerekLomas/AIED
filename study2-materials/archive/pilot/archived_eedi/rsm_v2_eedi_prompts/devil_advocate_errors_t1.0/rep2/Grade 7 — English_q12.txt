Here's my calibrated estimate for the proportion of Class 7 students in Indian government schools who would answer the question "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away" correctly.

My initial instinct, as someone proficient in English, might be that this is a relatively straightforward grammatical transformation. However, considering the provided context and common error patterns, I must significantly adjust this.

**Factors heavily reducing the pass rate:**

1.  **Complexity of "Active Voice to Passive Voice":**
    *   This is a highly specific grammatical concept that requires understanding of:
        *   Subject-verb-object structure in active voice.
        *   Identifying the direct object ("the leaves").
        *   Understanding the past tense ("blew") and its passive form ("were blown").
        *   Using the past participle ("blown").
        *   Introducing "by the wind" (or understanding that it's implied if omitted, but the full answer expects it).
        *   Reordering the sentence elements.
    *   This is far more complex than identifying a "theme" or describing a "hobby," which already have extremely low pass rates.

2.  **Limited English Proficiency:**
    *   The examples of common errors show students struggling with basic sentence formation and understanding prompts like "describes" or "write a theme."
    *   Many students might not even understand what "Active Voice" or "Passive Voice" means, let alone how to apply the transformation. They might just recognize "change the sentence" and try to rephrase it nonsensically.
    *   The irregular verb "blew" -> "blown" is an added layer of difficulty.

3.  **Lack of Practice/Instruction:**
    *   The note about teachers overestimating difficulty because students haven't practiced the *exact* question type is crucial. While they might have been *taught* active/passive voice, applying it correctly in an exam setting, under pressure, without recent, targeted practice, is a different challenge.

4.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:**
    *   The high number of "Empty Response" errors for even seemingly simpler questions suggests that when students don't understand, they simply give up. This concept is likely to induce many blank responses.

5.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   Active/passive voice is often considered a fundamental grammar topic for this age group, but the context clearly states that "basic" concepts aren't basic for struggling learners.

**Re-evaluating based on error patterns:**

*   The "describes the poet's writing style" question (4% pass rate) involves abstract thinking and vocabulary.
*   The "theme of the poem" question (5% pass rate) also requires abstract comprehension and analytical skills.
*   The "My Favourite Hobby" question (10% pass rate) is about personal expression, but students still struggle with basic sentence structure and appropriate content.

Transforming active to passive voice is a *rule-based, multi-step grammatical transformation*. It requires not just understanding individual words but a specific syntactic process. Given the existing evidence, where students struggle with simpler comprehension and composition tasks, expecting them to successfully apply a multi-step grammatical rule like this is highly optimistic.

If students are giving "Empty Responses" or making fundamental errors on questions about hobbies or poem themes, their ability to correctly execute a complex grammatical transformation will be extremely low.

**My Calibrated Estimate:**

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for the exam, and the extremely low pass rates for questions that are arguably less demanding (requiring comprehension or simple composition), I believe this specific grammatical transformation will yield one of the lowest pass rates. It requires a deep understanding of grammatical structure and vocabulary that many of these students demonstrably lack.
