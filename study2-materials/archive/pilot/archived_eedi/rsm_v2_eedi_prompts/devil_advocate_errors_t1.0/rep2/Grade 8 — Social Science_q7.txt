Let's break down the question and the context to arrive at a calibrated estimate.

**Question:** "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"

**Rubric:** Explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab).

**Key Challenges for Class 8 Students in Indian Government Schools:**

1.  **English Comprehension:**
    *   "Contribute to the expansion of British power" requires understanding "contribute," "expansion," and "power." While "British power" might be vaguely understood, the nuance of "expansion" could be tricky.
    *   The term "political dominance/control" in the rubric is complex. Even if students know *what* happened, articulating it with these specific terms in English might be difficult. "Puppet nawab" is also a specific concept.

2.  **Historical Knowledge:**
    *   **Recall:** Students need to recall the Battle of Plassey (1757) and its immediate aftermath. This is a core historical event, so some exposure is expected.
    *   **Causality:** The question asks "How did X contribute to Y?", requiring an understanding of cause and effect. This is a higher-order thinking skill than simply recalling facts. Students often struggle with explaining relationships.
    *   **Specifics:** Knowing about Mir Jafar and the establishment of control over Bengal is crucial. Many students might know Plassey happened and the British won, but linking it directly to political control and the puppet ruler might be a step too far for many struggling learners.

3.  **Common Errors Observed:**
    *   **Empty Response:** This is a major concern. If a student can't understand the question or doesn't recall enough, they will leave it blank. The high rates for "Empty Response" in other questions are alarming.
    *   **Irrelevant/Vague Answers:** Students might recall something about the British gaining power but fail to link it specifically to Plassey or its *mechanism* (political control, puppet ruler). They might say "British won and got strong" which isn't sufficient for the rubric.
    *   **Misspelling/Grammar:** While not directly penalized if the meaning is clear, very poor English can obscure the intended answer.

4.  **Teacher/Expert Overestimation:**
    *   Experts would think Plassey is fundamental. They might assume students understand "political dominance."
    *   They forget that "knowing the facts" doesn't equate to "explaining the impact" in good English, especially under exam pressure.
    *   The "puppet nawab" detail is often taught, but its significance might not stick for everyone.

**Challenging the First Instinct:**

My first instinct might be "Plassey is an important event, many students should know it, maybe 30-40%."

However, considering the constraints:
*   Average pass rate is 29%, but these specific *Social Science explanation* questions have much lower pass rates (9-12%). This question is very similar in type and difficulty to those examples.
*   The requirement to explain *how* it contributed, rather than just *what* happened, elevates the difficulty.
*   The need for specific details (political dominance, Bengal, Mir Jafar implicitly) to fully meet the rubric.
*   The prevalence of "Empty Response" suggests that many students simply don't have enough to say or can't articulate it.
*   The limited English means even if they have some knowledge, expressing it accurately to meet the rubric is a hurdle.

This question requires not just recall, but also an understanding of political consequence and the ability to articulate it. Given the evidence, it's highly likely to fall into the lower range of Social Science question pass rates.

Let's consider the 9-12% range for similar explanation questions. This question is arguably slightly more "central" than "why lions on notes" but equally demanding in terms of explanation and specific historical outcome.

A student needs to clearly state that the British gained political control over Bengal, or installed a puppet ruler like Mir Jafar. Simply saying "British power increased" or "British won" would not score.

Taking all this into account, especially the high rate of blank responses and the difficulty with articulating complex historical relationships in limited English, my estimate would be on the lower end.
