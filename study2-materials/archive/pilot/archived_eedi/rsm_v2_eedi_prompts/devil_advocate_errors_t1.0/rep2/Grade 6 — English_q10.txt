Let's break down the thinking process, keeping the given context and common errors in mind.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):**
My first instinct, as an English speaker, is that this is a *very* basic grammar question. "Some/any" is usually taught early. I might think, "Oh, most students should get this, maybe 60-70%."

**Challenging the Instinct based on provided information:**

1.  **Limited English, Economically Weaker Sections, Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is the most crucial piece of information. The overall pass rate is *very* low. This single question is unlikely to be an outlier that *most* students get right when the average is so dismal.

2.  **Common Errors in English:**
    *   **"Describes the poet's writing style." (4% pass rate):** This is a comprehension and expression task. The low pass rate (and the non-sensical answers like "I am reading") shows a fundamental inability to understand the question *and* form a coherent response, even a simple one.
    *   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate):** Again, comprehension and abstract thinking, which is challenging. The incorrect answer about "child and labour" shows they might grasp *some* words but miss the core concept and structure.
    *   **"Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby" (10% pass rate):** This is a very common, simple paragraph-writing prompt. Yet, students are writing lists, incomplete sentences, or just one fragmented idea. This reveals severe limitations in basic sentence formation, vocabulary, and understanding simple instructions ("4-5 sentences").

3.  **Specific Challenges to "Some/Any":**
    *   **Grammar vs. Vocabulary:** While "some" and "any" are common words, understanding *when* to use them correctly requires grasping the concept of positive vs. negative statements/questions, and countable/uncountable nouns (though in this specific sentence, it's more about positive statement). This is a grammatical rule, not just a vocabulary word.
    *   **"Basic" isn't Basic:** For students struggling with forming "My hobby is cricket play," the subtle difference between "some" and "any" in a positive declarative sentence might not be "basic" at all. They might just pick one randomly, or the one they've heard most frequently, or the one that "sounds" okay without understanding the rule.
    *   **Absence for Topic:** If a student was absent when "some/any" was taught (or if it was taught poorly), they simply wouldn't know. Given the context of struggling schools, this is a real possibility.
    *   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** While this question is multiple-choice in essence (choose between two), anxiety can still lead to wrong choices or simply leaving it blank if it were an open fill-in-the-blank. The rubric says "selects 'some'," implying a choice.

**Re-evaluating based on the challenges:**

*   The average pass rate is 29%. This question is definitely simpler than writing paragraphs or describing writing styles, but it's *still* an English grammar rule.
*   The errors on other questions demonstrate a very weak foundation in both comprehension and production of English. If they can't write "My hobby is cricket play" correctly, their grasp of "some" vs. "any" might be tenuous.
*   They might have encountered this, but "remembering" it for an exam is different from "knowing" it perfectly.
*   Many might pick "some" because it's a common word, not necessarily because they understand the rule perfectly. But a significant number might pick "any" or just guess randomly.

Considering the *low* pass rates on very basic tasks, and the high likelihood of fundamental gaps in grammar understanding, it's hard to imagine *most* students getting this right. If 10% get a paragraph right, and 4-5% get higher-level tasks, this simpler task *must* be higher, but not dramatically so. It's a single word choice, which often has a higher success rate than full sentences.

I need to calibrate my estimate to be *above* the average pass rate (29%) but *below* what a native speaker would consider "easy." It's likely simpler than the "My Hobby" question, so definitely above 10%.

Let's assume:
*   Some students will know the rule.
*   Some will guess correctly.
*   Some will guess incorrectly.
*   Some will not understand the question or the distinction at all.

If it were pure random chance (50/
