Okay, let's break this down.

**Initial Instinct vs. Calibrated Assessment:**

My initial instinct, knowing that the Harappan Civilization is a foundational topic in Indian history for Class 8, would be that a moderate number of students *should* be able to answer this. Features like the grid pattern or drainage system are usually highlighted.

However, the provided context strongly cautions against this initial optimism.

**Applying the Contextual Factors:**

1.  **Economically Weaker Sections, Limited English:** This is crucial. "Describe one key feature" is a relatively straightforward prompt, but formulating a coherent English sentence describing even a basic concept can be a hurdle. They might *know* about the drains, but struggle to articulate "advanced drainage system."
2.  **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is a sobering baseline. If the *overall* pass rate is this low, then even questions considered "easier" will likely have significantly lower success than one might expect in a more privileged school setting.
3.  **Common Errors - "Empty Response," Incomprehensible Answers:** The examples of common errors are telling. Students frequently provide no answer, or answers that indicate a complete lack of understanding or an inability to process the question in English. The "Ashok seamb" example is particularly concerning for a history question.
4.  **Teachers Overestimating Difficulty:** This reinforces the need to be conservative. Experts assume students "should know this" from textbooks, but the reality of retention and articulation is different.
5.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:** While Harappan civilization is a core topic, remembering *specific features* and then *describing* one accurately in English is a step beyond just being introduced to it.
6.  **Exam Anxiety:** Contributes to blank responses.
7.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** While they might have studied the civilization, they may not have practiced *describing one key feature* in an exam setting.

**Re-evaluating the Question and Rubric:**

*   "Describe one key feature" is simple.
*   The options (grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town) are all standard textbook points.

**Bringing it all together:**

Given the extremely low pass rates for similar explanatory questions (9-12%), the prevalence of "Empty Response," and the severe language barrier, even for what seems like a basic history fact, the proportion of students who can correctly articulate *one* feature will be very low.

Students might recall "drainage," but struggle to write "advanced drainage system." They might recall "bricks," but struggle to write "use of baked bricks." They might just write "drain" or "brick" which might not be sufficient for a "correctly describes" rubric.

The question isn't asking for a simple recall of a word, but a descriptive sentence. This requires more English proficiency than just identifying a keyword.

Considering the examples:
*   "Explain how colonial rule..." (9% pass) - This is a more complex historical analysis.
*   "Why are lions shown..." (10% pass) - This is also a historical/cultural explanation.
*   "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign..." (12% pass) - Again, a more complex explanation.

While "Describe one key feature of Harappan urban planning" is *simpler* than these, it's not radically simpler in terms of the English required to formulate a full correct answer. The difficulty might be slightly lower than those, but not by much given the overall context.

I need to challenge the idea that "most students could do this." Could a student who barely reads English, who has a 29% average pass rate, formulate a sentence like "They had a well-planned grid layout of streets" or "They had an advanced drainage system"? Many will fail.

I will err on the side of extreme caution.
