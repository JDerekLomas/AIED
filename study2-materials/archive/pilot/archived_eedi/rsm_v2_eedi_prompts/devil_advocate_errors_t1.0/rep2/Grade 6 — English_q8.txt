This question tests basic sentence structure and common verb usage, which are fundamental in English. However, the context of Class 6 students in Indian government schools, mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English, and the provided common error examples are crucial.

Let's break down the potential challenges despite the seeming simplicity:

1.  **Limited English Proficiency:** While "he," "is," "reading," "a," and "book" are high-frequency words, forming a grammatically correct sentence from scrambled words can be challenging for someone who primarily thinks in their native language and has limited exposure to English sentence structures beyond memorized phrases.
2.  **Lack of Exposure to Question Type:** The prompt explicitly states that many students "have never practiced this exact question type." Rearranging words into a meaningful sentence, while a common exercise in English learning, might be unfamiliar for students who primarily focus on vocabulary, simple translation, or answering direct questions.
3.  **Basic Concepts Not Basic for Struggling Learners:** For someone struggling, identifying "he" as the subject, "is reading" as the verb phrase, and "a book" as the object, and then putting them in the standard SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) order, might not be intuitive. They might mix up "a book is reading he," or "reading he is a book."
4.  **Impact of Anxiety:** Exam anxiety can lead to blank responses even for questions that *might* be within a student's grasp under normal circumstances. The high proportion of "Empty Response" in the error examples reinforces this.
5.  **Teacher Overestimation:** Teachers might think, "These are simple words, they'll just put them together." But they might forget that the *concept* of rearranging, and the implicit knowledge of SVO structure, is what's being tested, not just word recognition.

Looking at the error examples provided:
*   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%) - This is a much higher-order thinking task, but the "Empty Response" and "I am reading" show a complete disconnect or a very basic, unrelated response.
*   "Write a theme or central idea..." (pass rate: 5%) - Again, "Empty Response" dominates, with one student attempting a partially correct idea but failing on grammar and full expression.
*   "Write a short paragraph..." (pass rate: 10%) - Shows students can identify *some* related words ("cricket," "badminton") but struggle with sentence formation, structure, and staying on topic ("my favourite food is noodles"). "My hobby is cricket play" is a clear example of incorrect grammar for a simple sentence.

**Applying these insights to "book/reading/a/is/he":**

*   Students might correctly identify all the words.
*   They might produce fragments or incorrect orders: "Reading is he a book," "He a book is reading," "A book is he reading."
*   They might use "Empty Response" due to unfamiliarity with the task or anxiety.
*   The high frequency of "Empty Response" in other questions suggests a significant portion of students will simply not attempt it, or not know how to approach it.

Given the average pass rate of 29% for the exam, and the particularly low pass rates for questions involving even slightly more complex English tasks (like constructing a paragraph or identifying themes), this question, while seemingly basic, still requires a foundational understanding of English syntax that many of these students may lack. The common errors point to a struggle with even basic sentence construction.

My first instinct might be 50-60%, but challenging that instinct:

*   Could a student who barely reads English put these in the right order consistently? Perhaps a few, but not a majority.
*   Could a student who was absent for this topic? No, they wouldn't have the explicit instruction.
*   The "My hobby is cricket play" example is very telling. If they can't correctly say "My hobby is playing cricket" or "I play cricket," then "He is reading a book" is not a given for rearrangement.

The key is "meaningful sentence." Many might put words together, but not in the *correct* or *meaningful* grammatical order.

Considering the 29% average pass rate, the prevalence of "Empty Response," and the grammatical errors in seemingly simple attempts from other questions, I would estimate it to be closer to the average, perhaps slightly higher due to the very common words, but nowhere near what an instructor might assume based on the words alone.

I'm going to go with an estimate that's better than the paragraph/theme questions, but still reflects the significant challenges with basic English sentence structure for this demographic.
