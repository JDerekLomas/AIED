Here's a breakdown of the thought process to arrive at the calibrated estimate:

1.  **Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):**
    *   "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life?" - This seems like a relatively simple "yes/no" question with a follow-up for a reason. Most people would quickly say "yes" and come up with a reason like "knowing what to do" or "making good decisions."
    *   The "importance in real life" aspect might also make it seem relatable, encouraging a "yes."
    *   *Challenge:* This assumes a level of abstract thinking, English comprehension, and the ability to connect a fictional text to a real-world concept, which might be too high for the target group.

2.  **Analyzing the Question's Demands:**
    *   **"Do you think... important in real life?"**
        *   Requires understanding "important" and "real life."
        *   Requires a value judgment ("do *you* think").
        *   Requires connecting the *fictional king's questions* to *real life*. This is a leap for many.
        *   The king's specific questions (right time, right thing, right people) are quite abstract. A struggling student might not fully grasp their implications even if they read the passage.
    *   **"Give one reason."**
        *   This requires formulating an explanatory sentence or two in English.
        *   It can't just be "yes."
        *   The reason needs to be *valid* and connect to the importance.

3.  **Considering the "Common Errors" and Student Profile:**
    *   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass rate):** This is a much harder, abstract analytical question. However, the *type* of errors ("I am reading," "Empty Response") are crucial. It shows a fundamental lack of comprehension of the question itself, not just the content.
    *   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate):** Again, high-level comprehension. Errors like "Empty Response" and fragmented, off-topic answers ("The last bargin they about a child and labour...") show difficulty in extracting core meaning and expressing it cohesively.
    *   **"Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby." (10% pass rate):** This is a *personal* and concrete topic. Yet, students struggle to write 4-5 sentences, give fragmented lists, or make basic grammatical errors. This is a HUGE red flag. If they struggle with "My Favourite Hobby," how much more will they struggle with the abstract importance of a king's philosophical questions?
    *   **"Mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English."** This underpins all the above. They are not regularly exposed to complex English structures or abstract reasoning in English.
    *   **"Exam anxiety causes blank responses."** High likelihood of "Empty Response" here too.
    *   **"Many students have never practiced this exact question type."** Connecting a fictional text's themes to "real life" and articulating a reason might be a novel task.

4.  **Recalibrating based on expert advice (challenge your first instinct):**
    *   My first instinct might have been 20-30%, thinking "it's a yes/no and a simple reason."
    *   But looking at the *similar questions* and their abysmal pass rates, especially the "My Favourite Hobby" one (a much simpler, personal prompt), makes me think much lower.
    *   The "My Favourite Hobby" prompt requires basic sentence formation about a personal, familiar topic. Its 10% pass rate suggests that producing *any* coherent, moderately relevant English response is a significant hurdle.
    *   The current question requires:
        1.  Understanding the king's questions (from the passage).
        2.  Understanding "important in real life."
        3.  Making a judgment ("do you think").
        4.  Formulating a *valid reason* in coherent English.
        5.  Connecting the abstract questions to practical life.

5.  **Final Estimate Justification:**
    *   If only 10% can write a simple paragraph about "My Favourite Hobby," the complexity of this question (abstract concepts, critical thinking, explanation) will be much harder.
    *   The average pass rate is 29%, but that includes easier questions. This question, based on the *types* of errors seen in other questions, leans towards the lower end of the spectrum.
    *   Many students will likely give "Empty Response," "Yes," "Yes, it is important," or a reason
