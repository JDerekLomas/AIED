Let's break down the thought process for this.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):**
My first thought as an educated adult is, "This is simple subtraction. Any student in Class 8 should be able to do this." This is the "expert's curse" the prompt warns about. I'm forgetting all the limiting factors.

**Challenging the Instinct (Applying the Constraints):**

1.  **Limited English:** "Find the value of 'y' in the equation." While "find the value" and "equation" are common math terms, for a student with *limited* English, this might still be a hurdle. They might understand "y + 9 = 4" numerically but stumble on the instruction.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   **Understanding "equals":** Do they consistently understand that the equation means both sides *must* be the same value?
    *   **Inverse Operations:** Do they reliably know that to isolate 'y', they need to perform the *opposite* operation (subtract 9)? Many might try adding 9 to 4.
    *   **Negative Numbers:** This is the *biggest* hurdle. Many students at this level struggle significantly with negative numbers. `4 - 9 = -5` is not intuitive for someone who mostly deals with positive quantities in everyday life or has weak foundational math. They might see `4 - 9` and just declare it "not possible" or flip it to `9 - 4 = 5`.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Never Practiced This Exact Type:**
    *   **Appearance:** While standard, the layout might throw some off if they've only seen similar problems presented slightly differently.
    *   **"Blank Responses":** The negative number aspect is a prime candidate for a blank response or a guess like `y=5` (from `9-4`) or `y=13` (from `9+4`).

4.  **Average Pass Rate (29%):** This is a critical anchor. If the *average* pass rate for *all* subjects/questions is 29%, then a question needs to be significantly easier than average to exceed that, or significantly harder to fall below. This question involves a concept (negative numbers) that often trips up students.

**Re-evaluation:**

*   If it were `y + 4 = 9` (resulting in `y = 5`), the proportion would be much higher, probably 40-50%, because it avoids negative numbers.
*   The negative number `y = -5` is the real differentiator here. A significant portion of students will either:
    *   Calculate `9 - 4 = 5` and give `y = 5`.
    *   Calculate `9 + 4 = 13` and give `y = 13`.
    *   Get confused by `4 - 9` and leave it blank or make a wild guess.

Considering these factors, especially the difficulty with negative numbers and the overall low average pass rate, I need to be cautious about overestimating.

If 29% is the *average*, this question, while fundamental, introduces a common point of error (negative numbers) that could pull it down from what might seem like a "standard" question. Many students might solve `y + 9 = 4` as `y = 4 + 9 = 13` (incorrectly adding instead of subtracting), or `y = 9 - 4 = 5` (incorrectly flipping the subtraction to avoid negative numbers). Only a subset would correctly handle `4 - 9`.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

I'm aiming for something that reflects a challenge, even for a Class 8 student, given the context. It's not impossibly hard, but the negative number makes it a specific hurdle.

Let's imagine:
*   Perhaps 10% get totally confused by English/equation structure.
*   Another 20-25% correctly identify the need to subtract, but then calculate `9 - 4 = 5` (avoiding the negative).
*   Another 10-15% might add `9+4=13`.
*   Only the remaining fraction would correctly do `4 - 9 = -5`.

Given the 29% average pass rate, a question that requires a nuanced understanding of negative numbers, especially in a subtraction where the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend, is likely to be right around or slightly below the average for *correctness*.

I think 25% is a reasonable estimate. It's below the average pass rate, indicating it's slightly harder than the *average
