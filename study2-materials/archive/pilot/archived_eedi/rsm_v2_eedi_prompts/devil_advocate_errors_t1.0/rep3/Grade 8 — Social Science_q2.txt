Here's my thought process for estimating the proportion of Class 8 students who would correctly answer the question: "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

1.  **Initial Instinct (and why I'm challenging it):** My first instinct, as someone with a good understanding of the topic, is that Harappan civilization's urban planning (grid layout, drainage, citadel) is a fundamental concept taught in Indian history classes. I'd think, "This is basic, they *should* know it." If I were a teacher, I might estimate 40-50%.

2.  **Applying the "Challenge Your Assumptions" Framework:**

    *   **"Economically weaker sections with limited English."** This is a huge factor.
        *   "Describe one key feature..." is relatively simple English, but "urban planning" itself might be slightly advanced for some, or at least not immediately transparent if they haven't explicitly learned the term.
        *   Even if they *know* about Harappan cities, articulating "urban planning" concepts in English can be difficult. They might remember "cities were neat" but struggle to phrase "grid layout" or "systematic drainage."
    *   **"Average pass rate is about 29%."** This immediately brings down expectations. If only 29% pass the *entire exam*, then individual questions, even "basic" ones, are unlikely to have a pass rate significantly higher, unless they are exceptionally easy.
    *   **"Common Errors on Social Science exam."**
        *   **"Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi" (pass rate: 9%)**: This is a complex analytical question, requiring understanding cause-and-effect and specific historical details. Its low pass rate (9%) tells me students struggle with detailed explanations and historical impact.
        *   **"Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes? Explain" (pass rate: 10%)**: This requires specific factual recall *and* explanation of symbolism. The "Asher' stand," "ashok a second," "Ashok seamb" answers show a partial, garbled recall of "Ashoka" but an inability to connect it to the lions or explain its significance. This is crucial for Harappan: they might remember "Harappan" but fail to connect it to specific features.
        *   **"Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign in Indian history..." (pass rate: 12%)**: Again, a demand for explanation and significance. The "Empty Response" and fragmented answers further highlight struggles with articulation and complete recall.

    *   **"Teachers and experts consistently MISJUDGE item difficulty."** This is the core warning. My initial 40-50% is probably what an expert *would* say. I need to go lower.

    *   **"Could a student who barely reads English?"** They might recognize "Harappan Civilization" but "urban planning" could be a hurdle. Even if they know "drainage system," they might not be able to write it clearly.
    *   **"Could a student who was absent for this topic?"** Unlikely to get it correct.
    *   **"Exam anxiety causes blank responses."** Given the prevalence of "Empty Response" for other questions, this is a very real possibility.

3.  **Connecting to the Harappan Question:**

    *   **Recall vs. Explanation:** The Harappan question asks to "Describe one key feature." This is more about recall and simple description than complex explanation or analysis like the Ashoka or tribal questions. This *should* make it slightly easier than those.
    *   **Specificity of Concepts:** "Grid layout," "drainage system," "baked bricks," "citadel" are all relatively concrete and visual concepts. They are often taught with diagrams.
    *   **Expected "Wrong" Answers:** I'd expect answers similar to the "Ashok" examples:
        *   "Harappan city have good."
        *   "Drain water good."
        *   "Brick house."
        *   "They make big city."
        *   Or, most likely, "Empty Response."
    *   **Rubric:** The rubric is generous ("Correctly describes one key feature"). So, "good drainage system" or "streets were straight" would likely get a point.

4.  **Calibrating the Estimate:**

    *   The 29% overall pass rate is a strong ceiling.
    *   The "explanation" questions had 9-12% pass rates. This Harappan question is *simpler* than "explain significance" or "explain how colonial rule affected." So it should be higher than 12%.
    *   It's similar in
