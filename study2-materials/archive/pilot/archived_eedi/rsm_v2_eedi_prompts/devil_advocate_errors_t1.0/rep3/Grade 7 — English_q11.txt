Let's break down the thinking process for calibrating this estimate.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**

My first instinct, if I weren't specifically told to challenge it, might be: "Oh, 'tiny' is a simple adjective. Most students should be able to pick that out. Maybe 50-60%."

**Challenging Assumptions based on provided information:**

1.  **"Mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English."** This is crucial. "Limited English" means they might know common nouns and verbs, but grammatical terms like "adjective phrase" are likely advanced.
2.  **"Average pass rate is about 29%."** This sets a very low baseline for the *entire exam*. We're looking at a single question, but it indicates a significant struggle overall.
3.  **COMMON ERRORS:**
    *   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%)** This is a *descriptive* task requiring higher-order thinking and vocabulary. The very low pass rate here shows that even relatively simple *descriptive* tasks are extremely difficult.
    *   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (pass rate: 5%)** Again, abstract concepts and higher-level comprehension are nearly impossible for most.
    *   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'." (pass rate: 10%)** This is a much simpler, personal topic, but even here, students struggle with basic sentence structure and spelling ("My hobby is cricket play"). This indicates a very shaky foundation in basic English expression.
4.  **"Teachers and experts consistently MISJUDGE item difficulty."** This is a direct warning to *lower* my initial estimate. They overestimate because they forget the realities of the students.
5.  **"Could a student who barely reads English?"** A student who "barely reads English" will likely not know what an "adjective phrase" is. They might recognize "tiny" as a word, but not its grammatical function in this context.
6.  **"Could a student who was absent for this topic?"** Yes, many students would have been absent or just didn't grasp the concept when taught.
7.  **The Question Itself:** "Identify the adjective phrase in the sentence: A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony."
    *   The rubric says: "The student correctly identifies 'tiny' as an adjective." This is key. They don't need to identify an *adjective phrase* (which "tiny" alone isn't, strictly speaking, it's just an adjective), but just the adjective. This *simplifies* the task slightly.
    *   However, the question *asks* for an "adjective phrase." A student who correctly identifies "tiny" might do so because they know "tiny" is a describing word, not because they understand "adjective phrase."
    *   The term "adjective phrase" itself is a grammatical concept. For students with "limited English," understanding such terminology is a huge hurdle. They might recognize "tiny" but not know what an "adjective" is, let alone an "adjective phrase."

**Re-evaluation considering the challenges:**

*   **Grammar Terminology:** The biggest barrier is "adjective phrase." Even if the answer is just "tiny," the question *frames* it using a specific grammatical term that most struggling learners won't know or will confuse.
*   **Context of other errors:** The common errors show a severe lack of basic writing and comprehension skills. If they can't write a coherent 4-sentence paragraph about their hobby, or understand basic themes, asking them to identify a grammatical part of a sentence is a significant leap.
*   **"Empty Response" is common:** This tells us anxiety or simply not knowing leads to blanks.
*   **Pass Rate of 4-10% on other questions:** While this question is different, it points to the overall difficulty of the exam for these students.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Given that:
*   Students have "limited English."
*   They struggle with basic writing and comprehension.
*   Grammar terminology is often a major stumbling block.
*   Blank responses are common.
*   Other questions, even seemingly simpler ones (like the hobby paragraph), have very low pass rates.
*   Teachers *overestimate* difficulty.

It's highly unlikely that a significant portion would correctly identify "tiny" *because they understand the term "adjective phrase."* Some might guess "tiny" because it describes the bird, but without understanding the grammatical term, it's essentially a lucky guess within the context of the question. If they *had* to identify an *adjective* versus an *ad
