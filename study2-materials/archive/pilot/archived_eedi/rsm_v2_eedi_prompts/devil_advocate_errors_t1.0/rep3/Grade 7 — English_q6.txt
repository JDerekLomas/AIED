ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 7%

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

My initial instinct, like the experts, was to think it might be a bit higher, perhaps 15-20%. However, challenging those assumptions brings it down significantly.

Here's a breakdown of why I landed on 7%:

*   **Evidence from Similar Questions:** The provided examples for "Describes the poet’s writing style" (4% pass rate) and "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate) are extremely close in structure and cognitive demand. Both require analysis beyond literal comprehension and the ability to articulate an abstract concept in English.
*   **Cognitive Load:**
    *   **Understanding "Describes the poet's writing style":** This phrase itself is complex for students with limited English. "Describes" might be understood, but "poet's writing style" requires understanding "poet" (which might be okay), "writing," and "style" in an abstract literary context. It's not about *what* the poem says, but *how* it says it.
    *   **Formulating an Answer:** Even if they grasp the question, they need to recall or infer appropriate descriptive words (simple, descriptive, informal, direct). This requires a vocabulary that many struggling learners may not possess, especially when under exam pressure.
*   **Common Errors Illustrated:**
    *   "I am reading" (for "Describes the poet's writing style") shows a complete misunderstanding of the question's intent, likely latching onto "reading" or "poet."
    *   "Empty Response" is a consistent and significant factor, indicating either a complete lack of understanding, inability to formulate an answer, or exam anxiety. This is a very real problem.
    *   The "My Favourite Hobby" example shows that even with a more concrete and personal topic, students struggle with sentence structure and staying on topic. Describing an abstract concept like "writing style" is exponentially harder.
*   **Teacher/Expert Overestimation:** The crucial warning about teachers overestimating difficulty is paramount here. They likely assume students have covered literary terms like "style" and can apply them. However, for students from economically weaker sections with limited English, these "basic" concepts are often anything but.
*   **Average Pass Rate Context:** The overall average pass rate is 29%. This question is demonstrably more difficult than many others, given its abstract nature and the need for analytical thought in a second language. It should naturally fall well below the average.

Given the existing 4% pass rate on an identical question, a slight increase to 7% acknowledges that some students might *just* get lucky with a memorized term or a very basic, acceptable description, but the vast majority will fail due to the combined challenges of language, conceptual understanding, and exam pressure.
