Here's my thought process for estimating the proportion correct:

1.  **Analyze the Question:** "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away."

2.  **Analyze the Rubric:** "The student correctly transforms the sentence into passive voice: 'The leaves were blown away by the wind.'" This means they need to identify the object, change "blew" to "were blown," and correctly add "by the wind."

3.  **Consider the Target Group:** Class 7 students in Indian government schools, mostly from EWS, limited English, average pass rate ~29%.

4.  **Recall Common Errors and Teacher Overestimation:** This is crucial.
    *   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass):** This is *descriptive writing* – a skill that requires comprehension and generation. Voice change is a *grammatical transformation*. They are different skill sets, but both rely on a foundational understanding of English.
    *   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass):** Again, comprehension and abstract thought.
    *   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'" (10% pass):** Even basic sentence construction for a familiar topic is very low. "My hobby is cricket play" shows fundamental errors in verb tense and subject-verb agreement even in simple sentences.

5.  **Break Down the "Voice Change" Task:**
    *   **Identify Subject, Verb, Object:** *The wind* (S) *blew* (V) *the leaves* (O) *away*.
    *   **Shift Object to Subject:** *The leaves...*
    *   **Apply "to be" verb + Past Participle:** "blew" -> past participle "blown". The "to be" verb must agree with the new subject and match the original tense. "blew" (simple past) means "were blown".
    *   **Reintroduce Original Subject with "by":** *...by the wind.*
    *   **Combine and Add Adverb:** *The leaves were blown away by the wind.*

6.  **Evaluate Each Step for a Struggling Learner:**

    *   **Understanding "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice":** This is a meta-linguistic concept. If students are struggling with basic sentence formation (like in the hobby examples), they might not have *any* conceptual grasp of grammatical voice. This likely requires specific, explicit instruction. Many might not have received or absorbed it.
    *   **Identifying Subject, Verb, Object:** Easier, but not guaranteed.
    *   **Shifting Object to Subject:** Requires understanding "object" and "subject" roles.
    *   **Converting Verb Tense for Passive:** This is the *most difficult part*.
        *   They need to know "blew" is past simple.
        *   They need to know "be + past participle" is the passive structure.
        *   They need to know the past participle of "blow" is "blown" (irregular verb - a huge hurdle).
        *   They need to conjugate "be" correctly (to "were" for "leaves" in the past tense). This is complex. "Is blown" or "was blown" or "are blown" or "blowing" are all plausible errors for someone guessing or not fully understanding.
    *   **Adding "by the wind":** Relatively easier, but depends on understanding its purpose.

7.  **Compare to Pass Rates of Other Questions:**
    *   The "hobby" question (10%) shows students struggle even with writing simple, familiar sentences. "Voice change" is significantly more complex grammatically and conceptually.
    *   The other questions are very low (4-5%) for abstract comprehension. While "voice change" is concrete, the *number of grammatical rules and pieces of vocabulary* (irregular verb "blown") required is substantial.

8.  **Re-calibrating First Instinct:** My *first* instinct might be higher because I recall learning this in school and finding it straightforward *as a native speaker with a strong foundation*. However, considering the data:
    *   **Low English proficiency:** This makes grasping grammatical concepts much harder.
    *   **Irregular verb "blow-blew-blown":** This is a *major* trap. Many might use "blowed."
    *   **Correct "to be" verb and tense:** Getting "were" *and* "blown" correct simultaneously is difficult.
    *   **Conceptual understanding of "passive voice":** This isn't just word-swapping.

    The examples show very fundamental errors. Changing voice requires *precise application of multiple grammatical rules*. Given that many students can't even correctly phrase
