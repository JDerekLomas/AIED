Here's my thought process to arrive at the estimate:

1.  **Analyze the Target Audience:** Class 7 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. Average pass rate of ~29% on *this exam type*, not general English exams. This implies a very low baseline for English comprehension and writing.

2.  **Analyze the Question:** "Describes the poet's writing style."
    *   **Keyword "Describes":** This implies analytical thinking beyond simple recall. Students need to understand what "describe" means in an analytical context.
    *   **Keyword "poet's writing style":** This is highly abstract.
        *   "Poet's": Implies understanding the role of an author.
        *   "Writing style": This is a challenging concept for *native* English speakers at this age, let alone L2 learners from disadvantaged backgrounds. It requires understanding elements like word choice, sentence structure, tone, imagery, rhythm, etc., and then summarizing them with a descriptive adjective.

3.  **Analyze the Rubric:** "Identifies a suitable and relevant word describing the writing style (e.g., simple, descriptive, informal, direct) or other appropriate word."
    *   This confirms that a *single adjective* or very short phrase is sufficient. This simplifies the *output* requirement but not the *cognitive load* to arrive at it.
    *   The examples (simple, descriptive, informal, direct) are themselves fairly abstract English adjectives.

4.  **Consider the Common Errors (CRUCIAL):**
    *   "Q: 'Describes the poet’s writing style.' (pass rate: 4%) Wrong answer: 'I am reading.'" This is the *exact same question* as the one I'm estimating. Its previous pass rate was **4%**. This is a powerful anchor.
    *   The common errors on *other* questions demonstrate:
        *   Misinterpretation of keywords (e.g., "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho" for a paragraph on "My Favourite Hobby" shows difficulty adhering to the prompt).
        *   Difficulty with abstract concepts (the theme question).
        *   Simple lack of vocabulary and grammatical structure (e.g., "My hobby is cricket play").
        *   A high percentage of "Empty Response."

5.  **Apply the Expert Bias Warning:** "Teachers and experts consistently MISJUDGE item difficulty." My first instinct might be, "Well, if they just say 'simple' or 'clear,' that's not too hard." *CHALLENGE THAT INSTINCT.*
    *   Could a student who barely reads English understand "writing style"? No.
    *   Could a student absent for that topic (if it was even explicitly taught as an analytical concept) do it? No.
    *   Will exam anxiety cause blank responses? Yes, for complex questions.
    *   Have many students practiced this *exact type* of analytical literary question in English? Highly unlikely given the general proficiency level.

6.  **Synthesize and Calibrate:**
    *   The *same question* had a 4% pass rate previously.
    *   The cognitive demands ("describes," "writing style") are very high for this cohort.
    *   The examples of successful answers ("simple," "descriptive") still require an advanced understanding of both the literary concept and English vocabulary.
    *   The common errors confirm widespread difficulty with comprehension, analytical tasks, and English expression.
    *   The warning against overestimating student ability is paramount.

7.  **Final Estimate:** The 4% prior data point is incredibly strong evidence. There's no information to suggest conditions have drastically changed to make this *easier*. If anything, focusing on it might make some attempt, but true understanding for *correctness* will still be low. I might allow for a very slight bump if there's been some exposure, but "4%" is almost certainly representative. Perhaps rounding up marginally for generosity, but the underlying difficulty is extreme.

    Given the historical pass rate of *the exact question* is 4%, and the general common errors support extreme difficulty for this cohort, I must lean heavily on that.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 5%**
