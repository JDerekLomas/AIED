Okay, I'm going to follow the instructions carefully and challenge my first instinct, which would be to say "many students will get this" because decomposition is a common topic.

Here's my breakdown of why students will struggle:

*   **English Language Barrier:** This is a major hurdle. The question uses terms like "collected waste," "pit," "notice any change," "evaluate," and "beneficial for soil health." While "plants," "vegetables," and "fruits" are somewhat common, the full sentence structure and request for "reasons" and "evaluation" will trip up students with limited English. The sample incorrect answers clearly demonstrate how poorly these students grasp scientific terminology and even basic English sentence construction.

*   **Conceptual Understanding (Decomposition/Compost):** Even if a student understands the words, the concept of decomposition leading to compost as a "beneficial" substance for "soil health" might not be robust. The sample errors show fundamental misunderstandings even in simpler science questions (e.g., misidentifying what a "pitcher plant" does, struggling with basic experimental setups). "Gobar" (cow dung) came up in an incorrect answer for the manure question, suggesting some familiarity with organic matter, but linking *this specific waste* to *specific beneficial changes* for *soil health* might be too advanced for struggling learners.

*   **Open-ended "Reasons and Evaluate":** This is a critical difficulty point. It requires more than a simple recall of a fact. Students need to describe *what* changes (smell, color, texture, reduction in volume), *why* (decomposition by microorganisms), and then *evaluate* its benefit to soil health (nutrient enrichment, improved texture). This level of synthesis and explanation is often a struggle for students with a pass rate of 29%. They often provide very brief, fragmented, or off-topic responses even when attempting explanations.

*   **Absence/Limited Exposure:** Given the low pass rate, many students were likely absent for parts of the curriculum, or the teaching was not effective enough for them to internalize these concepts in a way that allows for comprehensive answers. "Basic concepts" are definitely not basic for these students.

*   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** As noted, exam anxiety is a significant factor, leading to blank responses, even if there's some partial knowledge.

*   **Matching Rubric:** The rubric requires the user to "suggests that the gardener will notice significant changes." This means a simple "yes" isn't enough; there needs to be an indication of *what* kind of changes (decomposition). Then implicitly, the reasons and evaluation contribute to that. Students might say "yes," but then fail on "reasons and evaluate," making them only partially correct, and if they don't explicitly mention "changes" related to decomposition, they might not meet even the minimal rubric requirements for "noticing changes."

Considering the examples of common errors, which are quite severe in their lack of understanding and linguistic ability, an open-ended question like this asking for "reasons and evaluation" seems very difficult for this population.

My calibrated estimate, therefore, leans towards a very low proportion. Students might write "yes, it will become khaad (manure)" or something simple, but elaborating on *how* it changes, *why*, and *how it benefits soil health* in an intelligible way is a very high bar. The instruction "The user suggests that the gardener will notice significant changes" means they need to demonstrate *what* those changes are (e.g., decomposition, reduction in volume, becoming fertile soil).
