After challenging my assumptions and considering the common errors and specific student demographics:

My initial instinct might be that "some/any" is a relatively basic English grammar point that Class 6 students should have encountered. However, factoring in the context:

1.  **Limited English proficiency:** The pass rates on seemingly simple descriptive and analytical questions (4-5%) highlight just how fundamental the English language barrier is. Many students are likely still grappling with basic vocabulary and sentence structure, let's alone nuanced grammar.
2.  **Abstractness of grammar rules:** While "some" vs. "any" follows a rule (positive statements vs. questions/negatives), understanding and applying that rule consistently in a test setting, especially when other English concepts are so challenging, is a hurdle. It's not a direct factual recall like "What is X?" but requires application.
3.  **Common error types:** The example errors show a strong tendency towards:
    *   **Empty responses:** Signifying complete lack of understanding or confidence.
    *   **Tangential or incomplete answers:** Students try to respond but are far off, suggesting a fundamental lack of comprehension of the *question's* demand, let alone the topic.
    *   **Basic vocabulary/spelling errors even in simple self-description:** "My favowrife hobby cbaking" shows difficulty with core written English.
4.  **Misjudgment by experts:** Experts overestimate. This is a crucial reminder. While "some/any" might seem simple to a native speaker or someone fluent, for a student with limited exposure and frequent absence, it's not a guaranteed learning.
5.  **Lack of practice/familiarity:** "Many students have never practiced this exact question type." Even if they know the rule, seeing it presented as a "choose the correct word" fill-in-the-blank might be unfamiliar enough to cause issues.
6.  **Exam anxiety:** This often leads to blank responses, especially on questions that require a decision or application rather than simple recall.

Comparing this to the provided error types and pass rates:
*   "Describes the poet's writing style." (4% pass rate) - This is highly analytical.
*   "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate) - Also analytical.
*   "Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby." (10% pass rate) - This is personal, less abstract, but still requires constructing multiple sentences correctly.

The "some/any" question is less abstract than literary analysis but requires correct application of a grammar rule, which is a step beyond simple vocabulary or literal comprehension. The extremely low pass rates on the paragraph writing suggest even basic sentence construction is very difficult.

This "some/any" question tests a specific grammar rule. Given the difficulties in even producing *any* relevant text, accurately applying a grammar rule without perfect instruction or retention would be challenging. Students might guess randomly or get confused by the options if they don't fully grasp the underlying rule. Many might just leave it blank due to anxiety or confusion.

Therefore, while "some/any" is generally considered basic, within this specific context of very low proficiency and high test anxiety, I anticipate the performance to be significantly lower than what one might expect in a more privileged school setting. It's more akin to the "My Favourite Hobby" question in terms of requiring sentence construction and appropriate word choice, and less like literary analysis.

Considering a similar type of discrete grammar question, it should theoretically fare better than a complex paragraph, but not by a huge margin given the context. Students may guess correctly at a higher rate than for open-ended questions.

Revised estimation:
