This is a classic "easy for us, hard for them" trap. My first instinct, knowing that fables are a common literary form, would be higher. However, looking at the common errors and the consistently low pass rates for similar English-based definition or description questions, I need to significantly lower that estimate.

Here's why:

*   **Limited English Proficiency:** Even though "fable" might be discussed in Hindi/local language, providing a definition *in English* that matches the rubric (using terms like "typically uses animals as characters," "imparts a moral lesson") is a high bar for students with 29% average pass rates and evidence of extremely broken English (e.g., "I am reading" for writing style).
*   **Abstract Concepts:** "Fable" isn't just about identifying it, but defining its core elements. The idea of "imparts a moral lesson" is a relatively abstract concept to articulate precisely in a second language.
*   **Previous Performance on Definition/Description:** The example "Describes the poet’s writing style" had a 4% pass rate. While "fable" might be a more common term, articulating a clear definition is still a descriptive task.
*   **"Empty Response" & Broken English:** The high rate of "Empty Response" or utterly nonsensical answers (like "The last bargin they about a child and labour. many people tried to force the la") suggests that even if they know *of* a fable, translating that knowledge into a coherent English definition is beyond them. "My hobby is cricket play" shows they can name, but struggle with constructing even simple sentences.
*   **Lack of Practice with Exact Question Type:** As noted, they might not have practiced "define [term]" extensively. They might be familiar with fables as stories but not used to extracting and articulating their characteristics in formal definitions.
*   **Anxiety:** The pressure of an exam can lead to blank responses even if they have some fragmented knowledge.

While "fable" might be known to *some* in the class, very few will be able to construct a definition in English that encompasses both "short story, animals as characters, and moral lesson" sufficiently to earn full marks. Many will likely write nothing, something vague like "It's a story," or struggle immensely with the English structure.

Considering all these factors, particularly the performance on "writing style" and "theme," a *correct* definition as per the rubric seems incredibly challenging for this group.
