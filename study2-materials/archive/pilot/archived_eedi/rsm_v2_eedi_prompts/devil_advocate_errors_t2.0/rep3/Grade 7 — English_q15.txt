I initially thought this question would have a slightly higher pass rate, perhaps 15-20%, because "My Favourite Hobby" is a very common essay topic. However, considering the common errors shown for similar questions and the extremely low pass rates on the examples provided, I need to adjust my estimate significantly downwards.

Here's why:

*   **The Length Requirement ("4-5 sentences") is a huge barrier:** Students struggle with generating even short, coherent sentences in English, let alone crafting 4-5 connected sentences on a single topic. The "My hobby is cricket play" example perfectly illustrates this struggle with sentence construction and length.
*   **Multiple Prompts within one question:** "What it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it" means they need to integrate three distinct pieces of information coherently. This adds cognitive load beyond just identifying the hobby.
*   **Evidence of Grammatical/Syntactic Struggle:** The example "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy" shows that students might list things but fail to form sentences or connect them to the hobby prompt. It also demonstrates difficulty staying on topic, moving to "food."
*   **Vocabulary Limitations:** Even simple words to describe *why* they enjoy a hobby might be missing. They might know "happy" but struggle with "relaxing," "challenging," "creative," etc.
*   **Exam Anxiety and Blank Responses:** Given the "Empty Response" common for other questions, many students will simply not attempt a paragraph they perceive as difficult or too long.
*   **"Basic" isn't Basic:** While teachers might consider "write about your hobby" a basic exercise, for students with very limited English and little practice in structured paragraph writing, it is an advanced task.

Looking at the pass rates for similar questions:
*   "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what" (pass rate: 10%) - *This is essentially the exact same question as provided as an example in the prompt, with a pass rate of 10%. I must respect the provided empirical data for a very similar item.*

Given that this question is almost identical to one for which data was already provided and which scored 10%, my estimate should be very close to that, possibly a point or two lower if the nuances of "when you do it" and "why you enjoy it" are particularly difficult, but given the existing 10% on essentially this question, I will align with it as closely as possible.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **10%**
