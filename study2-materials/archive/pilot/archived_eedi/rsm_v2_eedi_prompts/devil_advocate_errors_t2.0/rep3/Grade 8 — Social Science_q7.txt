Let's break down the factors for this specific question and rubric.

**The Question:** "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"
**The Rubric:** Explaining that victory led to establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab).

**Analysis considering common errors and student context:**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "Contribute to the expansion of British power" is moderately complex. "Contribute" might be understood, "expansion of power" less so in the specific context.
    *   The phrase "political dominance/control over Bengal" requires understanding both "political dominance" and "Bengal."

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   The Battle of Plassey (1757) is a cornerstone of Indian history curriculum at this level. Students would *definitely* have encountered it. However, the *nuance* of its contribution (political control, puppet ruler) might be lost if it was just rote learned as "British won."
    *   Understanding the concept of a "puppet nawab" requires going beyond simply memorizing the name Mir Jafar. Many might remember the name but not the significance of his placement.

3.  **Common Errors Observed:**
    *   **Empty Response:** This is a major concern. Even if they know "Plassey," if they can't formulate a coherent answer linking it to *expansion of power*, they might leave it blank, especially given exam anxiety.
    *   **Tangential/Vague:** Students might just write "British won" or "British became powerful." This *doesn't* meet the rubric for explaining *how* it contributed (i.e., by establishing dominance/control over Bengal and using Mir Jafar). They might simply state outcomes without explaining the mechanism of contribution.
    *   **Misspellings/Incorrect Details:** Less likely to entirely prevent scoring, but can signal a general lack of clarity.

4.  **Teacher/Expert Overestimation:**
    *   Teachers would think, "Everyone knows Plassey! Everyone knows Mir Jafar!" But they forget the need to *articulate* the link clearly and precisely enough for the rubric, especially for the "politically weaker" students. They'd assume understanding of "puppet ruler" is inherent when it might just be a memorized phrase without true comprehension of its implications for British power.

**Challenging the first instinct:**

My first instinct might be around 25-35% because it's a core topic. However, considering the extreme rates of "Empty Response" (which means *zero* score), the limited English impacting the ability to link cause and effect ("contributed to"), and the requirement for specific detail (political dominance, Bengal, Mir Jafar), the actual pass rate will be significantly lower for students who *just barely* grasp English and the concept.

Students might write:
*   "British won the war of Plassey." (No score)
*   "British took control of India." (Too broad, no mention of Bengal/Mir Jafar as mechanism)
*   "Mir Jafar helped British." (Incomplete explanation of contribution)

To score, they need to connect the win *to British political control/dominance over Bengal* and/or *the installation of Mir Jafar as a puppet*. This level of articulation is what challenges students with limited English and conceptual clarity.

Given the abysmal rates for other conceptually more demanding (but still seemingly "basic" to an expert) social science questions, and the high frequency of "Empty Response," a core historical event like Plassey, while known by name, requires a level of conceptual articulation that many struggle with.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Given the common errors (especially empty responses and vague answers), the precise nature of the rubric, and the low English proficiency/conceptual grasp of struggling learners:

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 18%**
