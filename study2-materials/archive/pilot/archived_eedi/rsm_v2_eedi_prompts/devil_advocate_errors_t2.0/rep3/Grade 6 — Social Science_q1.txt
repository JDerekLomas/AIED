Let's break down the thought process for this question.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):**

My first thought is, "This is pretty basic geography. Himalayas are well-known, maybe Aravalli too. Even if they only know one, they get 0.5. Lots of students should know at least one." This initial thought would probably lead to an estimate of 40-50%.

**Challenging the Assumptions (Applying the provided advice):**

1.  **Limited English:** "Name any two major mountain ranges..." This isn't super complex English, but "major" and "ranges" might be slightly tricky if their vocabulary is extremely limited. However, "Name two mountains" would likely get the gist across for most. The biggest English barrier is probably *understanding the topic itself* more than the question wording.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:** While "Himalayas" might feel basic to someone educated, imagine a student who consistently struggles in Social Science, often gives "Empty Responses," or guesses things like "Asher' stand." Have they internalized the concept of "mountain range" and memorized the names? Perhaps not. They might know "mountains" exist, but not necessarily specific *ranges* by name.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** The example errors clearly show "Empty Response" is a massive problem, even for questions that seem to have simple, direct answers. If they don't *immediately* know two, or even one, they might freeze.

4.  **Never Practiced this Exact Question Type:** While they've certainly learned about mountains, have they explicitly practiced "Name two major mountain ranges in India"? Or is it usually "Where are the Himalayas located?" This distinction can be important. They might be able to *identify* them on a map, but not *recall their names* when prompted like this.

5.  **Teachers Overestimate:** This is a crucial piece of advice. Teachers might think, "Oh, we covered this in Class 5 and Class 6! They definitely know the Himalayas!" But covering it and a struggling student *retaining and being able to recall it under pressure* are very different things.

6.  **"Barely Reads English" / "Absent for Topic":**
    *   **Barely reads English:** The English itself is relatively straightforward, but if they struggled with understanding "significance" or "colonial rule," they might also struggle with basic factual recall due to overall academic weakness.
    *   **Absent for topic:** If they missed the specific lessons on Indian physical features, they would have no chance.

**Refining the Estimate:**

*   **Average pass rate (29%):** This is for *all* Social Science questions. This question seems *slightly* easier than explaining colonial rule's impact or Ashoka's significance, but the "Why are lions..." question also had a low pass rate (10%) despite seeming fact-based. The fact that *any* factual recall question yields a 10% or 12% pass rate is highly concerning.
*   **Difficulty compared to examples:**
    *   "Colonial rule" (9%): Requires explanation, higher-order thinking, and knowledge. This question is just recall.
    *   "Lions on notes" (10%): Factual recall, but specific and perhaps culturally less emphasized than geography. Answers suggest deep confusion (Asher' stand, Ashok seamb). This question is pure recall, similar to this. The fact that students invent things like "Asher' stand" rather than just giving up is interesting. They try to relate "lions" to "Ashok," which is correct thinking, but then fail spectacularly on recall or spelling.
    *   "Ashoka's reign" (12%): Factual recall and explanation.

*   **Core Challenge:** The major mountain ranges (Himalayas, Aravalli) *should* be basic. The issue isn't complexity but **recall and basic retention in a stressed environment, for a population prone to "Empty Responses" or severe factual errors.** If students struggle to name basic Ashokan facts (leading to "Empty Response" or "Ashok seamb"), then naming mountain ranges isn't guaranteed either.

*   **Scoring (0.5 for one):** This is generous. If they only know one, they still get half credit. The Himalayas are overwhelmingly likely to be the *one* range students might recall. Aravalli is also prominent in some regions, and perhaps Western/Eastern Ghats for students in peninsular India.

Given the pervasive "Empty Response" issue and the very low pass rates on other recall-based questions, simply *knowing* the answer isn't enough. Many students might
