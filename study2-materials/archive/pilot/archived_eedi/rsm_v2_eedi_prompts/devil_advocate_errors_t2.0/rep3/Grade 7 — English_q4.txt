Here's my analysis to arrive at the calibrated estimate:

1.  **Analyze the Question Structure and Language:**
    *   "Do you think..." This requires a subjective "yes/no" or an implied agreement. It's relatively simple.
    *   "...the king's questions are important in real life?" This requires linking a story concept (the king's questions) to a real-world concept ("important in real life").
    *   "Give one reason." This requires a basic explanatory sentence or phrase.

2.  **Connect to Common Errors & Student Profile:**
    *   **"Empty Response":** This is a huge factor. Anxiety and lack of comprehension lead to many blank answers. The sample pass rates of 4-10% clearly show this.
    *   **Limited English:**
        *   "Important in real life": While "important" is a common word, "in real life" might be slightly less frequent than simple descriptors. However, the concept itself isn't too abstract.
        *   "Give one reason": This phrasing is common in simpler questions and likely understood.
    *   **"Basic Concepts Not Basic":** The *concept* of identifying real-world relevance from a story is a step up from just comprehension. However, it's a common critical thinking skill that teachers *try* to teach. The simplicity of *this specific question's content* (finding the right time, people, things) makes it more accessible than an abstract theme.
    *   **Irrelevant Answers:** The "My Favourite Hobby" example shows students often just dump pre-memorized content or something tangentially related. For this question, an answer like "Yes, because kings are important" or "Yes, because the king wants to know" is possible.
    *   **Grammatical Errors:** Expected, but often overlookable if the core meaning is present for this rubric.

3.  **Rubric Consideration:**
    *   "The king wanted to answer (based on the reading passage) the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with. Any valid reason."
    *   The "any valid reason" is crucial. Students don't need to quote the passage directly or list all three. Something like "because you need to know what to do" or "it helps you live better" or "knowing the right time to do things is important" could qualify. This leniency is important.

4.  **Challenging First Instinct (Overestimation):**
    *   My initial instinct might be 30-40% because the question itself isn't structurally complex, and "important" is a common word.
    *   **However, I must counteract:**
        *   **Pass Rate for *simple* recall is 4-5%.** This is a step beyond simple recall into very basic analysis.
        *   The sheer volume of "Empty Responses" and off-topic answers (e.g., the "The last bargin they about a child and labour..." even though it misses the *theme* of the poem entirely) will significantly pull down the average.
        *   Students who struggle with "Writes the poet's style" (4%) will find relating king's questions to *real life* challenging, even if the individual words are known. It requires synthesizing the story with outside knowledge.
        *   Anxiety and lack of practice for this *exact* type of inferential, application question are significant barriers.

5.  **Re-evaluating Based on Common Errors & Student Profile:**
    *   Many will give an "Empty Response" (conservatively, 30-40% right there).
    *   Some will struggle to connect "king's questions" to "real life importance" clearly and will give vague or tangential answers. (e.g., "yes because the king needs to know things")
    *   Some might interpret "important in real life" as "important *in the story's real life*" and describe the king's motivation without making the *personal* connection required for "real life."
    *   A smaller group will successfully articulate a basic reason (e.g., "Yes, it helps you live better," "Yes, to make good decisions," "Yes, for your future"). The "any valid reason" helps these students.

Given the *very low* pass rates for similar, even slightly more complex, analytical questions (4-10%) and the strong propensity for "Empty Response," this question, while verbally simple, requires a small inferential leap many will struggle with. The forgiving rubric helps, but the execution and English limitations will remain massive hurdles. It's likely better than the 4-5% range because "important" is very common,
