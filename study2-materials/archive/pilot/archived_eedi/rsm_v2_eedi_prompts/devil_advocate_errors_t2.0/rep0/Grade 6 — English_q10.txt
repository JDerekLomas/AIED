Here's my thought process for estimating the proportion of correct answers:

1.  **Analyze the Target Audience:** Class 6 students in Indian government schools. Economically weaker sections, limited English. Average pass rate ~29% on *other* English questions. This immediately signals a low baseline.

2.  **Analyze the Specific Question:** "Choose the correct word. There are (some/any) apples in the basket."
    *   It's a grammar question focusing on "some" vs. "any" in affirmative sentences.
    *   The sentence structure ("There are... apples in the basket") is common and relatively simple.
    *   The context (apples in a basket) is relatable and concrete.

3.  **Consider Potential Difficulties for This Audience:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Apples," "basket" are likely known. "There are" is fundamental.
    *   **Grammar Concept:** The "some" vs. "any" distinction is fundamental but often misused even by intermediate learners. "Some" for affirmative, "any" for negative/questions. For a Class 6 student with limited English, this rule might not be deeply ingrained or fully understood.
    *   **"Choice" vs. "Fill-in-the-Blank":** Choosing from two options *can* be easier than generating the word from scratch, but it also means there's a 50/50 chance of getting it right just by guessing.
    *   **Direct Instruction:** Has "some/any" been explicitly taught and practiced? If so, to what extent? Given the background, it's possible it was rushed, poorly understood, or even missed.
    *   **Cognates/First Language Interference:** I don't see direct interference from common Indian languages here that would easily lead to the wrong answer.
    *   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** While this question *feels* easier, the common errors listed (empty responses) are a red flag for any question type. Some students will still be overwhelmed and just leave it blank.

4.  **Review Common Errors from Other Questions (and *Crucially*, their low pass rates):**
    *   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass): This requires higher-order thinking, abstract concepts, and specific literary vocabulary. It confirms very limited descriptive English. "I am reading" shows an inability to link the question to the required type of answer.
    *   "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass): Again, abstract, critical thinking. "The last bargin they about a child and labour..." shows an attempt at content but very broken grammar and an inability to extract a *theme* correctly.
    *   "Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby." (10% pass): This is a simpler task but still requires paragraph structure, sentence formation, and coherent ideas. Errors like "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy" show a list-like answer, poor structure, and topic shift. "My hobby is cricket play" is structurally flawed.

5.  **Re-evaluating Against Instinct:**
    *   My first instinct might be, "Oh, 'some' is pretty basic. Many students would know this."
    *   *Challenging that instinct*: Look at the actual pass rates. 4%, 5%, 10% on *far more complex* but still fundamental English tasks.
    *   This "some/any" question is definitely simpler than describing a writing style or writing a paragraph. However, it still requires an understanding of a grammatical rule that isn't universal across languages.
    *   A student who gets 4-10% on *other* questions is probably guessing for this one, or only dimly aware of the rule.
    *   If they haven't explicitly learned/practiced "some" vs "any", they're at a 50% guess rate *if they attempt it*. But some won't attempt it correctly due to anxiety, lack of confidence, or just not knowing.

6.  **Synthesizing and Calibrating:**
    *   The task is concrete (not abstract like "theme").
    *   It's multiple choice (binary choice).
    *   It's a foundational grammar point taught in early English learning.
    *   However, the *baseline performance* (29% average, and 4-10% on examples) is extremely low. This means a significant portion of students will likely get *any* English question wrong, regardless of perceived difficulty.
    *   Even if taught, *retention* and *application* for these students are low.
    *   The "some/
