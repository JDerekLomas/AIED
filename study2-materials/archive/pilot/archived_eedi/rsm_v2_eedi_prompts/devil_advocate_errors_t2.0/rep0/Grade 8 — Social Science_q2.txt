Let's break down the thinking process for calibrating this estimate.

**1. Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):**

My first instinct, based on general knowledge of Indian history curricula, would be that "Harappan Civilization" and its "urban planning" are fundamental concepts taught in Class 8. Many students *should* know about the grid system, drainage, or citadel. So, maybe 40-50%?

**2. Applying the Red Flags from the Prompt:**

*   **"Mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English."** This is *huge*. "Describe one key feature" is a relatively simple English command, but for students barely understanding the language, it adds a cognitive load. Even if they know the *fact* in their native language, translating it into comprehensible English is a hurdle.
*   **"Average pass rate is about 29%."** This sets a very low bar. We are looking at students who, on average, are struggling significantly across all subjects.
*   **Common Errors - "Empty Response."** This is prevalent even for questions that seem simpler. Exam anxiety, lack of preparation, or just giving up are real factors.
*   **Common Errors - Vague/Incorrect English for related history topics.**
    *   Lions on currency (Ashoka): Students provided "Ashok seamb," "ashok a second." This shows a basic recognition of "Ashok" but a complete inability to articulate *why*.
    *   Tribal communities under British rule: *All empty responses*. This suggests either total lack of knowledge or inability to articulate anything meaningful for a more complex question.
*   **Teacher Overestimation:** This is the most crucial warning. I *am* a teacher/expert in a sense, and I need to fight my initial urge to assume competency. "Basic" concepts aren't basic.

**3. Specific Analysis of the Harappan Question:**

*   **Concept Complexity:** Harappan Civilization *is* a core topic. Students likely have heard about it.
*   **Recall vs. Explanation:** The question asks to "describe one key feature." This is more than just recalling a name (like Ashoka) but less complex than "explain the significance." Students need to access the information and phrase it concisely.
*   **Possible Correct Answers (and their ease of articulation):**
    *   "Grid layout of streets": This is fairly specific. "Grid" might be a known term.
    *   "Advanced drainage system": "Drainage" is a relatively common word. "Advanced" adds detail but might be omitted by struggling students.
    *   "Use of baked bricks": Simple. "Baked bricks" is concrete.
    *   "Division of city into citadel and lower town": "Citadel" is a less common English word. "Lower town" is easier. This is a slightly more complex feature to describe.

**4. Challenging Assumptions/Lowering the Estimate:**

*   **The "Empty Response" Threat:** Given the examples, a significant number of students will likely write nothing, even if they've *heard* of Harappa. Why? Limited vocabulary, unable to form a sentence, lack of confidence, anxiety.
*   **Partial Credit isn't a thing here:** The rubric is Max Score: 1. It needs to be "correctly describes one key feature." "Harappan had good cities" wouldn't pass. "Baked" without "bricks" probably wouldn't.
*   **Limited English Barrier:** Even if they know "Pakki Eent" (baked brick), how many can consistently write "baked bricks" correctly? How many know "drainage system" vs. "water drain"?
*   **Low Overall Pass Rate (29%):** If the average pass rate is 29%, we should expect questions to have highly varied individual pass rates, with many falling significantly below average, especially for more demanding tasks or concepts they might struggle to articulate.
*   **Absence/Lack of Attention:** Students might have simply missed that lesson or weren't paying attention. Harappan civilization can be one among many topics covered.

**5. Final Calibration:**

My initial thought was 40-50%.
Factoring in:
*   Limited English and vocabulary challenges: Subtract 10-15%.
*   Prevalence of "Empty Response": Subtract another 10%.
*   Difficulty with forming even simple correct sentences in English: Subtract 5-10%.
*   The overall low pass rate and poor performance on other history questions (e.g., Lions/Ashoka where they recognized "Ashok" but couldn't explain anything).

This brings me down significantly. While Harappa is taught, articulating it *correctly* in English for a low-achieving
