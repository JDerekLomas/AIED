Here's my thought process to arrive at the estimate, actively challenging initial instincts:

1.  **Initial Read-Through & Identify Core Concepts:**
    *   Start temperature: 30°C at 10 am.
    *   Rate of increase: 2°C per hour.
    *   End time: 4 pm.
    *   Goal: Find temperature at 4 pm.
    *   Core math: Time elapsed, multiplication, addition.

2.  **Initial, Uncalibrated Instinct (The Overestimation Trap):**
    *   "This is pretty straightforward. Find the hours, multiply by the increase, add to the start temp. Class 6 students should know this. Maybe 60-70%." *Immediately hit the brakes on this thought.* This is exactly the kind of overestimation the prompt warns about.

3.  **Applying the "Challenge Your Assumptions" Filter (Student Perspective):**

    *   **English Language Barrier:**
        *   "At 10 am in the morning..." - Repetitive but clear enough.
        *   "temperature of Jodhpur was 30°C." - Common word, likely understood.
        *   "If the temperature increases by 2°C per hour..." - "Increases by," "per hour" are key. These can be stumbling blocks for weak readers. Do they equate "increases by" with addition? Do they understand "per hour" as a rate for multiplication?
        *   "...what will be the temperature...at 4:00 in the evening?" - "Evening" for 4 pm is slightly less common in purely mathematical contexts than "afternoon," but probably understood.
        *   *Conclusion:* The language isn't impossibly complex, but words like "increases by," "per hour," and understanding the whole sentence structure as a rate problem *will* trip up a significant number of weaker English learners.

    *   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
        *   **Time Calculation (10 am to 4 pm):** This is the crucial first step.
            *   Counting fingers: 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4. (7 hours). *Common mistake alert!* Many will count the *numbers* directly.
            *   Actual elapsed hours: 11 am (1 hr), 12 pm (2 hr), 1 pm (3 hr), 2 pm (4 hr), 3 pm (5 hr), 4 pm (6 hr). *This takes mental effort.*
            *   Some might do 4 - 10, getting -6 (ignoring am/pm switch) or 16 (4 pm in 24-hr) - 10 = 6. The 24-hour conversion might not be widely practiced, or remembered under stress.
            *   *Risk:* Many students will get 7 hours, or a completely different incorrect number.
        *   **Multiplication:** Once they get the hours, multiplying `hours x 2`. If hours are wrong, multiplication is wrong by proxy. Basic multiplication itself for 6-hour vs 7-hour isn't the hardest part.
        *   **Addition:** Adding the total increase to 30. Again, basic addition itself isn't the hardest part *if* the prior steps are correct.
        *   *Conclusion:* Calculating the elapsed time across the AM/PM boundary is a significant hurdle that is frequently underestimated by adults. This alone could halve the correct responses.

    *   **Exam Anxiety / Practice / Absenteeism:**
        *   **Anxiety:** Makes students freeze, misinterpret words they normally know, or make calculation errors.
        *   **Absenteeism:** Some might have missed the lesson on "time elapsed across am/pm." This isn't usually the primary focus of rate problems, which tend to give elapsed time directly.
        *   **Question Type:** While rate problems are common, this specific format combining a fixed start time, a per-hour rate, and a specific end time might not have been practiced *exactly* this way. Many exercises just state "over 6 hours."
        *   *Conclusion:* These factors depress scores further. A student who 'mostly' gets it might make a small but fatal error under pressure.

4.  **Recalibrating based on average pass rate (29%):**
    The problem description states an average pass rate of 29%. This problem, while involving multiple steps, isn't conceptually groundbreaking for Class 6 *if taught well and practiced.* However, we're explicitly told that's *not* the reality.

    *   The English is slightly complex but
