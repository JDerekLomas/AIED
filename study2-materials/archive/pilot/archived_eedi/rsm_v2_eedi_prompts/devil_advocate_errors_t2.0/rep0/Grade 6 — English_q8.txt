Okay, let's break this down.

My initial, *uncalibrated* instinct, if I hadn't read the context, might have been around 50-60%. "It's just rearranging a few common words!"

But now, applying the provided context and examples of common errors:

1.  **Limited English and Common Errors:**
    *   The "Describes the poet's writing style" question (4%) got "I am reading." This shows a complete disconnect from understanding complex English instructions *even when the words are present*.
    *   "Write a theme or central idea..." (5%) gets a lot of empty responses and partial, incoherent sentences like "The last bargin they about a child and labour..."
    *   "Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby" (10%) shows students struggling even with very simple, high-frequency words, producing fragments like "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy" or "My hobby is cricket play". This isn't just about comprehension; it's about forming even grammatically simple sentences.

2.  **Overestimating Teacher/Expert Judgement:** The explicit warning is to *challenge* my first instinct. If I think "most students could do this," I need to remember the reality of students who barely read English.

3.  **Specific Question Type:** This is a "rearrange words" question.
    *   It requires recognizing common sentence structure (subject-verb-object). "He is reading a book." is a very basic structure taught early on.
    *   However, consider a student who struggles to differentiate between words like "fauourite" and "favourite" (from the hobby example), or who interprets "describes the poet's writing style" as "I am reading."
    *   They might recognize *some* of the words (he, a, book) but struggle with the precise order, especially with "is reading." They might produce:
        *   "A book is reading he."
        *   "Reading he is a book."
        *   "He book is reading a."
        *   They might also just stare at it and produce "Empty Response" because they are overwhelmed by the task and anxiety.

4.  **Analogies to other questions:**
    *   The "hobby" question involves writing simple sentences. Students failed *dismally* at this (10% pass rate). While rearranging is slightly different from generating, it still requires understanding that a correct sentence must flow.
    *   The pass rate for *other* questions where they struggle to form *any* coherent English sentence is extremely low (4%, 5%, 10%). While this is a multiple-choice-like task (choosing word order) rather than open-ended writing, it requires fundamental sentence-making knowledge.

Given that students:
*   Have very limited English.
*   Struggle profoundly to construct simple sentences in "My Favourite Hobby" (10%).
*   Show major issues with understanding instructions (4-5% for other questions).
*   Might default to empty responses under anxiety.

The fact that "He is reading a book" is a common early-learned structure will pull the score up a bit compared to, say, generating a complex theme. However, the overall struggle with *any* form of basic sentence construction is very strong evidence that many will still fail.

I think the 10% on the "hobby" question is the closest analogy here. Rearranging is slightly easier than composing from scratch, but not by much for struggling learners who lack foundational grammar rules. It's about taking those known words and putting them into a coherent order that makes grammatical sense. Many will get one or two words in place but mess up the full sequence or word form (if there were options). Here, there aren't many wrong ways to interpret the words, but there are many wrong ways to order them.

I will calibrate *down* from even the 10-15% range because "is reading" as a continuous verb might trip some up, and the *accuracy* needed for "Max score: 1" means zero tolerance for small errors in order. Many will get close, but not perfectly right.

Therefore, while the individual words are simple, and "He is reading a book" is a common pattern, the overwhelming evidence of general English deficiency and difficulty with *any* sentence construction points to a very low success rate for this population.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **18%**
