After careful consideration and challenging my initial assumptions, my estimated proportion correct is **11%**.

Here's my reasoning:

1.  **Limited English Proficiency:** The examples provided demonstrate an extremely low comprehension level for even seemingly simple English prompts. A pass rate of 29% overall, and single-digit pass rates for questions requiring analytical thought or slightly extended writing, strongly suggests that grammatical transformations are highly challenging.

2.  **Specific Skill Difficulty:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** While "wind," "blew," "leaves," and "away" might be recognized individually, understanding "active voice" and "passive voice" and the grammatical restructuring required is a huge leap.
    *   **Concept Grasp:** Active/passive voice is an abstract grammatical concept. Given the difficulties with "describing a writing style" or "identifying a theme," it's highly improbable that the *mechanics* of voice transformation would be understood by many. Many students might not even recognize what "change from active to passive voice" *means* as an instruction, let alone how to execute it.
    *   **Irregular Verb Conjugation:** The need to change "blew" (past tense active) to "were blown" (past participle passive) introduces an additional layer of complexity. Students often struggle with irregular past participles, even in active voice contexts.
    *   **Structure:** Re-ordering the sentence elements ("the leaves" becoming the subject, "by the wind" at the end) requires a strong grasp of sentence structure that these students generally lack.

3.  **Common Error Analogy:**
    *   The "describes the poet's writing style" (4%) and "write a theme" (5%) questions indicate a profound difficulty with even basic analytical or descriptive tasks in English. Transforming sentence structure is arguably *more* difficult and abstract than these.
    *   The "My Favourite Hobby" (10%) example shows students either misinterpreting the prompt entirely or only able to produce fragmented, grammatically incorrect sentences. A grammatical transformation is a more advanced task.

4.  **Teacher Overestimation:** This is a key factor. Teachers, who understand active/passive voice, would naturally assume this is "basic grammar." However, for a student who can barely form a coherent sentence about their hobby, a complex grammatical transformation is far from basic.

5.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** The frequency of "Empty Response" reinforces that many students are simply overwhelmed and cannot attempt the question.

While the sentence itself is relatively short and simple, the *task* of transforming its voice is grammatically sophisticated for this population. My initial instinct might have been slightly higher, but the examples of actual student performance severely pull down the estimate. The 11% accounts for:

*   A very small percentage of students who might genuinely understand and have practiced this specific transformation.
*   A few lucky guesses or partial correct answers that might just hit the mark (e.g., "The leaves was blown..."). However, given the *complete* transformation requirement, even partial credit would be difficult to earn.

The jump from an active verb ("blew") to a passive past participle ("were blown") is the biggest hurdle beyond simply recognizing the task. Many might write something like "The leaves blew away by the wind," misunderstanding the auxiliary verb and past participle.
