ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 10%

**Reasoning for the calibrated estimate:**

1.  **Direct Recall vs. Application:** The question requires more than simple recall. Students need to understand decomposition, its observable effects, and its benefits. This is a multi-step concept application.
2.  **Vocabulary and Sentence Structure:**
    *   "collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit" is understandable.
    *   "Does gardener notice any change after some days?" This phrasing might trip up students with limited English. "Any change" might be interpreted narrowly, and "after some days" implies observation over time.
    *   "Give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health" - "Evaluate" is a higher-order thinking verb and requires justifying the benefits. "Beneficial for soil health" is specific scientific terminology.
3.  **Prior Performance on Similar Questions (Low Pass Rates):** The provided common errors and pass rates for other science questions are alarmingly low (6-11%). These questions often involve describing experiments, identifying structures, or basic biological concepts. The decomposition question is arguably more complex in terms of required explanation and justification.
4.  **Common Errors Observations:**
    *   **Empty Responses:** A significant issue, often due to anxiety or not understanding the question at all. This question is long and requires detailed answers, increasing the likelihood of empty responses.
    *   **Irrelevant/Mumbled Answers:** "gobaer," "gobar," "letard," "summarie" suggest a struggle with English comprehension and expressing scientific ideas. A student might vaguely know about decomposition but struggle to articulate *what* changes occur and *why* it's beneficial for soil.
    *   **Misinterpreting Keywords:** In one example, "povidone + iodine" seems like a misremembered association. Students might vaguely link "waste" with "manure" but fail to explain the process or benefits.
    *   **Syntactical Difficulties:** Answers like "This tree is very long and natural Vegatable. This v" show a complete breakdown in expressing a coherent thought in English. This question requires explaining *process and outcome*, which is more syntactically complex than naming parts.
5.  **Teacher/Expert Overestimation Bias:** The reminder to challenge initial instincts and consider students with limited English or who missed the topic is crucial. While the concept of decomposition might be taught, expecting a majority of students from economically weaker sections with limited English to articulately answer a multi-part question about its process, reasons, and benefits *in English* is unrealistic, given the demonstrated difficulty with much simpler science questions.
6.  **"Basic Concepts Aren't Basic":** Decomposition might be covered, but linking it directly to observable changes *and* soil health benefits requires a deeper, more integrated understanding that struggling learners might lack.

Given the extreme difficulty students show even with simpler questions (pass rates <10%), and the demands of this question in terms of scientific understanding, multi-part explanation, and English expression, a low double-digit percentage seems appropriate. It requires a relatively full, accurate explanation to get full credit. Many will struggle just to articulate the "changes."
