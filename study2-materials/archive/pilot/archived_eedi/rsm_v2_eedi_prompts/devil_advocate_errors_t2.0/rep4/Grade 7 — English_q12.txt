ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 5%

Here's my reasoning, challenging my initial instincts:

1.  **Direct Instruction is Key, but Recall is Hard:** Changing voice requires explicit teaching of rules and structures. Even if taught, retention and accurate application are very low for struggling learners, especially under exam conditions. This isn't like recalling a fact, but applying a learned grammatical transformation.

2.  **Vocabulary/Concept Barriers:**
    *   "Change," "Active Voice," "Passive Voice" are all abstract grammatical terms. For students with "limited English," these terms themselves can be confusing, let alone the process they denote. They might not even understand *what* the question is asking them to do, despite the simplicity of the source sentence.
    *   "The wind blew the leaves away" - while the individual words are simple, the "blew...away" phrasal verb might trip some up, though less likely to be the primary blocker.

3.  **Required Grammatical Transformations are Complex for Strugglers:**
    *   Identify Subject, Verb, Object.
    *   Swap Subject and Object positions.
    *   Choose the correct form of "to be" (were, in this case).
    *   Change the main verb to its past participle (blown).
    *   Introduce "by the wind."
    *   *All* of these steps need to be correct. One error renders the whole answer wrong according to the strict rubric.

4.  **Analogous Error Patterns from Examples:**
    *   The examples show very fundamental comprehension issues ("I am reading" for "describes style," or "my hobby is cricket play").
    *   Even when *trying* to answer the prompt (like the "Last Bargain" example), the grammar is extremely fractured.
    *   The "Empty Response" rates are very high for questions requiring analytical thought or more complex sentence construction. This voice change requires both.
    *   Students struggle with basic sentence structure and paragraph writing, making a grammatical transformation of a sentence exceptionally difficult.

5.  **Teachers Overestimate - My Personal Experience:** My first instinct *was* higher, around 15-20%. However, thinking about the student profile (EWS, limited English, 29% average pass rate, extreme difficulty with even basic description/theme identification) reminds me how sophisticated "voice change" is for this group. It's not a common, naturally occurring structure they use frequently. It's a formal grammatical exercise.

6.  **Anxiety and Blank Responses:** Many will see the grammatical terms ("Active Voice," "Passive Voice"), panic, and leave it blank, mirroring the high "Empty Response" rates in the examples.

7.  **The specific solution "The leaves were blown away by the wind."** Requires specific mastery of tense, verb form, and the "by" phrase. Getting *all* of this correct is a very high bar for the described student population. Many might attempt a partial transformation (e.g., "The leaves blowed by the wind" or "The leaves blew away by the wind") which would not get credit.

Considering all these factors, 5% feels like a realistic, calibrated estimate, acknowledging the very specific, multi-step grammatical knowledge required, the abstract terms used in the prompt, and the documented struggles with basic English expression and comprehension shown in the error examples.
