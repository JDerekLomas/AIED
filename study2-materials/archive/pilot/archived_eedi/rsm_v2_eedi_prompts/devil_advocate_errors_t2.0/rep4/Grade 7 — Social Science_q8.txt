Here's my thought process for estimating the proportion correct:

1.  **Analyze the Question:**
    *   "What are the main occupations of people in the rural areas of Rajasthan?" - This requires factual recall about a specific region.
    *   "Describe any one in brief." - This requires a basic understanding and ability to articulate a few words about one of the recalled occupations.
    *   "Rural areas of Rajasthan" - This implies agriculture, animal husbandry, and potentially some traditional crafts relevant to that arid/semi-arid region.

2.  **Consider the Student Profile (Class 7, Indian government schools, EWS, limited English):**
    *   **Economically Weaker Sections (EWS):** Many students in EWS backgrounds often come from rural areas themselves, or have direct/indirect exposure to rural occupations through relatives or community members. This might be a slight advantage.
    *   **Limited English:** This is the *biggest* hurdle.
        *   "Occupations" might be understood, but "main occupations" and "rural areas" in context might be challenging for some.
        *   "Describe in brief" requires basic sentence construction, which is hard with limited English.
    *   **Average Pass Rate (29%):** This is a critical anchor. My estimate *must* be around or below this, unless there's a very strong reason otherwise.
    *   **Common Errors (Empty Response, Gibberish):** This highlights the prevalence of not understanding the question, not knowing the answer, or not being able to express it.
    *   **Exam Anxiety:** Further increases "Empty Response" rates.
    *   **Absent for Topic:** A significant factor. If they missed the geography/social science lesson on Rajasthan, they'll struggle.
    *   **Teachers' Overestimation:** My *first* instinct was higher, but the prompt is specifically telling me to fight that.

3.  **Evaluate against the Rubric (Names at least two main occupations correctly... Max score: 1):**
    *   This is a relatively low bar for scoring. Just naming two.
    *   "Agriculture" and "Animal Husbandry" are the two most common and obvious. Many students *should* know these.

4.  **Challenging Assumptions (as per prompt):**

    *   **Initial thought:** "Agriculture and animal husbandry are so common, surely most kids from India would know these! Maybe 35-40%?"
    *   **Challenged thought:**
        *   **Limited English:** Could a student who *barely* reads English even process "main occupations," "rural areas," and "Rajasthan" effectively? They might confuse it with their own state or another region, or simply not grasp "occupations" correctly.
        *   **Basic concepts aren't basic:** While these are fundamental concepts *in general*, applying them to a specific state (Rajasthan) might not have been explicitly covered or reinforced enough for all students.
        *   **Lack of practice:** Even if they *know* "agriculture" and "animal husbandry" in Hindi/their local language, writing it correctly in English might be a barrier for many. The question requires *writing it down* for a score.
        *   **Anxiety/Empty Response:** Given the very high rates of "Empty Response" in other similar questions, a significant chunk will likely put nothing, even if they had a vague idea. They might get stuck on the "describe in brief" part and just give up entirely, or feel their English isn't good enough.
        *   **Comparing to sample questions:**
            *   "Colonial rule" (9%): This is more abstract. My current question is concrete.
            *   "Lions on currency" (10%): This is general knowledge about national symbols, again quite concrete, but gets very low scores due to expressing *why*.
            *   "Ashoka's reign" (12%): Requires historical context.

        This question feels *slightly* more accessible than "Colonial rule" or "Ashoka's reign" because it's about contemporary geography/society, which often feels closer to students' lived experience. It's similar in a way to "Lions on currency" because it's specific facts about India, but might be slightly easier because occupations are a very common topic.

        However, the *articulation* challenge is consistent. "Agriculture" and "Animal Husbandry" are single words, making the "naming two" part relatively low-friction for *some*. But then, how many can *correctly spell* both in English? And the instruction to "describe in brief" could be a stumbling block for many, making them avoid the question. The rubric, thankfully, only requires
