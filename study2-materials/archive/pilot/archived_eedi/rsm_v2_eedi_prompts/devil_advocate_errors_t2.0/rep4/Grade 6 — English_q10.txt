Let's break down the thought process, challenging initial assumptions.

**Initial Instinct (before challenging):**
"This is a basic grammar question about 'some' and 'any'. Most students learn this early. 'Some' is used for positive statements, 'any' for negative or questions. This is a straightforward positive statement. Maybe 60-70% will get it."

**Challenging the Initial Instinct (applying the provided context and common errors):**

1.  **Limited English, Low Pass Rates (29% average):** The average pass rate is very low. This immediately flags that "basic" is not basic. The 60-70% instinct is far too high given this context.

2.  **Common Errors Observed:**
    *   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass):** This is a comprehension/analytical question. The *level* of the answers ("I am reading," "Empty Response") shows a fundamental inability to process even slightly complex instructions or concepts in English.
    *   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass):** Again, shows deep comprehension issues. The "last bargin they about a child and labour..." response, while attempting relevance, has major grammatical errors, indicating a low level of functional English.
    *   **"Write a short paragraph..." (10% pass):** Students struggle with basic paragraph structure and coherence, even when asked about a simple, personal topic. "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy" demonstrates a disconnect from the *type* of response requested. "My hobby is cricket play" is very simple, grammatically incorrect English.

3.  **Specific Question Type - Grammar:**
    *   While "some/any" is basic *English grammar*, for students who struggle with *reading instructions* (evidenced by the paragraph writing question errors), it might not be.
    *   Have they explicitly practiced this *exact* "choose the correct word" format often? The examples don't directly address this, but if paragraph writing is hard, identifying a specific word might also be.
    *   Do they understand the underlying rule? "Some" for positive, "any" for negative/interrogative. This requires a level of grammatical awareness that might not be present if basic sentence formation is an issue.

4.  **Teacher/Expert Overestimation Warning:** This is key. My initial 60-70% was precisely that overestimation. I, as an English speaker, know "some/any" intuitively. These students don't.

5.  **Anxiety and Blank Responses:** If a student sees "some/any" and they've either:
    *   Never encountered this specific rule.
    *   Encountered it but haven't internalized it.
    *   Are too anxious to think clearly.
    They might just guess incorrectly or leave it blank. Given the high rate of "Empty Response" in the examples, this is a very real possibility.

**Re-evaluating based on challenges:**

*   The pass rates for the other questions are *extremely low* (4-10%). Even the "paragraph writing" on a simple topic is only 10%.
*   "Some/any" is indeed a relatively basic grammar concept compared to "describe writing style." However, it still requires understanding the nuance between the two words based on sentence type (positive statement).
*   If students can barely form grammatically correct simple sentences ("My hobby is cricket play"), their understanding of a grammatical distinction like "some" vs. "any" might be shaky.
*   The instruction "Choose the correct word" is relatively simple, but if their *internalized knowledge* of "some/any" is weak, they're guessing.

Considering the extreme difficulty on *all* other tasks, even seemingly simple ones, this task, while perhaps slightly easier than *writing a paragraph*, is still reliant on specific grammatical knowledge that these students likely lack or struggle to apply consistently. An average pass rate of 29% for all subjects makes a higher estimate for even a "simple" English grammar question very hard to justify. If 10% can write a few basic sentences about a hobby, how many can *correctly apply* a grammar rule? Maybe slightly more, as it's multiple choice, but not by much given the overall context.

If 10% get the paragraph, and 4-5% get the harder comprehension, this "some/any" question is probably on par with the 10% "my favorite hobby" if they know the rule, and on par with 5% if they really struggle with any rule-based application. Let's assume some exposure but high error rates
