I will assume "passing rate is about 29%" refers to the overall subject pass rate for Class 7 in Indian government schools, not for specific questions. This helps contextualize the general academic level.

Let's break down the difficulties:

*   **English:** The question is in straightforward English. "Find the area," "base is... and height is..." are fairly common mathematical terms. However, "whose" might trip some students up, though context usually helps. Given "limited English," it's not trivial.
*   **Mathematical Concept:** Finding the area of a triangle given base and height is a fundamental concept typically covered in Class 6 or 7.
*   **Formula Recall:** Students need to recall `Area = 1/2 × base × height`. This is often memorized.
*   **Application:** Once the formula is recalled, the calculation is `1/2 * 8 * 6 = 24`. This involves basic multiplication and division, which are usually strong points even for struggling students.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While teachers might consider this "basic," for struggling learners, recalling any formula accurately, especially if they struggle with abstract concepts or have weak long-term memory, can be an issue.
*   **Absent for Topic:** A significant factor. If a student was absent or inattentive when this topic was taught, they simply won't know it.
*   **Exam Anxiety:** Can cause students to forget even known formulas or make simple calculation errors.
*   **Never Practiced this Exact Question Type:** While "find area given base and height" is a standard type, some students might only recognize it if it's presented with the *exact same wording or number format* as what they've practiced. The simplicity here should reduce this factor, but for very anxious students, it might still play a role.
*   **Limited Resources/Exposure:** Students from economically weaker sections might have less exposure to supplementary learning materials or home support that reinforces these concepts.

**Challenging Initial Instinct:**
My initial instinct might be that "most know this, it's basic." However, considering the factors above, this would be an overestimation.

*   Many students, despite coverage, *will* forget the 1/2.
*   Many might confuse it with the area of a rectangle or simply multiply base and height.
*   The absence factor is real.
*   Even simple formula recall under pressure can fail.
*   The *passing rate* being only 29% implies a substantial portion of students are truly struggling.

The task is specific to recalling *and applying* the formula. Simply knowing what area means isn't enough.

Considering the common pitfalls, the "1/2" is the most likely error if the formula isn't known. Some might just multiply 8 * 6 = 48.

Let's consider groups:
1.  **Knows formula, applies correctly:** These are the ones getting it right.
2.  **Knows concept, but forgets "1/2":** Will likely answer 48. These will score 0 by the rubric (unless a partial mark for just multiplying b*h was given, which it isn't).
3.  **No idea about area of triangle or forgets formula entirely:** Will guess, leave blank, or try something unrelated.

Given the rubric states "States or uses the correct formula," simply calculating 8*6 would not score. The 1/2 is critical for getting the point.

My initial lean would be 40-50% for this "basic" question, but when applying the filter of the pass rate, limited English, and teachers consistently overestimating, I have to drastically reduce that.

If 71% of students are generally struggling (implied by 29% pass rate), a substantial portion will likely struggle with *this* specific concept too.

Perhaps 30-40% might know it, and some of those will make errors or forget the 1/2.
Let's consider:
*   Maybe 60% of students have *seen* the formula.
*   Of those, perhaps only 60-70% *remember* it correctly (including the 1/2).
*   Of those who remember, maybe 90% can apply it without calculation errors.
    This would be ~60% * 0.65 * 0.9 = 35% approximately.

This still feels a bit high given the strong warning about overestimation. The crucial factor is recalling "1/2". Students might think "base x height" from rectangles. The distinction isn't always solidified.

Let me adjust lower. If a student gets 0-3 marks out of
