Here's a breakdown of why I'm settling on my estimate, considering the common pitfalls:

**Why an initial instinct might be higher (and why it's probably wrong):**

*   **Natural resources seem "basic":** Many adults, and even teachers, might think identifying a natural resource is easy, especially for a specific region.
*   **Rajasthan has prominent resources:** Marble, desert/sand, and salt are quite well-known. Water is universal.
*   **Two simple parts:** Identify two, explain one. Doesn't seem overly complex.
*   **Hindi medium instruction:** While the exam is in English, instruction might be largely in Hindi, which could *help* with concept recall, but then the English translation becomes a barrier.

**Factors pushing the estimate down (and why they are critical):**

1.  **Limited English:** This is the *biggest* killer.
    *   "Mention any two natural resources..." - Many students will understand "two natural resources." But will they *know the English names* for common resources like marble, sandstone, gypsum, zinc, mica, even copper or iron? "Water" is a safe bet, but "solar energy" or "wind energy" are more complex concepts for some, and using the exact English terms might be challenging.
    *   "...explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there." - This requires formulating a sentence or two in English to connect the resource to daily life. For example, "Marble is used for building houses/sculptures." "Lack of water makes farming difficult." This goes beyond simple recall and demands basic expressive English, which is a major hurdle. The previous wrong answers ("Asher' stand", "ashok a second") show struggles with basic sentence formation and understanding the question itself.

2.  **"Basic" isn't basic:** While adults see natural resources as basic, a struggling Class 6 student from an EWS background might not have the broader context or the specific vocabulary for various resources. If they primarily learn through rote memorization in Hindi, translating and explaining spontaneously in English is a tall order.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Empty Response:** The examples of "Empty Response" for "Explain how colonial rule..." and "Significance of Ashoka" are *extremely telling*. These were much harder questions conceptually, but the blank responses highlight students' tendency to simply give up or have nothing to write even when *some* information might be known. This question, while simpler conceptually, still requires *something* written in English.

4.  **Absence/Lack of practice:** As mentioned, if a student was absent or didn't explicitly practice this exact question type, their chances decrease significantly. Teachers often overestimate how widely concepts are retained without specific recall practice.

5.  **Specificity required:** Students need to recall *Rajasthan-specific* resources. While some like "water" are general, connecting it to the desert context of Rajasthan (scarcity) adds a layer. Other options like marble, copper, gypsum, mica, and zinc are quite specific.

**Revisiting Common Errors in the context of this question:**

*   "Explaining the significance of Ashoka" and "Colonial rule" are high-level analytical questions. Their 9-12% pass rates suggest extremely low baseline performance on anything beyond simple factual recall, *especially when English composition is needed*.
*   "Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes?" (10% pass rate) is factual but also requires *explanation*. The wrong answers show utter confusion ("Ashok seamb") suggesting not just wrong information but an inability to even process the question and construct a meaningful answer in English. This specific question demands *less* explanation than the lion question.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Given that only ~10% could explain why lions are on notes (a relatively well-known fact needing minimal explanation beyond "Ashoka Chakra"), and this question requires *identifying two specific resources* AND *explaining an influence* in English, it's very demanding. Many might get one resource, fewer two. Even fewer will be able to construct an English sentence explaining the influence correctly.

I'm thinking about the "minimal successful answer": "Water, Marble. Water makes farming hard/scarce." Even that is probably a stretch for many.

My initial thought might have been 20-25%. However, looking at the *extreme* struggles with English and explanations in the example common errors, coupled with the ~29% average pass rate for all questions, this question, which demands both recall *and* basic English composition for the "explain" part, is going to be significantly below average.

Let's imagine:
*   Perhaps 30-40% know "water" as a resource for Rajasthan.
*   Maybe 15-20% can
