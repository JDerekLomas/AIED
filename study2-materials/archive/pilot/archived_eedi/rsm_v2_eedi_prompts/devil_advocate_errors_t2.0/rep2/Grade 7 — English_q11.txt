Here's my analysis and calibrated estimate:

**Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):** My initial instinct would be around 20-30%. "Tiny" is a basic adjective, and students learn about parts of speech early on.

**Challenging the Assumptions (Applying the provided context):**

*   **"Adjective phrase":** The question asks for an "adjective phrase," but the rubric says "identifies 'tiny' as an adjective." This discrepancy is a huge red flag.
    *   If students are trying to find a *phrase*, they might be looking for "A tiny bird" or "its nest in our balcony" and miss just "tiny." The concept of an "adjective phrase" might be distinct from just identifying a single adjective for many struggling learners.
    *   If they only learned "adjective," and the question asks for "adjective phrase," they might not connect the two, or they might try to force a phrase answer.
*   **Limited English:** Many students will struggle with the *word* "identify" and "adjective phrase" itself. They might know what an adjective *is* but not recognize the terminology in the question.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While "tiny" is basic, the *grammatical terminology* of "adjective phrase" is not necessarily basic for students with limited exposure to formal English grammar in this context.
*   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** Given the very low pass rates for other questions and the tendency for empty responses, many will just leave it blank if they don't immediately grasp "adjective phrase."
*   **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** Identifying a specific *phrase* (especially when the intended answer is just one word, but the question says "phrase") could be a novel task. Students might have practiced identifying single adjectives, but not an "adjective phrase" where the answer is effectively just the adjective itself. This type of nuanced grammatical question is harder than "What is a theme?" or "Describe something."

**Revisiting the Example Errors:**

*   Q: "Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%) – Shows students struggle significantly with descriptive English and abstract concepts.
*   Q: "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" (pass rate: 5%) – Shows profound difficulty with inferential comprehension and abstract summarization.
*   Q: "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'." (pass rate: 10%) – Even simple personal writing is a challenge, with common errors showing basic sentence structure and vocabulary limitations.

**Connecting to this Question:**
This question about "adjective phrase" requires a very specific grammatical understanding and the ability to apply terminology. If they are failing at descriptive writing, thematic identification, and even simple personal paragraph writing, identifying an *adjective phrase* (especially with the rubric/question mismatch) will be extremely difficult.

Many students might be able to point to "tiny" if simply asked, "Which word describes the bird?" But adding the formal "adjective phrase" creates a significant barrier. They might give "A tiny bird," which is an noun phrase, or just "tiny" if they disregard "phrase." Only "tiny" gets full credit.

Given the existing pass rates are 4%, 5%, and 10% for other questions that, at first glance, might seem a bit more accessible (describing style, theme, simple paragraph), a specific grammar terminology question is going to be exceptionally hard.

My challenge here is to not be swayed by how "easy" "tiny" is to spot as an adjective, but rather how difficult the *question format and terminology* will be for the target group.

**Calibrated Estimate:** 7%
