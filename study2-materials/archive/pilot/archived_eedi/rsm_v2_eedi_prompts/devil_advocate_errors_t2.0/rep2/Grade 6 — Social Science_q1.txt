ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%

**Reasoning for the Estimate (Challenging Initial Instincts):**

My initial instinct might have been slightly higher, perhaps 30-40%, assuming that basic geography is widely covered and prominent features like the Himalayas are common knowledge. However, considering the provided context and common error patterns, I've adjusted my estimate significantly downwards.

Here's why:

*   **Limited English and Comprehension:** While "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" seems straightforward, the term "major mountain ranges" might be slightly formal or confusing for students with limited English. They might know "pahad" (mountain) but struggle to differentiate "ranges." Even simple English can be a barrier.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for All:** For students from economically weaker sections, access to quality educational materials, exposure to diverse maps, and consistent classroom instruction might be uneven. While the Himalayas are very famous, other ranges like Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, or Eastern Ghats might not be universally memorized, especially if classroom time for geography is limited or not regularly reinforced.
*   **"Empty Response" Dominance:** The examples provided show an extremely high rate of "Empty Response" or irrelevant answers even for seemingly core Social Science topics (colonial rule, significance of Ashoka, lions on currency). This indicates a significant proportion of students who either don't understand the question, lack the knowledge, or suffer from severe exam anxiety leading to blanks. A simple naming question is less complex than an explanation, but the pattern of "Empty Response" for tough explanation questions suggests that if students *don't know*, they likely leave it blank or give minimal output.
*   **Single vs. Two Ranges:** The rubric gives credit for *one* correct range, even though the question asks for *two*. This suggests the question designers already anticipate difficulty in listing two. Many students might only recall the Himalayas, and then struggle to think of a second.
*   **Lack of Practice with Exact Question Type:** While they might have learned about mountains, specifically being asked to *name two major ranges* as an isolated question might not have been something they've explicitly practiced, especially in the context of high-stakes exams.
*   **Low Pass Rates for Explanatory Questions:** While this is a factual recall question, not an explanation, the 9-12% pass rates for explanatory Social Science questions highlight a very low baseline of engagement and correct responses in this subject area overall. Even simple recall suffers if the foundational knowledge and English comprehension are weak.

Considering all these factors, particularly the pervasive "Empty Response" phenomenon and the context of struggling learners with limited English, an estimate around **20%** feels more realistic for students who could correctly name *at least one* mountain range. Some might only know the Himalayas, a few others might recall one more, but a substantial number will likely leave it blank or struggle to identify even one clearly.
