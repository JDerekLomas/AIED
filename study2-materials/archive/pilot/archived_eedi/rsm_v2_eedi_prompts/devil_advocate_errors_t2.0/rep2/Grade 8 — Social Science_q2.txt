Here's my thought process for estimating the proportion correct:

1.  **Analyze the Target Audience:**
    *   Class 8 Indian government school students.
    *   Mostly economically weaker sections.
    *   **Limited English:** This is crucial. Even simple-sounding questions can be impenetrable.
    *   **Average pass rate ~29%:** This sets a baseline for general academic performance.
    *   **"Struggling learners," "absent for topic," "exam anxiety":** These factors disproportionately affect students in this demographic.

2.  **Analyze the Question:** "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."
    *   **Topic:** Harappan Civilization (ancient Indian history). This is a standard topic in Indian history curricula.
    *   **Verb:** "Describe." Requires more than just a recall; needs a short explanation.
    *   **Keywords:** "key feature," "urban planning."
    *   **Cognitive Load:** Low to moderate if the concept is understood and remembered.

3.  **Analyze the Rubric/Expected Answers:**
    *   Well-planned grid layout of streets.
    *   Advanced drainage system.
    *   Use of baked bricks.
    *   Division of the city into a citadel and a lower town.

4.  **Incorporate Common Error Patterns and Teacher/Expert Bias:**
    *   **"Empty Response":** Very high risk for this group due to English limitations, anxiety, or not knowing the answer. This is explicitly called out as a dominant error.
    *   **Misinterpreting "Key Feature" or "Urban Planning":** Some might list a random fact about Harappan culture, not specifically urban planning.
    *   **Difficulty with English formulation:** Even if they know "drainage system," constructing a grammatically correct sentence in English to "describe" it can be a hurdle. "Harappa good drain" might be the best some can manage, and a strict grader might not give credit for that without "system."
    *   **Limited English example (from other questions):** "Asher' stand," "ashok a second," "Ashok seamb" for a simple Ashoka question show how badly language skills can undermine content knowledge. "Baked bricks" might come out as "make brick fire."
    *   **Teacher overestimation:** Teachers *would* likely think this is an "easy" question because they've taught it. They forget the nuances of English, retention rates, and general academic challenges.

5.  **Initial Instinct vs. Calibrated Estimate:**
    *   **Initial instinct:** *Most* students who paid attention should remember one of these. Maybe 35-45%. Harappan Civilization is important.
    *   **Challenging the instinct:**
        *   **"Limited English":** Can a student with *very* limited English accurately *describe* one key feature? "Drain system good" might be close, but is it a full description?
        *   **"Absent for this topic":** High chance, given the school context.
        *   **"Basic concepts aren't basic":** For some, distinguishing "urban planning" from just "Harappan facts" is tough.
        *   **Previous pass rates for *similarly difficult Social Science* questions are 9-12%:** This is a huge red flag. While this question isn't asking for an "explanation of effect" like the tribal question, it's still requiring description of a historical concept. The *Ashoka significance* question, which also asks for description/explanation of a concept, had a 12% pass rate. This question is arguably comparable in difficulty (recall and describe a key feature vs. recall and explain significance).
        *   The *lions on currency* question, which is somewhat simpler (identification and very basic explanation), also had only 10%.

6.  **Refining the Estimate:**
    *   Given the *average pass rate is 29%*, we expect some questions to be much lower and some higher.
    *   Given the error patterns (mostly blank or nonsensical English for *similarly simple Social Science recall/explanation questions* leading to 9-12% pass rates), it's highly likely this question will fall into that lower bracket.
    *   The requirement to "describe" is slightly harder than just "list."
    *   The multiple choice of correct answers (grid, drainage, bricks, citadel) *does* slightly help, increasing the chance of someone hitting one.

    I think the prompt is explicitly pushing away from a higher estimate, directly citing low pass rates on comparable (or even slightly harder but still conceptual recall) Social Science questions. The Ashoka question (12%) and the tribal
