Let's break down the question and common student challenges to estimate the proportion correctly.

**Analyzing the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question:** "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"
*   **Key terms:** "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "British power," "expansion," "contribute." These are core historical terms students *should* encounter in Class 8.
*   **Rubric:** "explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)."
*   **Expected answer:** Students need to connect the military victory to the *political outcome* – British control, particularly over Bengal, often mentioning the puppet ruler.

**Considering the Student Demographics and Common Errors:**

1.  **Economically Weaker Sections, Limited English:** This is a huge hurdle. Even if they know the facts in their local language, articulating it in English, specifically using terms like "political dominance," "expansion," or "puppet nawab," will be challenging. The common errors show a profound struggle with expressing even basic concepts in English.
2.  **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is a low baseline for overall exam performance. Social Science questions tend to have even lower pass rates (9-12% for the examples given), suggesting a significant problem with this subject area specifically.
3.  **"Empty Response":** This is the most prevalent error shown in the examples (for "tribal communities" and "Ashoka"). Exam anxiety and lack of comprehension often lead to students simply writing nothing or minimal text.
4.  **Misremembered or Partially Understood Facts:** Students might know "Plassey," "1757," and "British won," but connecting it to the *consequence* of British political control, rather than just military victory, requires deeper understanding.
5.  **Lack of Specific Terminology:** Many students might not recall or be able to properly use terms like "political dominance," "puppet nawab," or even "territorial control" in English. They might just say "British got power."
6.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While Plassey is a foundational topic, understanding its *contribution to the expansion of power* requires an analytical leap beyond just rote memorization of the event itself.
7.  **Overestimation by Experts:** My first instinct would be higher because I recall Plassey as a major event. However, applying the stated context:
    *   Could a student who barely reads English explain *how it contributed to expansion of power* rather than just stating *it was a battle the British won*? Probably not, or not well enough.
    *   Could a student who was absent for this topic, or has general weakness, articulate this without practice? Very unlikely, leading to an empty response or vague answer.

**Re-calibrating the Estimate:**

Given the low pass rates on comparable Social Science questions (9-12%), the prevalence of "empty response," and the severe language barrier, students attempting to explain the *consequence* and *contribution* to "expansion of British power" will struggle immensely. They need to understand the connection between a military victory and the subsequent *political establishment* of control over a region.

Even if 20-30% know *what* the Battle of Plassey was, far fewer will be able to articulate its specific contribution to British power *in English* in a way that meets the rubric for explaining political dominance. Many will simply state "British won the battle."

The closest comparison would be explaining "significance" (Ashoka, 12%) or "why something is shown" (lions, 10%). This question is also asking for an explanation of "how it contributed" to "expansion."

I would expect a very high proportion of "empty responses" or vague answers that miss the core political consequence, similar to the 9-12% observed pass rates for other explanation-based questions in Social Science.

If the *average pass rate* is 29% and Social Science questions are often in the 9-12% range for explanatory questions, this question falls squarely into that difficult category.

Let's consider that Plassey is a *very* important topic. Perhaps slightly more will attempt it. However, success in English with the specific nuance of the question is the bottleneck.

If 10-15% can correctly explain the significance of Ashoka or why lions are on notes, this question, which requires explaining a historical process of political consolidation, is arguably of similar or slightly higher difficulty due to the need for a conceptual link.

My initial thought might have been 20-25%, but applying the
