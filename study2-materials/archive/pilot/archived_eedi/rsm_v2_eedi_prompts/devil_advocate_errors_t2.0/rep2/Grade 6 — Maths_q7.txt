Let's break down the thought process to arrive at a calibrated estimate.

**1. Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):**
*   "Oh, this is a simple word problem. Find the time difference, multiply by the rate, add to the starting temperature. Class 6 students should know basic arithmetic and time."
*   This instinct leads to an estimate that's too high.

**2. Challenging Assumptions (applying the "expert misjudgment" criteria):**

*   **Limited English:**
    *   "`10` am in the morning": Understand "am," "morning."
    *   "temperature of Jodhpur was `30^0 C`": Understand "temperature," "was," "degree Celsius."
    *   "If the temperature increases by `2^0 C` per hour": "Increases by," "per hour" are crucial. This is a common phrase, but for struggling readers, "per" can be a blocker.
    *   "then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?": "will be," "evening."
    *   **Concern:** Students with very limited English might miss "increases by" or "per hour," interpreting it as a static value or not understanding the hourly rate. They might latch onto numbers `10`, `30`, `2`, `4` and try to just perform *some* operation.

*   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic for struggling learners:**
    *   **Time elapsed calculation:** From `10` am to `4` pm. This involves crossing noon. `10->11->12->1->2->3->4`. That's 6 hours. This is *not* `4-10 = -6` or `10-4=6` directly, which students might try. It requires conceptual understanding of an analog clock or 24-hour conversion, which might not be uniformly solid. Many students would calculate `4-10` and be stuck. Some might correctly count, but many might miscount.
    *   **Multiplication for repeated addition/rate:** `6 hours * 2 degrees/hour`. If they struggle with multiplication facts or understanding the "per hour" concept, they might fail here.
    *   **Addition:** `30 + 12`. This is simpler, but a compounding error if previous steps are wrong.

*   **Exam anxiety causes blank responses:**
    *   Seeing multiple numbers and phrases, especially if the English is daunting, can lead to panic and just leaving it blank, even if they might have a partial understanding.

*   **Never practiced this exact question type:**
    *   They might have done problems on time, or problems on temperature, or simple word problems. But a multi-step problem combining time calculation *across noon* with a rate of change *and* addition might be new for some. The language nuance is also key.

**3. Specific Difficulties I Anticipate:**

*   **Biggest Hurdle:** Calculating time from 10 AM to 4 PM. This is where most students will struggle.
    *   `4-10` is wrong.
    *   Counting fingers from 10 AM, crossing 12 PM is prone to error (e.g., counting 10 AM as hour 1, instead of counting the interval *after* 10 AM).
    *   Some might correctly do `12 - 10 = 2` hours (until noon) and `4 - 0 = 4` hours (after noon) so `2 + 4 = 6`. This is a sophisticated way.
    *   Many might miscount to 5 hours or 7 hours.

*   **Second Hurdle:** Understanding "increases by `2^0 C` per hour". Some might multiply 30 by 2 or add 2 to 30 immediately without considering the hours.

*   **Cumulative Error:** If they get the time wrong, even if they correctly perform the multiplication and addition, the final answer will be wrong.

**4. Calibration - How many could overcome these hurdles?**

*   **Time Calculation (10 AM to 4 PM):**
    *   Very low-performing students (a significant portion given 29% average pass) will struggle significantly here. Maybe only 30-40% of the entire class can *reliably* calculate this across noon.
*   **Understanding "per hour":** Probably better understood, maybe 60-70% if the English barrier is cleared.
*   **Multiplication & Addition:** Assuming previous steps are correct, the math is relatively straightforward (6*2=12, 3
