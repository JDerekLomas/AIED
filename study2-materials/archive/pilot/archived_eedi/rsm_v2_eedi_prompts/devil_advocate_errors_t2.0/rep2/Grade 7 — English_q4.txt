Let's break down this question and apply the observed error patterns and expert warnings.

**Understanding the Question:** "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."

**Breakdown for the student:**
1.  **"Do you think... important in real life?"**: This requires an opinion, an "is it relevant to *my* life/the world around me?" kind of connection. This isn't just recalling facts.
2.  **"the king's questions"**: This directly refers to the passage. Students *must* know what those questions were. The rubric itself outlines them: "the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with."
3.  **"Give one reason."**: This demands justification. It can't just be "Yes."

**Applying Common Errors & Warnings:**

*   **Limited English:**
    *   "Important in real life" might be understood, but "give one reason" could be a stumbling block. They might just say "yes" or "no" without elaborating.
    *   Understanding the *nuance* of connecting "the king's questions" (from a story) to "real life" might be too abstract.
    *   Many students who struggle with "describes the poet's writing style" (4% pass) will likely struggle with a question that demands inferential thinking and a real-world connection.
    *   The prompt asks for *their opinion* and a reason. Students are often trained to parrot back information from the text, not offer original thoughts, especially in limited English.

*   **"Empty Response" / Off-topic:** This is a major concern (5% for theme, and often occurs on other difficult questions). If they don't understand *any* part of the question or how to form an answer, they will leave it blank or write something completely irrelevant. The "My favourite hobby" examples show that students can connect vaguely but completely miss the point (e.g., listing unrelated hobbies).

*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   Connecting a story's premise to real-world applicability (inferential reasoning) is not basic for students who struggle with foundational English comprehension.
    *   Formulating an opinion and supporting it with a reason, even a simple one, requires a higher cognitive load and stronger English writing skills than basic recall.

*   **Exam Anxiety / Lack of Practice:** If they haven't explicitly practiced this *type* of question ("do you think X is important... give a reason"), anxiety will contribute to blank or poor responses.

**Calibrating the Estimate:**

*   The average pass rate is 29%.
*   The "Describes the poet's writing style" question has a 4% pass rate, indicating extreme difficulty with analytical/abstract English prompts.
*   The "Theme or central idea" question has a 5% pass rate, indicating extreme difficulty with summarization and conceptual understanding.
*   The "My Favourite Hobby" question (requiring paragraph writing and simple personal detail) has a 10% pass rate, showing even relatively simpler English writing tasks are very challenging.

This question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason." falls in difficulty somewhere between needing to identify a theme and writing about a hobby, leaning towards the more challenging end due to the "real life" connection and "reason" requirement, which demands analytical thought and opinion generation rather than just factual recall or simple description.

For a student to get this correct, they need to:
1.  Understand the question's language: "important in real life," "give one reason."
2.  Recall what the king's questions were.
3.  Formulate a plausible link between those questions and real life (e.g., "Yes, because knowing the right time helps avoid mistakes," or "Yes, because it's good to know who to trust").
4.  Write this thought in a coherent, grammatically understandable sentence in English.

Given the extremely low pass rates on comparable or even seemingly simpler English comprehension/writing tasks for this demographic, a significant portion will leave it blank, misunderstand it entirely, or give an irrelevant answer. The need to generate *their own* opinion and reason in English is a major hurdle.

I would anticipate this to be on the very low end, similar to or perhaps slightly higher than the 5-10% range for theme and paragraph writing, because the *content* of the king's questions (right time, right thing, right people) is relatable, but the *form* of the answer (opinion + reason) is complex.

If "My Favourite Hobby" at 10% is about writing 4-5
