I will start by analyzing the common errors and the overall context of the students.

*   **Limited English proficiency:** This is the most crucial factor. The example errors show that even basic comprehension is a major hurdle. "Describes the poet's writing style" is fundamentally misunderstood. "I am reading" demonstrates a complete inability to engage with the prompt.
*   **"Empty Response":** This is a recurring issue, indicating either a complete lack of understanding, a lack of confidence, or exam anxiety leading to paralysis.
*   **Rudimentary sentence construction:** "My hobby is cricket play" highlights difficulty with basic grammar and sentence structure.
*   **Specific knowledge required:** Changing active to passive voice is a grammatical transformation. While it might be *taught* in Class 7, the low overall pass rate (29%) suggests that many fundamental grammar concepts are not consistently mastered. The specific verb "blew" transforming to "were blown" requires knowledge of irregular past participles and the correct auxiliary verb ("were").
*   **Teacher/expert overestimation:** This is a key warning. My first instinct *might* be to think, "Oh, passive voice is a standard grammar topic." However, the evidence from other questions strongly suggests that *even standard topics* are only accessible to a small fraction of these students.

Let's break down the demands of the "Active to Passive Voice" question:

1.  **Identify Subject, Verb, Object:** "The wind" (subject), "blew" (verb), "the leaves" (object).
2.  **Move Object to Subject position:** "The leaves..."
3.  **Use appropriate form of "to be" + Past Participle:** "The leaves *were blown*..."
4.  **Add "by" + Original Subject (optional but common in full answers):** "...by the wind."

*   Many students might struggle to correctly identify the components.
*   The irregular verb "blew" becoming "blown" is a potential pitfall. If they only know regular past participles (e.g., "walked," "played"), they might try "blewed."
*   Choosing "were" instead of "was" requires agreement with the plural "leaves."
*   Understanding the *concept* of voice transformation itself is complex for non-native or struggling English speakers. It's an abstract grammatical rule.

Considering the common errors on other questions (complete misunderstanding, blank responses, extremely simple and grammatically incorrect answers even for paragraph writing):

*   The pass rate for the "writing style" and "theme" questions are 4% and 5%. These involve comprehension and interpretation.
*   The pass rate for "My Favourite Hobby" is 10%, which requires basic sentence formation and personal expression. The errors show that even this is difficult.

Transforming active to passive voice is arguably more difficult than simply writing a few sentences about a hobby, because it requires specific knowledge of grammatical rules and transformations, not just comprehension or basic expression.

If only 10% can write a few semi-coherent sentences about their hobby, a smaller proportion will be able to flawlessly execute a specific grammatical transformation, especially one involving irregular verbs. Many will likely just copy the sentence, provide an irrelevant answer, or leave it blank. Those who try might get parts right but miss key elements (e.g., "The leaves blown by the wind" - missing "were").

Challenging my assumption: I might initially think 20-30% because it's a grammar rule. But considering the *type* of errors (comprehension failures, complete blanks, inability to construct basic sentences), even a *rule-based* question will stump most. The jump from "I am reading" (4% pass) or "The last bargin they about a child" (5% pass) to correct passive voice transformation is massive.

I expect a very low score, perhaps comparable to or slightly better than the lowest "pass rate" questions, but still in single digits. If 4-5% get interpretation/description questions right, and 10% get simple paragraph writing right, then a specific, somewhat complex grammatical transformation will not be much higher. Many students likely skip such questions or provide very mangled attempts.

Rubric is "correctly transforms... 'The leaves were blown away by the wind'." This is an all-or-nothing question. Partial credit for "The leaves blown away by the wind" is not allowed.

My estimate leans towards the lower end of the very difficult questions, as it requires specific application of a taught grammatical rule rather than just understanding.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **7%**
