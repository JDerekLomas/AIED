To estimate the proportion of Class 6 students who would correctly answer "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" (where naming one correct range gets 0.5 points), let's break down the difficulty based on the provided context:

**Analysis of the Question and Rubric:**

*   **English Difficulty:** "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India." The English is relatively simple. "Name," "two," "major," "mountain ranges," "India" are all basic vocabulary. This is significantly simpler than explaining "colonial rule" or "significance of Ashoka's reign."
*   **Content Knowledge:**
    *   **"Mountain ranges in India":** This is a fundamental geography topic taught at primary levels. The Himalayas, specifically, are almost universally known in India from a very young age, often through patriotic songs or general knowledge. Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, and the Ghats are also standard textbook content.
    *   **"Any two":** This makes it easier, as students don't need to recall specific ones but just *any* two.
    *   **Partial Credit (0.5 for one correct):** This is a huge factor. A student only needs to recall *one* correct range to get the point. This significantly increases the chances of partial success.

**Comparison to Common Errors and Past Performance:**

The common errors shown ("Empty Response," garbled answers related to Ashoka but not the question) for higher-order questions (explain, why) highlight:
*   **Low English proficiency for *explanation*:** The sample answers for "colonial rule" and "Ashoka's reign" suggest an inability to articulate thoughts in English, even if the student might have some fragmented knowledge.
*   **Rote memorization challenges:** Even "Ashok seamb" for the lion question suggests a failed attempt at rote recall rather than comprehension.

**Why this question is different/easier:**

*   **No explanation required:** It's a direct recall/naming task, not an "explain" or "why" question. This sidesteps the significant English writing barrier identified in common errors.
*   **Highly familiar concept:** "Mountains in India" (especially Himalayas) is introduced very early in geography, even informally. It's not a nuanced historical concept.
*   **Visual cues/Maps:** Students are likely to have seen these on maps frequently.
*   **One correct is enough for full credit:** This drastically lowers the bar. Recalling "Himalayas" alone gets them full credit for this item (as the maximum for the *question* is 0.5, naming one is sufficient).

**Calibrating the Estimate:**

My first instinct might be "most students will know Himalayas," perhaps 50-60%. However, applying the challenge:

*   **"Limited English":** For *naming*, this is less of a barrier than for *explaining*. A student who barely reads English would likely recognize "Himalayas" written down, or could simply recall and write it.
*   **"Basic concepts aren't basic for struggling learners":** While "Himalayas" might seem basic, some struggling learners might still have gaps. However, given its prominence, it's one of the *most* basic geographical facts in India.
*   **"Exam anxiety causes blank responses":** This is a factor, but because the question is straightforward and involves common knowledge, the mental block might be less severe than for a complex historical explanation.
*   **"Never practiced this exact question type":** This question type (direct recall) is extremely common in lower grades.

Given the fundamental nature of "Himalayas" in Indian geography, the direct naming task (no explanation needed), and the credit for *just one* correct answer, the barriers of limited English and complex thought processes are largely removed. Many students who might write "Empty Response" for "Explain why lions" could still scribble "Himalayas."

Considering the *overall* average pass rate is 29% for potentially harder "explanation" questions, a direct recall of such fundamental information should be higher, especially with partial credit. However, acknowledging the "challenging your assumption" aspect, it won't be universally correct. Some students might still blank, misspell, or simply not have learned it due to absence or poor instruction.

I'd place it significantly higher than the complex "explain" questions (9-12%), and likely above the general pass rate of 29%. It's simpler than even the "Why are lions..." question because it's a direct fact and not about *explaining* significance or reasoning.

Let's consider that roughly 50% might confidently recall the Himalayas, and another 10-15% might vaguely remember *one* name like A
