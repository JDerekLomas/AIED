Here's my thought process for arriving at the estimate:

1.  **Analyze the Question:**
    *   "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan." - This part requires recall of specific facts.
    *   "Explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there." - This part requires basic comprehension, connection, and simple explanation.

2.  **Consider the Target Audience:**
    *   **Class 6, Indian government schools.** This immediately flags them as young, likely with foundational rather than advanced knowledge.
    *   **Economically weaker sections, limited English.** This is crucial. Even simple English instructions can be a barrier. "Explain how...influences" might be a complex enough phrasing to trip some.
    *   **Average pass rate ~29%.** This sets a very low bar for the overall exam, indicating significant learning gaps or exam challenges.
    *   **Common Errors (given):** "Empty Response," phonetically similar but incorrect spellings (Ashok), unrelated responses. This suggests a struggle with understanding, recall, and even basic written expression. The pass rates for those social science questions (9-12%) are abysmal, indicating severe difficulty with *explanation* and *linking concepts*.

3.  **Evaluate Each Part of the Question Against the Student Profile:**

    *   **"Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan."**
        *   Rajasthan is known for its arid climate, so "water" is a very common and easily recognizable natural resource (even if it's scarce, it's a *resource*).
        *   "Sand" is another obvious one.
        *   Marble, Copper, Gypsum are also significant, but might require more specific geographical knowledge that not all students retain.
        *   Solar energy/Sunlight, Wind energy are modern, and while accurate, might not be the *first* things that come to mind for all students at this level, or they might struggle to classify "Sunlight" as a "natural resource" in the same way as a mineral.
        *   *Self-correction:* For this part, many students should be able to recall at least *one* common resource like water or sand. Recalling *two* might be slightly harder but still very plausible. If they can recall two, they've done well on the first part.

    *   **"Explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."**
        *   This is the *critical* hurdle. The example common errors show students struggle with "explain" even on simpler topics.
        *   If they choose "water": They'd need to say something like, "Lack of water makes farming difficult," or "People have to walk far for water," or "Water is essential for life." These are simple explanations.
        *   If they choose "sand": They might say "Used for building houses" or "Desert affects travel."
        *   *Problem:* The act of forming a coherent, grammatically understandable sentence (even broken English) for an "explanation" is a major weakness according to the provided data. "Empty Response" is rampant.

4.  **Recalibrate Based on Expert Warnings:**
    *   "Teachers and experts consistently MISJUDGE item difficulty." This is a big red flag against an initially higher estimate.
    *   "How limited many students' English actually is." Even if they *know* the answer, expressing it correctly in English is a barrier.
    *   "That 'basic' concepts aren't basic for struggling learners." While water's influence seems basic to us, linking it explicitly and articulating it for an exam might not be.
    *   "Exam anxiety causes blank responses." This ties into the "Empty Response" common error.
    *   "Many students have never practiced this exact question type." Explaining influence might be less common than just listing facts.

5.  **Synthesize and Estimate:**
    *   I'd initially think 40-50% for this. Listing two resources seems easy, and a basic explanation of water's impact too.
    *   **BUT, factoring in the strict caveats and actual observed pass rates for *other Social Science explanation questions* (9-12%), that initial estimate is clearly too high.** Those questions involved "explain how," "why explain," "explain the significance" - all very similar to "explain how one of them influences."
    *   The "explain" part is the real killer. Even if 80% could list two resources, perhaps only 15-20% could then articulate an acceptable "explanation" in English for one of them.
    *   Combine this with "Empty Response" for seemingly easy questions.
    *   A student might write "Water, Marble." But fail to explain
