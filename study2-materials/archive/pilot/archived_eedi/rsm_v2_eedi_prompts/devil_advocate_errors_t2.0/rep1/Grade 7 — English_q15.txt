Let's break down the difficulties and recalibrate the estimate for the question: "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it."

Here's why my first instinct needs to be challenged and the likely common pitfalls for Class 7 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections with limited English:

**1. "Short paragraph (4-5 sentences)":**
    *   **Problem:** The concept of a "paragraph" itself might be difficult. Many students struggle with writing *any* connected sentences, let alone a specified length. They might write bullet points, a list of single words, or just a sentence or two.
    *   **Evidence from common errors:** The "My Favourite Hobby" examples show attempts to list multiple hobbies, or very short, grammatically incorrect sentences. The concept of 4-5 *related* sentences is advanced.

**2. "About 'My Favourite Hobby'":**
    *   **Problem:** While "hobby" might be a known word, forming coherent sentences about one's *own* hobby, including specifics, is harder than just recognizing the word.
    *   **Evidence:** "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho" indicates an understanding of "favourite game/hobby" but an inability to construct a paragraph about *one* hobby with details.

**3. "Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it.":**
    *   **Problem:** This requires understanding three distinct pieces of information and integrating them logically into the paragraph.
        *   "What it is": Relatively straightforward to name.
        *   "When you do it": Requires prepositions of time, adverbs, and specific time phrases (e.g., "in the evenings," "on weekends," "after school"). This can be tricky.
        *   "Why you enjoy it": This demands more complex vocabulary and sentence structures to express reasons, feelings, and benefits (e.g., "It makes me happy," "It helps me relax," "I learn new things"). This is often the hardest part.
    *   **Evidence:** The low pass rates for descriptive questions and theme analysis show that abstract reasoning or explaining *why* something happens/is liked is a major hurdle. "I am reading" for "describes the poet's writing style" demonstrates an inability to explain a concept.

**4. General English Language Barriers:**
    *   **Grammar:** Errors in tense, subject-verb agreement, articles (a/an/the), and prepositions will be rampant, even if they grasp the core meaning.
    *   **Vocabulary:** Limited vocabulary restricts their ability to express details about *when* and *why* with variety or precision.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple declarative sentences are the norm; forming complex or compound sentences to link ideas might be beyond many.

**5. Exam Anxiety & Practice:**
    *   As noted, anxiety often leads to blank responses ("Empty Response").
    *   "Never practiced this exact question type" means they might be overwhelmed by the combined requirements (paragraph length, multiple details, personal expression).

**Recalibration based on comparison to similar questions:**

*   "Describes the poet's writing style." (4% pass) - Highly conceptual, abstract, demanding complex language.
*   "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" (5% pass) - Also conceptual, requires analytical thinking and articulating abstract ideas.
*   "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what" (10% pass for the prompt as written) - This prompt is slightly less abstract but still has high linguistic demands.

The given pass rate of "10%" for *this specific question* suggests it is indeed very challenging. However, the initial examples provided with that 10% rate are incorrect responses. My task is to estimate what proportion would get it *correct* according to the rubric: "Student writes a complete paragraph that clearly mentions the hobby, when it is done, and why it is enjoyable."

Considering:
*   The "complete paragraph" requirement itself is a high bar.
*   Clearly mentioning all three elements (what, when, why).
*   The overwhelming evidence of basic grammatical and sentence structure issues.
*   The tendency towards listing or very short, broken sentences.
*   The pass rates of even simpler-seeming English writing tasks being incredibly low.
*   The provided errors demonstrate students are attempting to respond but falling far short of the rubric.

While the topic ("My Favourite Hobby") is accessible, the *form* and *detail* required are not. Achieving "a complete paragraph" that "clearly mentions" all three elements
