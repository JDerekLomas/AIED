Let's break down the question and common student difficulties to arrive at a calibrated estimate.

**Understanding the Question and Rubric:**
*   **Part 1: "Which line from the poem do you like the most..."** This requires students to identify a specific line. They need to recall or find it in the provided text.
*   **Part 2: "...and why?"** This is the more challenging part. It requires students to articulate a reason for their preference. This involves:
    *   Comprehension of the chosen line.
    *   Formulating an opinion/reason in English.
    *   Expressing that reason coherently.

*   **Rubric: "Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why."** This means both parts *must* be present and understandable for *any* score, even if minimal.

**Applying the Context and Common Errors:**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass rate) - This is conceptually harder but also involves more abstract language. "I am reading" shows complete misunderstanding.
    *   "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate) - This is conceptual but also requires expressing an idea. The "last bargin... child and labour" answer shows *some* understanding but poor formulation.
    *   The target question asks for "I like X because Y." While "I like" is common, "because" might be challenging to use grammatically and explain clearly.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   "What do you like?" might seem basic to a native speaker. But expressing *why* can be a complex thought process that students might struggle to translate into English.
    *   Some students might not have a strong personal connection to the poem or haven't been taught to express personal opinions in written form in English.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:**
    *   High frequency of "Empty Response" (demonstrates extreme difficulty with any productive writing). The 29% average pass rate, coupled with 4-5% on "theme" or "writing style," suggests a huge proportion will be blank or incomprehensible.

4.  **Teachers' Overestimation:**
    *   Teachers might think: "They just have to pick a line and say 'I like it because it's nice' or 'I like it because it's easy to understand'." However, "nice" or "easy to understand" might not be sophisticated enough for the rubric or difficult to formulate.
    *   Identifying *why* you like something often requires inferential reasoning or emotional response, which is hard to articulate in a foreign language for students with low comprehension and writing skills.

**Challenging the First Instinct ("most students could do this"):**

*   **Could a student who barely reads English?** They might pick *a* line, but the "why" is the stumbling block. They're unlikely to formulate a comprehensible reason beyond perhaps "it is good" or a direct translation of an emotion. The common errors show that even for seemingly simpler tasks, basic sentence formation is a huge issue.
*   **Could a student who was absent for this topic?** They might be able to pick *any* line randomly, but they would have zero context for *why* they would like it, making the "why" impossible.

**Specific Difficulties for This Question:**

*   **Locating a line:** While seemingly simple, students might struggle with attention, rapid reading, or recalling specific phrases.
*   **Comprehension:** They need to understand the *meaning* of the line to genuinely "like" it for a reason, not just pick it randomly.
*   **Expressing Personal Preference:** This involves more than just reciting facts or rephrasing text; it requires introspection and linguistic tools to convey it.
*   **Formulating "Why":** This is the highest hurdle. It requires:
    *   Using "because."
    *   Constructing a grammatically sound sentence/phrase to explain the reason.
    *   The reason itself needing to be intelligible. (e.g., "I like this line because it's good" might not get full marks if "good" isn't elaborated, and some might only manage "It is good" without the preceding phrase).

Given the consistent struggles with producing *any* coherent written output, the high rate of "Empty Response," and the very low pass rates on tasks requiring formulation of ideas/explanations, this question is harder than it appears. Many will either only pick a line without explanation, or give a very simplistic, barely comprehensible "why," or provide an empty response.
