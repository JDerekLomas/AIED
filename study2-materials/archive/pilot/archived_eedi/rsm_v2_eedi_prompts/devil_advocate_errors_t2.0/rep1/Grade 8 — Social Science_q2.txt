Let's break down the thinking process for estimating the pass rate for "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

**Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):**

My first thought might be: "Harappan Civilization is a foundational topic in Indian history. Urban planning is a major part of it. Most students would have learned about grid layouts or drainage systems. This seems pretty straightforward." This initial instinct would likely lead me to estimate a much higher pass rate, perhaps 40-50%.

**Applying the "Challenge Your Assumptions" Filter:**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "Describe one key feature" is a relatively simple instruction, but "Harappan Civilization's urban planning" has multiple multi-syllable words that could trip up struggling readers.
    *   Do they understand "feature"? "urban planning"?
    *   Even if they know the *concepts* in their local language, articulating them concisely in English is a separate, significant hurdle.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   While Harappan Civilization *is* foundational, remember the 29% average pass rate and the low pass rates on other "basic" history questions.
    *   The specifics of urban planning (grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town) might have been covered quickly or abstractly in class.
    *   Do they remember *specific examples*? Or just that Harappans were "advanced"? Many might confuse them with other ancient civilizations.

3.  **Exam Anxiety and Blank Responses:**
    *   This is huge. If a student sees "Harappan Civilization" and doesn't immediately recall a *specific, answerable feature*, their default could easily be "Empty Response" (which we see frequently in the error examples).
    *   Even if they vaguely remember "drainage," translating that into a coherent sentence to "describe" it under pressure is tough.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   Students might have learned about Harappan features, but have they practiced *describing one key feature* specifically, in English, for an exam?
    *   Often, rote learning focuses on memorizing lists rather than explaining concepts. A student might be able to *list* 5 features but struggle to *describe* just one accurately without their notes.

5.  **Looking at Common Errors for *Similar* Questions:**
    *   The "Colonial rule tribal communities" question (9% pass rate) involves describing impacts. The Harappan question also involves description. This hints that description itself is difficult.
    *   The "Ashoka's reign" question (12% pass rate) also asks for significance/features. Again, very low.
    *   The errors "Asher' stand," "ashok a second," "Ashok seamb" for the Lion Capital question suggest significant misinterpretation of keywords or general gibberish when unsure, not just blank responses. This indicates that even if they grasp parts of the question, the *output* can be unintelligible.

**Revisiting Potential Correct Answers:**

*   "Grid layout of streets": This is a very common feature taught. But can they explain *what* a grid layout is in English?
*   "Advanced drainage system": Also common. Can they articulate "advanced" or "system" adequately?
*   "Use of baked bricks": Perhaps a bit more obscure than the first two for a quick recall, but a solid correct answer.
*   "Division into citadel and lower town": Requires understanding specific terminology.

The *simplicity* of "one key feature" might trick us. Students need to *recall*, *select*, and *articulate* it clearly.

**Calibrating the Estimate:**

Given the extreme difficulty of other historical explanation/description questions (9-12% pass rates) and the strong negative factors (limited English, anxiety, poor concept recall for struggling students), a "straightforward" history question about a fundamental topic still won't fare well.

While "Harappan" is taught universally, the *detail and precision required to pass the rubric in English* for these students is very high. It's likely many will vaguely recall something but fail to describe it adequately, or write blank.

Considering the average is 29%, and specific Social Science questions involving *description/explanation* often drop below 15%:

*   It's likely *higher* than the "Explain how colonial rule..." or "Ashoka's reign" because Harappan urban planning is often a standalone, distinct lesson point.
*   But it's unlikely to be near the average due to the *demands of articulation in English* and the common blank/gibberish responses for
