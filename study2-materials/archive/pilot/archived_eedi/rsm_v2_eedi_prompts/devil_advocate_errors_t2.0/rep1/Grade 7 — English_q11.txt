Let's break down the thought process to arrive at a calibrated estimate.

**1. Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**
My first instinct, based on my own educational background and native English, is that "adjective phrase" is a relatively simple concept, especially if it only requires identifying an adjective. The sentence itself is straightforward. My initial, uncalibrated guess might be 40-50%.

**2. Applying the "Common Errors" Context:**

*   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%)**: This is a major red flag. If students are failing so dramatically on a conceptual question about "writing style," or simply responding "I am reading," it implies a profound lack of comprehension beyond basic word recognition. They aren't just misinterpreting, they're often not engaging with the prompt's core meaning.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (pass rate: 5%)**: Another very low pass rate. Again, students are either completely blank or providing extremely tangential, incomplete, or misspelled responses. This isn't just a nuance problem; it's a fundamental gap in understanding or expression. The "last bargin they about a child and labour. many people tried to force the la" shows an attempt, but a very broken one, far from coherent.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby." (pass rate: 10%)**: While slightly better, a 10% pass rate for *writing a short paragraph about a personal topic* is shockingly low. The examples ("My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho", "My hobby is cricket play") show they grasp *parts* of the prompt (hobbies), but struggle immensely with the "short paragraph," "4-5 sentences," or even basic sentence structure and spelling. This question asks them to produce *simple* English, yet they largely fail.

**3. Specific Analysis of the Target Question:**
"Identify the adjective phrase in the sentence: A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony."
Rubric: "The student correctly identifies "tiny" as an adjective."

*   **"Adjective Phrase" vs. "Adjective"**: The question asks for an *adjective phrase*, but the rubric allows for identifying just the *adjective*. This *increases* the potential pass rate compared to a strict interpretation of "adjective phrase."
*   **Target Word "tiny"**: It's a very common, simple adjective. No complex vocabulary.
*   **Sentence Structure**: "A tiny bird" is simple SVO structure.

**4. Incorporating "Important Reminders":**

*   **Limited English**: Given the low pass rates on other questions, many students likely don't understand what "adjective" means, let alone "adjective phrase." They might recognize "tiny" as a word, but not its grammatical function.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic**: For struggling learners, "adjective" is *not* a basic concept if it hasn't been consistently taught or reinforced, or if the terminology itself is opaque.
*   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses**: The high number of "Empty Response" errors suggests that even for seemingly "easier" questions, anxiety and lack of comprehension lead to non-attempts.
*   **No Practice with Exact Question Type**: Even if they know "adjective," have they practiced *identifying* it from a sentence? Have they been exposed to the term "adjective phrase" at all?

**5. Calibrating the Estimate (Challenging the First Instinct):**

*   **If only 4-5% can handle conceptual writing or theme questions, and only 10% can write a simple paragraph, what does that say about a grammatical term?** Understanding grammatical terms often requires a higher level of meta-linguistic awareness than basic reading/writing.
*   **"Empty Response" Factor**: This will significantly pull down the average.
*   **Misunderstanding "Adjective Phrase"**: Even if they know "adjective," they might overthink "phrase" and look for something more complex, leading to errors or blanks. The simple *rubric* is the saving grace, but the *question itself* might still intimidate them.
*   **"tiny" is easy, but identifying it as "an adjective" is not.** Many could read the sentence perfectly, understand it, but still fail to label "tiny" correctly.

Given the extreme underperformance on conceptual and even simple production tasks, it's highly improbable that a significant portion would correctly identify a grammatical part of speech, even with a forgiving rubric. If they are failing to write 4-5 sentences on "My Favourite Hobby," asking them to identify an "adjective phrase" (even if the answer
