Let's break down the likely student responses to "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

1.  **Empty Response/No Attempt (Significant):**
    *   **Reason:** Similar to the high rate of "Empty Response" seen in the examples, many students might not know *any* major mountain ranges or feel overwhelmed by the question if they don't immediately recall. The general pass rate of 29% suggests a significant portion of students are simply unable to answer many questions.
    *   **Prevalence:** Very high. This will be the single largest category of failure.

2.  **Naming One Correct Mountain Range (Partial Credit - Rubric):**
    *   **Reason:** Some students will likely know at least *one* major range, with the Himalayas being the most prominent and frequently taught. Aravalli might also be known, especially in regions closer to it.
    *   **Prevalence:** This will be a significant portion of the "passing" answers. Many will only get one and thus fail to get full credit, but according to the rubric, naming one is enough for *0.5* max score. *This is critical - the rubric specifies "Names one correct mountain range" as sufficient for 0.5 marks.*

3.  **Naming Two Correct Mountain Ranges (Full Credit - Beyond Rubric):**
    *   **Reason:** These students have a good grasp of Indian geography. They'll likely name Himalayas and then another well-known one.
    *   **Prevalence:** Moderate, lower than just one.

4.  **Misidentifying Mountains/Landforms (Attempt but Fail):**
    *   **Misconception:** Confusing a general "hill" or a specific peak for a "range." Students might name a local hill, or a specific famous peak within a range (e.g., "Mount Everest" instead of "Himalayas," though Everest is shared, not entirely in India, but often associated).
    *   **Misconception:** Confusing rivers, cities, or states for mountain ranges. This shows a fundamental lack of geographical knowledge.
    *   **Misconception:** Naming non-Indian mountains. (e.g., "Andes," "Rocky Mountains") - Less likely but possible.
    *   **Most Common Wrong Answer:** Perhaps something like "Everest" (if not specifically clarifying it's not a range, and also shared), or a local hill range not considered "major," or just random Indian names (e.g., "Delhi" or a river name).

5.  **Language Misunderstanding (Less Likely here, but possible):**
    *   **"Major":** Students might not understand the nuance of "major" and list smaller, less significant ranges. The rubric, however, seems quite lenient ("a major mountain range")
    *   **"Ranges":** Students might confuse "range" with a single peak, as noted above.
    *   **Prevalence:** Given the directness of "Name any two major mountain ranges," linguistic misunderstanding of core terms like "mountain" or "India" is low, but confusion between "range" and "peak" is possible.

6.  **Incorrect Spelling (Doesn't lead to a "wrong answer" if identifiable):**
    *   **Reason:** Common in written exams, especially with non-English names. If "Himalayas" is spelled "Himmalay" it would still be considered correct. This would not result in an incorrect answer, only perhaps a deduction for spelling if that were part of the assessment (but not here for accuracy).

**What the most common wrong answer would look like:**

*   **Most frequent (by far):** "Empty Response" or leaving the space blank.
*   **Next most frequent attempted wrong answer:**
    *   A single, less major local hill, or a specific peak instead of a range.
    *   A generic response not related to geography.
    *   Potentially, *only one* correct mountain named, which according to the rubric *still counts as passing*.

**Estimating the Pass Rate:**

Given the low pass rates on other Social Science questions (9-12% for explanatory answers) and the high prevalence of "Empty Response," this question, while simpler ("Name any two"), still presents a challenge.

However, a few factors increase the likelihood of *some* students passing (scoring 0.5):

*   **Simplicity:** It's a recall question, not requiring explanation.
*   **Himalayas:** The Himalayas are globally famous and prominently taught. Many students would likely recall this one.
*   **Rubric:** The key is the rubric: "Names one correct mountain range." This is a low bar for
