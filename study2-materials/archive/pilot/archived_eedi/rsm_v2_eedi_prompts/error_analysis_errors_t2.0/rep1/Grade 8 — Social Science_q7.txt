Here's an analysis of the likely errors and an estimated pass rate for the given question:

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

Given the context of Class 8 students in Indian government schools, mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English, and the common error patterns observed, here's a breakdown:

1.  **Limited English Comprehension:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Contribute," "expansion," "political dominance," "puppet nawab" are relatively complex terms. Students might grasp "Battle of Plassey" and "British power," but struggle to link them precisely.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The "How did X contribute to Y" structure might be difficult to parse, leading them to simply state facts about the Battle of Plassey rather than explain its *contribution* to British power *expansion*.
    *   **Result:** This could lead to partial answers or answers that describe the battle itself (who fought, who won) but not its *significance* in terms of British power.

2.  **Lack of Specific Historical Detail/Conceptual Understanding:**
    *   **Misconception about "Power":** Students might understand "British power" in a generic sense of military strength, but not in terms of political control, economic exploitation, or administrative dominance, which is what the rubric is looking for.
    *   **Lack of Linkage:** Even if they know about Plassey, they might not make the explicit connection that the *outcome* of the battle led to British control over Bengal and the installation of a puppet ruler. They might see it as just *one battle* among many.
    *   **Focus on Narrative vs. Analysis:** Social Science often requires analytical thinking ("how," "why," "significance"). Students, especially with rote learning common, might be good at recalling events but struggle with analyzing their implications.
    *   **Result:** They might simply state "The British won the Battle of Plassey" or "It helped the British" without explaining *how*. They might mention Mir Jafar but not clarify his "puppet" status or the shift in control.

3.  **Prioritization of Other Information:**
    *   Students might associate "British power" with later events (e.g., Company rule, direct British rule after 1857) more strongly than the earlier phase of mercantile expansion and political maneuvering starting with Plassey.
    *   **Result:** They might try to bring in information not directly relevant to Plassey's immediate contribution, confusing the timeline or broad impact with specific direct contributions.

4.  **Common Errors Observed in Sample Questions:**
    *   **"Empty Response":** This is a very strong indicator that students are either completely lost, cannot understand the question, or have no knowledge of the topic. This will likely be a significant chunk for a question requiring nuanced understanding.
    *   **Tangential or Partially Correct Snippets:** Similar to "Ashok a second" or "Ashok seamb" for the Ashoka question, students might try to recall isolated words or phrases related to Plassey, but fail to form a coherent, relevant answer. They might write "Nawab of Bengal," "Robert Clive," or "East India Company" without context.
    *   **Vague Answers:** "It helped British become powerful." (Doesn't explain *how*).

5.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   Many students, especially if they have some keyword recognition ("Battle of Plassey," "British power"), will attempt something rather than leave it entirely blank, even if their answer is wildly off or very vague.
    *   However, the observed high "Empty Response" rate for other Social Science questions suggests that a substantial number will also opt out due to low confidence or lack of understanding.

**What would the most common wrong answer look like?**

*   **Most Common Wrong Answer Type 1 (Empty/Minimal Attempt):**
    *   "Empty Response"
    *   "I don't know."
    *   "British power expanded." (Too vague, just rephrasing the question slightly)

*   **Most Common Wrong Answer Type 2 (Describing the Battle, Missing Significance):**
    *   "The Battle of Plassey was fought between the British East India Company and the Nawab of Bengal. The British won." (Correct facts, but doesn't explain *contribution to expansion of power* specifically as per rubric).
    *   "Robert Clive won the Battle of Plassey for the British." (Focuses on an individual rather than political implications).

*   **Most Common Wrong Answer Type 3 (Incorrect Details/Vague Historical Association):**
    *   "It was an important battle."
    *   "It led to British rule in India." (Too broad, not specific enough to Plassey's immediate role
