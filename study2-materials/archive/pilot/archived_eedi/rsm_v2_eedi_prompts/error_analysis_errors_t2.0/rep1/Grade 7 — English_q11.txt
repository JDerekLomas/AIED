Let's break down the potential errors for this question.

**COMMON ERRORS in English on this exam & implications for this question:**

*   **"Q: 'Describes the poet’s writing style.' (pass rate: 4%) Wrong answer: 'I am reading.'"** This shows a fundamental lack of understanding of what the question is asking and often a very literal or off-topic response. For our question, this might manifest as students highlighting the entire sentence, random words, or writing a tangentially related English phrase.
*   **"Q: 'Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.' (pass rate: 5%) Wrong answer: 'Empty Response' / 'The last bargin they about a child and labour. many people tried to force the la'"** This highlights two issues:
    *   **Empty Response:** Many students will likely not even attempt if they don't understand the core concepts.
    *   **Attempt with fundamental misunderstanding:** The last wrong answer shows an attempt to write about the poem but a struggle with sentence structure, grammar, and expressing complex ideas in English. They might know some of the words but can't put them together correctly.
*   **"Q: 'Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'.' (pass rate: 10%) Wrong answer: 'My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy' / 'My hobby is cricket play'"** This illustrates severe grammatical issues, difficulty forming complete sentences, and misinterpreting the "paragraph" instruction as a list or a very simplistic statement.

**Analysis of Errors for "Identify the adjective phrase in the sentence: A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony."**

*   **Misconceptions about English:**
    *   **What is an adjective?** Many might not clearly distinguish an adjective from a noun, verb, or preposition. They might pick the first word, last word, a verb, or even a conjunction if they don't know the core concept.
    *   **What is a phrase?** This is a huge hurdle. Even if they know "tiny" is an adjective, the instruction "adjective *phrase*" adds a layer of complexity. An adjective phrase is often a group of words modifying a noun. "Tiny" itself *is* an adjective, but as a single word, it's not a phrase. The correct answer would technically be just "tiny" if "phrase" were removed, or something like "a tiny bird" (noun phrase with an adjective) if the question meant a phrase containing an adjective. *Crucially, the rubric only asks for "tiny" to be identified as an adjective, not an adjective phrase. This simplifies the expected correct answer, but the wording of the question itself is problematic and a potential source of confusion.*
    *   **Word Order/Parts of Speech:** Difficulty identifying words by their function in a sentence.

*   **Language misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Identify":** While common, some might misinterpret this as "define" or "rewrite."
    *   **"Adjective phrase":** As noted, this is the biggest issue. Students are likely to struggle with "phrase" far more than "adjective."
    *   **Sentence structure:** Simply not understanding how words group together.

*   **Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**
    *   Given the "Empty Response" rates on other questions, a significant portion (perhaps 30-40%) will not attempt at all due to not understanding "adjective phrase."
    *   Those who attempt will likely struggle severely.

*   **What would the most common wrong answer look like?**

    Considering the provided errors:

    1.  **"Empty Response":** Very high likelihood.
    2.  **Highlighting/Underlining the entire sentence:** "A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony." (Trying to cover all bases or showing total lack of understanding).
    3.  **Highlighting the subject/verb/object mistakenly:**
        *   "A bird" (thinking it's the main idea)
        *   "built" (a prominent verb)
        *   "its nest"
        *   "balcony" (a noticeable noun)
    4.  **Picking the first or last few words:** "A tiny bird" (often done when unsure) or "our balcony."
    5.  **Picking a random prominent word:** "built" or "nest."
    6.  **Highlighting just "A":** If they pick the first word out of confusion.
    7.  **Highlighting just "tiny bird":** Still missing the "phrase" concept for "ad
