Let's break down the analysis for the "My Favourite Hobby" question, considering the provided context and common errors.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

*   **Misconceptions about "Paragraph" and Sentence Structure:**
    *   **Lists instead of paragraphs:** As seen in "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho," students might list ideas or single words rather than forming coherent sentences into a paragraph. They may not understand the concept of a "paragraph" as a cohesive unit of related sentences.
    *   **Lack of subject-verb agreement or incomplete sentences:** "My hobby is cricket play" indicates a struggle with basic sentence construction. They might omit subjects, verbs, or necessary articles.
    *   **Fragmented thoughts:** Even if they write a few sentences, they might not logically connect them or fully express a thought.

*   **Language Misunderstandings/Limited Vocabulary:**
    *   **Understanding "Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it":** While the phrasing is relatively simple, students with limited English might struggle to identify *and correctly incorporate* all three required elements into their answer. They might state the hobby, but fail to clearly articulate *when* or *why*.
    *   **Vocabulary for "enjoy":** They might struggle to find appropriate words to express *why* they enjoy their hobby, leading to very basic or repetitive explanations ("I like it").
    *   **Spelling and basic grammar:** Frequent errors in spelling (Favowrife Hobby cbaking), prepositions, and tenses will make sentences difficult to understand, even if the intent is there.

*   **Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**
    *   **Mostly attempt and fail:** Unlike the more abstract "describes the poet's writing style" or "theme" questions which yielded many "Empty Responses," "My Favourite Hobby" is a very relatable and common topic. Most students will likely *attempt* to write something, even if it's very basic or grammatically incorrect.
    *   The "Empty Response" common error for other questions suggests a complete lack of understanding or confidence. For a topic like this, students might feel they *can* write something, even if their English skills are insufficient.

*   **What would the most common wrong answer look like?**
    1.  **Too short/incomplete:** One or two fragmented sentences. "My hobby is playing cricket. I like it."
    2.  **Lists:** Naming hobbies without forming sentences. "My favourite hobbies are football, reading, drawing."
    3.  **Missing components:** States the hobby, but omits when or why, or gives a very weak explanation for why. "My favourite hobby is cricket. I play everyday." (Missing 'why enjoy it' or making it very superficial).
    4.  **Grammatical chaos:** A collection of words vaguely related to a hobby, but not forming coherent sentences or paragraphs. The meaning is lost in translation or poor construction. "My Favowrife Hobby cbaking My Favowrife" falls into this category – attempting, but utterly failing the "paragraph" and clarity criteria.
    5.  **Off-topic:** Listing favourite foods or other unrelated items, similar to "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho my fauourite food is noodles". This suggests a lack of understanding of "hobby" or "paragraph" context.

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

Considering the relatively low pass rates on other questions, especially those requiring basic writing ("My Favourite Hobby" 10%), this specific rubric requires a complete paragraph with all three elements mentioned *clearly*. The existing "My Favourite Hobby" examples already show significant struggles even for a very basic understanding of the task.

The students' struggles with paragraph structure, complete sentences, and answering all parts of the prompt will be significant. While they will likely attempt it, few will achieve the standard outlined in the rubric ("writes a complete paragraph that clearly mentions the hobby, when it is done, and why it is enjoyable").

Given the *average pass rate of 29%*, and the specific struggles with sentence formation and "paragraph" that the sample errors demonstrate, the requirement for a *complete paragraph* with *all elements clearly mentioned* will push the pass rate down. The prompt asking for *4-5 sentences* is an added hurdle for students who struggle to write even one correct sentence.

My estimation will be *slightly higher* than the given 10% example of previous years (which already indicates extreme difficulty), because I assume the prompt for *this* analysis might be slightly rephrased for clarity from the earlier "10% example", but the fundamental challenge remains the same. If the "10%" pass rate refers to *exactly this question as stated*, then my estimation should align closely. Given the specific
