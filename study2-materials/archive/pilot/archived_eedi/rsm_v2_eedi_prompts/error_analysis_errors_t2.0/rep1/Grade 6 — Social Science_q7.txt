Let's break down the potential errors for this question.

**COMMON ERRORS and ANALYSIS:**

*   **Social Science Misconceptions:**
    *   **Lack of Specific Knowledge:** While Rajasthan is well-known for certain resources, many students might struggle to recall *two specific* natural resources from that state. Their general knowledge about "resources" might be too broad (e.g., "minerals," "plants," without specifics).
    *   **Difficulty Linking Resource to Influence:** Even if they identify one resource, connecting it to "how it influences lives" requires a higher level of understanding. For instance, knowing "marble" is a resource is one thing; explaining its use in construction, sculpture, or as a source of livelihood is another.
    *   **Focus on Man-Made/Cultural:** Some might confuse natural resources with man-made attractions or cultural aspects (e.g., "forts," "tourism," "dessert culture").
    *   **General vs. Specific Influence:** They might give a very generic explanation of "influence" (e.g., "it helps them") rather than a concrete impact.

*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Natural Resources":** While likely understood broadly, precise identification could be challenging if their English vocabulary for specific minerals or elements is weak.
    *   **"Influences":** This word might be complex. They might understand "affect" but struggle with articulating the *nature* of the influence clearly in English.
    *   **"Explain how one of them influences":** This two-part instruction (identify resources AND explain influence) increases the cognitive load and potential for error. They might do one part but not the other.

*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **Attempt and Fail:** Many students would likely attempt this. Identifying *one* natural resource for Rajasthan (like water, desert, sand, sunlight, or maybe a mineral) might feel within reach. However, providing *two* *correct* ones and then explaining the influence could be the stumbling block.
    *   **Partial Credit Potential (if available, but rubric is 1/0):** The rubric is 1 or 0, so partial answers (like only listing one resource) would not score. This makes the question harder to pass.
    *   **Empty Response/Off-Topic:** As seen in previous examples, a significant proportion might leave it blank or give completely unrelated answers, especially if they lack specific knowledge or struggle with comprehension.

*   **Most Common Wrong Answer Looks Like:**
    *   **List one correct resource, fail to list a second, or list an incorrect second resource.** E.g., "Water" (correct) and "Camels" (incorrect resource, but influenced by the environment).
    *   **List two resources, but the explanation is too vague or missing.** E.g., "Marble, Water. They are important for people." (Doesn't explain *how* they influence lives).
    *   **Lists non-natural resources or very broad concepts:** E.g., "Forts, Deserts" (Desert is natural, but "Forts" is not. Also, desert itself isn't a *resource* in the same vein as water or minerals). Or "Minerals, Animals."
    *   **Confusion with adjacent states:** Listing resources from Gujarat or Haryana.
    *   **Empty Response:** Always a significant portion due to lack of knowledge or comprehension.
    *   **Focus only on "desert" characteristics without linking to resources:** "Rajasthan is a desert. People have less water." (Doesn't explicitly mention water as a resource or its *influence*).

**Conclusion based on analysis:**

*   **Identification of Two:** The need for *two specific* correct resources is a hurdle. Students often remember one prominent one but struggle with a second.
*   **Explanation:** Explaining "influence" requires more analytical thinking and command of English than simple recall.
*   **Rubric strictness:** The 1-mark rubric means no partial credit, making it an all-or-nothing situation for many attempts.
*   **Prior error patterns:** "Empty Response" is a major problem across other questions. Specificity (Ashok a second vs. Ashoka's significance) is a general weakness.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for Social Science, and the nature of this question (recall of two specific facts + explanation), it feels moderately challenging. It's not just "explain X," but "identify A and B, then explain A's influence."

I anticipate many students getting one resource correct but not two, or listing two but failing on the explanation. The high prevalence of "Empty Response" for even simpler "explain" questions is concerning.
