Let's break down the likely errors for the sentence rearrangement question:

**Q: Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence:\nbook/reading/a/is/he**

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Misconceptions about English Word Order (SVO Structure):**
    *   **Direct Translation Interference from Regional Languages:** Many Indian languages (like Hindi, Marathi, Bengali) are SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). This is a *major* source of error for sentence rearrangement into English. Students might naturally try to put the verb at the end or place the object before the verb.
        *   Example (Hindi): वह एक किताब पढ़ रहा है (Vah ek kitaab padh raha hai) - "He a book reading is."
    *   **Lack of Explicit Understanding of English Sentence Structure Rules:** They might not have been explicitly taught or practiced subject-verb-object order in English beyond very basic examples.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings/Word Recognition Issues:**
    *   **Treating words as independent units without syntactic roles:** They might see "book," "reading," "a," "is," "he" as a list and just put them together in an arbitrary order or the order they've seen them in isolated phrases, without understanding their grammatical function.
    *   **Focus on key content words over function words:** They might prioritize "book," "reading," "he" and ignore "is" or "a," leading to incomplete or garbled sentences.
    *   **Confusion with Auxiliary Verbs:** While "is" is common, its role in forming a continuous tense might not be fully grasped, especially if the continuous tense is challenging.

3.  **Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**
    *   **High Attempt Rate:** Unlike abstract questions about poetic style or themes, this question deals with concrete words and a very common grammatical task. Most students, even if unsure, would likely try to put the words together. It *feels* more approachable than writing a paragraph or explaining a concept.
    *   **Failed Attempt:** The majority of errors will be failed attempts, rather than blank responses, because they have all the components provided.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answers:**

    *   **SOV Influence (Verb at the end or near the end):**
        *   "He a book reading is." (Direct SOV transfer)
        *   "A book he reading is."
        *   "Reading he is a book."
        *   "Book reading a is he."
    *   **Slightly Disordered but close:**
        *   "He is a book reading." (Common, confusing word order within the predicate)
        *   "Is he reading a book?" (Posing as a question, potentially from practice with simple Q&A structures)
        *   "A he is reading book."
    *   **Random Order/Garbled:**
        *   "Book a is reading he."
        *   "Reading a he book is."
        *   This is less likely to be the *most common* type of wrong answer compared to structurally influenced ones, as students generally try to form some kind of coherent sequence.
    *   **Partial Answers (missing words, though less likely as all words are given):** This is rare given the nature of the question, unless they are extremely careless or don't understand the task at all.

**Why this question is DIFFERENT from the low-pass rate examples:**

The "common errors" questions you provided all require:
*   **Abstraction/Interpretation:** "poet's writing style," "theme/central idea."
*   **Production of new text:** "Write a short paragraph."
*   **Sophisticated understanding of concepts and vocabulary:** "Describes," "theme."

This "rearrange the words" question, while challenging due to SOV interference, is:
*   **Concrete:** All words are provided.
*   **Familiar vocabulary:** "book," "reading," "he," "is," "a" are all very basic and frequently encountered words.
*   **Focus on syntax, not semantics/interpretation.**

These factors make it significantly *easier* than the examples given. Students at a 29% average pass rate *might* still struggle with this, but it taps into a more fundamental, rote-learnable aspect of English grammar. They would have encountered "He is reading" frequently.

**Estimating the Pass Rate:**

Considering the challenges but also the fundamental nature and high attempt rate:

*   **SOV interference:** This is the primary hurdle and will cause a lot of errors.
*   **Familiarity of words/pattern:** The "He is reading a book" structure is taught very early and repeated. Even
