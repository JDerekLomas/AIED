Based on the provided context, the student profile, common errors, and the nature of the question, let's break down the likely error types and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Empty Response/Lack of Knowledge (Most Common):**
    *   **Misconception:** Social Science topics, especially ancient history, might be perceived as rote memorization, and if a student hasn't memorized this specific fact, they have nothing to say.
    *   **Attempt:** Not at all, or a minimal attempt that reveals complete lack of knowledge.
    *   **Evidence from past errors:** "Empty Response" is rampant for the more complex questions. While this question is more factual, a lack of recollection would lead to similar outcomes. The low pass rates for similar explanatory questions (9-12%) suggest a general difficulty in recalling specific details or formulating a coherent answer.

2.  **Partial Knowledge/Vague Answer:**
    *   **Misconception:** The student might have a general idea that Harappa was "advanced" or "old" but can't pinpoint a *specific key feature* of *urban planning*. They might know about the Indus Valley Civilization but struggle to retrieve architectural details.
    *   **Attempt:** They might try to write something generic about "good cities" or "they built houses." This wouldn't meet the rubric's requirement for a "key feature."
    *   **Example:** "They built strong buildings" or "They had many people living there."

3.  **Language Misunderstanding (Less common for this specific Q, but possible for "feature" or "urban planning"):**
    *   **Misconception:** While "feature" and "urban planning" are fairly common terms, especially in a Social Science context, if a student struggles with English, they might not grasp the specific nuance.
    *   **Attempt:** They might focus on *other* aspects of the civilization (e.g., their agriculture, seals, script – which isn't part of the question's scope on urban planning) if they misinterpret the question.
    *   **Example:** "They wrote on seals" (understanding "feature" generally but missing "urban planning").

4.  **Recalling Wrong Information/Confusing Civilizations:**
    *   **Misconception:** They might remember details from another ancient civilization (Mesopotamian, Egyptian, or even later Indian empires like Mauryan) and attribute them incorrectly to Harappa.
    *   **Attempt:** They attempt to answer but with factually incorrect details for Harappa.
    *   **Example:** "They built huge pyramids" or "Their streets were very narrow and winding."

5.  **Focusing on Non-Urban Planning Features:**
    *   **Misconception:** They understand "feature" and "Harappan Civilization" but struggle to narrow down to *urban planning*. They might talk about trade, pottery, religious practices, or governance.
    *   **Attempt:** Provides relevant Harappan information, but not in the scope of urban planning.
    *   **Example:** "They traded with Mesopotamia."

**Connection to Common Errors Provided:**

*   "Empty Response" is highly likely due to direct factual recall needed.
*   The "lions on currency notes" and "Ashoka's reign" examples show a pattern of rote recall failing, or general vagueness. Students who fail these likely haven't sufficiently grasped or memorized specific details.

**Estimation Strategy:**

*   The question is factual and requires specific recall (a grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town). It's not a complex explanation like the tribal communities question.
*   However, it's specific enough that many students from an average 29% pass rate, limited English, and background in rote learning might not have this precise detail memorized.
*   The general pass rate is 29%. This question is more straightforward than "explain how colonial rule affected tribals" (9% pass) or "significance of Ashoka's reign" (12% pass), both of which require more synthesis and understanding.
*   However, it's not as simple as defining a single word.
*   The example wrong answers for other questions suggest significant gaps in basic factual recall or understanding of specific domains within social science.
*   **Likely Pass Determinant:** Whether they *explicitly know* one of the bulleted points in the rubric. General statements like "they had good cities" won't count.

Given the student profile and error trends:

*   A significant portion will give **empty responses** (similar to the 9-12% pass rates on other recall/explanation questions).
*   Some will attempt but provide **vague or incorrect information**, not
