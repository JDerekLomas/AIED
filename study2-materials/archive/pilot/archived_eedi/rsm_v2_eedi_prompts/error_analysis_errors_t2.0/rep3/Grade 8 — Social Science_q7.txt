Here's an analysis of the likely errors and an estimated pass rate for the given question:

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

1.  **Empty Response/No Attempt (Significant Factor):**
    *   **Misconception/Lack of Knowledge:** A large proportion of students, given the 29% average pass rate and the nature of Social Science errors provided, might simply not know enough about the Battle of Plassey to formulate any answer. History, especially specific events and their consequences, often requires memorization and understanding of cause-and-effect.
    *   **Language Barrier:** While the question is straightforward, "contribute to the expansion of British power" might be slightly more complex than direct recall questions. If they only remember "Battle of Plassey" but not its *significance*, they might not attempt.
    *   **Behavior:** Given the common "Empty Response" in other challenging questions, this will likely be a very dominant error type.

2.  **Generic/Vague Answers about British Power/Rule (Common Attempt, Fails Rubric):**
    *   **Misconception/Partial Knowledge:** Students might know that Plassey was a British victory and led to increased British power, but not the *specific mechanism* (control over Bengal, puppet nawab). They might say things like: "British won and became powerful," "British started ruling India," or "It helped British become rulers." These are too broad and don't meet the rubric's requirement for explaining "political dominance/control over Bengal."
    *   **Lack of Detail:** They understand the general outcome but not the crucial intermediate step. This indicates a superficial understanding rather than a deep one.

3.  **Confusing with Other Battles/Events (Less Common but Possible):**
    *   **Misconception:** While Plassey is quite iconic, students might mix it up with other Anglo-Indian conflicts or treaties that expanded British power (e.g., Anglo-Mysore Wars, Subsidiary Alliance). They might attribute consequences of other events to Plassey.

4.  **Focusing on Minor Details or Misinterpretations (Less Common):**
    *   Students might incorrectly state the date, the commanders involved, or focus on a less relevant detail without connecting it to the expansion of British power.
    *   Some might provide narrative details of the battle itself without explaining its *consequence* for British power expansion.

5.  **Language Misunderstandings (Minor for this specific question but always present):**
    *   The phrase "contribute to the expansion" might be slightly tricky, but usually, context helps. More likely, a student knows what happened but can't express it effectively in English.

**What would the most common wrong answer look like?**

*   **"Empty Response" or no answer at all.** (Highest probability)
*   **"The British won and became more powerful."** (Very common for students attempting but lacking specifics)
*   **"It helped the British to rule India."** (Similar to the above, too generic)
*   Less commonly, "They got a lot of money." (Focusing on wealth transfer but missing the political control aspect as the primary contribution to *power expansion*)

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

Considering the average pass rate (29%), the complexity of articulating a specific historical impact versus mere recall, and the nature of errors (especially "Empty Response" and generic answers), this question would be challenging. The need for explaining *how* it led to power expansion (political dominance in Bengal, puppet nawab) rather than just stating *that* it did, raises the bar.

*   A significant portion will leave it blank.
*   Many will provide generic answers about British power increase without hitting the Bengal-specific aspect of the rubric.
*   Only a smaller subset will accurately articulate the key point.

Given that similar "explain" questions have pass rates of 9-12% and this requires specific historical impact rather than just defining a term, it's on the tougher side. The concept of "puppet nawab" or direct political control over Bengal requires a reasonably good grasp of the event's aftermath.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 15%**
