Here's an analysis of the likely errors and an estimated pass rate for the "Active to Passive Voice" question among Class 7 students in Indian government schools:

## Analysis of Likely Errors for "Change from Active Voice to Passive Voice"

Given the student demographic, the provided common error examples, and the inherent complexity of active/passive voice transformation, here's a breakdown of anticipated errors:

### 1. Fundamental Lack of Understanding (High Frequency)

*   **Misconception:** Students may have been *introduced* to active/passive voice but haven't grasped the core concept. They might know the terms but not the mechanism of change.
*   **Language Misunderstanding:** The terms "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" themselves are abstract. Simply remembering "change the voice" doesn't mean understanding *how* to change it.
*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:** Many might attempt but fail drastically due to no underlying understanding. A significant portion might leave it blank, as seen in "Empty Response" for other questions, especially if they are unsure what "voice" even refers to.
*   **Common Wrong Answer Look-like:**
    *   "The wind blow the leaves away." (No change, or minimal incorrect verb tense change).
    *   "Wind blowing the leaves." (Attempts a different tense, maybe continuous).
    *   "The leaves blew away the wind." (Incorrectly switches subject and object without voice transformation).
    *   "The leaves and the wind." (Random phrase unrelated to the question).
    *   **Empty Response** will be very common due to complete confusion.

### 2. Issues with Verb Tense and Irregular Verbs (Very High Frequency)

*   **Misconception:** While they might attempt to change the structure, the *blown* (past participle of blow) will be a major stumbling block. "Blew" is an irregular verb.
*   **Language Misunderstanding:** Students often struggle with past participles, especially of irregular verbs. They might default to a simple past or even try to make a regular past tense form (e.g., "blewed").
*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:** These students would attempt the change but fail specifically at the verb conjugation.
*   **Common Wrong Answer Look-like:**
    *   "The leaves was blew away by the wind." (Correct subject, auxiliary verb, but wrong participle).
    *   "The leaves was blown away by the wind." (Singular "was" instead of plural "were"). This is an extremely common error for SVA.
    *   "The leaves were blew away by the wind." (Correct auxiliary, but wrong participle).
    *   "The leaves is blown away by the wind." (Mixing tenses).

### 3. Subject-Verb Agreement Errors (High Frequency)

*   **Misconception:** Even if they get to "the leaves were blown," they might struggle with plural "leaves" and pick the singular "was." This is a recurring issue in basic English grammar.
*   **Language Misunderstanding:** Basic SVA is often shaky.
*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:** Will attempt, but will make a fundamental grammatical error.
*   **Common Wrong Answer Look-like:**
    *   "The leaves *was* blown away by the wind."

### 4. Omission of "by the wind" (Moderate Frequency)

*   **Misconception:** Students might correctly transform the main part but forget or omit the "agent" ("by the wind"). This is acceptable in some contexts for passive voice, but for a direct transformation task, it implies incomplete understanding of the mechanics.
*   **Language Misunderstanding:** Focusing only on the core transformation and missing the less emphasized "by + agent."
*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:** Will attempt and largely succeed, but miss a crucial part.
*   **Common Wrong Answer Look-like:**
    *   "The leaves were blown away."

### 5. Incorrect Order of Words / General Confusion (Moderate Frequency)

*   **Misconception:** Trying to change the sentence but without a clear rule set, resulting in jumbled or nonsensical phrasing.
*   **Language Misunderstanding:** Weak sentence structure knowledge.
*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:** Will definitely attempt but fail due to lack of a systematic approach.
*   **Common Wrong Answer Look-like:**
    *   "Away the leaves blew the wind."
    *   "The wind the leaves blew away."
    *   "Blown away were the leaves by the wind." (Incorrect but close inversion).

### 6. Mixing up Active/Passive (Low but possible frequency)

*   **Misconception:** Attempts to change it but makes it *more* active or a
