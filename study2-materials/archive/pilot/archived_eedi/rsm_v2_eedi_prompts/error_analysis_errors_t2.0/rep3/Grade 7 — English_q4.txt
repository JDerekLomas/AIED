Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the context of Class 7 students from economically weaker sections, limited English proficiency, and the common errors observed, here's what I anticipate:

1.  **Vocabulary/Lexical Difficulty:**
    *   **"Important":** While "important" is a relatively common word, students might struggle to grasp its full implications in an abstract sense ("important *in real life*"). They might associate it with something specific or tangible rather than a philosophical query.
    *   **"Reason":** Similar to "important," asking for a "reason" requires analytical thought that might be challenging for students primarily focused on basic comprehension.

2.  **Abstract vs. Concrete Thinking:**
    *   The question moves from the concrete narrative of "the king's questions" (from the reading passage, which we assume they have read) to a more abstract evaluation of their "importance in real life." This leap can be very difficult. Students might be able to recall the king's questions but fail to connect them to broader life applications.

3.  **Syntactic/Grammatical Confusion:**
    *   "Do you think..." implies expressing an opinion and justification. This structure might be tricky. They might focus only on "king's questions are important" and struggle with "Give one reason."
    *   The use of "real life" might be interpreted too literally, expecting a specific real-world example rather than a general principle.

4.  **Influence of Passage Comprehension:**
    *   If students have a weak understanding of the original passage about the king's questions (e.g., "The Three Questions" by Tolstoy, or a similar story), then answering *this* question will be even harder. The rubric clarifies the king's questions ("the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with"). If they don't grasp these core questions, they can't evaluate their importance.

5.  **Reluctance to Express Opinion/Lack of Confidence:**
    *   Questions that ask "Do you think...?" and require giving a "reason" demand personal engagement and the formulation of an argument, however simple. Given their generally low pass rates and "Empty Response" common errors, many might not feel confident enough to venture an answer. They might fear being wrong or simply lack the expressive tools.

6.  **Common Errors Translated to This Question:**

    *   **Similar to "Describes the poet's writing style":** Many might simply identify the king or the questions, without addressing "importance" or "real life."
        *   Wrong Answer Idea: "King has three questions."
        *   Wrong Answer Idea: "King ask questions about time."
    *   **Similar to "Write a theme...":** They might recall aspects of the story without relating it to the question asked.
        *   Wrong Answer Idea: "The king wanted to know what is right time and what is right person." (This states what the king wanted, not if *they* think it's important *in real life* and *why*.)
        *   Wrong Answer Idea: "King's questions are about working with people." (Partially correct fact from the story, but doesn't answer the prompt fully).
    *   **Similar to "My Favourite Hobby":** Lack of complete sentences, fragmented thoughts, difficulty in extending a point.
        *   Wrong Answer Idea: "Yes it important king wants to know real life things." (Weak reason, incomplete thought).
        *   Wrong Answer Idea: "Yes. They are important." (No reason provided, incomplete answer for the rubric).
        *   Wrong Answer Idea: "Real life is difficult we need to know what to do." (Doesn't directly link to the king's questions, though it's moving towards a relevant point).

7.  **"Yes/No" without Justification:** A significant number might correctly say "Yes" but fail to provide *any* valid reason, or provide one that is too vague or repetitive. The rubric requires a "valid reason."

**What would the most common wrong answer look like?**

*   "Empty Response" (High likelihood, similar to other questions)
*   "Yes." (Correct agreement, but no reason, so zero score)
*   "King asks questions." / "The King has three questions." (Recalling part of the passage, not answering the prompt)
*   "They are important because the king wants answers." (Focuses on the king's desire, not *real-life importance* from the student's perspective.)
*   "Yes it is good." (Vague reason, probably insufficient).
*   "It teaches us good
