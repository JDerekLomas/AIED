Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the context (Class 6 Indian government school students, mostly from EWS, limited English, low average pass rates, common error patterns observed):

*   **Misconceptions about English Grammar/Usage:**
    *   **"Some" vs. "Any" is a nuanced concept:** This isn't just about singular/plural or basic vocabulary. It deals with affirmative/negative statements and questions. While "some" in affirmative statements and "any" in negatives/questions is a primary rule, there are exceptions (e.g., offers/requests using "some" in questions). For these students, even the primary rule might be challenging.
    *   **Direct Translation/Literal Meaning:** Students might struggle to see "some" and "any" as more than just vague quantity words. They might not have the grammatical framework for their specific uses.
    *   **Lack of Exposure:** They likely have very limited exposure to structured English grammar instruction or natural language use that would reinforce this distinction.

*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **Vocabulary of the words themselves:** While "some" and "any" are common, understanding their *grammatical function* in a sentence is harder than just knowing their dictionary definition.
    *   **Understanding the question "Choose the correct word":** They generally understand this directive (as shown by attempts, even if incorrect, in other questions). The difficulty isn't in understanding the *task*, but in the *content* required.
    *   **Context of the sentence:** "There are ... apples in the basket" is a straightforward, simple sentence. No complex vocabulary here.

*   **Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**
    *   **Attempt:** This question is very short and simple in structure. It only requires circling/writing one word. Unlike "Write a short paragraph," which is demanding, this question *invites* an attempt. Students are very likely to attempt it.
    *   **Guessing:** Given the simplicity of the task, many who don't know the rule will resort to guessing between the two options.

*   **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   **Selecting 'any':** Since it's a 50/50 choice for someone who doesn't know the rule, 'any' is just as likely to be picked as 'some'. There isn't an obvious phonetic or semantic reason that one would be chosen over the other without understanding the grammar. It would just be a random guess for many.

**Comparing to Previous Error Types:**

*   "Describes the poet’s writing style": Requires deep comprehension and sophisticated analytical language. High difficulty. Many empty responses or off-topic.
*   "Write a theme or central idea...": Requires inferential reading and summarizing skills. Moderate-high difficulty. Many empty or partially correct/misguided.
*   "Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby": Requires paragraph structure, content generation, and sustained correct grammar/spelling. Moderate difficulty. Many struggle with structure and coherent sentences.

This question ("Choose the correct word...") is **mechanically simpler** than the examples given. It's a closed question with only two options. The *cognitive demand* to identify the *correct grammatical rule* is present, but the *output demand* is minimal. This implies that many will *attempt* and produce *one of the two options*.

**Estimate Calculation:**

1.  **Students who genuinely know the rule:** Given the low overall pass rates (29% average), and the grammatical nuance of "some/any," I would expect a small percentage to genuinely know this rule. Perhaps around **10-15%**. These would be students with stronger English foundations, possibly from home exposure or slightly better prior schooling.
2.  **Students who guess:** For the vast majority who don't know the rule, it's a coin flip between 'some' and 'any'. Roughly 50% of these will guess correctly.
3.  **Proportion of students attempting:** This question is very approachable; nearly 100% would attempt it.

Let's assume the remaining 85% don't know the rule and guess.
85% * 0.5 (chance of guessing correctly) = 42.5%

Adding those who know the rule: 15% (know) + 42.5% (guess correctly) = 57.5%

Let's adjust for some students still finding the distinction confusing even for simple guesses, or perhaps a small proportion not even registering the difference between the two words fully and just picking randomly with slightly less than 50/50 chance of getting it right. However, for a two-option choice,
