Here's an analysis of the likely errors and an estimation of the pass rate for the question: "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"

## Analysis of Likely Errors:

**1. Content/Conceptual Misconceptions (Leading to Failed Attempts or Tangential Answers):**

*   **Lack of Specificity/General Knowledge:** Many students might know *of* the Battle of Plassey as *a* significant event, but not recall its direct *consequence* regarding British power expansion. They might remember it as "a battle with the British" but struggle to link it specifically to political dominance or the puppet Nawab.
*   **Confusing with other Battles/Events:** There are many battles and key historical figures in this period. Students might confuse the outcomes of Plassey with other Anglo-Indian conflicts (e.g., Carnatic Wars, Buxar), or simply remember a general narrative of British "takeover" without pinpointing the *how* for Plassey.
*   **Focus on Economic Exploitation (General):** Students might generally understand that the British exploited India economically. While Plassey enabled this, they might struggle to connect the *political* dominance immediately established by Plassey to the subsequent economic gains, instead offering a broad statement about British trade or resources.
*   **Limited Understanding of "Expansion of Power":** Students might not fully grasp "expansion of power" beyond simple conquest. The idea of installing a puppet ruler (Mir Jafar) and gaining political control without direct annexation might be too nuanced.

**2. Language Misunderstandings (Leading to Confusion or Vague Answers):**

*   **"Contribute to the expansion":** This phrasing might be challenging. Some might interpret "contribute" broadly as simply "being part of it" rather than a direct causal link. "Expansion of power" might also be interpreted vaguely.
*   **Key historical terms:** Words like "dominance," "puppet nawab," "political control" might not be fully understood or correctly applied by all students, especially given the limited English proficiency.

**3. Student Attempt & Engagement:**

*   **High Attempt Rate, Low Success Rate:** Unlike the "Explain how colonial rule under the British affected..." question, which requires a broader essay-like answer and more abstract thinking, this question is more specific. Many students would likely attempt it because "Battle of Plassey" is a well-known historical marker. However, the accuracy of their answer would be the issue.
*   **"Empty Response":** While common in difficult or open-ended questions, for a specific event like Plassey, "Empty Response" might be less common than for a broad "explain how... affected..." type question. Students will likely try to write *something*.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

Given the context and typical errors, here's what the most common wrong answers would look like:

*   **Vague/General British Victory:** "The British won the battle." or "The British became stronger." (Lacks specific consequence for expansion of *power*).
*   **Economic Focus (without political link):** "The British got more money/resources." or "It helped the British trade more." (Missing the political mechanism).
*   **Chronological Error/Confusion:** Listing something that happened much later, or mistaking the outcome of another battle.
*   **Partial Truth:** Mentioning that "the British gained control," but failing to explain *how* (e.g., through a puppet ruler). This would likely earn 0 marks if not specific enough about political dominance.
*   **Single-Word/Short Fragment:** "British win," "Power of British," "Mir Jafar" (without context).

## Estimated Proportion Correct: 15-20%

**Reasoning:**

*   **Specific Historical Event:** Unlike broad social science questions, this is about a specific event and its *direct* outcome, making it more challenging to fudge or offer vague, yet plausible-sounding, generalities.
*   **Nuance of "Expansion of Power":** The rubric requires linking the victory to *political dominance/control over Bengal* through a *puppet nawab*. This is more nuanced than just "British won" or "British got powerful." Many students will stop at "British won" or "British gained power" without detailing *how* and *where*.
*   **Comparison to other Pass Rates:**
    *   The 29% average pass rate is a benchmark.
    *   The tribal communities question (9%) and the Ashoka's reign (12%) require broader explanations and are conceptually challenging.
    *   The lions on currency question (10%) is about cultural significance and symbolic meaning, which is often difficult to articulate specifically.
    *   The Battle of Plassey
