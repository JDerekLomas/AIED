Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Nature of the Question & Content (Geography - Factual Recall):**
    *   This is a relatively straightforward factual recall question from basic geography.
    *   Mountain ranges are typically introduced early in Social Science (Geography) textbooks in India.
    *   The "major" aspect implies well-known ranges, not obscure ones.

2.  **Misconceptions about Social Science:**
    *   **Focus on memorization:** Indian education, particularly at this level, often heavily relies on rote memorization. If they memorized but couldn't recall under pressure, or if they confused the names, that's a direct failure.
    *   **Difficulty with specificity:** While they might know *about* mountains, recalling specific *names* can be harder, especially if they haven't adequately internalized them.
    *   **Scope Confusion:** Some might name mountains *in general* rather than *mountain ranges* (e.g., Mount Everest, which is a peak, not a range, and also not entirely *in* India). While Everest is near India and well-known, it wouldn't be a "major range located in India."
    *   **Region Confusion:** They might name mountain ranges from other continents if their general knowledge of geography is weak, though less likely for such a basic question.

3.  **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   "Major mountain ranges located in India": The phrasing is clear. "Major" is simple, "mountain ranges" is standard terminology, and "located in India" specifically limits the scope.
    *   *Self-correction:* This seems unlikely to be a significant source of error compared to content knowledge. Even with limited English, these terms are often introduced in a geographical context and understood.

4.  **Attempt Rate vs. Empty Response:**
    *   Given the examples provided ("Empty Response" for "Explain how colonial rule...", "Why are lions...", "Explain the significance of Ashoka..."), these questions often require explanation, critical thinking, or recalling more nuanced information. The "empty response" rate is high for these.
    *   **For *this* question ("Name any two major mountain ranges...")**, it's a simple recall of names. Students are *more likely to attempt* it because they probably have *some* idea, even if it's incorrect. They might just write down whatever mountain names they remember.
    *   The rubric *only* requires one correct name for 0.5 points. This is very forgiving. Even getting one out of many common answers is enough to pass this specific scoring point.

5.  **What would the most common wrong answer look like?**
    *   **Single Correct Answer, Second Incorrect/Blank:** They name one range (e.g., "Himalayas") but then can't recall a second, or provide a wrong one (e.g., "Mount Everest," "Aravall"). This would still earn them 0.5 marks as per the rubric.
    *   **Empty Response (Less likely for this question):** Some might still leave it blank if they genuinely don't remember any names, or if they struggle with anxiety. However, given the simplicity, it should be lower than the explanation-based questions.
    *   **Confusing peaks for ranges:** "Mount Everest," "K2," "Kanchenjunga." (Though Kanchenjunga is a major peak in the Himalayas, it's not a *range* itself.)
    *   **Misspellings:** "Himalays," "Arravalli," "Vindyas." The rubric typically forgives reasonable misspellings.
    *   **Geographical Overlap/Ambiguity:** "Deccan Plateau" (a plateau, not a range). "Ganga River" (a river, not a range). These would indicate very weak geographical knowledge.
    *   **Foreign Ranges:** Very weak students might name famous ranges like "Andes," "Rockies," but this would be rare for "located in India."
    *   **Animal names, famous people names, or unrelated gibberish:** The wrong answers from the other questions ("Asher' stand," "ashok a second") indicate extreme disengagement or lack of understanding. This is less likely here, as the topic "mountains" provides a clearer frame of reference.

**Impact of Rubric:**
The rubric is extremely lenient: "Names one correct mountain range... Max score: 0.5". This significantly boosts the pass rate. A student only needs to remember *one* out of several well-known ranges. Himalayas is universally known, Aravalli is often mentioned, Western/Eastern Ghats for peninsular India, etc.
