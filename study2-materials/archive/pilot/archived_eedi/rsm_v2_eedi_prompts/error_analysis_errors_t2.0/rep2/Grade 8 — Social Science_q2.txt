Here's an analysis of the likely errors and an estimated pass rate for the given question:

**Likely Errors leading to incorrect answers:**

1.  **Misconception/Lack of Knowledge about Harappan Civilization:** This is the most significant hurdle.
    *   **Completely Unfamiliar:** Many students, especially if they haven't adequately covered this chapter, will have absolutely no idea about the Harappan Civilization. It might be a name they vaguely recognize or have never heard before.
    *   **Confusing with other Ancient Civilizations:** Less likely at this level for Harappan specifically, but generally possible. They might vaguely recall something from Egyptian or Mesopotamian civs if that's all they've learned about.
    *   **Focusing on Irrelevant Details:** If they have *some* knowledge, they might remember names like Mohenjo-Daro or Harappa, but not be able to articulate a "key feature of urban planning." They might remember artifacts or the Great Bath, but struggle to frame it as "urban planning."

2.  **Language Misunderstanding:**
    *   **"Key Feature":** While relatively straightforward, some might struggle to differentiate between *any* feature and a *key* feature related to "urban planning."
    *   **"Urban Planning":** This specific term might be a barrier. They might know about the cities but not frame their answer within the context of "planning." They might describe buildings rather than the *layout* or *system*.
    *   **English Comprehension:** Even if they know the facts in their local language, articulating it concisely and correctly in English (especially technical terms like "grid layout," "drainage system," "baked bricks," "citadel") can be a major challenge. They might have a fragmented understanding or incorrect vocabulary.

3.  **Attempt but Fail (Partial Knowledge/Poor Articulation):**
    *   Students with some exposure might try to recall details like "water system" or "straight roads" but fail to connect them properly or use the precise terminology expected for full credit. For instance, they might write "they had good water" instead of "advanced drainage system."
    *   They might recall "bricks" but not specify "baked bricks" or link it to durability in urban planning.

4.  **Not Attempting at all (Empty Response):** Given the low pass rates on other "Explain" and knowledge-based questions, "Empty Response" is a very high probability. If they have no idea, they'll leave it blank or write something completely irrelevant, which for all practical purposes is an "empty response" in terms of getting marks.

5.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   **"Empty Response":** As seen in other examples, this is extremely common.
    *   **Vague or Incorrect Generalizations:** "They had good cities," "They lived by the river," "They were developed."
    *   **Confabulations/Random Words:** Students who feel compelled to write something might jot down random words associated with history or just general terms. Similar to the "Asher' stand" or "Ashok seamb" type answers seen for other questions, indicating a complete disconnect from the question.
    *   **Focus on the "Great Bath":** If they know *anything*, the Great Bath is often the most striking feature they recall, but they might struggle to link it directly to "urban planning" (though one *could* argue its design is part of the planning, it's not usually the primary example for "layout" or "drainage system"). If they just mention "Great Bath," it might not be enough for full credit.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%) and Common Errors:**

The other examples are more analytical or involve specific recall of individuals/symbols. Harappan civilization is a significant chapter, but it relies on rote learning and understanding of specific features. The term "urban planning" might be slightly technical.

*   **Low English proficiency:** This is a huge barrier for correctly describing terms like "grid layout" or "advanced drainage system."
*   **Emphasis on rote memorization:** Many students might not grasp the *concept* of urban planning but might memorize a few facts about Harappa.
*   **Difficulty articulating:** Even if they know "good drainage," converting that into a score-worthy English sentence is hard.

Given the depth of knowledge required (knowing a *key feature* of *urban planning*), the need for relatively specific vocabulary in English, and the demonstrated pattern of "Empty Responses" and disconnected answers:

I believe this question would likely have a pass rate closer to the lower end of the spectrum, possibly even slightly below the average due to the specific, nuanced knowledge and English articulation required for "urban planning." The average pass rate being 29% for this group already implies that a
