Let's break down the potential errors for the question: "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"

**Analyzing Potential Errors:**

1.  **"Which line from the poem do you like the most..."**
    *   **Misconception about "Which line":** Students might misunderstand "line" as just any word or phrase from the poem, not necessarily a distinct textual line number/segment.
    *   **Misunderstanding "from the poem":** Some might attempt to make up a line or quote something that is generally "poem-like" but not actually from the given poem. This is less likely if the poem is provided directly with the question, but possible if they're relying on memory or general knowledge of a famous poem.
    *   **"Do you like":** This is a fairly common and understood phrase, but some might struggle with expressing "liking" in English beyond a simple "good."

2.  **"...and why?"**
    *   **Misconception about "why":** This is the biggest hurdle. Based on the previous error examples, explaining "why" in a coherent sentence or two is extremely challenging for these students.
        *   The "Describes the poet's writing style" question (4% pass rate) required explanation, and almost all failed.
        *   The "Write a theme or central idea" question (5% pass rate) also required an abstract explanation, and again, failure.
        *   The "My Favourite Hobby" question (10% pass rate) involved self-expression but still showed significant issues with forming connected sentences or elaborating.
    *   **Limited vocabulary for explanation:** Even if they understand "why," their ability to articulate a reason using appropriate vocabulary (e.g., "because it talks about...", "it makes me feel...", "it reminds me of...") will be severely constrained. They might just reiterate the line or say "it is good."
    *   **Grammar/Sentence structure:** Connecting the "line" with the "why" using conjunctions like "because" or "as" will be a significant grammatical challenge.

**Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**

*   **Attempt and fail:** Highly likely for the first part ("Which line..."). They will probably try to write *something*. They might even try for the "why" with a single, grammatically incorrect word or phrase.
*   **Not attempt at all (Empty Response):** Also likely for the "why" part, as seen in the theme/central idea questions. If they feel they cannot express the reason, they might leave it blank or only answer the first part.

**What would the most common wrong answer look like?**

Given the error patterns, here are likely wrong answers:

*   **Identifies a word/phrase but not a full line, and no "why":**
    *   "The poem is 'bargain'." (if "The Last Bargain" was the poem)
    *   "child."
*   **Identifies a line, but provides no "why" or a nonsensical "why":**
    *   "I like this line: 'I am reading.'" (quoting an instruction or random phrase)
    *   "The line is 'Come and play with me.' Because good."
    *   "The poem last bargain and a child." (repeating something from another question or showing general recall without specificity)
    *   "My favourite line is freedom. (Empty Response for why)"
    *   "My favorite line. (empty response for line and why)"
*   **Grammatically incorrect and insufficient "why":**
    *   "I like 'I work for no pay.' Because me happy."
    *   "The line is 'come and play'. I like."
*   **Complete misunderstanding, quoting instructions or unrelated info:**
    *   "Describe the poet's writing style." (repeating a previous question)
    *   "My favorite hobby." (confusing it with a prior task)

**Impact on Pass Rate:**

*   **Part 1 (Denotes a line):** This is achievable for a subset of students. They might randomly pick a line, or a short phrase they remember.
*   **Part 2 (Mentions why):** This is the critical stumbling block. The demand to explain, even simply, in grammatically sound English, is very high. Based on the 4-5% pass rates for explanation-heavy questions, the vast majority will fail here. Even if they get the line right, the "why" component will make them lose marks, potentially pushing them below the pass threshold.

The rubric requires *both* parts to score high. A single, incoherent word for "why"
