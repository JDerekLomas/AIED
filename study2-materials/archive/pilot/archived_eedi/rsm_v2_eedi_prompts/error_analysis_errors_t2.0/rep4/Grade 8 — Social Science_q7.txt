Here's an analysis of likely errors for the given question and an estimated pass rate:

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

1.  **Empty Response/Lack of Knowledge (Most Common):**
    *   **Misconception:** Many students from economically weaker sections, especially those in government schools with potentially less exposure to supplementary resources, might simply not have a detailed understanding of the Battle of Plassey's significance beyond perhaps knowing it was a battle. They may have rote-learned dates but not the *impact*.
    *   **Language:** While the question is straightforward English, the core issue here isn't necessarily language *comprehension* of the question itself, but rather the inability to recall and articulate the specific historical impact in English.
    *   **Attempt:** This would primarily manifest as no attempt or a completely blank answer.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "Empty Response" (as seen in other examples).

2.  **Confusing Plassey with Other Battles/Events (Factual Error):**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might vaguely recall British expansion or other battles but conflate them. They might mention other Company policies, economic exploitation, or the Mughal Empire's decline, without specifically linking it to Plassey's immediate political outcome.
    *   **Language:** They might pick up keywords like "British power," "India," "expansion" and attempt to connect it to any related historical fact they know.
    *   **Attempt:** They would attempt but get the specific contribution wrong.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "British rule in India." "They took over India." "It started their empire." (These are too general and don't address the specific mechanism of Plassey's contribution to political dominance/puppet rule). Or they might mention unrelated aspects of colonial rule.

3.  **Understanding "Contribute to Expansion" but not "How" (Lack of Depth):**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might know that Plassey was important for British power, but struggle to explain *how*. They might say "the British became powerful after Plassey" or "it helped them gain control," which is true but doesn't hit the specific nuance of the rubric (establishing political dominance/puppet rule in Bengal). The rubric specifically looks for the mechanism – the placement of a puppet ruler, political control over Bengal.
    *   **Language:** They understand the prompt's direction but lack the specific vocabulary or historical detail to articulate the "how."
    *   **Attempt:** They would attempt but fail to provide the required depth.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "The British won the battle and became powerful." "They defeated the Nawab."

4.  **Recalling Mir Jafar, but not linking to "expansion of power" (Partial Knowledge):**
    *   **Misconception:** Some might recall the name "Mir Jafar" but fail to connect him being made a *puppet* to the *expansion of British power* or political control. They might just state "Mir Jafar became the Nawab."
    *   **Language:** They have a key fact but miss the historical analysis connecting it to the question.
    *   **Attempt:** Attempt but fail to connect the dots sufficiently.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "Mir Jafar became the ruler."

**Impact of Previous Errors on this Question:**

The examples of common errors given for other questions (empty responses, very fragmented/nonsensical answers like "Ashok seamb") are highly relevant. This indicates a general difficulty with:

*   **Recalling specific historical facts and their implications.**
*   **Articulating complex social science concepts in structured English.**
*   **Going beyond rote memorization to explain cause-and-effect.**

The pass rates for those questions (9-12%) suggest a high prevalence of "Empty Response" or utterly irrelevant answers.

**Estimation for this question:**

The question asks for a specific "how," which requires more than just knowing *that* the Battle happened or that British power expanded. It demands understanding the *mechanism* (puppet ruler, control over Bengal).

Given the:
*   Average pass rate (29%).
*   Difficulty with similar Social Science explanation questions (9-12% pass rate on "Explain how colonial rule..." and "Significance of Ashoka").
*   Economic background and English proficiency limitations.
*   The likelihood of "Empty Response" or overly vague answers.

This question is harder than average, akin to the lower-pass-rate explanation questions because it requires specific causal reasoning and knowledge of *political mechanisms*, not just general outcomes. While the *term* "Battle of Plassey" might be known, its specific contribution as per the rubric is more challenging.

Therefore, the estimated pass rate would likely be closer to the lower
