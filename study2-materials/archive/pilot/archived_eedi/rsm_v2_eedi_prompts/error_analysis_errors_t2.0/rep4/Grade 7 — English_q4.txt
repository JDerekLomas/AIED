Let's break down the likely errors for the question: "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."

**Understanding the Students' Context:**

*   **Economically weaker sections, limited English:** This is crucial. Their exposure to English, particularly abstract reasoning and complex sentence structures, is low. Their vocabulary is basic.
*   **Average pass rate 29% for general English questions:** This suggests a significant struggle even with straightforward tasks.
*   **Common Errors (as provided):**
    *   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass):** High-level abstract thought and specialized vocabulary are near impossible for them. "I am reading" shows they recognize "describe" as a verb related to an action, but misinterpret its object and purpose. "Empty Response" suggests total inability to comprehend or formulate.
    *   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass):** Again, abstract concepts ("theme," "central idea") are extremely challenging. The attempt "The last bargin they about a child and labour. many people tried to force the la" shows some topic recognition but a complete breakdown in grammatical construction and coherent expression.
    *   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'." (10% pass):** This is *personal, concrete*, and yet still a low pass rate. Errors like "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho my fauourite food is noodles" demonstrate a struggle with paragraph structure, connecting ideas, and basic sentence formation beyond simple lists. "My hobby is cricket play" is a common grammatical error.

**Analyzing the Specific Question: "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."**

**1. Comprehension of "Do you think...?":**
    *   Students might understand "you" and "think," but struggle with the open-ended nature requiring a personal opinion. They are likely more comfortable with factual recall.
    *   **Misconception:** They might interpret it as "Do you know *the* answer to the king's questions?" instead of "Do you believe the *questions themselves* are relevant?"

**2. Comprehension of "king's questions":**
    *   They might recall "king" and "questions" from the passage.
    *   **Language misunderstanding:** They might remember *that* the king asked questions, but not necessarily *what* those questions were, or grasp the abstract nature of "the right time," "the right thing," "the right people." If they haven't deeply understood the original passage about the *content* of the king's questions, answering this question becomes impossible.

**3. Comprehension of "important in real life":**
    *   "Important" is a relatively common word, but "in real life" adds a layer of abstraction. Connecting fictional events to their own reality is a cognitive step that is difficult in a second language, especially when their "real life" might be vastly different from what they encounter in school texts.
    *   **Misconception:** They might confuse "important for the king" with "important in real life," or simply confirm the king's quest without elaborating on its broader relevance.

**4. Comprehension of "Give one reason":**
    *   This explicitly requires justification. Given their struggles with paragraph formation and explaining ideas (as seen in the "theme" and "hobby" questions), providing a coherent *reason* in English is a major hurdle.
    *   **Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?** Most will *attempt* something, even if it's a very simple affirmation. "Yes," or "Yes, because king is good." Complete blanks are less likely than for very complex questions (like "poet's writing style").
    *   **Most common wrong answer look like:**
        *   "Yes" (without a reason, or a very generic one like "king asked questions")
        *   "King is asking question so it is important." (circular reasoning, poor English)
        *   "Because it's about good things." (vague)
        *   "Yes, I think it is important because the king needs to know the time and things." (Recalling part of the passage without connecting it to "real life" importance.)
        *   Misinterpreting "real life" entirely: "Yes because in real life king is living."

**Likely Errors leading to incorrect answers:**

*   **Difficulty with Abstract Thought:** Connecting "the right time, thing, people" to *universal human importance* is abstract. Students struggle with abstract concepts ("theme," "style").
*   **Vocabulary/Sentence Structure:** While "important" and "reason"
