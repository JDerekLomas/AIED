Let's break down the potential performance on this question for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, keeping their background and common error patterns in mind.

**Analysis of the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Difficulty:** The question requires identifying two natural resources and explaining the influence of one.
*   **Knowledge Required:** Basic geography of Rajasthan, understanding of "natural resources," and cause-effect relationship between resources and human life.
*   **English Level:** "Mention any two natural resources" is relatively straightforward. "Explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there" is a bit more complex, requiring descriptive English.
*   **Rubric:** Flexible with various resources. The explanation only needs to be for *one* resource and demonstrates influence.

**Anticipated Errors and Their Drivers:**

1.  **Empty Response/No Attempt (Significant):**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a recurring dominant error as seen in the examples provided (9%, 12% for similar questions).
    *   **Possible causes:**
        *   Lack of specific knowledge about Rajasthan's resources.
        *   Overwhelmed by the "explain how...influences" part, leading them to give up entirely.
        *   General low confidence or lack of understanding of what "natural resources" means in this context.
        *   Time constraints in the exam.
        *   If the question comes later in the paper, fatigue or giving up on difficult-looking questions.
    *   **Likely Impact:** This will be a huge chunk of incorrect answers, as they often struggle with even basic recall in social science when explanation is involved.

2.  **Listing Resources Incorrectly/Only One Correct Resource:**
    *   **Reasoning:** Students might remember one resource (e.g., sand because Rajasthan is a desert) but struggle with a second.
    *   **Misconception:** Vague understanding of "natural resources" – some might list cities or man-made structures if their understanding is not firm.
    *   **Example Wrong Answer:** "Sand and Jaipur." (Jaipur is a city, not a natural resource).

3.  **Correct Resources but No Explanation/Insufficient Explanation:**
    *   **Reasoning:** The first part of the question (listing two resources) is easier. The "explain how...influences" part is more challenging both in terms of content and English expression.
    *   **Language Barrier:** Describing the *influence* requires a bit more advanced vocabulary and sentence structure than simply listing. Students might know that water is important, but struggle to articulate *how* it influences lives ("Water is there. People use it.").
    *   **Social Science Misconception:** Some students might just list uses without connecting it to "influence."
    *   **Example Wrong Answer:** "Water, Marble. Water is for drinking." (Too brief for 'explanation of influence').

4.  **Language Misinterpretation (Less Likely but Possible for "Influence"):**
    *   **Reasoning:** While "influences" is a common enough word, linking it conceptually might be tricky. However, the context generally clarifies it.
    *   **Example Wrong Answer (Less common):** Misunderstanding "influence" for something entirely different, but unlikely to be a major trend for this specific phrase.

5.  **Focusing on Non-Natural Resources:**
    *   **Reasoning:** Students might not fully grasp "natural resources" and list things like tourism, culture, or industries instead.
    *   **Misconception:** Confusing economic activities or cultural aspects with natural endowments.

**Estimation Strategy:**

Given the 29% average pass rate and the very low rates on "explain" questions (9-12% for tribal life, lions, Ashoka), this question, while seemingly simpler in its "list two" part, has a significant "explain" component.

*   **Baseline (due to "explain"):** Likely falls closer to the 10-15% range if we just consider the 'explain' aspect, as the reference errors suggest significant difficulty with detailed answers.
*   **"List Two" part:** This will be easier. Many students might get at least one correct resource, some might get two.
*   **Combine:**
    *   **A large chunk (30-40%) will give empty responses/not attempt**, aligning with common errors.
    *   **Another significant portion (30-40%) will attempt but fail or partially fail:**
        *   List 0 or 1 correct resource.
        *   List correct resources but fail to explain or give a very minimal, unacceptable explanation.
        *   List non-natural resources.
    *   **Therefore, the group that successfully identifies two resources AND provides a
