Let's break down the potential errors for Class 7 students in Indian government schools facing the active to passive voice transformation.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the context (economically weaker sections, limited English, low pass rates on other questions, common error types), here's what we can expect:

*   **Fundamental Lack of Understanding of "Voice":**
    *   **Misconception:** The concept of "active" and "passive" voice is likely abstract and poorly understood. They might simply not know what is being asked of them, even if they recognize some words in the prompt.
    *   **Result:** This will lead to many "Empty Responses" or attempts to change individual words without understanding the grammatical structure.

*   **Confusing Voice Change with Tense Change or Simple Sentence Rewording:**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might think they just need to write the sentence differently, perhaps by changing the tense, replacing a word with a synonym, or making it a question.
    *   **Example Wrong Answer:** "The wind will blow the leaves away." (Tense change)
    *   **Example Wrong Answer:** "Did the wind blow the leaves away?" (Question formation)
    *   **Example Wrong Answer:** "The air moved the leaves away." (Synonym substitution)

*   **Difficulty with Past Participle Form (blown):**
    *   **Misconception:** Irregular verbs, especially their past participle forms, are notoriously difficult. "Blew" is a past simple verb, and they need "blown" for the passive structure. This is a common point of failure even for more advanced learners.
    *   **Example Wrong Answer (attempting passive but failing participle):** "The leaves was blew away by the wind." / "The leaves were blew away by the wind."

*   **Subject-Object Confusion and Reversal:**
    *   **Misconception:** Identifying the original subject ("wind") and object ("leaves") and understanding that they need to swap roles in the passive voice will be challenging.
    *   **Example Wrong Answer (confusing roles):** "Away the wind blew the leaves." (Just reordering)

*   **Incorrect Use of "to be" verb and agreement:**
    *   **Misconception:** Knowing to use "was/were" and ensuring agreement with the new subject ("leaves" requires "were," not "was") will be a stumbling block.
    *   **Example Wrong Answer:** "The leaves was blown away by the wind." (Subject-verb agreement error)

*   **Omission of "by the wind":**
    *   **Misconception:** While "by the agent" is often optional in passive voice, students learning the transformation are usually taught to include it. Some might omit it, leading to a partially correct but not fully complete answer according to typical rubrics. However, many schools would still award points if the core transformation is there.
    *   **Example Wrong Answer:** "The leaves were blown away."

*   **Interference from Native Language Grammar:**
    *   **Misconception:** The concept of grammatical voice might not have a direct one-to-one equivalent or common usage pattern in their native language (e.g., Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, etc.), making the English construction feel unnatural and hard to grasp.

*   **Lack of Vocabulary/Spelling:**
    *   While not directly related to voice, general spelling errors could occur if they attempt the transformation. "Blown" could be misspelled as "bloon," "blowned," etc.

*   **Failure to Attempt (Empty Response):**
    *   Given the complexity of the grammar and the low pass rates on other questions, many students will simply not understand what is required and will leave the answer blank or provide a non-sensical response that functionally amounts to an "Empty Response." This is highly probable.

**Most Common Wrong Answer Types:**

1.  **Empty Response/Nonsensical Answer:** Similar to "I am reading" or the extensive "The last bargin..."
2.  **Tense Change/Simple Rewording:** "The wind will blow the leaves away." or "The wind moves the leaves away."
3.  **Partially Correct Attempt with Verb Error:** "The leaves were blew away by the wind." (Most common specific grammatical error).
4.  **Partially Correct Attempt with Subject-Verb Agreement Error:** "The leaves was blown away by the wind."

**Likelihood of Errors:**

*   **Not Attempting/Empty Response:** High. Many won't grasp the core instruction.
*   **Attempt but Fail (Grammar):** Very High. Even if they attempt, the multiple steps (identify S/O, swap, change verb form, use 'be',
