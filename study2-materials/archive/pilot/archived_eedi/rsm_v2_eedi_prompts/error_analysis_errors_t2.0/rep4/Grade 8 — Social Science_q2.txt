Here's an analysis of the likely errors and an estimated pass rate for the given question:

**Likely Errors leading to incorrect answers:**

1.  **"Empty Response" / Non-attempt (Very High Probability):**
    *   **Reason:** This is consistently the most common wrong answer type across other Social Science questions.
    *   **Misconceptions/Factors:**
        *   Lack of knowledge about the Harappan Civilization altogether.
        *   Feeling overwhelmed by the question and deciding not to try.
        *   Not recognizing the term "Harappan Civilization" or associating it with urban planning.
        *   Limited exposure to this specific historical period in their curriculum, or poor retention.
        *   Students from economically weaker sections might have less access to supplementary learning resources or less consistent schooling, impacting their factual recall.
    *   **Expected frequency:** Extremely high.

2.  **Generic or Vague Answers (High Probability):**
    *   **Reason:** Students might have heard of the Harappan civilization but lack the specific details for urban planning.
    *   **Misconceptions/Factors:**
        *   Confusing it with other ancient civilizations.
        *   Providing general positive adjectives like "very good," "advanced," "developed" without explaining *what* was good or advanced.
        *   Lack of vocabulary to articulate specific features.
        *   Limited understanding of "urban planning" itself – what constitutes a feature of it.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer Look:** "They had good cities." "Their planning was good." "They were smart people." "They lived in houses."

3.  **Language Misunderstandings (Moderate Probability):**
    *   **Reason:** While "key feature," "Harappan Civilization," and "urban planning" are relatively standard terms for Social Science in English, students with limited English proficiency might misinterpret them.
    *   **Misconceptions/Factors:**
        *   Misunderstanding "key feature" as just "something about Harappa."
        *   Not connecting "urban planning" with city layout, drainage, etc., but perhaps thinking about "farming" or "trade."
    *   **Common Wrong Answer Look:** Something about crops grown, or types of goods traded, or perhaps the decline of the civilization, showing they're discussing Harappa but not *urban planning*.

4.  **Recalling an Incorrect Feature / Confusion with other civilizations (Moderate Probability):**
    *   **Reason:** They might remember a fact but not apply it correctly to urban planning or might misattribute a feature from another historical period or region to Harappa.
    *   **Misconceptions/Factors:**
        *   Recalling facts about the *Indus Valley Civilization* but not specifically "urban planning" features.
        *   Mixing up details with Vedic period or early empires.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer Look:** "They had temples for worship." (While Harappans did have beliefs, monumental temples like later civilizations are not a key feature of their urban planning in the same way). "They had a strong king."

5.  **Partial/Incomplete Answers (Low Probability - closer to getting it right):**
    *   **Reason:** Students might be on the right track but unable to articulate it fully.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer Look:** "They built roads." (Doesn't quite capture "grid layout"). "They had drains." (Missing "advanced" or "covered" to make it a distinct *key feature* rather than just *any* drain).

**Comparison with Other Questions:**

*   This question is more fact-based and less abstract than "Explain how colonial rule...". This *might* slightly increase the chance of recall if the student has studied it well.
*   It's similar in structure to "Why are lions shown..." which is also a direct recall/reasoning question.
*   The concepts "Harappan Civilization" and "urban planning" are central to introductory history curricula, but "key feature" still requires specific factual recall, not just general knowledge.

**The most common wrong answer will very likely be "Empty Response" or something incredibly vague/irrelevant due to lack of specific knowledge.**

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 15%**

**Reasoning for 15%:**

1.  **Baseline Pass Rate:** The average pass rate is 29%, but these *Social Science* questions often perform much worse (9-12% examples). This indicates significant difficulty with specific recall and articulation in this subject for this demographic.
2.  **Factual Recall Demand:** This question requires recalling a very specific piece of information (a key feature of Harappan urban planning). Unlike an opinion or an analysis question, you either know a feature like the grid pattern or
