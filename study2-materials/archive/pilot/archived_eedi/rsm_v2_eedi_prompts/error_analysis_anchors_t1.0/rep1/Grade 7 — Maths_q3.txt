The student population is Class 7 in Indian government schools, mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English. The average pass rate on this exam is about 29%.

Let's break down the likely errors for the question: "Find the area of a triangle whose base is `8` cm and height is `6` cm."

**1. Misconceptions about Mathematics:**
    *   **Forgetting the 1/2:** This is the most common error in area of triangle calculations. Students might simply multiply base × height (8 × 6 = 48).
    *   **Incorrect Formula:** Some might use the perimeter formula, or a formula for the area of a rectangle/square (though less likely for a specific "triangle" question if they understand what a triangle is).
    *   **Calculation Error:** Even if they remember the formula, 1/2 * 8 * 6 = 24, they might make a simple multiplication error (e.g., 8 * 6 = 42, then 1/2 * 42 = 21, or 1/2 * 8 * 6 = 16 or 32 due to poor mental math).
    *   **Ignoring Units:** While the rubric asks to "state or use the correct formula," the final answer often implicitly requires the correct calculation. Not including units (cm²) might be an issue in some rubrics, but this one focuses on the formula itself. However, incorrect calculation would lead to not getting full marks.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Area":** While a fundamental term, students with very limited English might not immediately recognize "area" or confuse it with "perimeter." However, given it's a math class, "area" is usually taught with the concept.
    *   **"Base" and "Height":** These terms are fairly standard in geometry. If they've been taught the topic in their local language, they might still recognize the mathematical concept even if their English is weak.
    *   **"Triangle":** A very common shape; this is unlikely to be a major barrier.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   This is a direct computation question with clear numbers. It's highly likely most students would attempt it, even if they guess or apply an incorrect formula.
    *   An "Empty Response" is less likely compared to conceptual questions or writing tasks.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   `48` (base × height)
    *   `28` (8 + 6 + something, perimeter type thinking)
    *   `14` (8 + 6)
    *   `24` (Correct answer, but could be a correct guess if they just happened to divide by 2 after multiplying base and height, without knowing the formula).

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and good English writing. This math problem is much more concrete.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires recall of definitions, critical thinking to differentiate, and English writing. This is harder than the math problem.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires personal expression, vocabulary, sentence structure, and sustained writing. Many students struggle with the writing length and quality.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Requires recall of specific plot details from a story, which can be challenging, but it's a direct factual recall. It's simpler than the paragraph, but still relies on memory and comprehension of a text.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is direct recall of facts taught in Civics. If they know the two facts, it's an easy win. It's often taught in local languages and then translated.

**Analysis for the Math Problem:**

The question is a basic application of a fundamental geometric formula.
*   Students *will* have been taught the area of a triangle formula in Class 7. It's a core topic.
*   The numbers are simple (8 and 6). The multiplication (8x6=48) is easy, and then dividing by 2 (24) is also simple.
*   The primary challenge is remembering the `1/2` factor.
*   Compared to the other anchors, this problem is less reliant on nuanced English comprehension or complex abstract thought. It's a direct application.
*   The "states or uses the correct formula" rubric is quite lenient. Even if they write `1/2 * 8 * 6` without
