I'll break down the thought process for estimating the pass rate for the given question.

**1. Analyze the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question:** "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."
*   **Key components:**
    *   Two *natural resources*
    *   Found in *Rajasthan*
    *   *Explain influence* of *one* of them on *lives of people*.
*   **Rubric:** Mentions two correct natural resources. Max score: 1.
*   **Crucial Insight from Rubric:** The rubric states "Max score: 1" and only mentions "Mentions two correct natural resources." This means *the explanation part is not required to get the point*. This is a *huge* simplification and will significantly increase the pass rate compared to if the explanation was required. Students just need to list two.

**2. Consider the Target Audience (Class 6, Indian Government Schools, Economically Weaker Sections, Limited English, 29% average pass rate):**

*   **Social Science Knowledge (Rajasthan):**
    *   Rajasthan is a prominent Indian state. Students at this level *should* have some basic geographical/resource knowledge about major states.
    *   Commonly known resources: Water (especially its scarcity), Sand/Desert (though sand isn't typically listed as a *resource* in the same way as minerals, it's a key geographical feature that might lead to "sand" as an answer), Minerals (marble, copper are well-known, even if specific names aren't). Solar energy/sunlight is also a strong candidate.
*   **Language (English):**
    *   "Natural resources" is a standard term taught in Social Studies. Students should recognize it.
    *   "Found in Rajasthan" is straightforward.
    *   "Explain how one of them influences the lives of the people" – This part is the most complex linguistically, but thankfully, *it's not required for the point*.
*   **Motivation/Attempt Rate:** Given the simplicity of just listing two things, many students will attempt.
*   **Common Errors / Misconceptions (if the explanation *were* needed):**
    *   Difficulty explaining the *influence* concisely or clearly in English.
    *   Explaining *what* the resource is, rather than *how it influences lives*.
    *   Generic explanations not specific to Rajasthan.
*   **Common Errors / Misconceptions (for just listing resources):**
    *   Listing things that aren't natural resources (e.g., "forts," "tourism").
    *   Listing resources not found in Rajasthan (less likely for common ones).
    *   Listing only one resource.
    *   Spelling errors might make a correct answer unrecognizable, but often some leniency is given for phonetic spelling.

**3. Calibrate with Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5%:** Theme of a poem. Requires abstract thought, interpretation, and expression. Very difficult.
*   **Pass rate 15%:** Differentiating archaeological vs. literary sources. Requires conceptual understanding, comparison, and specific examples. More direct recall but still involves understanding.
*   **Pass rate 30%:** Short paragraph on "My favorite season." Open-ended writing, but personal experience. The example response shows very poor English and structure, yet still scores max (3/3), indicating a very lenient rubric for content over English quality. This is a good anchor for *simple recall/personal expression*.
*   **Pass rate 50%:** Three questions the king wanted to answer. Direct recall of specific details from a story. This is *very close* to the current question in terms of requiring specific factual recall. The correct answers are short phrases.
*   **Pass rate 66%:** Two Fundamental Rights. Direct recall of two specific items from a list. This is *highly analogous* to the current question (listing two resources). The examples show good English isn't necessary, just the correct items.

**4. Initial Estimate & Refinement:**

*   **Comparing to 50% anchor ("Three questions the king wanted to answer"):** This question requires recalling *three specific phrases*.
*   **Comparing to 66% anchor ("Two Fundamental Rights"):** This question requires recalling *two specific named rights*. This is the *closest match* in terms of cognitive demand and output format.

    The current question ("Two natural resources in Rajasthan") is very similar:
    *   It requires recalling *two specific named resources*.
    *   The pool of correct answers is somewhat broader than Fundamental Rights (e.g., water, various minerals, solar/wind). This might make it *
