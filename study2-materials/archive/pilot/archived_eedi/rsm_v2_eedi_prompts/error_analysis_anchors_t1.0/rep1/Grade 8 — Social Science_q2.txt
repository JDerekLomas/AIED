Let's break down the potential student responses and estimate the pass rate for the question: "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

**Analysis of the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Key Concepts:** Harappan Civilization, urban planning, key features (grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town).
*   **Difficulty:** This is a factual recall question from Social Science (History). It requires understanding a specific historical concept and being able to articulate it.
*   **Max Score:** 1, meaning even a partially correct or simply stated feature will likely score.

**Likely Errors and Student Behavior:**

1.  **Lack of Knowledge (Most Common):**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might not have studied the Harappan Civilization in detail, or they might confuse it with other ancient civilizations. They might not remember specific features of its urban planning.
    *   **Response:** Empty response, "I don't know," or a completely irrelevant answer about a different topic or civilization.
    *   **Likely Impact:** High percentage of students.

2.  **Partial Knowledge/Vague Recollection:**
    *   **Misconception:** They remember "Harappan" and "city" but can't recall specific features. They might offer general statements about cities.
    *   **Response:** "They built cities." "They had houses." "They were good at building." (These would likely score 0 as they don't describe a *key feature* of *urban planning*).
    *   **Likely Impact:** Moderate percentage.

3.  **Language Misunderstanding (Less likely to be the *primary* issue here, but still a factor):**
    *   **Misconception:** "Urban planning" might be a slightly complex term for some. They might understand "city" but not the "planning" aspect as much. However, "describe one key feature" is fairly direct.
    *   **Response:** Might describe something *in* the city but not related to its *planning* (e.g., "They had pots.").
    *   **Likely Impact:** Low to moderate.

4.  **Incorrect Specifics/Confusion:**
    *   **Misconception:** They might remember a feature but misattribute it or describe it incorrectly (e.g., "They had circular roads" instead of a grid). Or confuse it with another civilization's features.
    *   **Response:** "They had pyramids." (If confusing with Egypt). "They had a strong wall around the city but not planned inside."
    *   **Likely Impact:** Moderate.

5.  **Attempt but Fail to Meet Rubric:**
    *   Students might attempt to answer but their description is too vague or doesn't hit a "key feature." For example, "They built strong houses." (While true, it's not a *key feature of urban planning* like the grid or drainage).
    *   **Likely Impact:** Moderate.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking and interpretation. Much harder. Our question is factual recall.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires understanding two distinct concepts and providing examples. Similar to our question in requiring specific historical knowledge, but ours asks for only *one* feature.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on favorite season):** Open-ended, creative writing. Requires sustained writing and personal expression. Our question is much more constrained and factual. The low pass rate here suggests difficulty with sustained writing and expressing thoughts clearly in English.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Direct recall of a specific plot point from a story. This is the closest in nature. It requires remembering specific details. Students who recall *one* of the three questions likely scored.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Direct factual recall, commonly taught. Requires remembering specific terms. Our question is similar.

**Estimation Rationale:**

The question about Harappan Civilization's urban planning is factual recall, similar to the "King's questions" (50%) and "Fundamental Rights" (66%). However, "Harappan Civilization" might be covered with slightly less emphasis than Fundamental Rights (which are very civics-focused and contemporary). Also, while the king's questions are from a story that might be engaging, Harappan planning is a dry historical fact.

Given the average pass rate of 29% and the "mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English," there's a strong likelihood of:
*   Many empty responses due to lack of knowledge.
*
