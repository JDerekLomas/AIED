I will analyze the question and the provided calibration anchors to estimate the pass rate for Class 6 students in Indian government schools.

**Question Analysis:**

*   **Core Concept:** Time calculation, multiplication, and addition.
*   **Numbers:** `10` am, `30^0 C`, `2^0 C` per hour, `4:00` pm.
*   **Keywords:** "increases by," "per hour," "temperature at."
*   **Units:** hours, degrees Celsius.
*   **Key Challenge:** Calculating the elapsed time from 10 am to 4 pm. This involves crossing the "noon" boundary and understanding that "4:00 in the evening" is 4 pm, not 16:00 in 24-hour format (though the calculation is simpler in 12-hour format).

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Time Calculation Errors (Most Significant):**
    *   **Direct Subtraction:** Students might try to subtract 10 from 4, getting a negative number or struggling with the concept.
    *   **Ignoring AM/PM:** Students might not understand the difference between 10 am and 4 pm, potentially thinking it's just 6 hours (which it is, but the calculation isn't trivial for this age group) or miscounting.
    *   **Counting on Fingers Incorrectly:**
        *   10 am to 11 am (1 hr)
        *   11 am to 12 pm (2 hr)
        *   12 pm to 1 pm (3 hr)
        *   1 pm to 2 pm (4 hr)
        *   2 pm to 3 pm (5 hr)
        *   3 pm to 4 pm (6 hr) - This is the correct way, but requires careful counting. Some might miss a step.
    *   **Confusing 12 pm with 1 pm:** Some might think 10 am to 1 pm is 3 hours instead of 10 am to 12 pm (2 hours) + 1 hour.
    *   **Mistaking 4:00 pm for 4 hours past 10 am (i.e., 2 pm):** This would be a major misinterpretation of "4:00 in the evening."

2.  **Arithmetic Errors:**
    *   **Multiplication (6 * 2):** While 6 * 2 = 12 is relatively simple, errors can occur, especially if students are stressed.
    *   **Addition (30 + 12):** Adding 30 + 12 = 42 is also simple but prone to minor mistakes.

3.  **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"increases by":** Could be misunderstood as subtraction or just stating the increase.
    *   **"per hour":** Might be overlooked or misapplied.
    *   **"10 am" vs. "4:00 in the evening":** This is where the time calculation challenge lies. The phrasing is common but requires careful interpretation.

4.  **Attempt Rate:**
    *   Students are likely to attempt this question as it involves numbers and a real-world scenario. The difficulty lies in getting the *correct* answer. Many might get a wrong answer due to time calculation.

5.  **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   **Based on 4 hours elapsed (10 am to 2 pm, or 10 am to 4 am if they ignore pm):** 30 + (4 * 2) = 38.
    *   **Based on 5 hours elapsed (e.g., miscounting):** 30 + (5 * 2) = 40.
    *   **Based on 7 hours elapsed (e.g., counting 10 am as hour 1):** 30 + (7 * 2) = 44.
    *   **Only calculating the increase, not adding to the initial temperature:** 12 degrees.
    *   **Only stating the time difference:** 6 hours.
    *   **Subtracting instead of adding:** 30 - 12 = 18.

**Calibration Against Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Very difficult, requires abstract thinking, inferencing, and good English expression. This question is much more concrete.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires conceptual understanding, comparison, and examples. More demanding than a direct math problem.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Paragraph on
