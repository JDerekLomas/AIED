I will analyze the question and the calibration anchors to estimate the pass rate for the given question.

**Analysis of the Target Question:**
"Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away."

*   **Core Concept:** Active to Passive Voice transformation. This involves understanding subject-object roles, verb tenses, and the use of "to be" verbs and past participles.
*   **Verb Tense:** Simple Past ("blew"). The passive form will require "were blown."
*   **Vocabulary:** "wind," "blew," "leaves," "away." All are common, simple words.
*   **Sentence Structure:** Simple SVO structure.
*   **Difficulty for ESL/EAL learners:**
    *   The grammatical concept of active/passive voice can be challenging, especially for students whose native languages do not have a direct equivalent or use different structures.
    *   Forming the past participle of irregular verbs (blow -> blown) can be a hurdle.
    *   Correctly choosing the "to be" verb (was/were) based on the new subject's number ("leaves" is plural, so "were").
    *   The phrase "by the wind" might be omitted or misplaced.
    *   Understanding "away" as part of the verb phrase (blew away) could be an issue, though less likely to cause a complete failure.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Incorrect Past Participle:** Students might use "blowed" or simply "blew" again. (e.g., "The leaves were blew away by the wind.")
2.  **Incorrect "to be" verb:** Using "was" instead of "were" (e.g., "The leaves was blown away by the wind.") or incorrect tense (e.g., "The leaves are blown away...").
3.  **Subject-Object Confusion:** Simply reversing the words without changing the verb form (e.g., "The leaves blew the wind away.") or adding unnecessary words.
4.  **Omitting "by the wind":** While grammatically acceptable in some contexts, for a direct transformation exercise, its omission might indicate incomplete understanding. However, the rubric implies "by the wind" is part of the correct answer, so its absence would likely lead to a zero.
5.  **Not attempting/random words:** As seen in other items, some students might not understand the instruction or the concept at all and either leave it blank or write unrelated words.
6.  **Direct translation issues:** Trying to translate their native language's passive construction directly, which might not map perfectly to English.
7.  **Over-complication:** Adding extra words or trying to make it more complex than necessary.

**Calibration Anchor Analysis:**

*   **Pass rate 5% - Theme of poem:** Requires deep comprehension and abstract thinking, often difficult for students with limited language skills. Many struggle with expressing abstract ideas.
*   **Pass rate 15% - Differentiate archaeological/literary sources:** Requires specific knowledge and the ability to articulate differences with examples. Some understanding, but often incomplete or confused.
*   **Pass rate 30% - "My favorite season" paragraph:** Requires creative writing, basic sentence construction, and adherence to a structure. Many provide very short, list-like responses or struggle with coherence. This is a productive task, similar to the target question in requiring sentence construction.
*   **Pass rate 50% - Three questions the king wanted to answer:** This is a recall question from a specific text. It's about remembering facts, not applying complex grammar. If they read the story, they should know. This is a lower-order thinking skill.
*   **Pass rate 66% - Name two Fundamental Rights:** Another recall question from civics. If taught and memorized, it's easy. Many can recall facts.

**Connecting to the Target Question:**

The target question is a *grammatical transformation* task. It's more complex than simple recall (50-66% items) but less abstract than writing a theme (5%) or differentiating sources (15%). It's somewhat comparable to the "My favorite season" (30%) item in that it requires productive language use and adherence to a rule, but it's a *specific grammatical rule* rather than creative expression.

*   The average pass rate is 29%, which is close to the "My favorite season" item.
*   The "My favorite season" item, despite being a paragraph, had a 30% pass rate. Many responses were very basic, short, and grammatically flawed but still scored points.
*   The active/passive voice transformation is a specific, rule-bound task. There's
