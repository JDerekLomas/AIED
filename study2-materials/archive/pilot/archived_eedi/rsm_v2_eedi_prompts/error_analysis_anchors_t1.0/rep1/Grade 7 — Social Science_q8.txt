Here's an analysis of the question and likely errors, followed by an estimated pass rate:

## Analysis of Likely Errors for "What are the main occupations of people in the rural areas of Rajasthan? Describe any one in brief."

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science/General Knowledge:**

*   **Lack of Specific Regional Knowledge:** Many students, even within India, might not have specific knowledge about the dominant occupations *in Rajasthan*. While they might know about farming generally, connecting it specifically to Rajasthan's rural areas might be a stretch if they haven't covered regional geography/economy well. Rajasthan is also known for its desert landscape, so some might incorrectly assume *only* desert-related occupations.
*   **Limited Exposure to "Occupation" beyond Farming:** While farming is primary, students might struggle to name a second major occupation like animal husbandry or handicrafts, which might not be explicitly taught as "occupations" in their curriculum or are less prominent in their immediate surroundings.
*   **Focus on Tourism/Culture (Incorrectly):** Rajasthan is famous for its tourism and culture. Some students might incorrectly list occupations related to these (e.g., tour guides, folk dancers) which, while present, are not the *main* occupations for the *majority* of people in *rural* areas.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Main occupations":** Students might understand "occupation" but struggle with "main," leading them to list any occupation they know rather than the predominant ones.
*   **"Rural areas of Rajasthan":** The full phrase might be too complex. "Rural" might be clear, but "Rajasthan" might be the stumbling block if they don't associate specific economic activities with the state.
*   **"Describe any one in brief":** This part requires a small explanatory sentence or two. Students with limited English proficiency might struggle to formulate even a brief description, even if they know the occupation. They might just list without describing.

**3. Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**

*   **Attempt but Fail:** Many students will likely attempt this question. "Occupations" is a common theme, and they will probably default to "farming" or "agriculture" as a known rural occupation. The difficulty will arise in naming a second, and especially in providing a brief description in English.
*   **Partial Credit:** Students might correctly name one occupation (e.g., agriculture) but fail to name a second, or fail to describe one in brief. The rubric here is quite lenient (Max score 1), implying naming at least two *or* one described correctly might count for partial credit if the system allows. However, the calibration items suggest full credit for a relatively basic correct answer. Assuming the rubric is strict and requires *at least two* and *description*, this makes it harder. If "at least two" is the *only* criterion for 1 mark, it becomes easier. Given the max score of 1, it's likely that naming *two* is the key.

**4. Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **Only "Agriculture" / "Farming":** This will be the most common partial answer.
*   **Generic Rural Occupations (not specific to Rajasthan):** e.g., "laborer," "teacher" (while present, not the *main* distinguishing occupations).
*   **Tourism-related Occupations:** As mentioned, some might incorrectly focus on tourism.
*   **Incorrect / Vague Second Occupation:** Students might just guess or list something very general.
*   **No Description / Incoherent Description:** Even if they name correctly, the description part might be missing or unintelligible due to language barriers.
*   **Listing occupations from their *own* region:** If their region has different primary occupations, they might answer based on local knowledge.

## Comparison to Calibration Anchors:

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking and expressive English. Much harder than this question.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** Requires specific terminology, comparison, and examples. More complex than this.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires coherent paragraph writing with specific details. While it's about personal experience, the length and coherence requirement are challenging. This question asks for factual recall and a brief description.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is direct recall from a story they likely studied. If they remembered the story, it's easy. This question is also direct recall, but of general knowledge/social science.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is direct recall of specific, well-taught constitutional facts. It's often drilled in civics. The language
