Here's an analysis of the likely errors and an estimated pass rate:

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

*   **Misconceptions about English/Grammar (Active/Passive Voice):**
    *   **Lack of understanding of "Voice" itself:** Many students, especially at this level, might not explicitly know what "active" and "passive" voice mean, even if they've been taught it. It's an abstract grammatical concept.
    *   **Incorrect auxiliary verb:** The most common error would be using the wrong form of "to be" (e.g., "The leaves *are* blown away," "The leaves *was* blown away"). Agreement with the plural subject "leaves" might be an issue, leading to "was" instead of "were."
    *   **Incorrect past participle:** While "blown" is relatively common, some might default to "blowed" (non-standard past tense) or struggle to recall the correct past participle for irregular verbs.
    *   **Omitting "by the wind":** Students might correctly change the subject and verb but forget or struggle with reintroducing the original agent using "by."
    *   **Retaining the original subject as subject:** Some might simply rearrange words without understanding the underlying grammatical shift, e.g., "The wind was blowing the leaves away." (still active, just different tense) or "The wind was blown the leaves away."
    *   **Overcomplication/Incorrect structure:** Trying to make it passive but inserting extra, unnecessary words or creating an ungrammatical structure.
    *   **Focus on meaning, not form:** Students might prioritize maintaining the original meaning over strictly adhering to the grammatical transformation required.

*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Blew" and "leaves" are relatively common words for this age group, so direct vocabulary misunderstanding is less likely to be the primary barrier than the grammatical transformation. "Away" is also simple.
    *   **Instruction comprehension:** The instruction "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice" is quite specific. Students who haven't encountered this terminology or understand it well will be at a severe disadvantage. This is a common hurdle in English grammar questions in Indian government schools, where rote learning of definitions might happen, but practical application is harder.

*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   Many students will attempt it because it's a short, direct question. However, the quality of attempts will vary wildly.
    *   Students who don't know the rule at all might try a random rearrangement or not answer.
    *   Given the average pass rate of 29% and the abstract nature of this grammar rule, a significant portion will attempt but fail.

*   **Most Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   "The leaves was blown away by the wind." (Incorrect auxiliary verb)
    *   "The leaves are blown away by the wind." (Incorrect auxiliary verb/tense)
    *   "The leaves blowed away by the wind." (Incorrect past participle)
    *   "The leaves were blown away." (Missing "by the wind," though partially correct)
    *   "The wind was blowing the leaves away." (Attempted change, but still active)
    *   Completely garbled or nonsensical rearrangements.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain."** This requires higher-order thinking, inference, and articulation, which is very difficult. Our question is a grammar transformation, much more direct.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate archaeological/literary sources.** This requires factual knowledge and comparison, with examples. It's concrete but requires specific content knowledge. Our question is a rule application.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Paragraph on "My favorite season."** This is a creative writing task that allows for a wide range of answers and partial credit for basic sentences. Many can write *something*, even if simple. Our question has a single correct answer.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is direct recall from a story. If they read/remembered the story, it's easy. It tests comprehension and memory. Our question tests a grammatical rule.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Two Fundamental Rights.** This is direct recall of specific, often-taught facts. High pass rate suggests many have memorized these.

**Reasoning for Estimate:**

The question involves applying a specific, somewhat abstract grammatical rule (active to passive voice). While the base sentence is simple, the transformation requires knowledge of:
1.  Identifying subject/object.
2.  Switching them.
