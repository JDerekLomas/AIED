Here's an analysis of likely errors and the estimated pass rate for the 'My Favourite Hobby' question:

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

*   **Difficulty with Paragraph Structure (Common):**
    *   **Lack of flow/cohesion:** Students might list sentences rather than connecting them into a coherent paragraph.
    *   **Too short/incomplete:** Similar to the "My favorite season" example (pass rate 30%) where responses were very fragmented ("Winter\nSweater\nBaju"), students might provide only one or two very short, disconnected sentences.
    *   **Not addressing all prompts:** They might state the hobby but neglect when or why they do it, or provide very minimal answers for these components.
*   **Vocabulary and Sentence Construction (Very Common):**
    *   **Limited vocabulary:** Difficulty finding appropriate words to describe their hobby or express *why* they enjoy it beyond simple statements like "it is good."
    *   **Grammatical errors:** Subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, prepositions, articles (a/an/the) are common pitfalls.
    *   **Simple sentence structures:** Reliance on very basic SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) sentences without much variation or complexity.
    *   **Spelling mistakes:** Expect numerous spelling errors, though the rubric focuses on content and paragraph structure.
*   **Misunderstanding "Hobby" (Less Common but Possible):**
    *   While "hobby" is a fairly common word, some students might interpret it broadly or struggle to identify a specific leisure activity. However, given the nature of the prompt, most would likely think of a popular activity like playing cricket, drawing, reading, etc.
*   **Direct Translation/Mother Tongue Influence:**
    *   Students might directly translate thoughts from their native language into English, leading to awkward phrasing and grammatical structures.
*   **Attempt vs. Failure:**
    *   Most students will likely *attempt* this question because it's a personal topic and seems relatively straightforward.
    *   However, a significant portion will *fail* to meet the "complete paragraph" and "clearly mentions... when... why" aspects of the rubric due to the linguistic and structural challenges mentioned above.
    *   Unlike more abstract questions (like the "The Last Bargain" theme, 5% pass rate), this topic is concrete and relatable, encouraging an attempt.
    *   Unlike factual recall (like Fundamental Rights, 66% pass rate), this requires creative construction, which is harder.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"My favorite season" (Pass Rate 30%):** This is the closest anchor. That question asked for 6-8 lines and had similar "what you like to do, eat/wear" prompts. The responses showed significant difficulty in forming coherent paragraphs, often devolving into lists or extremely short, fragmented sentences. The "My Favourite Hobby" question asks for 4-5 sentences, making it slightly less demanding in length, but still requires paragraph cohesion.
*   **"Three questions the king wanted to answer" (Pass Rate 50%):** This involved recalling specific information from a story and writing it down. It didn't require as much original sentence construction or paragraph development.
*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources" (Pass Rate 15%):** This required specific factual knowledge and comparison, which is a different skill.

**Likely Common Wrong Answers:**

*   "My hobby is playing cricket. I play everyday. I like it." (Too short, lacks detail on *why* enjoyed beyond "I like it", barely a paragraph)
*   "I like to draw. I draw in the evening. Drawing makes me happy." (Similar to above, very simplistic, barely meets the paragraph criteria)
*   "My favorite hobby is reading. I read stories. I read when I finish homework. I enjoy reading because it gives me knowledge and new ideas. It is good." (Closer, but might still have grammatical issues or lack sophisticated expression for "why").
*   A list of sentences rather than a connected paragraph.
*   Focusing only on the hobby and not addressing when or why sufficiently.

Given the significant challenges observed in the "My favorite season" anchor (30% pass rate) despite a similar, relatable topic, and the slightly reduced length requirement (4-5 vs 6-8 lines), but still demanding a *complete paragraph* with *clear mentions* of all parts, students will struggle with the structural and expressive demands. The average pass rate is 29%, and this question feels slightly easier than the theme of a poem (5%) but harder than recalling specific facts (50%, 66%). It is comparable to "My favorite season" in difficulty for paragraph construction, perhaps a touch easier due
