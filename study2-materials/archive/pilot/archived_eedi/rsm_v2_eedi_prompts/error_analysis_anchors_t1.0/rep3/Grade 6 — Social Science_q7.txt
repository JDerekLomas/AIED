I'll break down the thought process for estimating the pass rate for the given question.

**1. Analyze the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question:** "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."
*   **Key components:**
    *   Two natural resources (found in Rajasthan).
    *   Explanation of influence for *one* of them.
*   **Rubric:** Mentions two correct natural resources (many examples provided). Max score: 1.
    *   This is crucial: Even if they struggle with the explanation, *just naming two* could potentially get them a point, depending on the exact marking scheme (though the phrasing "Max score: 1" often implies that the explanation is necessary for a full point, or that simply listing *two* resources *is* enough for the 1 point). Given the simplicity of other "score 1" questions, I'll lean towards simply naming two *correct* resources being sufficient for a pass, or at least a significant part of it. If the explanation *wasn't* required, this would be a much higher pass rate. Let's assume for now that *both* parts are needed for a "correct" answer, but that a partial answer (like just naming two) might get some credit in practice. However, the rubric *only* lists naming two, which is confusing. Let's assume "Max score: 1" means *any* correct part gets a point. This makes it easier.

**2. Consider the Target Audience (Class 6, Indian Government Schools, EWS, Limited English, 29% average pass rate):**

*   **Class 6:** Basic understanding of geography and resources. They would have covered this in EVS (Environmental Studies) or early Social Science.
*   **EWS:** May have less exposure to diverse information, but practical knowledge of their local environment might be strong.
*   **Limited English:** This is a major barrier. Even if they know the answer in Hindi/local language, translating it accurately into English can be challenging.
*   **29% Average Pass Rate:** This is the baseline. Questions significantly harder than average will be lower, significantly easier will be higher.

**3. Brainstorm Likely Errors and Challenges:**

*   **Content Knowledge (Social Science Misconceptions):**
    *   **Knowing what "natural resources" are:** Most students should grasp this concept at a basic level (things from nature that we use).
    *   **Knowing specific resources in Rajasthan:** This is the core challenge.
        *   **Common knowledge:** Desert, camels, heat, maybe some crops (though not "natural resources" in the raw sense). Water scarcity is *very* prominent. Marble is famous. Salt. Copper/Zinc mines.
        *   **Less common:** Gypsum, mica, limestone, solar/wind energy (as "resources").
        *   **Generalizing:** Some might just list *any* natural resources (trees, rivers, etc.) without specifically linking them to Rajasthan, even if Rajasthan has them.
    *   **Explaining influence:** This requires a cause-and-effect understanding.
        *   "Water scarcity makes life hard." (Good)
        *   "Marble is used for building." (Good)
        *   "Solar energy produces electricity." (Good)
        *   Some might struggle to articulate *how* the resource influences lives beyond just its presence.

*   **Language Misunderstandings/Errors (English Barrier):**
    *   **"Natural resources":** May understand "natural" and "things we use," but might not recognize the specific English term.
    *   **"Rajasthan":** They will know this name.
    *   **"Explain how one of them influences":** This is where English really bites. "Influences" is a more abstract verb. They might know *what* happens but struggle with the phrasing.
    *   **Spelling:** Even if they know "marble" or "salt," spelling it correctly can be an issue.
    *   **Sentence construction:** Constructing a coherent sentence in English to explain the influence will be hard for many.

*   **Attempt vs. Failure:**
    *   Most will attempt this. It's a direct factual recall question with an explanation.
    *   Many will likely list one or two resources, even if only one is correct, or struggle with the explanation.

*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   Listing general natural resources (trees, animals, mountains) not specifically linked to Rajasthan.
    *   Listing only one resource.
    *   Listing resources that aren't natural (e.g., historical sites, traditional crafts).
    *   Listing two
