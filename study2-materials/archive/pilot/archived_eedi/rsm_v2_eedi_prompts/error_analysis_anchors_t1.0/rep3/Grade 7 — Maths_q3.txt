Here's an analysis of the likely errors and an estimation of the pass rate for the given question:

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

*   **Misconceptions about Mathematics:**
    *   **Incorrect Formula:** The most common mathematical error would be using the formula for the area of a rectangle (`base × height`) instead of a triangle. Many students learn both around the same time and might confuse them.
    *   **Calculation Error:** Even with the correct formula, simple multiplication errors (`8 × 6 = 42` instead of `48`) or division by 2 errors (`48 / 2 = 20` instead of `24`) could occur.
    *   **Units Confusion (Less likely to cause a pass/fail, but possible):** Students might omit units or use incorrect units (e.g., cm instead of cm²). The rubric focuses on the formula, so this might not fail them unless the numerical answer is also wrong.

*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Base" and "Height" understanding:** While these are common mathematical terms, some students might struggle to link "base" and "height" to the correct parts of the triangle if their foundational understanding of geometry terminology is weak. However, in this simple context, it's fairly direct.
    *   **"Find the area":** This phrase is standard, so significant misunderstanding here is unlikely.

*   **Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**
    *   **Attempt and Fail:** This type of question (finding area) is a fundamental concept taught in Class 7. Most students would attempt it, even if they're unsure of the exact formula. The presence of numbers `8` and `6` strongly cues them to perform a calculation.
    *   **Not Attempt:** A small percentage might not attempt if they feel completely lost, but this is less likely for a direct calculation question compared to a conceptual writing task.

*   **What would the most common wrong answer look like?**
    *   **`48 cm²` (or just `48`):** This would be the most common incorrect answer, resulting from `base × height` (area of a rectangle).
    *   **Other calculation errors:** `20`, `42`, etc., if they make a mistake in `8 × 6` or `48 / 2`.
    *   **Leaving it blank or just writing the formula without calculation.**

**Calibration Anchors Analysis:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, literary interpretation, and good English expression. High difficulty for this demographic.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate sources):** Requires conceptual understanding, factual recall, and clear differentiation, with examples. Moderately difficult.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires creative writing, basic paragraph structure, and sustained expression. Many might get partial credit for listing words.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Requires factual recall from a specific story, likely rote memorization. If they remember the story, it's easy.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Requires factual recall of common civics knowledge. If they've studied, it's straightforward.

**Relating to the Current Question:**

The current question ("Find the area of a triangle...") is a direct application of a mathematical formula.
*   It does *not* require abstract thinking or complex English expression like the 5% item.
*   It is *not* a conceptual differentiation like the 15% item, but a direct calculation.
*   It requires less creative output than the 30% item (paragraph).
*   It is similar in cognitive demand to the 50% and 66% items in that it relies on recalling and applying a specific piece of learned information (a formula).

The main hurdle will be **recalling the *correct* formula** (`1/2 * b * h`) versus the common trap of `b * h`. Given that the average pass rate is 29%, a direct formula application question in Math should perform better than that average, assuming it's a topic covered.

Many students will recall "base times height" and forget the "half." However, a significant portion who have understood the concept well should remember the "half."

Let's consider the distribution:
*   A group will know the formula and calculate correctly.
*   A group will use `b*h` (area of rectangle) and get 48.
*   A group will make calculation errors.
*   A small group might not attempt.
