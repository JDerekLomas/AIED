Here's an analysis of the likely errors and the estimated pass rate for the given question:

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

*   **Misconceptions about English Word Order (SVO):** This is the most significant hurdle. While the target sentence is a simple Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure, students from this background often struggle with rigid English word order, especially when compared to more flexible word orders in some Indian languages.
    *   **Common Error 1: Incorrect Subject Placement:** They might put the subject later, perhaps influenced by how questions are formed or by simply not recognizing "he" as the primary subject for the action.
    *   **Common Error 2: Incorrect Verb Phrase Placement:** The "is reading" part might be broken up, or "reading" might be placed before "is."
    *   **Common Error 3: Prepositional/Article Confusion:** While "a book" is fairly straightforward, they might place "a" incorrectly or omit it if they don't fully grasp its role.
*   **Vocabulary/Grammar Misunderstandings (Minor):** All the words are very common, so direct vocabulary misunderstanding is unlikely. "Reading" and "book" are foundational. "He" and "is" are also basic.
*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:** Most students would attempt this question because all the words are provided, and it's a "rearrange" task, which feels less daunting than generating a full sentence from scratch or answering a conceptual question. The barrier is *correctly* rearranging, not attempting.
*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   "Reading a book is he." (Focus on the action first, common in less structured English)
    *   "He reading a book is." (Missing auxiliary verb 'is' in the correct position or misplaced 'is')
    *   "A book he is reading." (Object-first, less common but possible, especially if they see "a book" as a unit)
    *   "Is he reading a book." (Forming a question, misinterpreting the task, though the lack of a question mark might deter some from this)
    *   Simply writing the words in the order given, or a very slight, incorrect reordering.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme/Central Idea):** Requires deep comprehension and abstract thinking, plus expressive writing. Much harder.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate Archaeological/Literary Sources):** Requires conceptual understanding, recall, and structured comparison. Harder than rearranging.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on "My Favorite Season"):** Requires generating a paragraph with specific content, grammatical correctness, and sentence flow. This is significantly harder than rearranging a few words into a single, simple sentence. Students might provide fragmented lists (like the example given, "Winter, Sweater, Baju"), showing an ability to identify relevant words but not to form coherent sentences or paragraphs.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three Questions the King Wanted to Answer):** Requires specific recall from a story. This is a direct information retrieval task. It's often easier than sentence formation if the story has been understood.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Requires specific recall of two items from a list. This is often rote learning and much easier than understanding grammatical structure.

**Conclusion:**

The given question is purely about basic English SVO word order. All words are simple and known. It requires a fundamental understanding of how English sentences are built. While a 30% pass rate for "My favorite season" indicates many struggle with *producing* coherent sentences, *rearranging* a given set of words into a simple SVO structure is a lower-level task.

However, the "empty response" or "fragmented response" examples from the 30% item suggest that a significant portion of students might not even grasp the SVO structure well enough to form a correct sentence consistently. The jump from recall (50%, 66%) to even basic sentence construction (this item) can be substantial.

Many students will attempt this, but a good number will make the common word order errors mentioned (e.g., "Reading a book is he," "He reading a book is").

Given the 30% pass rate for a paragraph-writing task where many produce fragments, and 50% for direct recall, this task sits somewhere in between. It's harder than simple recall but easier than full paragraph generation.

I'd place it significantly higher than the 30% paragraph task because it's a constrained task with all words provided, and the target sentence is extremely common. Students might practice this type of exercise.
