I will break down the thought process for estimating the pass rate for this question.

**1. Analyze the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question:** "At `10` am in the morning, the temperature of Jodhpur was `30^0 C`. If the temperature increases by `2^0 C` per hour, then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?"
*   **Core Tasks:**
    1.  Calculate the time difference between 10 am and 4 pm.
    2.  Multiply this time difference by the rate of temperature increase (`2^0 C` per hour).
    3.  Add this total temperature increase to the initial temperature (`30^0 C`).
*   **Rubric:** "Calculates the time elapsed from `10:00` am to `4:00` pm as `6` hours." Max score: 1. This rubric is *very specific* and potentially misleading if interpreted too literally. It suggests *only* calculating the time elapsed is enough for a point. However, in these types of exams, a "pass" usually implies the *final correct answer*. Let's assume for this estimate that "pass" means the *correct final temperature*. If it truly only means calculating 6 hours, the pass rate would be higher. Given the other anchors, a full correct answer is more likely the intent for a "pass".

**2. Deconstruct Potential Errors (Math and Language):**

*   **Time Calculation (10 am to 4 pm):** This is the most crucial step and the one specifically mentioned in the rubric.
    *   **Common Mistakes:**
        *   Subtracting 10 from 4 directly (leading to -6 or just 6, but without understanding the AM/PM transition).
        *   Counting on fingers but miscounting (e.g., 10-11-12-1-2-3-4 is 6 hours, but some might count 7).
        *   Confusing AM/PM.
        *   Converting 4 pm to 16:00 (military time) and then subtracting 10:00, which is correct (16 - 10 = 6 hours). This requires an understanding of military time, which might not be universal for this age group/background.
        *   Simple arithmetic errors in counting hours.
*   **Multiplication:**
    *   `6 hours * 2^0 C/hour = 12^0 C`. This is a basic multiplication, generally straightforward. Errors here would be simple arithmetic mistakes (e.g., 6*2 = 8 or 10).
*   **Addition:**
    *   `30^0 C + 12^0 C = 42^0 C`. Also a basic addition. Errors here would be simple arithmetic mistakes (e.g., 30+12 = 32, 40, etc.).
*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   "increases by": Understanding the concept of addition.
    *   "per hour": Understanding the concept of multiplication over time.
    *   "10 am in the morning" vs. "4:00 in the evening": Understanding the time markers and their sequence. This is the biggest language-related hurdle for calculation.
    *   "Temperature of Jodhpur": Understanding that the final answer should be a temperature.
*   **Attempt vs. Failure:**
    *   Many students will attempt this. It's a word problem but involves relatively simple operations.
    *   Partial attempts are likely, especially getting the time difference wrong, but then correctly applying the increase to their incorrect time.
    *   Some might just add 2 to 30 (thinking 1 hour), or multiply 10 by 2, or 4 by 2, showing a complete misunderstanding of the problem structure.
*   **Most Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   `30 + 2 = 32^0 C` (assuming 1 hour increase)
    *   `30 + (4 * 2) = 38^0 C` (using 4 pm as 4 hours)
    *   `30 + (10 * 2) = 50^0 C` (using 10 am as 10 hours)
    *   `30 + (7 * 2) = 44^0 C` (if they miscalculated time as 7 hours)
    *   Errors in addition/multiplication after correct time calculation (e.g., `30 + 10 = 40^0 C` if they
