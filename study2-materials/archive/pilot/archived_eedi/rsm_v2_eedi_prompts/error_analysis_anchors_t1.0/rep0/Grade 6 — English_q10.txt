I'll break down the analysis for the question "Choose the correct word. There are (some/any) apples in the basket."

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Limited Exposure to "Some" vs. "Any" Rules:**
    *   Many students, especially from the described background, might not have had explicit grammar instruction on the nuances of "some" (affirmative statements, offers, requests) and "any" (negative statements, questions).
    *   They might use them somewhat interchangeably, or simply choose one at random if they don't know the rule.

2.  **Over-reliance on Translation/Direct Equivalence:**
    *   If they try to translate the sentence into their native language, the distinction between "some" and "any" might not be as clear-cut or might not map directly to their equivalent words, leading to confusion.

3.  **Guessing/Lack of Confidence:**
    *   For students who don't know the rule, this is a 50/50 guess. Even if they've heard both words, the specific grammatical context might be beyond their current understanding.
    *   They might attempt but fail because they genuinely don't know the rule, not because they misunderstand the individual words "apples" or "basket."

4.  **Influence of "Any" in Questions:**
    *   Students might associate "any" more with questions ("Are there any apples?"), and while this isn't a question, the presence of "apples in the basket" might vaguely trigger a connection to inquiries. This is less likely for an affirmative statement, but possible.

5.  **Not Attempting at All:**
    *   It's a multiple-choice/fill-in-the-blank type question, so "not attempting at all" would mean leaving it blank, which is less common for a simple word choice. They are more likely to make a guess.

**What the most common wrong answer would look like:**

The most common wrong answer would simply be choosing "any." There isn't much scope for other types of errors in this simple fill-in-the-blank.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Pass rate 66%:** "Name any two Fundamental Rights..." This requires recalling specific factual information, but the question itself is clear and the expected answer is straightforward (e.g., Right to Equality, Right to Freedom). Many students would have learned these.
*   **Pass rate 50%:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" This also requires factual recall from a story. It's a bit more complex than naming two things, as it involves remembering specific plot points.
*   **The Current Question:** This is a very fundamental grammar rule. Unlike factual recall (like the Fundamental Rights or the King's questions), which can be rote-learned, this requires an understanding of grammatical context. However, it's also a very common usage point.

**Reasoning for Estimation:**

*   **Simplicity of task:** It's a binary choice, simple sentence, common words. This leans towards a higher pass rate.
*   **Fundamental grammar:** "Some/any" is a very basic English grammar concept. While these students have limited English, this is often one of the earliest differentiations taught, even implicitly.
*   **Context is clear:** The sentence "There are ____ apples in the basket" is a straightforward affirmative statement.
*   **50/50 guess:** Even if they don't know the rule, they have a 50% chance of getting it right by guessing.
*   **Potential for confusion:** The key challenge is if they haven't been explicitly taught this rule or if their exposure to English is so limited that they haven't picked it up through usage.
*   **Compared to anchors:**
    *   It's simpler than the 50% recall question about the king's questions.
    *   It's simpler than the 66% recall question about Fundamental Rights because it doesn't require specific memorized knowledge, just a common grammatical pattern.
    *   It's far simpler than writing a paragraph (30%) or differentiating concepts (15%) or finding a theme (5%).

Given the 50% chance by guessing, and the fact that "some/any" is a very basic distinction even for learners, I expect a significant portion to get this right, either through knowledge or a lucky guess. Many students would have encountered this pattern enough times to intuitively choose "some" in an affirmative sentence, even without knowing the explicit rule. It's one of the most common quantifier uses.

I think it will be higher than the 50% factual recall, but perhaps not as high as a pure
