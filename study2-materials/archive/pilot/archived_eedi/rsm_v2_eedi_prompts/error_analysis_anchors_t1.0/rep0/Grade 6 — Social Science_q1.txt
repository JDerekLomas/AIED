ERRORS:

*   **Lack of direct geographical knowledge:** This is a factual recall question requiring specific geographical knowledge. Students might know "mountains" exist but not the specific names of major ranges *in India*. Their local geography might be more focused on their immediate state/region.
*   **Confusion with other geographical features:** They might confuse mountain ranges with individual peaks, rivers, states, or even large cities if their understanding of "major geographical features" is broad.
*   **Language barriers (minor):** "Major mountain ranges" is relatively straightforward English, but some students might struggle if they don't grasp "ranges" or "located in." However, "Name two mountains in India" is likely a common enough concept that they'll understand the gist.
*   **Partial knowledge/Recall failure:** They might know one range (e.g., Himalayas due to its prominence) but struggle to name a second, or misremember the name of a second. The rubric gives 0.5 for one correct answer, so partial knowledge helps.
*   **Attempt but fail:** Many would likely attempt, drawing on whatever geographical knowledge they have. Blank responses might be less common than incorrect attempts.
*   **Common wrong answers:**
    *   Naming a single prominent mountain (e.g., "Mount Everest" – though technically not a range and partly outside India).
    *   Naming a mountain range outside India (e.g., "Alps" if they have some very basic world geography).
    *   Naming a general area that *has* mountains but isn't a range (e.g., "North India").
    *   Naming something completely unrelated (e.g., a state, a river, a forest).
    *   Naming a local hill or small range that isn't considered "major" in the national context.

**Analysis against calibration anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain."** This requires abstract thinking, literary interpretation, and a good grasp of the poem. Much harder than factual recall.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate archaeological/literary sources.** This requires understanding two concepts and providing examples. It's more complex than simple recall.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Paragraph on "My favorite season."** This is a creative writing task with specific prompts, requiring sentence construction, vocabulary, and coherence. While common, it demands more skills than factual recall.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is direct recall from a story. Similar to the mountain question in its direct factual nature. The mountain question requires *two* correct answers for a full score, but one correct answer gets 0.5, which aligns with knowing a key part of the story. The difficulty might be slightly higher than the king's questions because there are more *potential* correct answers for the mountain question (many ranges), but remembering *any two major ones* might be harder than remembering three specific plot points. However, the Himalayas are extremely prominent.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Two Fundamental Rights.** This is also factual recall. Fundamental Rights are a core part of Civics education. Students are often taught these directly. The wording is simple. This is probably the closest in type.

**Reasoning for estimation:**

The question is direct factual recall, similar to the "King's questions" (50%) and "Fundamental Rights" (66%).
Himalayas is extremely well-known and likely taught from early grades. Many students would probably be able to name the Himalayas. Getting a second one (Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats) might be harder, but these are also commonly taught.

Given that 0.5 is awarded for just *one* correct range:
*   Most students who have basic geography knowledge of India would likely name the Himalayas. This immediately gets them 0.5.
*   A significant portion would also be able to recall a second range, especially if it's prominent in their region or frequently mentioned in textbooks.

Compared to "Fundamental Rights" (66%), which is also core factual recall, this is perhaps slightly less universally known than Rights (which are often drilled). However, the "King's questions" (50%) involves recalling specific plot points from *one* story. Geographical features are broader and constantly referenced.

I expect a very high proportion to get at least one, and a good number to get two. The "Himalayas" alone would make the pass rate for 0.5 quite high. To get *full* credit (0.5 for one, implied 1.0 for two), the challenge increases. But the question asks for "proportion
