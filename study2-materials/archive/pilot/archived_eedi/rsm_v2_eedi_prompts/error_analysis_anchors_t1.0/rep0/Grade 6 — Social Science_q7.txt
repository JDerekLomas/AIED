Here's an analysis of the question and likely student responses, leading to an estimated pass rate:

**Analysis of the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question Type:** Factual recall (naming two resources) + application/reasoning (explaining influence).
*   **Subject:** Social Science (Geography/Environmental Studies).
*   **Key Concepts:** Natural resources, regional geography, human-environment interaction.
*   **Difficulty:**
    *   Naming two resources: Relatively straightforward for students who have studied Indian geography or Rajasthan specifically. Many common resources are found there.
    *   Explaining influence: Requires a basic understanding of how a resource impacts daily life or economy. This might be slightly harder but still within the grasp of a Class 6 student with some contextual knowledge.
*   **Rubric:** Allows for a wide range of correct resources. Only *one* explanation is needed. This makes it quite achievable for a partial score (even if the full explanation isn't perfect, just naming two resources would be a good start). The max score is 1, implying that any reasonable attempt that hits the two resources + one explanation gets the full mark.

**Likely Errors and Student Behavior:**

1.  **Lack of Specific Knowledge about Rajasthan:**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might not have specific geographical knowledge about Rajasthan. They might name generic natural resources found elsewhere in India or globally, or simply list resources without linking them to Rajasthan.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "Water, trees, animals." (Too generic, not specific to Rajasthan's unique resource profile or the *influence* of a particular resource). Or "Coal, Iron ore" (found in other parts of India, not primary for Rajasthan).
    *   **Attempt:** Likely to attempt but fail on specificity.

2.  **Difficulty with "Explain how one of them influences...":**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might struggle with the cause-and-effect relationship or expressing it clearly in written English. They might just state *what* the resource is, rather than *how* it impacts lives.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "Water. It is important." (Doesn't explain *how* it influences). Or "Marble. People use it." (Again, lacks the influence aspect).
    *   **Language Barrier:** This part requires slightly more complex sentence structure and vocabulary than just naming. Students with limited English might struggle to articulate the influence clearly.
    *   **Attempt:** May attempt but fail to provide a satisfactory explanation.

3.  **Incomplete Answers:**
    *   Students might just name one resource, or two resources without explanation, or vice-versa. The rubric asks for two resources AND an explanation for one.
    *   **Attempt:** Partial attempt, getting part right but missing another part.

4.  **No Attempt / Irrelevant Answers:**
    *   Some students might simply not know and leave it blank or write something completely unrelated. This is less likely given the familiarity of the topic (natural resources).

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"My favorite season" (30%):** Requires short paragraph writing, personal expression, and some detail. This question requires factual recall + a short explanation. The explanation part is similar in complexity to elaborating on "what you like to do" in a season.
*   **"Differentiate archaeological/literary sources" (15%):** This is a differentiation question requiring definitions and examples, often a more formal academic skill. Our question is more direct factual recall and explanation.
*   **"Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%):** This is pure recall from a specific story. Many students get this right. Naming two resources for Rajasthan is comparable in recall difficulty. The explanation part makes our question slightly harder than pure recall.
*   **"Two Fundamental Rights" (66%):** Very high pass rate, likely due to direct recall of commonly taught facts. Naming resources is similar. The explanation part is the differentiator.
*   **"Theme of 'The Last Bargain'" (5%):** Requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and synthesis, which is much harder and often results in low scores. Our question is far more concrete.

**Reasoning for Pass Rate Estimate:**

*   **Naming Resources (Likely High Success):** Many common resources like water, sand, solar energy, marble, copper, gypsum, salt are associated with Rajasthan. Even basic knowledge would yield at least one or two.
*   **Explaining Influence (Moderate Success):**
    *   **Water:** Its scarcity and importance for agriculture, drinking, and daily life is a very common theme for Rajasthan. This is a highly likely and correct explanation.
    *   **Solar/Wind Energy:** Rajasthan is a leader;
