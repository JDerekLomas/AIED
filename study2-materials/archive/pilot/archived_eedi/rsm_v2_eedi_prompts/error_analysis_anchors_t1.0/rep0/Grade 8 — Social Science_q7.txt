I'll break down the thought process for estimating the pass rate for the given question.

**1. Analyze the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question:** "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"
*   **Rubric:** "For explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)." Max score: 1.

**Key takeaway from Rubric:** The answer needs to explicitly link the battle to *political dominance/control over Bengal*, ideally mentioning the puppet ruler aspect. Simple historical facts about the battle itself won't be enough.

**2. Evaluate Cognitive Demand and Prior Knowledge:**

*   **Subject:** Social Science (History). This is a core topic in Indian history curricula for Class 8.
*   **Concept:** Cause and effect (battle -> British power expansion). This requires more than just recalling facts; it requires understanding a consequence.
*   **Specificity:** "Battle of Plassey in 1757" is a very specific event. Students would have studied this.
*   **Complexity:** "Contribute to the expansion of British power" requires understanding the *mechanism* of expansion, not just that it happened. The rubric clarifies this to "political dominance/control over Bengal."

**3. Consider the Target Audience (Class 8, Indian Govt. Schools, EWS, Limited English, 29% average pass rate):**

*   **Economically Weaker Sections:** May have less access to supplementary learning materials, potentially less focus on analytical skills, and more rote memorization.
*   **Limited English:** This is crucial. Students might understand the historical facts in their vernacular but struggle to articulate them precisely in English.
*   **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This tells us the overall difficulty level of the exam and the students' general proficiency. This question is likely to be harder than the average.

**4. Brainstorm Common Errors (Misconceptions, Language, Attempt vs. No Attempt):**

*   **Misconception/Lack of Understanding:**
    *   **Knowing the event but not its significance:** Students might know *that* the Battle of Plassey happened and that the British won, but not *how* it led to power expansion.
    *   **Focusing on military victory only:** They might say "British won the battle" without linking it to political control.
    *   **Vague answers:** "British became powerful," "India lost." These are too general.
    *   **Confusing with other battles/events:** Less likely for a specific event like Plassey, but possible if historical timelines are weak.
    *   **Not understanding "contribute to":** Interpreting it as simply "what happened."
*   **Language Misunderstandings/Difficulties:**
    *   Struggling with words like "contribute," "expansion," "dominance," "puppet nawab."
    *   Difficulty forming coherent sentences to explain a complex cause-and-effect relationship in English.
    *   Grammatical errors making the answer unclear, even if the underlying idea is present.
    *   Using simple, informal language that doesn't meet the rubric's implicit standard for academic explanation.
*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   Given it's a prominent historical event, most students who have studied history *will attempt* it. Complete blanks might be less common than for, say, a nuanced poem analysis.
    *   However, many attempts will likely be incorrect or insufficient.
*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   "British won the Battle of Plassey." (Correct fact, but doesn't answer "how it contributed to expansion of power")
    *   "British became stronger after the battle." (Too vague)
    *   "They defeated Siraj-ud-Daulah." (Fact, not contribution to power expansion)
    *   Answers that mention the battle but don't connect it to political control over Bengal or the puppet regime.
    *   Answers that are poorly articulated due to English proficiency.

**5. Compare with Calibration Anchors:**

Let's look at the anchor items and their pass rates:

*   **5%:** "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" - Requires abstract thought, interpretation, and articulation. Very low pass rate, as expected for abstract English literature.
*   **15%:** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." - Requires understanding definitions and providing examples. More specific social science content, but still conceptual. The examples are crucial.
*   **30%:** "Write a short paragraph... 'My favorite season.'" -
