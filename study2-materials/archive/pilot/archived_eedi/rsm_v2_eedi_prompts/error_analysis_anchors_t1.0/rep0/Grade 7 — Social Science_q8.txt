**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

This question asks for occupations in rural Rajasthan and a brief description of one. This is a fairly straightforward Social Science question that would likely be covered in Class 7 curriculum related to geography or economy.

*   **Misconceptions about Social Science:**
    *   **Lack of Specificity about Rajasthan:** Students might know general rural occupations in India but not specifically for Rajasthan. However, given the prominence of agriculture and animal husbandry across most rural areas, this is less likely to be a major barrier.
    *   **Focus on Modern Occupations:** Some students might think of more urban or modern jobs if their understanding of "occupation" is not rooted in traditional rural contexts.
    *   **Difficulty with "Main Occupations":** They might list *some* occupations but struggle to identify the *primary* ones.

*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Main Occupations":** While "main" is a common word, some might interpret it broadly rather than as "primary" or "most common."
    *   **"Rural Areas":** Most Class 7 students in India would understand "rural areas" (गांव/ग्रामीण क्षेत्र).
    *   **"Describe any one in brief":** "Describe" and "brief" are common instructions. Students might struggle with *how* to describe briefly, leading to either too little or too much information, but the rubric only requires naming two and then a description, implying a low bar for "description."

*   **Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**
    *   This is a factual recall question that students are likely to attempt. The topic is common, and even if they only know one or two occupations, they can still partially answer. The prompt gives clear instructions (name occupations, describe one).

*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   **Generic Rural Occupations (Not Rajasthan-specific):** This is unlikely to be marked wrong unless the occupations are completely irrelevant to Rajasthan. Agriculture and animal husbandry are universal.
    *   **Listing only one occupation:** Many might just list "farming" or "agriculture" and miss the "at least two" part of the rubric, or fail to describe one.
    *   **Listing occupations that are not "main":** e.g., "teacher," "shopkeeper" (while present, not typically considered the *main* economic drivers of rural Rajasthan).
    *   **Incomplete Description:** Naming two occupations but failing to describe one.
    *   **No Attempt at Description:** Just listing the names.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain."** This requires abstract thinking and nuanced understanding of poetry. Much harder.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate archaeological/literary sources.** This requires understanding two concepts and providing examples. It's more conceptual than the Rajasthan question, which is factual recall. The Class 7 curriculum would cover this, but differentiating abstract concepts is harder than listing common jobs.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): "My favorite season" paragraph.** This is creative writing, requiring sentence construction and expressing personal thoughts within a structure. Many students struggle with English writing. The Rajasthan question is factual recall, which is often easier for these students than creative expression in English.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer.** This is direct recall from a story, similar in cognitive load to the Rajasthan question (factual recall). The success here suggests that if the information is directly taught and remembered, students can reproduce it. The Rajasthan question is likely covered.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Two Fundamental Rights.** This is also direct recall of specific names. This has a high pass rate, indicating that students are capable of memorizing and recalling specific social science facts. The Rajasthan question falls into this category.

**Synthesizing and Estimating:**

The Rajasthan question is a direct factual recall question from Social Science, similar in difficulty to "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%) and "Two Fundamental Rights" (66%). The requirement to name *two* occupations and *briefly describe one* is a slightly higher bar than simply naming two things, but the description can be very brief.

Given that students often struggle with *writing* in English (as seen in the 30% pass rate for the paragraph question), the "describe one in brief" part might slightly lower the score from the very high-recall questions. However, they only need to name two and then a minimal description for one.

The average pass rate is 29%, but these specific recall questions tend to perform better if the content is covered. Rajasthan is a prominent state, and its geography/economy would definitely be taught.
