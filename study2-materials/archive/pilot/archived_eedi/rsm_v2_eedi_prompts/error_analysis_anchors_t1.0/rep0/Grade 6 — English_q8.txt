Here's an analysis of the likely errors and the estimated pass rate for the given question:

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

*   **Misconceptions about English word order (SVO):** This is the primary hurdle. While Hindi (and many other Indian languages) often use SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order, English uses SVO. Students might instinctively try to put the verb at the end or place the object before the verb.
    *   *Example potential wrong answer:* "He a book reading is." or "A book he is reading."
*   **Difficulty with auxiliary verbs:** The "is" as an auxiliary verb might be confusing, especially if students are more familiar with simple present tense constructions. They might struggle to place it correctly within the continuous tense structure.
    *   *Example potential wrong answer:* "He reading a book is."
*   **Lack of subject-verb agreement understanding (less likely to be an error here, but possible in other questions):** While "he is" is straightforward, if the subject changed, some might falter. Here, it's mostly about the overall word order.
*   **Not understanding the task "meaningful sentence":** Some might just list the words in a different order without striving for grammatical correctness or meaning.
*   **Partial credit attempts:** Students might get the "he is" part right but then scramble the rest, or vice-versa. However, the rubric is strict (max score 1 for 'He is reading a book.'), so partial correctness leads to 0.
*   **No attempt:** Given the simplicity of the words, most students are likely to attempt this question, even if incorrectly. It doesn't require deep comprehension or factual recall, just linguistic arrangement.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 66% (Name any two Fundamental Rights):** This requires factual recall but is very direct. Students either know it or don't. The structure is simple.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?):** Again, factual recall from a text, relatively direct if they remember the story.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Write a short paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This requires sentence construction, vocabulary, and paragraph organization. Many struggle with generating coherent sentences and ideas, even if the topic is familiar. The errors show basic word lists rather than sentences.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources):** This requires conceptual understanding, definition, and examples, which is a higher-order thinking skill in English, leading to lower scores.
*   **Pass Rate 5% (Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain"):** This is very abstract, requiring deep comprehension, interpretation, and expression of complex ideas in English. Extremely difficult for this demographic.

**Reasoning for Estimated Pass Rate:**

This question is a test of fundamental English sentence structure (SVO). While students might struggle with complex English, this particular sentence is very common and basic.

*   Many students, even those with limited English, will have encountered "He is reading a book" or similar structures repeatedly in their textbooks and lessons.
*   It's a very common pattern: Subject + Be verb + -ing verb + Object.
*   The vocabulary is extremely simple and universal ("book," "reading," "he").
*   Unlike the paragraph writing (30%), it doesn't require generating ideas or extensive vocabulary. Unlike the factual recall questions (50%, 66%), it doesn't rely on remembering specific content. It's a direct application of a learned grammatical rule.

The main challenge will be overcoming the potential interference from their native language's word order. However, "He is reading a book" is so foundational that many will have memorized this exact phrase or pattern. Students attempting "My favorite season" (30%) struggle with *generating* grammatically correct sentences, but here they are just *rearranging* existing, simple words into a very common pattern. This should be easier.

It's simpler than the 50% question (which requires recall of 3 specific facts) because it only requires applying a single, very common grammatical rule. It's slightly more complex than simply listing two rights (66%) because it requires *arranging* words, but the arrangement is of a highly predictable type.

Therefore, it should fall somewhere between the 30% (paragraph writing) and 66% (factual recall) marks, likely closer to the higher end given its basic structural nature and the commonality of the phrase.
