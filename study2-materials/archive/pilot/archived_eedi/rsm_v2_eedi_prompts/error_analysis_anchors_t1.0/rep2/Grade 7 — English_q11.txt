Here's a breakdown of the analysis for the question "Identify the adjective phrase in the sentence: A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony." and the estimated pass rate:

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the student demographic (economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate ~29%):

*   **Misconception about "Adjective Phrase" vs. "Adjective":** This is the *most critical* error. The rubric states "The student correctly identifies 'tiny' as an adjective." However, the question asks for an "adjective *phrase*." This is a significant mismatch and will cause widespread confusion.
    *   Many students, if they know what an adjective is, will correctly identify "tiny." But this isn't an adjective *phrase*.
    *   An adjective phrase would be something like "very tiny" or "tiny and brown." The sentence only has a single adjective "tiny."
    *   Students might interpret "adjective phrase" as simply "adjective" because they don't grasp the distinction, or because they've been taught to identify single adjectives more commonly.

*   **Difficulty Identifying Adjectives in General:** Even identifying a simple adjective like "tiny" might be challenging for a significant portion of students if their grammatical foundation is weak. They might confuse it with verbs or nouns.

*   **Confusion with Other Phrases:**
    *   **Noun Phrase:** "A tiny bird" is a noun phrase. Some might identify this entire phrase.
    *   **Prepositional Phrase:** "in our balcony" is a prepositional phrase. Many students struggle to differentiate between different types of phrases and might pick this if they simply look for any "group of words."
    *   **Verb Phrase:** "built its nest" is a verb phrase. Less likely to be chosen as an *adjective* phrase, but possible if they're guessing.

*   **Lack of Attempt/Understanding:** A substantial number of students might not understand the question at all, leading to empty responses or completely unrelated answers (similar to the 5% pass rate item where answers like "This pen writer name is Rabindranath tagore" were given for a theme question).

*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   "tiny" (If the rubric is strictly followed, this would be incorrect as it's not a *phrase*. But given the discrepancy, it's the *best* wrong answer that aligns with part of the concept.)
    *   "A tiny bird" (Identifying the noun phrase, which contains the adjective.)
    *   "in our balcony" (Identifying a different type of phrase.)
    *   "bird" (Identifying the noun the adjective modifies.)
    *   Empty response.

**Impact of Rubric Mismatch:**

The rubric stating "The student correctly identifies 'tiny' as an adjective" *when the question asks for an adjective phrase* is problematic.

*   **If markers are strict:** No student will get it right because there isn't an adjective *phrase* in the sentence. The pass rate would be 0%. This is unlikely for a standardized test.
*   **If markers are lenient and interpret "adjective phrase" as "adjective":** Then students identifying "tiny" would score 1. This is the most probable scenario given the educational context where often simplified interpretations are accepted.

Let's assume the markers will be lenient and accept "tiny" as a correct identification, despite the question wording. If this is the case, the question effectively becomes "Identify the adjective in the sentence."

**Recalibrating with Anchors (assuming leniency):**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain."** Very abstract, requires comprehension and articulation.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources.** Requires specific factual knowledge and ability to differentiate.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph on "My favorite season."** Requires basic composition, personal expression, and some vocabulary. Many students gave very short or broken answers.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** Requires recall of specific plot details from a likely familiar story. Fairly straightforward recall.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights.** Requires specific factual recall from Civics. This is usually memorized and relatively simple.

Our question, if interpreted as "Identify the adjective," is about basic grammatical identification. It's less abstract than finding a theme, less demanding of specific knowledge than sources, and simpler than writing a paragraph. It's more akin to a recall/identification task like the king's questions or fundamental rights, but on a grammatical concept.
