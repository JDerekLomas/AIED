Here's an analysis of the likely errors and an estimated pass rate for the given question:

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the context (Class 8, Indian government schools, economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate 29%):

*   **Social Science Misconceptions/Lack of Knowledge:**
    *   **Limited Exposure to History:** Many students might have a very superficial understanding of ancient history, particularly Harappan civilization. It might be a topic they've covered briefly in textbooks but haven't deeply internalized.
    *   **Focus on Rote Learning:** History in these settings often involves memorizing names and dates rather than understanding concepts like "urban planning." They might remember "Harappa" but not specific features.
    *   **Confusing Civilizations:** They might confuse Harappan features with those of other ancient civilizations (e.g., Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts if they have any exposure, though less likely).
    *   **Difficulty with "Key Feature":** Even if they know a few facts, identifying a *key* feature of *urban planning* specifically might be challenging. They might list something generic about the civilization rather than its town planning.

*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Describe":** Students might struggle with the demand for description and provide a one-word answer or a very fragmented idea.
    *   **"Key Feature":** This phrase might be misunderstood. They might list *any* feature, not necessarily a *key* one, or struggle to differentiate importance.
    *   **"Harappan Civilization's Urban Planning":** This entire phrase is a mouthful. Students might grasp "Harappan Civilization" but struggle to connect it with "urban planning." They might not even understand "urban planning" itself as a concept.
    *   **Limited Vocabulary:** Terms like "grid layout," "drainage system," "baked bricks," "citadel," "lower town" might be challenging to recall or express correctly in English.

*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   Many students will attempt this question, as it's a direct factual recall from history. However, the quality of their attempts will vary widely.
    *   Some might leave it blank if they have absolutely no idea or cannot formulate an answer in English.

*   **Most Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   **Generic statements:** "It was a very old civilization," "People lived there."
    *   **Incorrect facts:** Listing features of other civilizations or completely made-up facts.
    *   **Incomplete/Vague answers:** "Good drainage," "Houses." (These might get partial credit if very generously marked, but the rubric requires "correctly describes one key feature.")
    *   **Grammatically incorrect or incomprehensible English:** Attempts to describe features that are unintelligible.
    *   **Focus on non-urban planning aspects:** Mentioning seals, pottery, or farming, rather than town layout.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking and expressing a concept in English. Much harder than factual recall.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires understanding two concepts and providing examples. More complex than a single feature, but still factual. The examples show some basic understanding can get points.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires personal expression and sentence construction, but on a familiar topic. The examples show even very basic sentences and lists can get credit if relevant. This is a good anchor for the *ability to formulate a simple English sentence*.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is direct factual recall from a story. Similar to the Harappan question in its demand for specific information. The examples show that even a partial list or slightly garbled recall can get points. This is probably the closest in cognitive demand.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Direct factual recall of two specific items. Very high pass rate, likely because it's a civics topic often emphasized and relatively easy to list.

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

The "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50% pass rate) is the most comparable. It requires recalling specific details from a story/text. The Harappan question is also factual recall from history.

However, "urban planning" is a slightly more academic concept than "questions the king asked." While students might have been taught features like the grid system or drainage, expressing them precisely in English, especially distinguishing them as *key features of urban planning*, will be a hurdle for many.

Considering the limited English proficiency, the average 29% pass rate, and the slightly more
