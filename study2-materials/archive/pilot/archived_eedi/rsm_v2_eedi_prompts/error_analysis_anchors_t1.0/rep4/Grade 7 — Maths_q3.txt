Students are from Class 7, mostly economically weaker sections, with limited English. The average pass rate for their exams is 29%.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Mathematical Misconceptions:**
    *   **Forgetting the 1/2 factor:** This is the most common error in calculating the area of a triangle. Many students might treat it like the area of a rectangle/square (base x height) and forget to divide by two.
    *   **Incorrect formula recall:** While the `1/2 * b * h` formula is fundamental, some might confuse it with perimeter formulas or other area formulas.
    *   **Calculation errors:** Even with the correct formula, basic multiplication and division errors could occur (e.g., 8 * 6 = 42, or 48 / 2 = 20). However, the primary error is usually the formula itself.
    *   **Units confusion:** Less likely to cause a "fail" if the numerical answer is correct, but some might write "cm" instead of "cm²". The rubric only asks for the formula.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Base" and "height":** These are common geometric terms, but for students with limited English, there might be some confusion if they haven't encountered them sufficiently in a mathematical context in English. However, for a Class 7 math problem, these terms are usually introduced early and consistently.
    *   **"Area":** The concept of area itself should be familiar, but relating it specifically to a triangle might be the challenge.
    *   The question is relatively straightforward and doesn't contain complex sentence structures.

3.  **Attempt Rate and Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   **Attempt Rate:** This is a fundamental concept in Class 7 geometry. Most students are likely to attempt this question.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** The most prevalent incorrect answer will be `base × height`, leading to `8 × 6 = 48`. If the rubric only asks for the formula, they might write `base × height` or `b × h`.
    *   Some might attempt to draw a triangle and then get stuck.
    *   A significant portion might leave it blank if they have no idea or simply recall the wrong formula.

4.  **Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

    *   **Pass rate 5% (theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and good English writing skills. This question is far simpler.
    *   **Pass rate 15% (differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires conceptual understanding, factual recall, and clear differentiation, along with examples. This question is a direct application of a formula.
    *   **Pass rate 30% (paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires creative writing, sentence construction, and adherence to prompts, again demanding more English proficiency.
    *   **Pass rate 50% (three questions the king wanted to answer):** Requires recall of specific plot details from a story. This is rote memorization. Our question is formula recall and application.
    *   **Pass rate 66% (two Fundamental Rights):** Requires recall of specific facts. Similar to the 50% anchor, but likely easier as these are often emphasized.

    Our question is a direct math formula application. Math questions generally tend to have higher pass rates than complex English comprehension or abstract thinking questions, especially for rote or formulaic problems. The core challenge here is remembering the `1/2` factor.

    The 50% and 66% anchors involve recalling facts. This question involves recalling a formula and applying it. Many students might remember *a* formula for a triangle, but omitting the `1/2` is very common.

    Given the average pass rate of 29% and the fact that this is a relatively basic math concept for Class 7, but still prone to a specific common error (forgetting the 1/2), it should be higher than the essay/interpretation questions but perhaps not as high as simple fact recall if the "1/2" is a significant hurdle.

    If the rubric is *only* about stating/using the correct formula, it simplifies the scoring slightly compared to getting the final numerical answer correct.

    Let's consider two groups:
    *   Those who know the formula correctly: `1/2 * b * h`
    *   Those who remember `b * h` (a common incorrect simplification)
    *   Those who don't attempt or have completely wrong ideas.

    The `1/2` factor is what makes this slightly tricky. If it were the area of a rectangle, the pass rate would be much higher.

    I'll lean towards it being
