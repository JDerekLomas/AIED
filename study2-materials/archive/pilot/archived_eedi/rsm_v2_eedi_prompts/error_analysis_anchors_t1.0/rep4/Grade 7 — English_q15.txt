Here's a breakdown of the likely errors and the estimated pass rate for the 'My Favourite Hobby' question:

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

*   **Limited English Vocabulary and Sentence Structure:** This is the most significant hurdle.
    *   Students might know a hobby (e.g., cricket, drawing) but struggle to express *when* they do it (e.g., "after school," "in the evening") or *why* they enjoy it (e.g., "it makes me happy," "I like to play with friends," "it improves my skills").
    *   They might use very simple, fragmented sentences instead of a cohesive paragraph.
    *   Struggling with conjunctions (e.g., "and," "but," "because") to link ideas.
    *   Basic grammatical errors (tense, subject-verb agreement, articles) are almost guaranteed.
*   **Misunderstanding "Paragraph" and "Sentences":**
    *   Some students might just list words or phrases related to their hobby, similar to the "My favorite season" example where a list of single words was given. They might not understand the concept of a "sentence" or how to link them into a "paragraph."
    *   They might write too few or too many sentences, failing to adhere to the 4-5 sentence requirement, though this is a minor rubric point compared to content.
*   **Difficulty with Abstract Concepts like "Enjoyment":**
    *   While they can state "I like cricket," expressing *why* they enjoy it ("it makes me feel energetic," "I learn teamwork") can be challenging. They might resort to very simple statements like "it is good" or "I like it very much," which might barely meet the "why you enjoy it" criterion.
*   **Not Attempting or Minimal Attempt:**
    *   If a student's English is extremely weak, they might write nothing, or just one or two words.
    *   They might get stuck after stating the hobby and not know how to elaborate.
*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   "My hobby is cricket. I play everyday. I like it." (Missing "why you enjoy it" with sufficient detail, or too short).
    *   "Drawing. I like drawing because good. I do morning." (Grammatically very poor, not a cohesive paragraph, fragmented ideas).
    *   Lists of words related to a hobby without forming sentences.
    *   Responses that clearly state the hobby and when they do it, but completely omit or give an extremely vague reason for enjoyment.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"My favorite season" (Pass rate 30%):** This is the closest anchor in terms of writing a short paragraph on a personal topic. The "My favorite season" task had a higher requirement (6-8 lines) but a similar structure (what you like to do, eat/wear). The examples show students struggling with paragraph structure and generating sufficient content. The given examples show students listing words, or writing very simple, short sentences.
*   **"Three questions the king wanted to answer?" (Pass rate 50%):** This requires recalling specific information from a text. Students often just list fragments of the answer. This suggests that even when the answer is 'known', expressing it fully can be an issue.
*   **"Fundamental Rights" (Pass rate 66%):** This is a direct recall task, where just naming two correctly grants a pass. This is much simpler than constructing a paragraph.

The 'My Favourite Hobby' question requires:
1.  **Identification:** Name a hobby (easy).
2.  **Contextualization:** When they do it (moderately difficult).
3.  **Elaboration/Reasoning:** Why they enjoy it (most difficult due to abstract thought and vocabulary).
4.  **Structure:** 4-5 sentences in a paragraph (difficult for students with limited writing practice).

This question is slightly more demanding in terms of sustained writing and expressing abstract ideas (enjoyment) compared to "My favorite season," which had more concrete prompts (what you *do*, *eat*, *wear*). However, the sentence count is lower (4-5 vs 6-8). The "why you enjoy it" part is the key differentiator and a likely stumbling block. Many might manage to state the hobby and when, but struggle with the 'why'.

Given the average pass rate of 29% and the difficulties observed in the "My favorite season" anchor, this task, while seemingly simple for a native speaker, poses significant challenges for Class 7 students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. They are likely to attempt it (as it's a personal topic) but struggle with the depth and coherence required.
