The question asks students to describe the poet's writing style. The rubric requires a suitable and relevant word, such as "simple," "descriptive," "informal," or "direct."

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

*   **Misconceptions about English/Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **Vocabulary Gap:** Many students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency might not know sophisticated vocabulary related to literary analysis (e.g., descriptive, evocative, metaphorical, nuanced). They might struggle to find *any* appropriate adjective.
    *   **Understanding "Writing Style":** Even if they know some adjectives, they might not fully grasp the concept of "writing style" in a literary context. They might confuse it with the *content* of the poem or the *poet's feelings* rather than *how* the poem is written.
    *   **Lack of exposure to literary criticism:** These students likely have limited exposure to analyzing poetry in terms of style, focusing more on comprehension of plot/theme.
    *   **Simple/Direct Translation:** If they try to describe it, they might use very basic words that are not specific enough or are somewhat off-target (e.g., "good," "nice," "emotional").
    *   **Grammar/Sentence Structure:** Even if they have the right word, they might struggle to integrate it into a grammatically correct answer, making it difficult to understand their intent.

*   **Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**
    *   **Attempt but Fail:** Many students would likely attempt this question, as it asks for a single word or short phrase. However, due to the vocabulary and conceptual challenges, their attempts would often be incorrect or irrelevant. They might guess based on the poem's theme (e.g., "sad," "happy," "love") rather than its style.
    *   **Not Attempt:** A significant portion might not attempt if they genuinely have no idea what "writing style" means or if they lack any relevant vocabulary. However, the short answer format makes it less intimidating than a longer essay.

*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   **Describing the *theme* or *content* instead of style:** "The poem is about happiness," "The poet is sad," "It is a love poem."
    *   **Generic positive/negative adjectives:** "Good," "Bad," "Nice."
    *   **Irrelevant words:** "Interesting," "Long," "Short."
    *   **Attempting to use a more complex word but misapplying it:** (e.g., "The poet's style is emotional," where "emotional" might describe the *effect* on the reader or the *tone*, but not strictly the *writing style* in a way that would gain a point). The rubric mentions "descriptive" or "informal," implying a focus on the *mechanics* or *approach* to writing.
    *   **Empty Response:** Similar to other short, analytical questions.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."** This is an analytical question requiring understanding of abstract concepts. Students struggle significantly, even with simpler themes. "Writing style" is arguably more abstract than "theme" for this demographic.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history...** This requires specific factual knowledge and comparison, which is challenging. Students often provide partial answers or misunderstand the distinction. "Writing style" requires applying an analytical lens to a text, which can be seen as similar in difficulty to applying a definition.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season."** This is a creative writing task based on personal experience, which is much easier and allows for simpler English, leading to a higher pass rate even with poor grammar.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is a direct recall question from a story, requiring careful reading and memory. Much easier than analysis.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights...** This is direct factual recall, often taught explicitly, leading to a high pass rate for those who remember.

**Conclusion:**

Describing writing style requires:
1.  Understanding the concept of "writing style."
2.  Analyzing the specific poem for stylistic elements.
3.  Possessing the vocabulary to articulate that style.

Given the students' limited English proficiency, background from economically weaker sections, and the abstract nature of literary analysis, this question presents significant challenges. It's more abstract than recalling facts or even describing a theme (where a simple "love"
