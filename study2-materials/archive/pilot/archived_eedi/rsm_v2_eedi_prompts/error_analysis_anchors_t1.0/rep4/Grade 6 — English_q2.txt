I'll analyze this question based on the provided calibration anchors and common errors among Class 6 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections with limited English.

**Analysis of the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question:** "Who lived inside the book?"
*   **Rubric:** Correctly states that a magical fairy lived inside the book. (Accept: 'a magical fairy', 'fairy')
*   **Max score:** 1

This question is extremely straightforward if the student has read the associated text (which is implied). It asks for a direct recall of a specific detail: the inhabitant of the book.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Not understanding "Who" or "lived":** While these are basic words, some students with very limited English might struggle. "Who" might be confused with "what" or "where." "Lived" might be misunderstood if the context isn't clear (e.g., thinking it asks about the author or characters in general, not specifically *inside* the book). However, given Class 6, "who" and "lived" are generally understood.
2.  **Lack of comprehension of the preceding text:** This is the most critical factor. If the student hasn't understood the story or poem that precedes this question, they won't know the answer. The question itself is simple, but its answer depends entirely on prior reading comprehension.
3.  **Vocabulary related to the answer:** If the answer is "fairy," students might not know how to spell it or might substitute it with a similar word if they only grasp the concept but not the exact term. However, "fairy" is a relatively common word, often encountered in children's stories.
4.  **Attempt but fail:** Students are likely to attempt this question, as it's a direct question requiring a one or two-word answer. They won't leave it blank if they have any idea.
5.  **Common wrong answers:**
    *   **"Book":** Misunderstanding "inside the book" as the answer itself, or not knowing who was inside.
    *   **Names of other characters:** If there were other characters in the story, they might name one of them.
    *   **"No one":** If they completely missed the detail or the story.
    *   **"Author" or "writer":** Confusing the inhabitant of the story with the creator of the story.
    *   **Generic terms:** "A person," "a character."

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."** This requires higher-order thinking, abstract understanding, and ability to articulate a complex idea. Our question is purely factual recall.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources...** This requires understanding two concepts, comparing them, and providing examples. It's multi-part and conceptual. Our question is simpler.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season."** This requires sustained writing, organization of ideas, and personal expression. While it's a common topic, the writing demand is significant. Our question is a single word/phrase answer.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is direct recall, similar to our question in nature. It requires recalling *three specific details*. If a student recalls one or two, they might get partial credit (though the rubric here is binary). The added complexity is recalling *three* distinct things.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India.** This is also direct recall of specific facts. It requires recalling *two* specific names. It's very similar in structure and demand to the "king's questions" but perhaps slightly easier as the names of rights are common.

**Estimation:**

Our question, "Who lived inside the book?", is a direct factual recall from a text. It requires:
1.  Having read and understood the relevant sentence in the preceding text.
2.  Knowing the meaning of "who" and "lived."
3.  Being able to write "fairy" (or "magical fairy").

It is simpler than "three questions the king wanted to answer" (50% pass rate) because it's only *one* specific detail, not three. It's also simpler than "name any two Fundamental Rights" (66% pass rate) for the same reason – one specific recall vs. two.

The main hurdle will be whether students understood the specific sentence in the story where
