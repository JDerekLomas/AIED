The question asks for "one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning." This is a straightforward recall question from a Social Science history chapter.

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

*   **Misconceptions about Social Science:**
    *   **Lack of Specific Knowledge:** The most common error will be simply not knowing the specific features of Harappan urban planning. While students might know *about* the Harappan Civilization, recalling a *key feature of its urban planning* specifically might be a challenge if they haven't memorized it well.
    *   **Confusing with other civilizations:** Less likely for a "key feature" question, but some might vaguely recall general features of ancient cities without specific attribution.
    *   **Focusing on non-urban planning aspects:** Students might describe other features of the Harappan civilization, such as their script, trade, or pottery, rather than urban planning. This would result in a 0.

*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Key feature":** This term should be well understood, meaning an important characteristic.
    *   **"Urban planning":** This phrase might be slightly challenging for some. They might interpret "urban" as "city" and "planning" as "how it was built," which is generally correct. However, if they don't fully grasp "urban planning," they might drift to other aspects of the civilization. Given the context of Class 8, this term is likely part of their curriculum vocabulary.
    *   **"Describe":** This asks for more than just naming; it requires a brief explanation.

*   **Attempt vs. Non-attempt:**
    *   This is a relatively short answer question. Most students who have some knowledge of the topic will attempt it.
    *   Those who have no idea might leave it blank or write something completely irrelevant (e.g., "It was an old civilization").

*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   "Harappan people were good traders." (Irrelevant to urban planning)
    *   "They had a unique script." (Irrelevant to urban planning)
    *   "It was a big civilization." (Too vague, not a "feature")
    *   "They lived near a river." (True, but not a feature of *urban planning*)
    *   Vague answers like "They built good cities" without specifying *how* or *what* was good about the planning.
    *   Mentioning something like the Great Bath without explaining its *planning* aspect (e.g., "The Great Bath was important" vs. "The Great Bath was a large, well-planned public structure in the citadel"). The rubric accepts "advanced drainage system," which the Great Bath contributes to, but a vague mention might not get a point.

**Calibration Anchor Analysis:**

*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each.** This requires understanding two concepts and providing examples. "Urban planning" is one concept, but "key feature" is simpler than "differentiate and give examples." The Harappan question is simpler in structure.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season."** This is a creative writing task requiring more sustained effort and organization. The Harappan question is a factual recall with a much shorter required answer. Students from economically weaker sections often struggle with elaborate creative writing in English.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is a direct recall of specific facts from a story, very similar in cognitive demand. The content is literary (from a story), while the Harappan question is factual from Social Science. The *length* of the answer for the King's questions is slightly more, but the structure is similar: recall specific details.

**Reasoning for Estimation:**

The Harappan Civilization is a foundational topic in Indian history for Class 8. Students are expected to learn its key characteristics. The question asks for *one* key feature, which reduces the burden of recall compared to listing multiple or differentiating. The acceptable answers (grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town) are all prominent and usually taught together.

Given that the "three questions the king wanted to answer" (50% pass rate) is also direct recall but slightly more information to remember, the Harappan question is comparable. However, the Harappan topic is a factual, historical one, which some students might find dryer or less memorable than a story.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% and the calibration points:
*   "Differentiate between sources" (15%) is harder.
*   "Favorite season" (30%) is creative
