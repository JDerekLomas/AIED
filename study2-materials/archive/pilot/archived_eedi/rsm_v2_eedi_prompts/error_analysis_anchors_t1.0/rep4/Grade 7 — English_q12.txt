This question tests a relatively complex grammatical transformation. Given the students' background and the average pass rate, I anticipate a significant number of errors related to both grammatical understanding and English proficiency.

Here's an analysis of likely errors:

*   **Misconceptions about English leading to incorrect answers:**
    *   **Lack of understanding of "voice":** Many students might not grasp the concept of active vs. passive voice at all. They might try to rephrase the sentence without understanding the underlying grammatical rule.
    *   **Incorrect auxiliary verb:** This is a very common error. Students might use the wrong tense of "to be" (e.g., "The leaves are blown," "The leaves blowing") or omit it entirely.
    *   **Incorrect past participle:** "Blown" is an irregular verb. Students might incorrectly use "blowed" or "blewed."
    *   **Incorrect use of "by":** Students might forget "by the wind" or place it incorrectly.
    *   **Subject/object confusion:** While "the leaves" is a relatively straightforward object, some might struggle to make it the new subject.
    *   **Direct translation errors:** Students from various linguistic backgrounds might attempt a direct translation of passive structures from their native languages, which might not align with English rules.

*   **Language misunderstandings:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** While "wind," "blew," "leaves," and "away" are relatively common words, if a student struggles with any of them, it could compound their difficulty with the grammatical transformation.
    *   **Sentence structure:** The instruction "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice" might itself be difficult to understand for some. They might understand "change the sentence" but not "active voice" or "passive voice."

*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   A significant number of students will likely *attempt* this question, as it's a sentence transformation. It doesn't require creative writing or extensive factual recall, which might encourage more attempts than, say, writing a theme.
    *   However, many attempts will be incorrect or incomplete rather than entirely blank. Some might just rewrite the sentence as is, indicating no understanding of the instruction.

*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   "The leaves was blown away by the wind." (Singular 'was' instead of plural 'were')
    *   "The leaves are blown away by the wind." (Incorrect auxiliary verb tense)
    *   "The leaves blowed away by the wind." (Incorrect past participle)
    *   "The leaves blown away." (Missing auxiliary verb and "by the wind")
    *   "The leaves blew away the wind." (Completely incorrect inversion)
    *   "The leaves were blowing away by the wind." (Continuous tense)
    *   Just rewriting "The wind blew the leaves away." (No change)
    *   "Wind the leaves away blew." (Random word order)

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Write a theme...):** This requires abstract thinking and nuanced English expression. Our question is more mechanical.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate...):** This requires specific factual recall and comparison, often in a structured way. Some English proficiency is needed, but the core is content.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Write a paragraph...):** This requires sustained writing, organization, and a moderate level of vocabulary and sentence construction. The expectation is low (e.g., "Winter\nSweater\nBaju" got a score). Our question is a single transformation.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted...):** This requires recall of specific details from a story. If the story was understood, the answer is usually straightforward, even with limited English.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights...):** This is largely factual recall of common terms. Even partially remembered terms often get points.

Our question requires a *specific grammatical transformation* that involves tense agreement, auxiliary verbs, and past participles of irregular verbs. This is a rule-based task, but the rule itself is often challenging for learners. The 30% anchor for paragraph writing suggests a baseline of functional but basic English. The 50% anchor involves recall. This question is somewhere in between factual recall and complex expression.

Students might recognize the need to change the sentence but struggle with the specific mechanics of passive voice. The irregular verb "blew/blown" will be a particular challenge. The core "be + past participle" structure is often difficult to master.

Considering the average pass rate is 29% and the complexity of grammatical transformation, especially with an irregular verb, it's unlikely to
