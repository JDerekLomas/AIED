I'll break down the analysis for the question "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Misconceptions about Natural Resources/Rajasthan:**
    *   **Generic vs. Specific:** Students might list very generic natural resources (e.g., "trees," "animals," "soil") that are found everywhere, rather than focusing on resources characteristic of Rajasthan.
    *   **Lack of regional knowledge:** Many students, even within India, might not have specific geographical knowledge about Rajasthan's resources. Their understanding might be limited to general textbook examples.
    *   **Confusing natural resources with man-made or agricultural products:** They might list crops (e.g., bajra), livestock, or even historical monuments, rather than true natural resources.
    *   **Focusing only on the desert aspect:** While sand/desert is a natural feature, they might struggle to identify *resources* extracted or utilized from it, beyond just "sand."

2.  **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   "Mention any two natural resources": This part is relatively straightforward. "Natural resources" might be a familiar term from EVS/Social Science.
    *   "explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there": This is the more challenging part.
        *   "influences the lives": Requires understanding cause and effect, and the ability to articulate this relationship.
        *   "people there": Links the resource directly to human activity and livelihood.
        *   The need to *explain* rather than just state. Many students might just list an influence without elaboration.

3.  **Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**
    *   Most students will likely attempt this question because "natural resources" is a common topic. They will at least try to list two resources.
    *   The "explanation" part is where many will fail or provide insufficient detail.

4.  **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   **Listing generic resources:** "water, soil," "trees, animals." (Potentially correct if water is linked to Rajasthan's scarcity, but often it'll be too general).
    *   **Listing only one resource correctly:** Missing the "any two" part or only knowing one.
    *   **Listing agricultural products:** "wheat, millet."
    *   **Listing things related to Rajasthan but not natural resources:** "forts, camels."
    *   **Listing resources but failing to explain influence:** "Marble, Copper. People use them." (Too vague, not an explanation).
    *   **Poorly articulated influence:** "Water is important for life." (True, but not specific to Rajasthan or detailed enough).
    *   **Focusing on negative impacts only:** e.g., "Sand causes heat." While true, it doesn't really explain an *influence* in terms of livelihood or societal impact.
    *   **Mixing up influence with just presence:** "There is a lot of sand in Rajasthan." (States presence, not influence).

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and good English expression. This question is less abstract.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** Requires precise definitions and examples, comparing two concepts. This question requires listing and then explaining a single concept's impact. It's conceptually simpler than differentiation.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires creative writing, adhering to a structure, and detailing personal preferences. The current question is more factual and analytical. Students *attempted* this, but many struggled with length/coherence.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is a recall question from a specific story. If they knew the story, it was easy. If not, impossible. The current question draws on general Social Science knowledge and some regional awareness.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Direct recall of specific facts. Very high pass rate, indicating straightforward recall.

**Estimating Pass Rate:**

This question is a mix:
*   **Part 1: Listing two resources:** This is closer to the "Fundamental Rights" type of recall, but with less specific, more regional knowledge required. Many will get one right (water, sand/solar energy). Getting two *correct and distinct* might be harder for some.
*   **Part 2: Explaining influence:** This requires more than just recall; it needs a basic understanding of cause-effect and the ability to articulate it simply. This is where many will falter, making their answer incomplete or insufficiently explained for a full
