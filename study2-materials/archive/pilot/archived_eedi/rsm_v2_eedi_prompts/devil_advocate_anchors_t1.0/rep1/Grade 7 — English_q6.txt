The question asks students to describe the poet's writing style. The rubric is quite lenient, accepting "a suitable and relevant word" like "simple, descriptive, informal, direct."

Let's break down the potential challenges for Class 7 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections with limited English:

1.  **Vocabulary/Concept of "Writing Style":** While the concept itself isn't incredibly abstract, articulating "writing style" with appropriate descriptive words might be difficult. Many students might struggle to move beyond simply summarizing the content of the poem.
2.  **English Proficiency:** Even if they understand the poem's content, finding an *English word* to describe the *style* (e.g., "descriptive," "simple") might be beyond their active vocabulary. The calibration anchors show a significant struggle with even basic sentence construction and spelling.
3.  **Prior Instruction:** Have they been explicitly taught how to analyze and describe a poet's writing style in English? This is often a higher-level literary analysis skill.
4.  **Poem Context:** The poem "The Last Bargain" (from the 5% pass rate item) is by Rabindranath Tagore. Without the poem itself, it's hard to judge how accessible its style is. However, given the 5% pass rate for identifying a *theme*, understanding the nuances of the *style* might be even harder.
5.  **Simplicity vs. Depth:** While the rubric accepts "simple," students might not naturally think to use such a word, or they might struggle to connect it to the act of writing.
6.  **Comparison to Anchors:**
    *   **5% pass rate (Theme of "The Last Bargain"):** This suggests a deep struggle with interpreting and articulating even the central message of the poem. Describing its *style* seems like a step up in abstraction.
    *   **15% pass rate (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** This is factual recall/differentiation, which is a different skill.
    *   **30% pass rate (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This is creative writing on a personal topic, allowing for more flexibility in language and less analytical thought. Students could get points for very basic sentences.
    *   **50% pass rate (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is direct recall from a story, likely explicitly stated in the text. This is much easier than abstracting a "writing style."
    *   **66% pass rate (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is factual recall, highly memorized content, which is typically the easiest type of question for these students.

The question requires an analytical skill (identifying a style) and a specific vocabulary (words like "descriptive," "simple"). Given the very low pass rates on tasks requiring interpretation and articulation of abstract ideas (like theme, 5%), and the general struggles with English demonstrated in the anchors, this question seems quite challenging. Many students might either leave it blank, attempt to summarize the poem's content again, or use irrelevant words. Even if the style *is* simple, articulating that simplicity in an academic context is difficult.

I initially thought it might be around 20-25% because "simple" is an easy word. However, looking at the "theme" question (5%), which requires understanding the poem and articulating an idea, describing the *style* is likely equally or more challenging. The student has to understand the poem, then abstract its characteristic, then find the correct English word. The common pitfalls (limited English, lack of explicit instruction in style analysis, exam anxiety) will significantly depress scores.

I am challenging my assumption that "simple" is an easy enough word for them to apply. It's not just knowing the word, but applying it correctly in this specific analytical context.

Therefore, it will be quite low. Perhaps not as low as 5% for "theme" if the style is genuinely *very* obviously simple, but still very challenging.

Final estimate: It requires analytical thought and specific vocabulary, which are significant hurdles.
