The question requires a grammatical transformation from active to passive voice. This is a specific grammatical rule that students would need to have learned and practiced.

Considering the calibration anchors:
*   **5% pass rate (Theme of a poem):** Requires abstract thinking and expressing it in English. Very difficult.
*   **15% pass rate (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires recall of definitions and examples, and the ability to differentiate.
*   **30% pass rate (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires basic paragraph construction, simple sentence formation, and personal expression. This is closer to what one might expect most students to attempt, even if poorly.
*   **50% pass rate (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Requires recall of specific facts from a story, likely a direct quote or close paraphrase.
*   **66% pass rate (Two Fundamental Rights):** Requires recall of specific facts (names of rights). Many students can recall at least two.

The question "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away" falls into the category of a specific grammatical transformation. While the active sentence is simple, the passive transformation involves:
1.  Identifying the subject, verb, and object.
2.  Changing the object to the new subject.
3.  Using the correct form of "to be" (were, as "leaves" is plural and past tense).
4.  Using the past participle of the main verb ("blown").
5.  Adding "by the wind."

Many students in these schools struggle significantly with English grammar, especially specific transformations like active/passive voice, direct/indirect speech, or complex tenses, if they haven't been drilled extensively on that exact structure. The "blown" (past participle of blow) might also be a stumbling block.

Comparing it to the anchors:
*   It's harder than simply recalling two facts (66%, 50%).
*   It's likely harder than writing a simple paragraph on a familiar topic (30%), because that allows for some creative freedom even with poor grammar. This question demands a very specific grammatical structure.
*   It's probably comparable to or slightly easier than differentiating sources (15%), which requires definitional recall and application. It's definitely easier than finding a theme (5%).

Given the average pass rate is 29%, and this specific grammar transformation can be tricky for students with limited English exposure and inconsistent instruction, I'd expect it to be below the average. Students might get parts right (e.g., "The leaves were blown"), but miss "by the wind" or struggle with "blown." Many might also simply provide a literal translation or attempt to rearrange words without the correct auxiliary verb and participle.

Considering the "teachers and experts overestimate" warning: my initial instinct might be higher, but realizing the specific demands of correct past participle and auxiliary verb for students with limited English pulls it down.
