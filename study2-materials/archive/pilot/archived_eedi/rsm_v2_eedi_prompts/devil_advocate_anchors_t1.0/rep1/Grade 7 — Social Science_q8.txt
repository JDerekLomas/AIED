I will use the provided calibration anchors to estimate the pass rate for the given question.

**Analysis of the target question:** "What are the main occupations of people in the rural areas of Rajasthan? Describe any one in brief."
*   **Knowledge required:** Basic general knowledge about Indian geography and economy, specifically Rajasthan. This is likely covered in Social Science or EVS.
*   **English proficiency required:**
    *   Understanding "main occupations," "rural areas," "Rajasthan," and "describe in brief."
    *   Ability to name two occupations (e.g., "farming," "animal husbandry").
    *   Ability to write a very short descriptive sentence for one (e.g., "Farming involves growing crops like wheat and millet.").
*   **Difficulty factors:**
    *   Students might know "farming" but struggle with "animal husbandry" or "handicrafts" in English.
    *   Even if they know the occupations, describing one "in brief" requires slightly more complex sentence construction than just listing.
    *   General knowledge about specific states like Rajasthan might be strong for some, but weaker for others, especially if the curriculum doesn't emphasize specific state-level details uniformly.

**Comparing with calibration anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5%:** "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" This requires abstract thinking, understanding a poem (which can be challenging even with good English), and articulating a "theme" which is a higher-order skill. This is significantly harder than the target question.
*   **Pass rate 15%:** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each." This requires understanding specific terminology ("differentiate," "archaeological," "literary sources"), and providing examples. The concept is quite specific. The target question is more general knowledge.
*   **Pass rate 30%:** "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.' Talk about what you like to do, what you eat or wear, and w" This is a descriptive writing task about a personal topic. While it allows for simple English, writing 6-8 lines and including specific details is more demanding than listing two occupations and briefly describing one. However, the topic is very accessible. The target question requires specific factual recall.
*   **Pass rate 50%:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" This is a direct recall question from a story, likely one they've read. It requires memorization of specific details. The target question also requires recall, but of general knowledge, not a specific text. The English required for the 50% item is very minimal (just listing the questions).
*   **Pass rate 66%:** "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India." This is a direct recall question of specific facts (names of rights). The English required is just listing two phrases. This is similar in structure (list two things) to the target question's first part.

**Calibrating the estimate:**

*   The target question is easier than the 5%, 15%, and 30% items due to less abstract thinking, less complex English, and less extensive writing required.
*   It's comparable to, but slightly harder than, the 50% item ("three questions the king wanted to answer") because while both are recall, the 50% item is from a specific story they've likely just read, making recall easier. The target question relies on broader general knowledge.
*   It's harder than the 66% item ("Name any two Fundamental Rights") because while both require listing two things, the "Fundamental Rights" are very specific terms likely memorized, and the second part of the target question ("Describe any one in brief") requires a short descriptive sentence, which adds a layer of difficulty beyond simple recall. Many students might struggle with formulating that brief description in correct English.

Considering these points, the ability to list two occupations might be around the 50-60% mark, but the added requirement to "describe any one in brief" in coherent English will pull the pass rate down. Students might list "farmer" and "cow," but describing "cow" as an occupation would be incorrect. They need to articulate "animal husbandry."

Many students might list "farming" and "labor," but "labor" isn't specific enough as a main occupation in the context of the others. The specificity required for "animal husbandry" or "handicrafts" could be a hurdle. Also, the brief description requirement will trip up many who can only provide single words or very broken English.

I initially thought this would be around 40-45%, but remembering the "limited English" and "basic concepts aren't basic" warnings
