Given the calibration anchors and the context of Class 8 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections with limited English, here's my reasoning for the estimate:

1.  **Nature of the Question:** It's a basic algebraic equation. While conceptually simple, it involves negative numbers, which can be a stumbling block for students who might be less comfortable with number lines or integer operations.
2.  **English Language Requirement:** The question itself is very short and uses common mathematical terms (`find the value of`, `in the equation`). This is not a significant barrier compared to the poem analysis or history differentiation questions.
3.  **Prior Knowledge/Curriculum:** Solving linear equations like `y + 9 = 4` is typically introduced in Class 6 or 7 and reinforced in Class 8. So, students *should* have encountered this concept.
4.  **Common Errors:**
    *   **"Flip and add" error:** A common mistake is to see `y + 9 = 4` and incorrectly think `y = 9 + 4 = 13` or `y = 9 - 4 = 5`.
    *   **Negative number difficulty:** The most likely error is getting `y = 5` instead of `y = -5` due to confusion with subtracting a larger number from a smaller one, or not understanding how to move the `+9` across the equals sign to become `-9`.
    *   **Blank responses:** Exam anxiety and lack of confidence in algebra can still lead to blank responses, even for what seems like a simple problem to an adult.
5.  **Calibration Anchors Analysis:**
    *   **5% (Poem Theme):** Requires abstract thinking, nuanced English comprehension, and expressing complex ideas. Much harder.
    *   **15% (Differentiate History Sources):** Requires specific knowledge, comparative analysis, and structured examples. English is a moderate barrier.
    *   **30% (Paragraph on Favorite Season):** Requires sustained writing, personal expression, and vocabulary. Fairly high English demand.
    *   **50% (Three Questions the King Wanted to Answer):** Requires recalling specific factual information from a story. English comprehension is key, but the answer is usually verbatim or very close. This is a recall task.
    *   **66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Requires specific factual recall. Lower English demand for the answer itself, but understanding the question is critical. The "fill in the blank" nature makes it easier.

**Challenging Assumptions:**
My first instinct might be "Most students should get this, it's basic algebra." However, remembering the "limited English," "economically weaker sections," and "average pass rate 29%" contexts is crucial.
*   "Basic" for a fluent English speaker from a privileged background is not "basic" for a student struggling with foundational math concepts in a non-native language.
*   The step `4 - 9 = -5` is where many will falter. Many might try to rearrange it as `9 - 4 = 5` because they are uncomfortable with negative results.
*   Compared to recalling names or facts (50-66% items), this requires an *operation* and understanding of integer rules, which is often harder than mere recall.
*   It's a step up from simple arithmetic, requiring an understanding of the balance of an equation.

**Re-evaluation:**
The question is short and the math is ostensibly simple, but the negative number result is a significant hurdle. It's more complex than recalling facts (50-66% items) but less demanding in terms of English or multi-step reasoning than the 5-30% items. The most common incorrect answer would likely be `y = 5` or `y = 13`. Given the average pass rate of 29% and the documented tendency for students to struggle with negative numbers and algebraic manipulation, even simple ones, I anticipate it will be harder than the factual recall questions.

I would place it somewhere between the "Favorite Season" paragraph (30%) and the "King's Questions" (50%), leaning closer to the lower end due to the specific arithmetic challenge of negative numbers. It's definitely harder than the 50% and 66% items because it's not pure recall; it requires a correct mathematical operation involving integers.

Let's consider:
- Students who understand the concept of isolating 'y' but make an arithmetic error with `4-9`. (Many)
- Students who don't understand how to isolate 'y' at all. (Some)
- Students who leave it blank. (Some)

Given the average pass rate is 29% and this question requires a specific *calculation* with a negative
