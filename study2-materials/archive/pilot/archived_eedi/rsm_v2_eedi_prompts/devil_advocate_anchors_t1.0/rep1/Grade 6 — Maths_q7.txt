I'll break down my thought process for estimating the pass rate for this question.

1.  **Analyze the Question:**
    *   **Subject:** Math (basic arithmetic, time calculation, temperature change).
    *   **Language:** Relatively straightforward English. "Temperature," "increases by," "per hour," "at 4:00 in the evening" are common phrases. The numbers are clear.
    *   **Core Tasks:**
        1.  Calculate the time difference between 10 am and 4 pm. This is crucial.
        2.  Multiply the hourly increase by the time difference.
        3.  Add this increase to the starting temperature.
    *   **Complexity:**
        *   Time calculation across AM/PM can be tricky for some. 10 am to 12 pm (2 hours), then 12 pm to 4 pm (4 hours) = 6 hours. Or 4 pm = 16:00 in 24-hour format, so 16 - 10 = 6 hours. Both require a basic understanding of time.
        *   Multiplication and addition are simple whole numbers.
        *   Units (`^0 C`, `per hour`) are consistent.

2.  **Consider the Target Audience (Class 6 Indian Government School, EWS, Limited English, 29% average pass rate):**
    *   **English:** The vocabulary is not overly complex, but "increases by *per hour*" requires understanding the rate concept. "in the evening" helps distinguish from "am."
    *   **Math Skills:**
        *   Adding/subtracting whole numbers: Expected at this level.
        *   Multiplying whole numbers: Expected.
        *   Time calculation: This is the most likely stumbling block. Understanding 10 am to 4 pm as 6 hours, especially across the noon transition, can be a challenge for students who struggle with abstract concepts or haven't had strong time-telling instruction. Many students might just do 4 - 10 (get a negative or just struggle), or 10 - 4 (get 6, but then apply it incorrectly), or simply count on their fingers which could lead to errors.
    *   **Common Pitfalls:**
        *   Miscalculating the time difference (e.g., 4 hours, 5 hours, or 7 hours).
        *   Forgetting to add the initial temperature (just giving the increase).
        *   Sustaining attention for a multi-step problem.
        *   Exam anxiety leading to blank responses.

3.  **Calibrate Against Anchors:**

    *   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, inference, and decent English comprehension of a poem. Very difficult. This math problem is much more concrete.
    *   **Pass Rate 15% (Archaeological vs. Literary sources):** Requires conceptual understanding, specific examples, and comparative thinking. This is more about recalling structured knowledge and applying it. The math problem is procedural.
    *   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph "My favorite season"):** Open-ended writing, requires sentence construction, vocabulary, and idea generation within specific prompts. This is difficult due to English writing demands. The math problem avoids significant writing barriers.
    *   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Requires specific recall of a story detail. If they read the story and remembered, it's easy. If not, impossible. The English is simple recall. This math problem requires *calculation*, not just recall.
    *   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Direct recall of a very important civic concept. If taught and remembered, it's easy. If not, impossible. The language is direct.

4.  **Synthesize and Estimate:**

    *   The question has clear numbers and a direct instruction, which helps compared to abstract English or open-ended writing.
    *   The math operations (multiplication, addition) are basic.
    *   The primary challenge is accurately calculating the time difference (10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours). This specific skill might not be universally solid.
    *   It's a multi-step problem, which means more chances for errors or giving up.
    *   Comparing to the anchors:
        *   It's definitely easier than the 5%, 15%, and 30% items because it's less reliant on abstract English comprehension or creative output.
        *   It's harder than the 50% and 66% items because those were often direct recall (assuming the student was present and paid attention to the material). This question requires *
