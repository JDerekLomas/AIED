I will estimate the proportion of Class 7 students in Indian government schools who would answer the question correctly.

**Analyzing the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question:** "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it."
*   **Rubric:** "Student writes a complete paragraph that clearly mentions the hobby, when it is done, and why it is enjoyable." (Max score: 1)

**Key Challenges for Students:**

1.  **Paragraph Structure (4-5 sentences):** This is a significant hurdle. Many students struggle with writing multiple coherent sentences, let alone organizing them into a paragraph. The "My favorite season" example (pass rate 30%) shows responses like "Winter Sweater Baju Hot water Tea Gever feali Hat" or fragments, indicating difficulty with sentence formation and paragraph length.
2.  **English Proficiency:** The instruction to "mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it" requires specific vocabulary and grammatical structures (e.g., expressing enjoyment, frequency). Given "limited English" and an average pass rate of 29%, expressing these ideas clearly will be tough for many.
3.  **Topic Familiarity:** While "favourite hobby" seems common, some students might not have a distinct, easily articulable hobby, or the English words to describe it.
4.  **"Complete Paragraph" requirement:** This implies not just individual sentences, but a logical flow and connection between them. This is often an advanced skill for these learners.

**Comparing with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"My favorite season" (pass rate 30%):** This is the closest anchor. It also asks for a short paragraph (6-8 lines) and specific details (what you like to do, eat/wear).
    *   The "My favorite season" question has a slightly longer paragraph requirement (6-8 lines vs. 4-5 sentences), which might make it harder.
    *   However, the *prompt itself* for "My favorite season" is arguably more concrete ("what you like to do, what you eat or wear") compared to "why you enjoy it," which requires more abstract expression.
    *   The pass rate of 30% for "My favorite season" is achieved with responses that are often fragmented or very basic. The "My favorite hobby" rubric also asks for a *complete paragraph* and *clearly mentions* the elements.

*   **"Three questions the king wanted to answer?" (pass rate 50%):** This is a recall question, often easier than composition. Students just need to pull specific phrases from memory.
*   **"Two Fundamental Rights" (pass rate 66%):** Pure recall, often rote memorization.
*   **"Differentiate archaeological/literary sources" (pass rate 15%):** Requires definitions and examples, often a more complex cognitive task, especially with subject-specific vocabulary.
*   **"Theme of 'The Last Bargain'" (pass rate 5%):** Highly abstract, requiring interpretation and advanced vocabulary/analytical skills.

**Revisiting "My favorite season" (30%):**

The pass rate for "My favorite season" at 30% suggests that many students struggle to produce even 6-8 *lines*, let alone coherent sentences. The example responses for 30% are often lists or very simple sentences.

The current question asks for a *paragraph* of 4-5 *sentences* and explicitly states "complete paragraph" and "clearly mentions." This implies a higher standard than some of the responses scored 3 for "My favorite season."

Given the "limited English," the difficulty of composing coherent sentences and linking them to form a paragraph, and the need to express abstract ideas like "why you enjoy it," I expect the performance to be similar to, if not slightly lower than, "My favorite season." The reduction in paragraph length from 6-8 lines to 4-5 sentences might offer a slight ease, but the requirement for a "complete paragraph" and clear articulation of "why you enjoy it" still presents a significant challenge.

I initially might think it's easier, but considering the anchor of "My favorite season" at 30% and the struggle with paragraph composition and English expression for these students, it's a demanding task. Many will likely write 1-2 sentences, list words, or fail to connect the ideas.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Considering the 30% anchor for a similar paragraph writing task, and the explicit need for a "complete paragraph" and expressing enjoyment, which can be harder for students with limited English than just listing activities/food/clothing. The slight reduction in sentence count might balance this out
