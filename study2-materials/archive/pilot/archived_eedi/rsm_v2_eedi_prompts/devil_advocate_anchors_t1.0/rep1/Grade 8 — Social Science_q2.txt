I'll analyze the question and rubric against the calibration anchors, keeping in mind the characteristics of the student population (economically weaker, limited English, average 29% pass rate, exam anxiety, no specific question type practice).

**Question Analysis:**
"Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

*   **Content:** Harappan Civilization and urban planning are specific historical concepts taught in Class 8. Students might have learned about this.
*   **English Difficulty:** "Describe one key feature" is a relatively straightforward instruction. "Urban planning" might be a moderately difficult phrase for some, but "Harappan Civilization" is a proper noun they should recognize.
*   **Response Expected:** A short, factual answer (one sentence or a phrase). Examples in the rubric (grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town) are common facts.
*   **Cognitive Demand:** Recalling a specific fact and expressing it. This is recall, not analysis or synthesis.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires interpretation and abstract thinking, which is very hard for this group. "Happiness is find in innocence" shows a basic grasp but struggles with expression. This question is *much easier* than this.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** Requires understanding two concepts and comparing them, plus providing examples. "Material or physical evidence | written" shows very concise, sometimes fragmented, but correct understanding. This question is *easier* than this one because it only asks for *one* feature, not differentiation of two concepts with examples.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Short paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires sustained writing (6-8 lines) and elaboration. Students struggle with this, often giving fragmented lists. "Winter, Sweater, Baju..." is an example of fragmented success. Our target question only needs one factual sentence. This question is *easier* than this one because it's less demanding in terms of English expression and length.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is a direct recall question from a specific story. Students can often pull out phrases directly from memory. "the right time to do everything, the right thing to do and the right people to work with" is a good example of recall. Our target question is similar in cognitive demand (direct recall of a fact).
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Name any two Fundamental Rights):** Another direct recall question. "Right of to equality, Right to freedom" shows students can list these. The question is very specific and factual. Our target question asks for *one* feature, which is even less demanding than two.

**Revisiting Assumptions & Challenging Instincts:**

My initial instinct might be closer to 50-60%, because "Harappan urban planning" is a key topic. However, considering the calibration anchors and student profile:

*   **Limited English:** While the concepts are taught, expressing them concisely and correctly can be a hurdle. "Advanced drainage system" might be rendered as "good water system" or "drainage pipe good." This would likely be accepted.
*   **"Basic" concepts:** What's basic for experts isn't basic for all. Some students might remember the name but not specific features, or mix them up.
*   **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** Even for a simple question, some students will leave it blank. The 50% and 66% anchors still have students who don't score.
*   **No specific question type practice:** While they might have learned the facts, they might not be used to this precise "describe one feature" format, though it's relatively common.

The question is a direct recall of a specific historical fact. It doesn't require complex English or extended writing. It's most comparable to the 50% anchor (king's questions) or 66% anchor (Fundamental Rights) in terms of cognitive load (recall specific information). The difference is that Harappan civilization might be slightly less universally ingrained than Fundamental Rights (which are more civics-related and perhaps discussed more broadly). However, it's *one* feature, not two or three.

If students can recall "the right time to do everything, the right thing to do and the right people to work with" (50%), or "Right to equality, Right to freedom" (66%), they should be able to recall "grid layout" or "drainage system." The 66% item asks for *two* rights, while this asks for *one* feature. This suggests it should be at least as high as 50%, potentially higher.

Let's consider common pitfalls:
