I'll start by analyzing the question and the target demographic.

**Question:** Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence: book/reading/a/is/he

**Rubric:** Arranges words into 'He is reading a book.' (subject-verb-object format)
Max score: 1

**Target Demographic:** Class 6 students in Indian government schools, mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English. Average pass rate is about 29%.

**Analysis of the Question's Difficulty:**

*   **Grammar:** This question tests basic English sentence structure (subject-verb-object). "He is reading a book" is a very common and simple sentence.
*   **Vocabulary:** All words are extremely common and should be known by Class 6 students: "book," "reading," "a," "is," "he."
*   **Task Type:** Rearranging words is a common exercise in English language learning.
*   **Cognitive Load:** The sentence is short (5 words) and straightforward. There are no complex clauses or unusual word order.

**Challenging Initial Instincts:**

My first instinct might be that this is very easy, almost everyone would get it. However, the calibration anchors and the description of the students' English proficiency force me to re-evaluate:

*   **Limited English:** While the words are basic, putting them in the correct grammatical order can still be a challenge for students whose primary language is not English and who have limited exposure. They might struggle with the "is" placement, or even the subject-verb agreement implicitly.
*   **"Basic" isn't basic:** What seems basic to a fluent English speaker might not be for these students. They might know the individual words but not the rules for combining them into a grammatically correct sentence.
*   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** Even for a simple question, anxiety can lead to blank or incorrect responses. The 50% pass rate item ("What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?") shows that even questions requiring recall of fairly direct information can be missed.
*   **Lack of Practice:** While word rearrangement is common, these specific students might not have had extensive practice with it, or might struggle to apply the rules.
*   **Common Errors:** Students might produce "He reading is a book" or "A book he is reading" or similar permutations, especially if they are translating directly from a different grammatical structure in their native language.

**Comparing to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** This requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and expression, which is significantly harder. This question is much easier.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires understanding two distinct concepts, recalling definitions, and providing examples. This is factual recall and analytical, harder than sentence rearrangement.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires sustained writing, creativity, organization, and adherence to specific prompts (6-8 lines, what to do/eat/wear). While the content is personal, the sustained writing and organization make it harder. This question is much simpler.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is direct recall from a story. If students read and understood the story, it should be straightforward. The fact that 50% missed it highlights issues with reading comprehension, memory, or simply not having read the text.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is factual recall of specific terms. If taught, it's a matter of remembering. The highest pass rate implies it's a concept that is often drilled or easily remembered.

Our question sits below the 66% anchor because "Fundamental Rights" are likely explicitly taught and memorized. Sentence structure, while fundamental, is often implicitly learned through exposure rather than explicitly memorized as a fact. However, it's more direct and less prone to misinterpretation or complex recall than the 50% anchor.

The "He is reading a book" sentence structure is one of the very first things taught in English. It's canonical. Many students would have seen this exact sentence or very similar ones. The challenge is in the *active construction* rather than simple recall.

Considering the limited English proficiency and the general struggle shown by the low average pass rate, I would place it somewhere between the 50% (recall of story details) and 66% (recall of specific rights) anchors, leaning towards the higher end given its extreme simplicity *if* the basic SVO structure is internalized. It's a foundational skill.

However, the warnings about teachers overestimating difficulty and the "barely reads English" student are crucial. A student who "barely reads English" might
