I'll analyze the question and rubric against the provided calibration anchors, keeping in mind the characteristics of the students (economically weaker, limited English, average pass rate 29%) and the tendency for overestimation.

**Question:** Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?
**Rubric:** Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why.
**Max score:** 1.5

Let's break down the requirements and potential difficulties:

1.  **"Denotes a line from the poem":**
    *   This requires recalling or identifying a specific line from the poem "The Last Bargain."
    *   Students need to understand what "line from the poem" means, which might not be trivial for struggling readers.
    *   Some might paraphrase or describe a scene rather than quoting a specific line.
    *   The poem itself might be a barrier if they didn't understand it well in the first place.

2.  **"mentions why":**
    *   This requires expressing a personal preference and providing a reason.
    *   The "why" needs to be understandable, even if simple.
    *   Limited English proficiency will severely impact their ability to articulate a coherent "why."
    *   Many students might struggle to formulate a reason beyond "I like it" or "it's good."

**Comparison with Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."**
    *   This question requires deep comprehension and abstract thinking, which is very hard. Our question is less abstract but still requires recall and explanation. The "theme" question is harder.

*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each.**
    *   This requires factual recall and conceptual understanding, plus the ability to differentiate and provide examples. It's quite specific and academic. Our question is more personal but still requires recall and justification. The "differentiate" question is likely harder due to its academic nature and multiple components.

*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season." Talk about what you like to do, what you eat or wear, and w**
    *   This is a creative writing task on a familiar topic, with clear prompts. It's personal and allows for simple sentences.
    *   Students can often produce *something* for this, even if it's just a list as seen in the example ("Winter\nSweater\nBaju\nHot water\nTea").
    *   Our question is *similar* in requiring a personal response and justification, but it adds the hurdle of *recalling a specific line from a poem*. This is a significant difference. While "My favorite season" can be answered with basic vocabulary, articulating *why* a specific poem line is liked requires more nuanced English and comprehension of the poem.

*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?**
    *   This requires factual recall from a story. If they understood the story, finding these three questions is relatively straightforward. There's no interpretation or personal opinion required, just memory. The English needed is just to list them. This is easier than our question.

*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India.**
    *   This is pure factual recall of specific terms. It's direct and requires minimal English beyond listing the terms. This is significantly easier than our question.

**Calibration:**

Our question falls somewhere between the "favorite season" (30%) and the "theme of the poem" (5%).
*   It's harder than "favorite season" because it demands recall of a *specific line from a poem* (which implies understanding that poem) *and* the articulation of a reason *in relation to that specific line*. "Favorite season" is entirely self-referential and allows for very simple English.
*   It's easier than "theme of the poem" because it's asking for a personal preference and a *reason*, not an abstract interpretation of the entire poem's central message. The "why" can be simpler than a "theme."

The key difficulty will be the combination:
1.  **Recalling a specific line:** Many students might just write *about* the poem generally or pick a common phrase that isn't a direct quote.
2.  **Articulating the "why" in English:** Even if they know *why* in their native language, translating that into simple but coherent English will be a major hurdle. Many responses might be "I like this line
