I will analyze the question and the calibration anchors, keeping in mind the student demographics and common pitfalls.

**The Question:** "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away."

**Rubric:** "The student correctly transforms the sentence into passive voice: 'The leaves were blown away by the wind.'" (Max score: 1)

**Analysis:**

*   **Concept:** Active to Passive voice conversion. This is a grammatical concept taught in English language classes.
*   **Vocabulary:** "wind," "blew" (past tense of blow), "leaves," "away." All are common words.
*   **Complexity:**
    *   Identifying the subject ("the wind"), verb ("blew"), and object ("the leaves").
    *   Knowing the passive voice structure (object + be verb + past participle + by + subject).
    *   Correctly using the past tense "were" for "leaves" (plural).
    *   Correctly identifying "blown" as the past participle of "blow."
    *   Including "by the wind."

**Considering the Student Demographics and Pitfalls:**

1.  **Limited English Proficiency:** While the words are common, the grammatical transformation itself can be challenging. Many students might understand the individual words but struggle with the syntactic rearrangement and verb form changes.
2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** Active/Passive voice is often considered a fundamental grammar topic. However, for students with a weak foundation, it's not. They might confuse tenses, forget auxiliary verbs, or struggle with past participles (e.g., "blowed" instead of "blown").
3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** As seen in the anchors, blank responses are common, especially for questions requiring specific grammatical transformations.
4.  **Lack of Practice:** Students might have been taught this but not practiced it enough, or not practiced this *exact* sentence structure.
5.  **Focus on memorization vs. application:** Students might be better at rote memorization than applying rules to new sentences.

**Calibrating with Anchors:**

*   **5% Anchor (Theme of a poem):** Requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and expression. Very difficult for students with limited English.
*   **15% Anchor (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** Requires conceptual understanding, recall, and ability to give examples. "Material or physical evidence | written" shows a basic grasp. This is recall of factual knowledge.
*   **30% Anchor (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires personal expression, sentence construction, and adherence to a topic. "Winter / Sweater / Baju / Hot water / Tea" shows a fragmented but somewhat relevant response. "Rainy season is my favorite season. I am so enjoy the Rainy season. fastly Growing plants and " shows attempt at full sentences, but with errors.
*   **50% Anchor (King's three questions):** Requires factual recall from a story. "the right time to do everything, the right thing to do and the right people to work with" shows perfect recall of key phrases, even if not a full sentence. This is pure recall.
*   **66% Anchor (Two Fundamental Rights):** Requires factual recall from civics. "Right of to equality / Right to freedom." is correct. This is also pure recall.

**Comparison to the Target Question:**

The target question is *not* pure factual recall like the 50% and 66% anchors. It requires application of a grammatical rule, similar to the paragraph writing (30%) in terms of generating new text, but more constrained and rule-based. It's more complex than simply listing facts.

*   Many students might know "Passive Voice" exists but struggle with the application.
*   Common errors will likely include:
    *   Incorrect auxiliary verb (e.g., "The leaves was blown...").
    *   Incorrect past participle (e.g., "The leaves were blowed...").
    *   Omitting "by the wind."
    *   Retaining active voice structure or mixing tenses.
    *   Leaving it blank due to confusion.

This is more difficult than simple recall (50-66%) but less abstract than writing a theme (5%). It's more prescriptive than writing a paragraph (30%) but requires more precise grammatical knowledge than differentiating sources (15%).

Given the limited English, the need for correct auxiliary verb, past participle, and sentence structure, many will likely fail to get the exact phrasing required by the rubric. While they might get *parts* right, the rubric asks for a *correct transformation*.

I expect a significant portion to either leave it blank, attempt it with incorrect verb forms, or omit key parts ("
