I will break down the thought process for estimating the pass rate for the given question, using the provided calibration anchors and considering the student demographic.

**1. Analyze the Question:**
*   **Core Task:** Identify two natural resources in Rajasthan AND explain the influence of *one* of them.
*   **Knowledge Required:**
    *   Basic geographical knowledge of Rajasthan (what natural resources are found there).
    *   Basic understanding of "natural resources" and "influence on lives."
    *   Ability to connect a resource to its impact.
*   **English Difficulty:**
    *   "Mention," "natural resources," "explain," "influences," "lives of the people." These are relatively common words, but "influences" might be a stretch for some. "Explain how one of them influences" requires a causal link, which is more complex than just listing.
*   **Expected Response Structure:** A list of two resources, followed by a sentence or two explaining one.

**2. Evaluate Against Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Very abstract, requires deep comprehension and articulation. Our question is more concrete. This is much harder than our question.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires understanding two concepts and comparing them, with examples. This is conceptual and requires structured thinking. Our question is less abstract but still requires two parts: identification and explanation.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires creative writing, personal expression, and adherence to a structure (6-8 lines, specific details). Many students struggle with sustained writing. Our question is factual and explanatory, not creative. The examples show *very* basic attempts. This might be comparable in the "explanation" part, but the "listing" part of our question is easier.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is recall from a story. If they remember the story, it's straightforward. If not, it's a blank. This tests memory of specific text. Our question requires general knowledge. Many students could likely recall the core elements of a story if they'd heard it.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is direct recall of specific factual information. If they learned it, they can list it. Very straightforward. Our question is similar in the "listing two resources" part, but adds an "explanation."

**3. Initial Gut Feeling & Challenging Assumptions:**

*   **Initial Gut:** "Natural resources" is a common topic in social studies. Rajasthan is a prominent state. Many students might know one or two resources (e.g., water scarcity, sand, maybe marble). Explaining the *influence* of one might be harder.
*   **Challenging Assumptions:**
    *   **Limited English:** "Influences" and "explain how" can trip students up. They might list resources but fail to explain the impact, or explain it very poorly.
    *   **"Basic" isn't basic:** While "natural resources" is a fundamental topic, linking them causally to people's lives (e.g., "water scarcity leads to dry farming and migration" vs. just "water is important") requires more than rote memorization.
    *   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** Some will simply draw a blank for Rajasthan.
    *   **Never practiced this exact question type:** They might have listed resources, but not necessarily practiced *explaining their influence*.
    *   **Rural context:** Many might associate Rajasthan with desert and water scarcity. They might list "sand" or "desert" but struggle to phrase it as a "resource" or explain its direct *influence* beyond "it's hot." However, they might also know about specific minerals if their region is known for it.

**4. Refined Comparison and Estimation:**

*   **"Listing two resources" part:** This is similar in difficulty to "two Fundamental Rights" (66% pass rate), but perhaps slightly harder because it's general knowledge about a specific region, not a core constitutional fact. Let's say 40-50% could list *at least one* correct resource, and perhaps 30-40% could list two.
*   **"Explain how one influences lives" part:** This is where the difficulty significantly increases.
    *   It's harder than simply recalling three questions (50%).
    *   It's likely harder than writing a simple paragraph on a favorite season (30%), because that's personal, whereas this requires a factual explanation. The *quality* of explanation needed for a pass is key here. The "winter sweater" example for 30% pass suggests
