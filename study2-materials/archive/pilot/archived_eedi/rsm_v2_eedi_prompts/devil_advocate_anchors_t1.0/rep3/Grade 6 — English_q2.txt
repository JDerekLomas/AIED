I'll analyze the question and rubric against the calibration anchors, keeping in mind the characteristics of Class 6 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency.

**Question:** "Who lived inside the book?"
**Rubric:** Correctly states that a magical fairy lived inside the book. (Accept: 'a magical fairy', 'fairy')
**Max score:** 1

**Analysis:**

1.  **Vocabulary and Reading Comprehension:** The question uses simple, direct English: "Who lived inside the book?" This is very accessible. The challenge will be if the source text (which isn't provided, but is implied to be a story they've read) also uses simple language to state who lived inside the book. Assuming the story is at a Class 6 level, the key information ("fairy" or "magical fairy") should be explicitly stated and easy to locate.

2.  **Recall:** This is a direct recall question. Students just need to remember one specific detail from a story. This is generally easier than synthesis, analysis, or creative writing.

3.  **English Production:** Students only need to write one or two words ("fairy" or "a magical fairy"). This is much simpler than writing a paragraph (30% item), differentiating concepts (15% item), or explaining a theme (5% item). Even a student with very limited English can likely produce "fairy" if they recall it.

4.  **Comparison to Anchors:**
    *   **50% Anchor ("What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"):** This question also requires direct recall of specific details. The answer is longer than "fairy," but it's still about retrieving information. The pass rate of 50% suggests that direct recall questions from a specific text are manageable for about half the students, even with slightly more to write.
    *   **66% Anchor ("Name any two Fundamental Rights..."):** This requires recalling two specific phrases/concepts. Again, direct recall. The higher pass rate indicates that if the information is explicitly taught and easily retrievable, a good proportion can answer.
    *   **30% Anchor (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This requires sentence construction, organization, and more complex English. Our question is far simpler.
    *   **15% Anchor (Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources):** This requires understanding concepts, comparing them, and providing examples, which is much more cognitively demanding and requires more complex English.
    *   **5% Anchor (Theme of "The Last Bargain"):** This requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and expressing a complex idea, all in English. Far, far more difficult.

5.  **Challenging Assumptions:**
    *   "Could a student who barely reads English?" Yes, if the story was read aloud or simplified, and "fairy" was a prominent character. Many students might struggle with complex sentences, but "who lived inside the book?" and recalling a single word is within reach for many.
    *   "Could a student who was absent for this topic?" No, if they were absent for the specific story, they wouldn't know. This is a significant factor.
    *   "Exam anxiety causing blank responses?" Yes, this is always a factor, but the simplicity of the expected answer might reduce it slightly compared to more open-ended questions.
    *   "Never practiced this exact question type?" While they might not have done "who lived inside the book?" specifically, they would have done comprehension questions.

**Conclusion:**
This question is a straightforward recall of a single, simple piece of information. The English required for the answer is minimal. It's significantly easier than the 30%, 15%, and 5% items. It's comparable to the 50% and 66% items in terms of direct recall, but the *length* of the expected answer is even shorter than those, making it less demanding on English production.

However, the "absent for the topic" factor is crucial. If the story was a one-off and not foundational, a significant chunk of students might miss it. Given the average pass rate of 29% for the entire exam, even "easy" questions don't reach 100%.

I believe it will perform better than the 50% anchor because the output is just one word, but not as high as 66% because it's a specific story detail, which some students might miss due to absence or inattention, whereas fundamental rights are often revisited.

Let's consider the 50% anchor: "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" This requires remembering three distinct phrases. Our question requires remembering only one word. This is easier.

Therefore, I'd place it slightly above the
