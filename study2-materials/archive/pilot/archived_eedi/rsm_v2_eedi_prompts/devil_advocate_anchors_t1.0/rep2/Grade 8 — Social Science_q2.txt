I will analyze the question, rubric, and calibration anchors to estimate the pass rate.

**Question Analysis:**
*   **Topic:** Harappan Civilization's urban planning. This is a specific history topic, likely covered in Class 8 social studies.
*   **Skill:** Describe one key feature. This requires recall and articulation in English.
*   **Complexity:** "Key feature" suggests specific details are needed, not just vague mentions.

**Student Profile:**
*   Class 8, Indian government schools.
*   Economically weaker sections.
*   Limited English proficiency.
*   Average pass rate 29% for the exam.

**Calibration Anchors Analysis:**

*   **5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract understanding and articulation. Very few students can do this well. Responses show struggle with comprehension and expression.
*   **15% (Differentiate sources):** Requires defining two concepts and providing examples. "Physical objects" for archaeological is a good start. Shows some understanding, but difficulty in full articulation.
*   **30% (Favorite season paragraph):** Requires creative writing and following prompts. Students struggle with generating multiple sentences, even on a personal topic. "Winter Sweater Baju" shows very basic recall, not paragraph writing.
*   **50% (Three questions king wanted):** Recall of specific plot details from a known story. Many students can recall fragments. "the right time to do everything, the right thing to do and the right people" is a good partial answer.
*   **66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Recall of two specific, well-taught constitutional points. Many students can list them, even if slightly misphrased. "Right of to equality, Right to freedom" is acceptable.

**Applying to the Target Question:**

The question asks for *one key feature* of Harappan urban planning. This falls somewhere between simple recall (like Fundamental Rights) and more complex explanation/differentiation.

*   **Content Knowledge:** Harappan Civilization is a significant topic in Indian history curricula. Students would likely have been taught about its distinct features.
*   **Recall vs. Description:** While the question asks to "describe," it only needs *one* feature. A student who remembers "drainage system" or "grid pattern" and can articulate even a short phrase about it ("good drainage," "streets in a grid") would likely get full marks based on the rubric.
*   **English Proficiency:**
    *   "Grid layout of streets" -> "streets are straight" or "streets are lines"
    *   "Advanced drainage system" -> "good drainage" or "water goes out"
    *   "Baked bricks" -> "use bricks" or "strong houses"
    *   "Citadel and lower town" -> "city has two parts" or "high part and low part"

    These simplified phrases are likely within the grasp of a good portion of these students, especially for those who remember the concept.

*   **Comparison to Anchors:**
    *   It's harder than listing two Fundamental Rights (66%) because "urban planning" requires a more specific historical detail and slightly more descriptive language.
    *   It's easier than differentiating between sources (15%) because it only asks for *one* feature and doesn't require comparison or multiple examples.
    *   It's arguably easier than the "three questions the king wanted" (50%) because that requires recalling three distinct points, whereas this needs just one.
    *   It's significantly easier than writing a theme (5%) or a paragraph (30%) as it doesn't require abstract thought or sustained writing.

Considering the common knowledge of Harappan features (especially drainage and grid patterns are often highlighted) and the relatively low bar for "describing one key feature" (a short phrase would suffice), I anticipate a moderate success rate. Many students will have heard of "drainage system" or "grid pattern." The challenge lies in recalling it and expressing it in English.

I expect it to be harder than the 50% anchor, but definitely not as hard as the 15% or 5% anchors.

Let's look at the 50% anchor: "three questions the king wanted to answer." This requires recalling three specific points. Our target question requires recalling *one* specific point and describing it. The "description" part is where it might be slightly harder than just listing, but still, a very basic description would pass.

Given the limited English, the word "describe" is still a hurdle. A student might remember "drainage" but struggle to form a coherent sentence like "They had a good drainage system." They might just write "drainage." However, the rubric implies a simple description is sufficient.

I'll place it slightly below
