I'll break down the reasoning process to arrive at the calibrated estimate.

**1. Initial Gut Feeling & First Challenge:**

*   **Initial Thought:** Rajasthan, rural areas, occupations. Agriculture, animal husbandry, maybe some crafts. Seems relatively straightforward. Many students in India would likely know this generally. I might initially guess 40-50%.
*   **Challenging this:**
    *   **English proficiency:** "main occupations," "rural areas," "Rajasthan," "describe in brief." While the core concepts are simple, formulating an answer in English, even broken English, is a hurdle. Many might know the *ideas* but struggle with the *words*.
    *   **"Basic" concepts:** Is "animal husbandry" or "pastoralism" a common phrase for a 7th grader from an EWS background? "Farming" is likely known, but the other official terms might be less familiar. "Handicrafts" might also be a slightly more advanced term for some.
    *   **Geographic specificity:** They need to connect it *specifically* to Rajasthan. While agriculture/animal husbandry are common in many rural areas, the question asks about *Rajasthan*. This isn't a huge leap, but it adds a layer of recall.
    *   **"Describe in brief":** This requires at least a basic sentence or two, not just a list. This is where English really becomes a barrier.

**2. Comparing to Calibration Anchors:**

Let's look at the anchors and see where this question might fit:

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain."** This requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and expression of a complex idea. Our question is factual recall, not abstract. So, definitely higher than 5%.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources.** This requires understanding two somewhat academic terms, comparing them, and providing examples. It's more demanding than our question, which is about general knowledge. "Archaeological" and "literary" are harder vocabulary than "occupation" or "rural." So, our question should be higher than 15%.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): "My favorite season" (paragraph).** This is a creative writing task requiring 6-8 lines, talking about preferences, activities, food, and wear. It's personal, but the length and detail required are significant, and it's free-form. Many students struggle with expressing themselves at length in English. Our question is more constrained and fact-based.
    *   *Comparison:* Our question asks for two specific occupations and a brief description of one. This is less writing than 6-8 lines, but it's factual recall, which can be harder than personal opinion for some, especially if they haven't rote-learned it. However, the *amount* of English required for "describe in brief" is likely similar to a few lines of "favorite season." The key difference is the *type* of knowledge.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer.** This is direct recall from a story. If they read the story and remembered, it's easy. Many students might recall snippets. "Empty Response" is common here too. This is a good anchor for direct recall from a text.
    *   *Comparison:* Our question is also direct recall, but from general knowledge/social studies, not a specific story often covered in English class. The "king's questions" is often a "main idea" point that's highlighted. For our question, "main occupations" might also be a highlighted topic in social studies. The difficulty of recalling *two* occupations and *briefly describing one* feels slightly harder than just listing three specific questions directly from a story they likely just studied.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights.** This is direct recall of specific, often-repeated terms from civics/social studies. "Right to Equality," "Right to Freedom" are probably hammered home. This is high pass rate, and it only requires listing two distinct items.
    *   *Comparison:* Our question is similar in requiring a list of two items, but then adds "describe any one in brief." This "describe in brief" part makes it harder than just naming. The terms for occupations might be slightly less formally "memorized" than Fundamental Rights.

**3. Synthesizing and Calibrating:**

*   Our question requires recalling two specific occupations for a specific region (Rajasthan rural).
*   It then requires a "brief description" of one. This means at least a sentence or two, testing basic sentence construction in English.
*   The concepts (agriculture, animal husbandry) are likely known,
