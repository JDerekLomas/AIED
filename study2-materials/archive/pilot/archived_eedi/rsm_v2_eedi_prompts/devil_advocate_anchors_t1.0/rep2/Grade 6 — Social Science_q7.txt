I will analyze the question and rubric in the context of the calibration anchors and student profile.

**Question Analysis:**
*   **"Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan"**: This requires factual recall. Rajasthan is a prominent Indian state, so students might have some general knowledge, especially if they live there or if it's covered in their curriculum. Resources like water, sand, sunlight, and various minerals are common.
*   **"explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there"**: This requires a slightly higher-order thinking skill – cause and effect, and basic explanation. The explanation doesn't need to be complex, just a simple link.

**Student Profile & Challenges:**
*   **Limited English:** This is a major hurdle. Even if they know the facts, expressing them clearly in English, especially the explanatory part, will be difficult.
*   **Economically weaker sections:** May have less exposure to diverse information or supplementary learning materials.
*   **Average pass rate 29%:** This is a critical anchor. It tells me that the default expectation should be low.
*   **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** Will further reduce scores.
*   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic:** While natural resources might seem basic, linking them to "influence" in English could be challenging.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking and good English expression. This question is less abstract.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires recall of definitions and examples, and comparison. The "explain how one influences" part of my question is somewhat comparable to providing an example and implicit differentiation.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Short paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This requires sustained writing (6-8 lines) on a personal topic. Students often struggle with sentence formation. My question is shorter in expected output for the explanation part. The examples show fragmented, basic English.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is factual recall from a story. If the story was well-known, direct recall is easier. This is a good comparator for the "mention two natural resources" part.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Direct factual recall of two items. This is very similar to the "mention any two natural resources" part. The high pass rate suggests direct recall of specific names is achievable if taught.

**Applying the Anchors:**

1.  **"Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan"**: This part is comparable to "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66% pass rate) or "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50% pass rate). Given that Rajasthan-specific resources might be slightly less universally known than fundamental rights, I'd put just this part's success rate around 45-55%. Many students might name one correctly, or two general ones that might be incorrect.

2.  **"explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there"**: This part is trickier.
    *   It's more complex than simple recall.
    *   It requires constructing a simple explanatory sentence or two in English.
    *   Referring to the "My favorite season" (30%) example, students struggled to form coherent sentences even on a personal topic.

**Overall Difficulty Synthesis:**

*   The first part (naming two resources) is relatively easier, potentially similar to the 50-66% items.
*   The second part (explaining influence) will significantly drag down the score, pushing it closer to the 15-30% items. Students might name resources but fail to explain the influence in comprehensible English, or only provide a very fragmented answer like the "My favorite season" example.
*   The rubric requires *both* parts to be correct for a score of 1. If a student names two resources but fails the explanation, they get 0. This strict rubric is crucial.
*   Considering the limited English and the strict rubric requiring both components, the "explanation" part is a major barrier. Many will likely get the resources wrong or provide a non-sensical explanation.

**Revised Estimate:**

Initially, I might think 40-50% given the factual recall part. However, the explanation, the strict rubric requiring *both*, and the student's limited English will heavily impact this. It's not just about knowing, but about expressing.

*   A significant portion will struggle with naming two *correct* resources for Rajasthan.
*   Even if they name two, constructing an English sentence that clearly explains "influence" will be a huge challenge for many from the 29%
