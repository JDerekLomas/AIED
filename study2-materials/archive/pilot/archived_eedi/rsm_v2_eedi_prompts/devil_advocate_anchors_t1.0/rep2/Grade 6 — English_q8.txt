I need to estimate the proportion of Class 6 Indian government school students who would correctly rearrange "book/reading/a/is/he" into "He is reading a book."

Let's break down the difficulty factors:

1.  **English Proficiency:** The question uses common, high-frequency words. "He," "is," "reading," "a," "book" are likely part of a Class 6 student's basic vocabulary, even with limited English.
2.  **Grammar/Syntax:** The target sentence "He is reading a book" follows a very standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure. This is one of the most fundamental sentence structures taught early in English.
3.  **Task Type:** Rearranging words is a common exercise in primary English education. Students would likely have encountered this format before.
4.  **Cognitive Load:** There are only five words, making the cognitive load relatively low. There aren't many alternative plausible arrangements that would be grammatically incorrect but still make some sense (e.g., "A book is he reading" is unlikely to be chosen by a student aiming for a common sentence).
5.  **Ambiguity:** There's only one truly meaningful and grammatically correct sentence ("He is reading a book"). "A book he is reading" might be considered, but it's less natural and less likely to be the target.

**Calibration Anchors Analysis:**

*   **Pass rate 66%:** "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India." This is recall-based and requires specific knowledge, but the output is very simple (two short phrases). Students who know the answer just need to write it.
*   **Pass rate 50%:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" Similar to the 66% item, it's recall-based. Students who remember the story can list the questions. The examples show direct recall or partial recall leading to a correct answer.
*   **Pass rate 30%:** "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season." This is a creative writing task requiring sustained effort, vocabulary, sentence construction, and adherence to prompts. The examples show very basic attempts, often just listing words. This is significantly harder than rearranging words.
*   **Pass rate 15%:** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each." This requires understanding two concepts, comparing/contrasting them, and providing examples. It's conceptually more complex and requires more sophisticated English expression than a simple sentence rearrangement.
*   **Pass rate 5%:** "Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain." This is a high-level comprehension and interpretation task, very difficult for this demographic.

**Comparing to the Question:**

The rearrangement task seems closer in difficulty to the 50-66% range.

*   It's simpler than the paragraph writing (30%), differentiation (15%), or theme extraction (5%) questions in terms of required English production and conceptual understanding.
*   It's a straightforward application of basic grammar, similar to recalling factual information (50-66%), but it's not pure recall. It requires a minimal understanding of English sentence structure.

The words are basic, the structure is basic, and the task type is basic. The most common error would likely be incorrect word order, or possibly putting "He is a book reading" which makes little sense. Even a student with very limited English might recognize "He is reading" as a common phrase, and "a book" as a common object.

Let's consider the "challenging assumptions":
*   **Limited English:** While limited, these are Class 6 students. They've been exposed to English for several years. SVO is fundamental.
*   **"Basic" isn't basic:** For this specific SVO structure with these words, it's about as basic as it gets in English.
*   **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** This is always a factor, but for a short, simple task like this, a student might at least attempt something, even if not fully correct.
*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** This is unlikely for a Class 6 student in India; rearranging words is a common exercise.

Given the simplicity of the words, the fundamental nature of the sentence structure, and the commonality of the task type, I expect a relatively high pass rate. It's less demanding than recalling specific historical facts, but more demanding than simply writing two known names.

It's similar in cognitive demand to answering "What are two fundamental rights?" if the student *knows* the answer. Here, if the student *understands* basic SVO structure, they *know* the answer
