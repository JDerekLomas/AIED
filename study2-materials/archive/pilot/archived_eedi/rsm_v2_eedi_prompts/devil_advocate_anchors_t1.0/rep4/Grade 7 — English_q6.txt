The question asks students to describe the poet's writing style. The rubric is quite lenient, accepting any "suitable and relevant word" like "simple, descriptive, informal, direct."

Let's break down the potential difficulties for these students:

1.  **Understanding "writing style":** This is an abstract concept. Students might struggle to differentiate between the *content* of the poem and the *way it's written*. Even if they understand the poem, articulating its "style" requires a higher level of analytical thinking and vocabulary.
2.  **Vocabulary for description:** While the rubric is broad, students need a suitable English word. Words like "simple" or "descriptive" might be within their active vocabulary, but connecting them specifically to a "writing style" might be difficult.
3.  **Poem context:** The question doesn't provide the poem. Assuming "The Last Bargain" from the 5% anchor, it's a Tagore poem translated into English. Even if they read the poem, identifying its style (especially if it's translated) is tough.
4.  **Limited English proficiency:** This is a major factor. Even if they grasp the concept, expressing it concisely and correctly in English is a hurdle.
5.  **Lack of practice:** Analyzing "writing style" is often a higher-order skill not frequently practiced in rote-learning environments or with students who struggle with basic comprehension.
6.  **Comparison to anchors:**
    *   **5% anchor (theme of poem):** This required understanding an abstract concept (theme) and expressing it. "Writing style" is similarly abstract.
    *   **15% anchor (differentiate sources):** This involved factual recall and comparison. More straightforward than abstract analysis.
    *   **30% anchor (short paragraph on favorite season):** This was a personal narrative, requiring sentence construction but not deep analysis. Many got partial credit for listing words.
    *   **50% anchor (king's questions):** This was direct recall from a story.
    *   **66% anchor (Fundamental Rights):** Direct recall of specific facts.

The task of identifying a "writing style" requires inferential reasoning and appropriate vocabulary, which is generally harder than factual recall or simple descriptive writing. Given the 5% anchor for "theme," which is similar in abstractness, and the difficulty of articulating such a concept in limited English, I expect a low pass rate. While "simple" or "direct" might be common observations, many students will likely misunderstand the prompt, write about the content, or simply leave it blank.

I'll lean towards the lower end, probably closer to the 15% mark because the rubric is generous (any relevant word). Some might just try "simple" or "good."

Challenging my assumption: Could "simple" be an easy go-to word? Yes, but connecting it to "writing style" is key. Many might just say "the poet writes simply" or "the poem is simple" rather than directly stating "simple style." The prompt "describes the poet's writing style" is fairly specific.

I think it's harder than the 15% anchor (differentiating sources) because that involved specific definitions, which some students would have memorized, even if poorly. This requires interpretation and abstract description. It's not quite as hard as the 5% theme question, as "style" might seem more observable than "theme" to some extent.

Let's consider the average pass rate is 29%. This question feels significantly harder than average. The "My favorite season" (30%) was much easier as it was personal and descriptive. The "king's questions" (50%) and "Fundamental Rights" (66%) were recall-based.

This question requires abstract thinking and specific vocabulary application. It's definitely in the lower tier of difficulty. It's probably easier than identifying a *complex* theme, but still difficult for these students.

I'll place it slightly above the 5% anchor but below the 15% anchor.
