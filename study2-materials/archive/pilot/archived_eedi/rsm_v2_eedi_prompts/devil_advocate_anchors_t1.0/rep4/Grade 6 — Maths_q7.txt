I'll break down the thought process for estimating the pass rate for this question.

1.  **Analyze the Question:**
    *   **Subject:** Math (basic arithmetic, time calculation, temperature change).
    *   **Language:** Relatively straightforward English. Keywords: "10 am," "temperature," "30 degrees C," "increases by 2 degrees C per hour," "4:00 in the evening," "what will be."
    *   **Concepts required:**
        *   Understanding time differences (am/pm, converting to total hours).
        *   Multiplication (rate x time).
        *   Addition (initial temperature + total increase).
    *   **Potential pitfalls:**
        *   Miscalculating time (e.g., 4 - 10 = -6, or just using 4 hours, or struggling with am/pm transition).
        *   Making a simple arithmetic error in multiplication or addition.
        *   Difficulty with the English if vocabulary is an issue ("increases by," "per hour").
        *   Blank response due to anxiety or not understanding the full problem.

2.  **Consult Calibration Anchors (and their implied difficulties):**

    *   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Extremely difficult. Requires abstract thinking, literary analysis, strong English comprehension for poetry. *This math problem is nowhere near this difficulty.*
    *   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Difficult. Requires specific factual knowledge, categorization, and the ability to articulate examples clearly. *This math problem doesn't require complex definitions or comparisons.*
    *   **Pass rate 30% (Short paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Moderate difficulty. Requires sustained writing, organizing thoughts, using descriptive language. Many struggle with generating content and basic grammar/spelling. *This math problem is much more concrete and has a single correct numerical answer.*
    *   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Moderate. Requires recall of specific details from a story. Many students likely remember the story but struggle with precise recall or writing it out. *This math problem doesn't rely on story recall, only basic math application.*
    *   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Easiest of the anchors. Requires recall of two specific facts. High chance of partial credit. Many students will remember at least one. *This math problem is a step-by-step calculation, not just recall.*

3.  **Synthesize and Calibrate:**

    *   **Initial Instinct:** My first instinct might be "this is pretty basic math, most students should get it." Maybe 70-80%.
    *   **Challenging the Instinct (applying the "important" considerations):**
        *   **Limited English:** While the English is relatively simple, "increases by" and "per hour" are crucial. "4:00 in the evening" might be a slight hurdle for some in calculating the total hours from 10 am.
        *   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic:** The concept of calculating time duration across am/pm, then applying a rate, and adding to an initial value is a multi-step problem. It's not just "2 + 2."
        *   **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** This is a real factor. Some will just stare at it and give up, even if they know some parts.
        *   **Never practiced this exact question type:** While they practice time and multiplication, the combination might be novel or poorly understood by many.
        *   **Economically weaker sections:** This often correlates with less exposure to varied problem types, less support at home for homework, and potentially less consistent attendance.
        *   **Average pass rate 29%:** This is a *very low* average. It indicates that the general academic environment is challenging and many students struggle significantly across the board.

    *   **Re-evaluating based on challenges:**
        *   The most common error will likely be calculating the time difference:
            *   10 am to 12 pm = 2 hours
            *   12 pm to 4 pm = 4 hours
            *   Total = 6 hours.
            *   Some might do 4-10 = -6 (ignoring am/pm).
            *   Some might do 4+10 = 14 (confusing 24-hour clock conversion).
            *   Some might assume 4 hours (e.g., 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 - count fingers, possibly miscounting).
        *   Once they get 6 hours
