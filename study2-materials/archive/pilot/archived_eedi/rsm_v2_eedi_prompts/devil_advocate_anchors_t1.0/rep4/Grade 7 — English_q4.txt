I will estimate the proportion of Class 7 students in Indian government schools who would correctly answer the question: "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."

The average pass rate for these students is 29%. They are mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English.

Let's break down the question and rubric:
*   **Question Part 1: "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life?"** This requires a yes/no answer or an implicit agreement. This part is relatively easy to understand and answer.
*   **Question Part 2: "Give one reason."** This requires providing a justification. The rubric states "Any valid reason." This is the more challenging part.

Let's consider the calibration anchors:
*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of a poem.** Requires deep comprehension and abstract expression. This question is much simpler.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate archaeological and literary sources.** Requires recall of specific definitions and examples. This question is simpler as it asks for an opinion and a general reason, not specific definitions.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph on "My favorite season."** Requires sentence construction, organization, and personal expression. This is somewhat comparable in terms of requiring a short explanation, but "My favorite season" is a more common and relatable topic for a paragraph. The King's questions are from a specific text they've read.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is pure recall from the text. This is a very direct and concrete question. The current question *builds* on the understanding of those three questions but then asks for a personal opinion and justification. Many students likely remember the questions themselves, which sets a good foundation.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights.** This is recall of specific factual information. Very direct.

**Analysis of the current question:**

1.  **Understanding the King's Questions:** The previous question (50% pass rate) directly asked for the king's questions. This implies a significant portion of students understand what those questions are. Even if they can't articulate them perfectly, they probably grasp the *concept* of finding the right time, people, and action.
2.  **"Important in real life?":** This is a very high-frequency, simple vocabulary question. "Important" and "real life" are basic concepts. Most students will likely agree that these questions are important.
3.  **"Give one reason":** This is the crucial part.
    *   **Low English proficiency:** Students might struggle to articulate a sophisticated reason. However, "Any valid reason" is very lenient.
    *   **Simple reasons accepted:** Reasons like "It helps you succeed," "You won't make mistakes," "It guides you," or even "It is good for life" are likely to be accepted. These are simple thoughts to express.
    *   **Relatability:** The concept of making the "right" choices is universally relatable, even for struggling students. They might link it to personal experiences of doing things at the wrong time or with the wrong people.
    *   **Contrast with paragraph writing (30% item):** While "My favorite season" (30% pass rate) required a longer paragraph, this only asks for "one reason." A single sentence or even a fragmented but understandable phrase could suffice.
    *   **Contrast with differentiation (15% item):** Differentiating requires understanding two distinct concepts and comparing them, which is more complex than giving a single reason for a perceived importance.
    *   **Contrast with poem theme (5% item):** Extracting a theme is highly abstract. Giving a reason for importance is much more concrete.

**Challenging Assumptions:**

*   **"Most students could do this":** My initial thought might be high, but I need to consider the limitations. Many will just write "Yes" or "No" without a reason, or their reason will be incomprehensible.
*   **Limited English:** While the reason can be simple, articulating *any* reason in English, even poorly, can be a hurdle. "It is good" might be scored, but "It is good for life because it helps to take right decision" is a stretch for some.
*   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** Some will leave it blank despite understanding.
*   **Basic concepts not basic:** "Importance" *is* a basic concept. The challenge is expression.

**Re-evaluating based on anchors:**

*   The 50% pass rate for just *recalling* the questions suggests that half the
