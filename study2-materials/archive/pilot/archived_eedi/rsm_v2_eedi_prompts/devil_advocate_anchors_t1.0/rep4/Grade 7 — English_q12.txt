I will analyze the question and the calibration anchors to estimate the pass rate.

**Question Analysis:**
The question asks to change a sentence from active to passive voice. This is a grammatical transformation task.
*   **Active:** The wind blew the leaves away. (Subject performs action)
*   **Passive:** The leaves were blown away by the wind. (Action is performed on the subject)

This requires understanding:
1.  **Subject-verb-object identification:** "wind" (subject), "blew" (verb), "leaves" (object).
2.  **Tense recognition:** "blew" is past simple.
3.  **Passive voice structure:** Object + "to be" (in correct tense) + past participle of main verb + "by" + original subject.
4.  **Past participle of "blow":** "blown".

**Student Profile and Challenges:**
*   **Limited English:** Many students struggle with basic sentence construction, let alone complex grammatical transformations like passive voice. Identifying the correct past participle ("blown") can be a significant hurdle, as irregular verbs are often poorly mastered.
*   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic:** While active/passive voice is taught, it's a concept that many, even native English speakers, struggle to apply consistently, especially under pressure. For students with limited English exposure, this is an advanced grammatical concept.
*   **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** Grammatical transformation questions can be intimidating, leading to many blank or incorrect attempts.
*   **Lack of practice:** Even if taught, consistent practice with this exact question type (especially with irregular verbs) might be lacking.

**Calibration Anchor Analysis:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking and expressing it in English. Very difficult.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires conceptual understanding and ability to articulate differences with examples. Some keyword recognition might help, but full differentiation is hard.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires personal expression, topic-specific vocabulary, and sentence construction. The "Winter / Sweater / Baju" example shows how basic the responses can be and still score. This is more about producing free-form English, even if simple.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is a recall question from a specific text. If they remember the story and key phrases, they can score. It's factual recall, less about complex language production.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Name two Fundamental Rights):** Another factual recall question, likely from civics. High chance of success if the information was learned, even with basic English.

**Comparison with the target question:**

The target question (passive voice) is more challenging than pure recall (50% and 66% items). It requires a multi-step linguistic transformation. It's also more structured and less open-ended than the "My favorite season" paragraph (30% item), where simple lists could score.

The difficulty lies in:
1.  Remembering the rule for passive voice.
2.  Correctly identifying the components of the active sentence.
3.  Applying the correct "to be" verb (were).
4.  Crucially, using the correct past participle ("blown" instead of "blewed" or "blowed"). This irregular verb is a common stumbling block.

Given the limited English proficiency, the irregular verb "blow/blew/blown" will trip up a significant number of students. They might get the structure partially right but fail on the verb form. The examples from the 30% item ("Winter / Sweater / Baju") show very fragmented English. Transforming a sentence grammatically is a higher-order task than listing items or simple recall.

I expect this to be harder than the "favorite season" paragraph (30%) because that allows for simple English expression, while this demands precise grammatical application. It's also harder than the recall questions (50% and 66%). It's probably easier than the abstract "theme of poem" (5%) or the "differentiate sources" (15%), as it's a direct grammatical rule application, not conceptual analysis, but the irregular verb is a significant barrier.

My initial instinct might be higher, but considering the "limited English," "basic concepts not basic," and "irregular verb hurdle," the pass rate will be dragged down significantly. Many might attempt a "The leaves was blow by the wind" or similar.

I'd place it somewhere between the 15% and 30% anchor. The 15% anchor requires conceptual understanding and articulation. This question requires a mechanical transformation. While it's mechanical, the
