I need to estimate the pass rate for the question "Who lived inside the book?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and the provided calibration anchors.

Let's break down the question and rubric:
*   **Question:** "Who lived inside the book?"
*   **Rubric:** Correctly states that a magical fairy lived inside the book. (Accept: 'a magical fairy', 'fairy')
*   **Max score:** 1

This question tests basic recall of a detail from a likely very simple story. The key challenges will be:
1.  **Reading Comprehension:** Can students understand "Who lived inside the book?" This is a very straightforward sentence, so understanding the question itself should not be a major barrier for most.
2.  **Vocabulary:** "lived," "inside," "book" are all very common words.
3.  **Recall:** Did they read the story, and can they remember this specific detail? The detail "a magical fairy" is quite distinct and memorable.
4.  **English Production:** Can they write "a fairy" or "fairy"? This is a very short, simple answer.

Let's compare this to the calibration anchors:

*   **Pass rate 5%:** "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" This requires abstract thinking, understanding poetic language, and articulating a complex idea. Much harder.
*   **Pass rate 15%:** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each." This requires understanding two concepts, differentiating them, and providing examples, all in coherent English. More complex.
*   **Pass rate 30%:** "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'" This is a personal response, but requires sustained writing, organization, and adherence to prompts about what to include. Even with simple language, it's a higher bar for production. The example "Winter / Sweater / Baju / Hot water / Tea / Gever feali / Hat" shows students struggle with paragraph structure and coherent sentences, yet still get 3 points for listing relevant words.
*   **Pass rate 50%:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" This is similar to our target question in that it's a recall task from a story. The answer required recalling *three* distinct things. The examples show students could recall the phrases. This is a very good anchor.
*   **Pass rate 66%:** "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India." This is also a recall task, but from a factual/civics context. The answers are specific terms ("Right to equality," "Right to freedom"). Students could list two.

**Analysis relative to anchors:**

*   Our question is *simpler* than the 5%, 15%, and 30% items due to its direct recall nature and minimal English production.
*   Our question is *comparable to or slightly easier* than the 50% item ("three questions the king wanted to answer"). Both require recalling specific details from a story. However, our question asks for only *one* detail ("fairy") as opposed to *three* distinct details ("right time," "right people," "right thing"). Recalling one specific, memorable noun is likely easier than recalling three specific concepts.
*   Our question is *comparable to* the 66% item ("Name any two Fundamental Rights"). Both require recalling specific factual information. However, "fairy" is a single, common noun, whereas "Right to equality" or "cultural and educational rights" are slightly more complex phrases, though still direct recall. The context of a children's story (for "fairy") might be more engaging and memorable than civics for some students.

Considering the "fairy" is likely a central and distinct character in whatever simple story they read, and the answer requires only one word or two ("fairy" or "a magical fairy"), the production burden is very low. The "three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%) required recalling more information and stringing together slightly longer phrases. The "two Fundamental Rights" (66%) involved specific, possibly harder-to-spell terms. "Fairy" is a relatively simple word.

Given the 50% item required recall of three concepts and the 66% item required recall of two specific, slightly more formal rights, asking for a single, memorable character from a simple story feels like it should fall closer to the higher end of these recall tasks. The blank response issue is always present, but the simplicity of the question and answer should minimize it among those who have *any* recollection of the story.

I'll lean towards it being easier than the 50% question due to only needing *one* simple
