I'll analyze the question and compare it to the calibration anchors, keeping in mind the students' background and common challenges.

The question asks students to rearrange words to form a meaningful sentence: "book/reading/a/is/he".
The correct answer is "He is reading a book." This tests basic English sentence structure (subject-verb-object) and common present continuous tense usage.

Let's compare this to the anchors:

*   **Pass rate 66%**: "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India."
    *   This requires recall of specific facts. Students who have memorized these facts (even if just the names) can answer it. The language barrier is minimal if they know the terms. Many students from government schools might have some exposure to civics/constitution.
    *   The target question ("He is reading a book") involves basic grammatical rules that are often taught early.

*   **Pass rate 50%**: "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"
    *   This requires specific recall from a story. If the story was read and understood, and the questions remembered, it's straightforward. The language needed for the answer is simple.
    *   The target question is about *applying* a grammar rule rather than recalling a fact.

*   **Pass rate 30%**: "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season.""
    *   This is a creative writing task requiring more sustained English production, organization of thoughts, and a wider vocabulary. Students often struggle with producing coherent sentences, let alone paragraphs, and many give very short or list-like answers.
    *   The target question is much simpler, requiring only the correct sequencing of given words. No new words or ideas are needed.

*   **Pass rate 15%**: "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each."
    *   This requires understanding two distinct concepts, comparing them, and providing examples. It's a higher-order thinking skill and requires specific knowledge in history, as well as the ability to express the difference clearly.
    *   The target question is far more fundamental in English language learning.

*   **Pass rate 5%**: "Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain.""
    *   This is very difficult. It requires reading comprehension of poetry (which is often abstract), abstract thinking to identify a theme, and the ability to articulate that theme in English. This is extremely challenging for students with limited English and analytical skills.
    *   The target question is about basic sentence construction, not abstract interpretation.

**Reasoning for the target question:**

*   **Simplicity of words:** "He," "is," "reading," "a," "book" are very common, basic English words that students would likely encounter early and frequently.
*   **Basic sentence structure:** SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) is the foundational English sentence structure. "He is reading a book" is a prime example of this and the present continuous tense.
*   **No new vocabulary or ideas:** Students are just rearranging given words.
*   **Commonality of the phrase:** "He is reading a book" is a very common and direct sentence, likely practiced extensively in early English lessons.
*   **Challenges:**
    *   Even with common words, the concept of sentence structure might be elusive for the weakest students.
    *   Some students might struggle with word order if their native language has a very different structure.
    *   Anxiety and lack of practice with this *exact* question type could lead to errors or blanks.
    *   Misplacing "a" or "is" could lead to a score of 0, even if the student got most of it right.

Compared to the 66% item (recalling facts), this item requires applying a fundamental English rule. Compared to the 50% item (recalling facts from a story), this is more about foundational language mechanics. The jump from 50% to 66% involves basic recall. This question feels like it should be on the higher end, as it tests something fundamental that should be repeatedly drilled.

The 66% item is specific factual recall. This is basic grammar and a very common sentence. While "basic" for a fluent speaker, for these students, any grammatical task can be tricky. However, "He is reading a book" is so fundamental that many would have seen it or similar structures countless times. The fact that the words are provided greatly reduces the cognitive load compared to generating a sentence from scratch.

I'm trying to avoid the expert bias of overestimating. While it seems simple, the constraints of "limited English" and "struggling learners" are crucial. However,
