The question asks to identify an **adjective phrase**, but the rubric states that identifying "tiny" as an adjective is sufficient for a full score. This is a critical discrepancy. An adjective phrase is a group of words that modifies a noun or pronoun, whereas "tiny" is a single adjective.

Given the students' background (economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate 29%), and the nature of the "calibration anchors," it's highly unlikely that a significant proportion of students would correctly identify an **adjective phrase**. However, if the rubric is strictly followed, and only identifying the single adjective "tiny" is required, the difficulty drops considerably.

Let's consider both interpretations of the question, keeping in mind the actual rubric:

**Interpretation 1: Students need to identify an *adjective phrase*.**
*   This is a more complex grammatical concept. Many students might be able to identify individual adjectives but struggle with phrases.
*   Given the examples of low pass rates for conceptual questions (e.g., "theme of the poem" at 5%, "differentiate archaeological/literary sources" at 15%), a question requiring the identification of a specific grammatical phrase would be challenging.
*   The sentence "A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony" actually contains a simple adjective "tiny." There isn't a clear multi-word adjective phrase modifying a noun that would be easy to isolate. "Its nest" is a possessive pronoun and noun, "in our balcony" is a prepositional phrase acting adverbially. If students tried to identify a phrase, they might incorrectly pick "its nest" or "in our balcony."

**Interpretation 2: Students need to identify the *adjective* "tiny" (as per the rubric).**
*   Identifying a single adjective is significantly easier than identifying an adjective phrase.
*   Comparing this to calibration anchors:
    *   Identifying "three questions the king wanted to answer" (50% pass rate) requires recall and basic comprehension.
    *   Naming "two Fundamental Rights" (66% pass rate) requires recall of specific facts.
    *   Identifying an adjective is a basic grammar concept. Many students might have encountered adjectives in their studies.

**Reconciling the Question and Rubric:**
The rubric explicitly says, "The student correctly identifies 'tiny' as an adjective." This means the question, despite asking for an "adjective phrase," will be graded based on identifying the simple adjective. This significantly lowers the difficulty.

Many students, even those struggling with English, would likely be able to pick out "tiny" as a descriptive word for the bird. They might not know the term "adjective" or "adjective phrase," but if the task is to point out the word describing the bird, "tiny" is the most obvious candidate.

However, the question *asks* for an "adjective phrase." Some students might get confused by the term "phrase" and look for multiple words, leading them to either give no answer, or incorrectly identify other parts of the sentence. The discrepancy itself could be a source of confusion and errors.

Let's consider the cognitive load:
1.  Read the sentence: "A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony."
2.  Understand the instruction: "Identify the adjective phrase."
3.  Recall what an adjective phrase is. (High difficulty for this student demographic)
4.  If they don't know "adjective phrase," they might default to looking for a descriptive word (an adjective).
5.  If they identify "tiny," they get a score of 1.

Given the rubric's simplification, the task becomes identifying an adjective. Students are more likely to succeed at identifying a descriptive word than a grammatical phrase. However, the phrasing of the question will still trip up some students who are trying to apply a more complex grammatical rule that isn't actually being tested (or is being mislabeled).

Considering the 50% pass rate for recalling three factual items, and the 66% pass rate for recalling two factual items, identifying a single, obvious adjective in a simple sentence, even with limited English, should fall in a similar range, perhaps a bit lower due to the confusing "phrase" terminology. The word "tiny" is very basic.

I will err on the side of caution due to the confusing question wording ("adjective phrase" vs. rubric accepting "adjective") and the general struggles of these students with English and abstract concepts.

My initial instinct would be higher (around 60-70%) if it *only* asked for an adjective. But the "phrase" part will confuse a significant portion, leading to blank responses or incorrect multi-word answers.

Let's re-evaluate:
*   Pass rate 50%: Three questions the king wanted to answer (recall from story).
