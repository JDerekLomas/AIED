I'll analyze the question and compare it to the calibration anchors.

**Question Breakdown:**
*   **"What are the main occupations of people in the rural areas of Rajasthan?"** This requires factual recall about a specific region (Rajasthan) and its rural economy. While Rajasthan is a well-known state, the specifics of its rural occupations might not be universally known, especially if not directly covered in the curriculum or if students haven't internalized it. Common answers would be agriculture, animal husbandry, and potentially handicrafts or tourism (though less "main" for rural poverty).
*   **"Describe any one in brief."** This requires a very short descriptive sentence or two about one of the named occupations. This part is relatively simple if they can name one.

**Considering the Student Demographics and Pass Rates:**

*   **Limited English:** The question uses straightforward English. "Main occupations," "rural areas," "Rajasthan," "describe in brief" are all common phrases. This is less of a barrier than interpreting complex poem themes or abstract historical differentiations.
*   **Economically Weaker Sections:** These students are often directly familiar with agricultural and animal husbandry practices, even if they don't use the formal terms. Their own families or neighbors are likely engaged in these activities. This lived experience could actually be an advantage.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While agriculture and animal husbandry are fundamental to rural India, recalling them *in the context of Rajasthan* and articulating them in English might still be a hurdle.
*   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** This is always a factor.

**Comparing to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Poem Theme):** This required abstract thinking and interpretation of a literary piece, very difficult for limited English speakers. Our current question is factual recall, much simpler.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate sources):** This required defining two distinct concepts and giving examples. It's more complex than just naming and briefly describing. Students struggled with distinguishing abstract historical concepts.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Short paragraph "My favorite season"):** This was a personal narrative, often easier as students can draw on their own experience and use simpler vocabulary. The current question is factual, but also about something many students would have direct experience with (rural occupations). The 30% item allowed for very basic, even list-like answers to score well (e.g., "Winter / Sweater / Baju / Hot water / Tea").
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This was direct factual recall from a specific story/text. If students read and understood the story, it was straightforward. Our question is also factual recall, but less about a specific text and more about general knowledge of a region's economy. Many students remembered snippets of the answer.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Name two Fundamental Rights):** This was direct factual recall from Civics/Social Science. It required remembering specific terms, but the answers were short and precise. This is quite similar in structure: name things, then briefly elaborate on one. The high pass rate suggests that direct recall of taught civic concepts is achievable.

**Re-evaluating the Question:**

*   The question is about a very common topic in Social Science curriculum for Class 7 (geography, economy).
*   Agriculture and Animal Husbandry are almost universal knowledge for anyone living in rural India, regardless of state. While Rajasthan is specified, these two are such primary occupations that they would likely apply.
*   The "describe any one in brief" part is very forgiving. A simple sentence like "Agriculture is growing crops" would likely suffice.
*   The rubric is generous: "Names at least two main occupations correctly... Max score: 1". This means even if they write a very short, slightly awkward description, as long as they named two occupations, they can score.

**Initial instinct vs. Challenging Assumptions:**

My initial instinct might be around 40-45%. Challenging this:
*   Could a student who barely reads English name "agriculture" and "animal husbandry"? Possibly, as these are common words associated with rural life.
*   Could a student who was absent for this topic? If it's general knowledge from life, yes. If it's only taught specifically for Rajasthan, then less likely. However, these are generic rural occupations.
*   Exam anxiety: The simplicity of the required answer helps reduce anxiety compared to open-ended creative tasks.

The 50% anchor (king's questions) and 66% anchor (fundamental rights) are good comparisons for factual recall. The current question feels slightly harder than naming two fundamental rights because it's specific to a region, but potentially easier than recalling three specific questions from a narrative if the student
