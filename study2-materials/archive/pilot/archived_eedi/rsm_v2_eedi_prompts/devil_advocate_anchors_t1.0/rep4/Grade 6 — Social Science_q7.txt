I'll break down the thought process for estimating the pass rate for "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."

**1. Initial Instinct & Challenging It:**

*   **Initial Instinct:** Rajasthan is known for its desert, minerals, and solar energy. Students should know *some* of these. Naming two resources seems easy enough, and explaining an influence isn't rocket science (e.g., water scarcity affects farming). Maybe 40-50%.
*   **Challenging:**
    *   **"Natural resources" concept:** Is this term universally understood and easily recalled by Class 6 students from EWS backgrounds, often with limited English? They might know "things from nature" but struggle to categorize them as "natural resources."
    *   **Specifics for Rajasthan:** While general knowledge might include "desert" and "sand," can they name *two distinct natural resources* like marble, copper, gypsum, or even *water* or *sunlight* in the context of "natural resources"?
    *   **"Explain how one of them influences":** This requires not just recall but a basic causal link. "Water scarcity means people struggle for farming" is simple, but can they articulate it in English? Will they even pick water, or will they pick something harder to explain like mica?
    *   **English proficiency:** Even if they know the *concept* in their native language, can they translate it and express it clearly in English? The calibration anchors show very basic English often gets credit, but complex explanations are rare.
    *   **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** The 50% pass rate item on "three questions the king wanted to answer" still had "Empty Response." Recalling specific facts and then elaborating is harder than simple recall.
    *   **Teacher overestimation:** Teachers would likely assume students *should* know Rajasthan's resources, but the reality of recall and articulation is different.

**2. Comparing to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain."** This requires abstract thinking and interpretation of literature, which is very difficult. This is *much harder* than our target question.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources.** This requires understanding two abstract historical concepts and providing examples. It's conceptually harder than naming concrete resources, but "differentiate" is a higher-order skill. The English required for a "1" or "2" score is still quite basic.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Paragraph on "My favorite season."** This is a personal, descriptive task, relatively low cognitive load, but requires some sentence construction and organization. The examples show students can get points even with very fragmented English. This is *easier* than our target question because it's personal and less fact-dependent.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer.** This is pure recall from a story they likely read. If they remember the story, it's easy. It's *easier* than our target question because it's direct recall of narrative plot points, not conceptual understanding + application.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Two Fundamental Rights.** This is specific factual recall from Civics. It's a key topic, likely drilled. This is *easier* than our target question because it's straight recall of highly emphasized content, and just naming two is enough.

**3. Placing the Target Question:**

Our question requires:
*   **Recall:** Two specific natural resources of Rajasthan. This is mid-difficulty recall, as some might be common knowledge (sand, water) but others might not (gypsum, mica).
*   **Conceptual Understanding:** "Natural resources" itself.
*   **Explanation:** How one resource *influences* lives. This moves beyond simple recall to a basic level of explanation/causal reasoning. This is where many students will struggle, both conceptually and linguistically.

It's harder than:
*   "My favorite season" (personal, descriptive, 30%) - ours requires factual recall and explanation.
*   "Three questions the king wanted" (direct plot recall, 50%) - ours requires conceptual application.
*   "Two Fundamental Rights" (direct factual recall, 66%) - ours requires more than just naming.

It's probably easier than:
*   "Theme of a poem" (abstract interpretation, 5%) - ours is concrete.
*   "Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources" (abstract concepts + differentiation, 15%) - ours is more grounded in observable reality.
