This question tests a very fundamental concept of English grammar: the usage of 'some' vs. 'any'.

*   **Simplicity of the concept:** 'Some' is used in affirmative sentences and offers, while 'any' is generally used in negative sentences and questions. The given sentence "There are (some/any) apples in the basket" is an affirmative statement. This is one of the very first distinctions taught when introducing these words.
*   **Vocabulary:** The words 'some', 'any', 'apples', 'basket' are all extremely common and likely part of a Class 6 student's basic vocabulary, even with limited English.
*   **Question Type:** It's a simple multiple-choice/fill-in-the-blank type question, which is less demanding than writing a paragraph or differentiating concepts.
*   **Calibration Anchors Analysis:**
    *   The 66% anchor (Fundamental Rights) requires recall of specific terminology.
    *   The 50% anchor (King's questions) requires recall of details from a story.
    *   The 30% anchor (Favorite season) requires paragraph writing, which is a much higher cognitive load and English proficiency requirement.
    *   The 15% anchor (Archaeological/Literary sources) requires differentiation and examples, which is a more complex task.
    *   The 5% anchor (Poem theme) requires abstract thinking and nuanced English expression.

This question is much simpler than any of the calibration anchors, specifically easier than the 66% anchor. It requires only a basic understanding of a very common grammatical rule. While some students will struggle with any English question, the high frequency of these words and the simplicity of the rule makes it highly accessible.

I'd expect the pass rate to be significantly higher than the 66% anchor because it's a direct, low-cognitive-load grammar point.
