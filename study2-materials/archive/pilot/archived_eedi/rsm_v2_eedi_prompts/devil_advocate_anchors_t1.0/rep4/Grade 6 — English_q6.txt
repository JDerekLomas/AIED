I will use the provided calibration anchors and insights into student demographics and common expert biases to estimate the pass rate.

1.  **Analyze the Question:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"
    *   **Task 1:** Identify a line from the poem. This requires recall or access to the poem. Assuming the poem is provided during the exam, this is a direct transcription task, not complex.
    *   **Task 2:** Explain *why* they like it. This requires some degree of original thought and expression in English. It's not a simple factual recall.

2.  **Consider Student Demographics & Limitations:**
    *   **Limited English:** Many students struggle with expressing complex ideas or even simple reasons in English. "Why" questions are harder than "what" or "name" questions for this group.
    *   **Economically weaker sections:** May have less exposure to English outside school, fewer resources, and potentially less encouragement for creative thinking or personal expression in academic contexts.
    *   **Average pass rate ~29%:** This sets a low baseline for general performance.
    *   **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** Will reduce scores.
    *   **Never practiced this exact question type:** Students might be good at factual recall but struggle with subjective opinion and justification, especially in a second language.

3.  **Compare to Calibration Anchors:**

    *   **Pass Rate 5%:** "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'"
        *   This requires understanding the *entire* poem and synthesizing a theme, then expressing it. Very difficult. Our question asks for a single line and a personal reason, which is less abstract than a theme.

    *   **Pass Rate 15%:** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..."
        *   This requires factual recall and analytical comparison, with examples. Again, a "why" question is different. The level of conceptual understanding and precise language for "differentiate" is high. Our question is less about factual differentiation and more about personal opinion.

    *   **Pass Rate 30%:** "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'"
        *   This requires sustained writing (6-8 lines) on a personal topic, including specific details (what you do, eat, wear). The rubric for this example is very lenient ("Winter\nSweater..." scores 3). This is probably the closest anchor in terms of requiring personal expression and some amount of writing. However, *our* question only asks for a line and *a* reason, not a whole paragraph with multiple details. It's shorter in required output but still has the "why" component. The 30% pass rate here indicates that even for a personal topic, many students struggle to produce a coherent paragraph.

    *   **Pass Rate 50%:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"
        *   Pure factual recall from a text. If they read/remembered the story, it's straightforward. Our question requires more than recall (the "why").

    *   **Pass Rate 66%:** "Name any two Fundamental Rights..."
        *   Pure factual recall of specific terms. Very straightforward if memorized. Much easier than our question.

4.  **Synthesize and Calibrate:**

    *   The question requires identifying a line (easy if poem present) and providing a *reason* (harder).
    *   The "why" component makes it harder than simple factual recall (50%, 66%).
    *   It's likely easier than deriving a theme (5%) or differentiating complex concepts (15%).
    *   The closest analogy is "My favorite season" (30%), which also asks for personal expression but requires a longer output (paragraph vs. a line + a reason). The rubric for "My favorite season" suggests leniency, accepting very simple lists.
    *   Our question's rubric ("Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why") seems to have a low bar for "why." A simple, perhaps even awkwardly phrased, reason might suffice.
    *   Students might just pick a line and give a very generic or simplistic reason (e.g., "I like this line because it is good"). The challenge is not just providing *any* reason, but one that gets credit.

    *   If students can pick a line (easy) and manage even a one-phrase simple reason like "because it talks about happiness" or "because it is beautiful," they might get a 1.5. The difficulty lies in constructing even this minimal English.
    *   Given the 30% for the paragraph on "My favorite season" (where simple lists scored
