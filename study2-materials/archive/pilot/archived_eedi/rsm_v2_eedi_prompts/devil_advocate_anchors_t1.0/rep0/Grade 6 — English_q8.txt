I'll analyze the question and compare it to the calibration anchors, keeping in mind the students' context.

The question is a simple sentence rearrangement: "book/reading/a/is/he".
The correct answer is "He is reading a book."

Let's break down the difficulty:

1.  **Vocabulary:** All words are extremely common and likely known even by students with limited English: "book," "reading," "a," "is," "he." This is a low barrier.
2.  **Grammar/Syntax:** This tests basic English sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object). This is taught early.
3.  **Question Type Familiarity:** Rearranging words to form a sentence is a very common exercise in early English language learning. Students are likely to have encountered this multiple times.
4.  **Cognitive Load:** Low. There are only five words, and the correct order is quite intuitive for anyone with a basic grasp of English. There are no tricky inversions or complex clauses.
5.  **Ambiguity:** None. There is only one grammatically correct and meaningful sentence.

Now, let's compare with the anchors:

*   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, understanding nuanced language, and expressing a complex idea concisely in English. Far more difficult than sentence rearrangement.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** Requires conceptual understanding, recall of specific definitions, and providing examples. Involves specialized vocabulary. Much harder.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires creative writing, sustained English production (6-8 lines), and connecting ideas. While common, many students struggle with producing more than a few fragmented sentences, as seen in the examples.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Requires specific recall of a story, but the answer itself is quite direct ("what time, what people, what thing"). Many students might remember *parts* but struggle to list all three accurately or in complete sentences.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Requires specific recall of factual information. If they studied it, it's a direct answer. The examples show direct recall of specific names of rights. This is a knowledge recall question with minimal linguistic complexity beyond naming.

**Where does "Rearrange the words" fit?**

This question is *simpler* than the "Fundamental Rights" question in terms of English production and cognitive load, and very similar in terms of direct recall/application of a learned skill.

*   **Fundamental Rights (66%):** Requires recall of specific facts. If they know the rights, they can answer.
*   **Rearrange words:** Requires application of basic grammatical rules. If they have a basic grasp of English sentence structure, they can answer.

The words are simple, the structure is fundamental, and this question type is very common. Even a student with limited English who has attended basic English classes should be able to attempt this successfully. The risk of blank responses due to difficulty understanding the prompt or the words is very low. The main challenge would be if they *don't know* that "he" comes before "is" or "reading" before "a book," which is a very fundamental error in English.

Considering the 66% anchor for direct recall of factual information, this sentence rearrangement is a core skill taught from early stages of English. It's less about creative production or deep understanding and more about applying a basic learned rule.

I believe a significant majority of students who have even a minimal foundation in English will get this right. It's arguably one of the most basic English language tasks.

Therefore, I would place it higher than the "Fundamental Rights" question.
