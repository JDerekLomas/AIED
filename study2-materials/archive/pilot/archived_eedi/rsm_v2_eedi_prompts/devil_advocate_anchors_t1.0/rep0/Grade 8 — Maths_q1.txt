I will analyze the question and the calibration anchors, specifically considering the target student demographic.

The question is a basic algebraic equation: `y + 9 = 4`. Solving it involves one step: subtracting 9 from both sides. `y = 4 - 9`, which simplifies to `y = -5`.

Let's consider the challenges for Class 8 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections with limited English:

1.  **English Comprehension:** The question itself (`Find the value of y in the equation`) is straightforward English. This is unlikely to be a major barrier compared to questions requiring understanding of poems or historical terms.

2.  **Mathematical Concept:**
    *   **Basic Algebra:** Class 8 is typically when students are introduced to solving linear equations. The concept of isolating a variable and performing inverse operations should have been taught.
    *   **Negative Numbers:** The result `y = -5` requires understanding of operations with integers, specifically subtracting a larger positive number from a smaller positive number. This is a common stumbling block for many students at this level.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** This is a factor for all questions, especially for students who struggle academically.

4.  **Prior Knowledge/Attendance:** While this is a core Class 8 math topic, some students might have missed the lessons or not grasped the concept due to various reasons (teacher quality, personal circumstances, learning disabilities).

Let's compare to the calibration anchors:

*   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, strong English comprehension, and nuanced understanding. Much harder.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Archaeological vs. Literary sources):** Requires recall of definitions, examples, and differentiating two concepts. More challenging than a simple math problem but still recall-based.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires creative writing, sentence construction, and specific detail recall (what you eat/wear). The examples show basic English but often fragmented thoughts. A score of 3 (max) was achieved by some students with simple sentences.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Requires specific recall of details from a story. The examples show direct recall of phrases from the text. This is a lower-order thinking skill (remembering facts).
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Requires specific recall of political science facts. The examples show direct recall of common rights. This is also a lower-order thinking skill.

**Analysis of the Equation Question:**

*   **Difficulty:** This is a *procedure-based* question. Students either know how to solve a basic linear equation or they don't.
*   **English Barrier:** Minimal.
*   **Concept Barrier:** The concept of solving for `y` and handling negative numbers is the main challenge. Many students struggle with integer operations.
*   **Guessing:** Unlikely to get the exact answer by guessing.

The 50% and 66% pass rates are for questions requiring direct recall from a text or memorized facts. This algebra problem requires applying a learned procedure, which can be harder than simple recall for many students, especially if their foundational math skills (integers) are weak.

Considering that the average pass rate is 29%, and questions requiring recall from a text (50% and 66%) were higher, this math problem, despite seeming "basic" to an adult, might be challenging for a significant portion of these students, particularly due to the negative number result and potential gaps in understanding algebraic manipulation.

Many students might attempt `9 - 4 = 5` and wrongly put `y = 5`. Or they might simply not know how to isolate `y`. However, it's also a fundamental skill taught in Class 8 math.

I initially thought it would be higher, around 40-50%, but recalling the expert advice to challenge assumptions and the struggles with negative numbers, plus the average pass rate of 29%, suggests it's closer to the middle of the difficulty spectrum for these students. It's procedural, not just recall.

If 50% could recall the king's three questions, that's textual recall. If 30% could write a short paragraph, that's creative application with some structure. This math problem is more about applying a specific algorithm.

I anticipate a common error will be `y = 5` (doing `9-4` instead of `4-9`) or simply leaving it blank.

Given the average pass rate of 29%, and the 50% for factual recall, a procedural math problem involving negative numbers for a struggling demographic should be lower than 50%. It's more complex than recalling names of
