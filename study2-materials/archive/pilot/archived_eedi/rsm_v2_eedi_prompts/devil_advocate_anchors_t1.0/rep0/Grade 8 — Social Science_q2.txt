I will use the provided calibration anchors and insights into the student demographic to estimate the pass rate for the given question.

**Analysis of the Target Question:** "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

*   **Content Knowledge:** This requires specific historical knowledge about the Harappan Civilization. While a core topic in Indian history, it's possible some students may not have grasped it, or it may have been covered superficially.
*   **English Language:** The question uses "describe" and "key feature," which are common but not extremely simple. Students need to articulate a specific feature.
*   **Complexity of Answer:** A single key feature is requested. This is a relatively straightforward recall question. Examples like "grid layout," "drainage system," or "baked bricks" are fairly distinct.
*   **Likelihood of Partial Knowledge/Recall:** Students might remember one aspect even if they don't have a comprehensive understanding.

**Comparing with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of "The Last Bargain"):** This requires abstract thinking and interpretation of a poem, which is very difficult for limited English speakers. The target question is more factual recall.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** This requires defining two distinct concepts and providing examples. It's a two-part answer. While the concepts are fundamental, differentiating them with examples adds a layer of complexity beyond simple recall. The target question asks for *one* feature.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This is a creative writing task requiring 6-8 lines, which is challenging for students with limited English and poor writing skills. Students often struggle with sentence structure and coherence. The target question requires a much shorter, factual answer.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer?):** This is a direct recall question from a story, likely a textbook story. It requires remembering *three* specific details. This is quite similar in nature to the target question (factual recall), but the target question only asks for *one* feature. Students are more likely to recall *one* specific feature than *three* specific questions.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Name any two Fundamental Rights):** This is a direct recall question of two specific items. It's a foundational concept in civics. It's highly probable students would have encountered this multiple times. The pass rate is high because it's usually rote-learned and frequently tested.

**Challenging Initial Instincts:**

My first instinct might be that "urban planning" is a fairly prominent feature of Harappan civilization, so a decent number of students should get it. However:

1.  **Limited English:** Students might know the concept in their native language but struggle to articulate it in English.
2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** Even fundamental historical facts can be missed by struggling learners or those with poor attendance.
3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** Some students will leave it blank even if they have some idea.
4.  **Exact Question Type:** While "recall a feature" is common, they might not have practiced this exact phrasing for Harappan planning.

The question asks for *one* key feature. This makes it significantly easier than recalling three items (50% anchor) or differentiating two concepts (15% anchor). It's more aligned with the "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66% anchor) in terms of recall, but the content about Harappan civilization might be slightly less universally mastered than Fundamental Rights, which are often drilled.

Considering the "one" item recall, it's easier than the "three questions" (50%). It's also less demanding than writing a full paragraph (30%) or differentiating concepts (15%). The content is specific history, which might be less universally accessible than "Fundamental Rights" (66%).

I believe it will be higher than the 50% anchor because only *one* feature is required, making it easier to score. However, it won't reach the 66% mark for fundamental rights because Harappan civilization, while important, might not be as thoroughly drilled or frequently discussed as fundamental rights.

Therefore, a pass rate between 50% and 66% seems appropriate. I'll lean towards the lower end of that range, accounting for the English barrier and potential content gaps specific to history.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
