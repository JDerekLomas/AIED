The question requires students to transform an active voice sentence into a passive voice sentence. This involves understanding the grammatical concepts of active and passive voice, identifying the subject, verb, and object, and then correctly rephrasing the sentence with the object as the new subject and using the correct form of "to be" and the past participle of the verb.

Considering the calibration anchors:

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain."** This requires abstract thinking and articulate expression, which is very difficult for students with limited English.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate archaeological and literary sources.** This requires factual knowledge and the ability to differentiate between two concepts, providing examples. Students often struggle with providing clear distinctions and examples.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Short paragraph on "My favorite season."** This is a creative writing task requiring some personal expression and sentence construction. The 30% pass rate shows that even relatively open-ended tasks are challenging.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer.** This is a recall question from a specific text. If students remember the story, it's relatively straightforward. The 50% indicates that many struggle with recall or comprehension.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights.** This is a direct recall of factual information, which is often easier if memorized. The high pass rate suggests that direct recall of specific, often-repeated facts is more accessible.

The current question ("The wind blew the leaves away.") requires a specific grammatical transformation.
*   **Grammar Complexity:** Active to passive voice is a fundamental grammatical concept taught in English, but it's not always easy for students who are not native English speakers, especially those from economically weaker sections with limited exposure to formal English outside of school.
*   **Vocabulary:** The vocabulary ("wind," "blew," "leaves," "away") is common and should not be a barrier.
*   **Sentence Structure:** The transformation requires understanding the object becoming the subject, the correct past tense of "to be" ("were"), and the past participle of "blow" ("blown"). The "by the wind" part is also crucial.
*   **Common Errors:** Students might struggle with:
    *   Forgetting "were" or using "was" incorrectly for plural "leaves."
    *   Incorrectly forming the past participle of "blow" (e.g., "blowed").
    *   Omitting "by the wind."
    *   Leaving the sentence in active voice.
    *   Blank responses due to anxiety or not knowing the rule.

Comparing this to the anchors:
*   It's more complex than simple factual recall (66% item) because it requires applying a rule.
*   It's less abstract than finding a theme (5% item).
*   It's more specific and rule-based than writing a paragraph (30% item).
*   It's similar to the 50% item in that it's a specific skill/recall, but it's *applying* a rule rather than just recalling facts from a story.

The average pass rate is 29%. This task is a core grammar concept, but the complexity of applying the past participle and auxiliary verb correctly, especially for students with limited English proficiency, is a significant hurdle. Many students might know the general concept but falter on the specifics of irregular verbs or subject-verb agreement in the passive form. The "basic" nature of this concept to a native speaker is deceiving for this student population.

Given the difficulty observed in other grammatical or conceptual application questions, even for seemingly "basic" concepts for these students, a significant portion will likely get it wrong or leave it blank. The 50% item involves recall, which is often easier than application. The 30% item is creative writing but allows for flexibility. This question demands precision.

I anticipate that more than half will struggle with the correct form.
