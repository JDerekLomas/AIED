I'll analyze the question and the calibration anchors to make an informed estimate.

**Question Analysis:**
*   **Concept:** Simple arithmetic progression/rate of change.
*   **Operations:** Subtraction (to find time difference), multiplication (rate * time), addition (initial temperature + increase).
*   **Numbers:** `10` am, `4` pm, `30` degrees C, `2` degrees C per hour.
*   **Difficulty points:**
    *   **Time conversion:** Students need to understand `4:00` in the evening is `16:00` in a 24-hour format, or calculate `12 - 10 = 2` hours to noon, then `4` more hours. This step is crucial and where errors often occur.
    *   **Multi-step problem:** It's not a single operation.
    *   **Reading comprehension:** "increases by `2^0 C` per hour" needs to be understood as a multiplication factor.
    *   **Numerical accuracy:** Simple calculations but easy to make mistakes under pressure.

**Calibration Anchors Comparison:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and expressing a nuanced idea in English. This is very difficult for students with limited English.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires understanding two distinct concepts, recalling examples, and articulating the difference. This requires subject knowledge and comparative thinking, which can be hard for struggling learners.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires generating ideas, organizing them into a coherent paragraph, and writing multiple sentences correctly. While "favorite season" is a common topic, sustaining a coherent paragraph with limited English is a challenge. The examples show fragmented responses.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is a recall question from a story, likely a textbook. It's relatively direct *if* they remember the story and the specific details. The examples show students recalling parts of the answer.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Name two Fundamental Rights):** Another recall question, likely from civics/social studies. This is a memorized fact. It's direct and requires minimal English beyond listing the names.

**Applying Insights to the Target Question:**

The target question is a word problem involving basic math. It's *not* abstract like the poem theme, *not* a definitional differentiation, and *not* a creative writing task. It's closer to the factual recall questions (50% and 66%) in that it has a definite correct answer, but it requires calculations, not just memorization.

The biggest hurdle will be correctly calculating the time difference.
*   From 10 am to 12 pm is 2 hours.
*   From 12 pm to 4 pm is 4 hours.
*   Total = 6 hours.

Many students might make errors like:
*   `4 - 10` directly (negative number or incorrect subtraction without considering am/pm).
*   Count hours on fingers but miscount.
*   Forget to convert pm to a 24-hour format if they try `16 - 10`.

Once 6 hours is found, `6 * 2 = 12` degrees increase.
Then `30 + 12 = 42` degrees.

This involves three steps, each simple, but the sequence and potential for error in the time calculation are high for students who struggle with basic arithmetic word problems and time concepts.

Considering the 30% pass rate for "My favorite season" (which involves more open-ended writing but a familiar topic) and the 50% pass rate for a direct recall question, this math problem sits somewhere in between. It's more structured than the paragraph but requires more steps and precise calculation than simple recall.

*   Students are generally weak in English, which can hinder understanding the question itself ("increases by `2^0 C` per hour").
*   Basic math operations are usually taught, but applying them in a multi-step word problem, especially with time, can be tricky for struggling learners.
*   Exam anxiety and lack of practice with this *exact type* of question will lead to errors or blank responses.

My initial gut might be higher, but challenging that instinct: many students will trip on the time calculation (10 am to 4 pm is 6 hours). Some might do `4 - 10` or `16 - 10` correctly, others won't. Then there's the multiplication and addition. It's a three-step problem for students who
