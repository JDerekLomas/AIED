I'll consider the calibration anchors carefully.

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract understanding and articulation in English. Very difficult.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate sources):** Requires understanding two distinct concepts and providing examples. Moderate difficulty, especially with the English requirement.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on favorite season):** Requires expressing personal preferences and details, which is relatively accessible but demands paragraph structure and some English fluency. Many blank or very short responses.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted):** Recall of specific details from a story. If the story was known, it's a direct recall. The provided correct responses are very succinct, suggesting simple recall.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Direct recall of factual information, if taught. Relatively straightforward.

Now for the target question: "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."
Rubric: Names one correct mountain range. Max score: 0.5.

This means a student only needs to name *one* correct mountain range to get full credit (0.5).

**Factors making it easier:**

*   **Direct recall:** This is a factual question, not requiring complex reasoning or interpretation.
*   **Common knowledge (in context):** "Himalayas" is a very prominent and commonly taught mountain range in India. Most students would have heard of it.
*   **Only one needed:** The question asks for two, but the rubric gives full marks for just one. This significantly lowers the bar.
*   **Low bar for "correct":** Simply naming it is enough, no description needed.

**Factors making it harder:**

*   **English limitation:** While "Himalayas" is a common word, spelling it correctly might be an issue for some, though phonetic attempts might be accepted. Other ranges like "Aravalli" or "Vindhya" might be harder to recall and spell for weaker students.
*   **Curriculum coverage:** Was this specific topic thoroughly covered? Even if it was, retention varies.
*   **Anxiety/Blank responses:** As noted in the prompt, exam anxiety causes blank responses.
*   **Distraction from "two":** Some students might struggle to remember a *second* one, and the attempt might lead to frustration or an incorrect answer. However, the rubric mitigates this.

**Comparison with anchors:**

*   It's easier than differentiating sources (15%) because it's pure recall, not conceptual differentiation.
*   It's likely easier than writing a paragraph (30%) because it requires far less English construction and detail.
*   It's similar in type to "Three questions the king wanted" (50%) and "Two Fundamental Rights" (66%), both of which are direct factual recalls. The "Himalayas" is arguably more universally known and geographically salient than specific fundamental rights or details from a story for all students.
*   The fact that *only one* correct answer is needed to get the score makes it significantly easier than the 66% item, which *required two* distinct rights for full credit.

Given the prevalence of the Himalayas in Indian geography lessons, and the fact that only one is needed for the full score (0.5), a significant proportion of students should be able to recall at least that one. The prompt specifically mentions "major mountain ranges," and the Himalayas are the most major.

I initially thought it might be around 50-60%, but then challenging that assumption:
Could a student who barely reads English name "Himalayas"? Yes, it's a common proper noun.
Could a student who was absent for this topic? Maybe, if it's general knowledge from other classes or media.
The "only one needed" is a huge lever.

I'll lean towards the higher end of the recall questions, recognizing the "only one needed" aspect.
