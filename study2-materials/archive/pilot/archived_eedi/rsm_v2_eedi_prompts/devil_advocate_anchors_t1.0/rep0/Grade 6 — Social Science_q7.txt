I will break down the thought process for estimating the pass rate for the given question.

1.  **Analyze the Question:**
    *   "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan." - This is a recall question. Students need to know *what* natural resources are and *where* Rajasthan is, and then specifically *two* found there. Rajasthan is a prominent Indian state, so its general characteristics (desert, minerals) might be known.
    *   "and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there." - This requires a slightly higher level of understanding and application. It's not just recall, but explaining a cause-and-effect relationship.

2.  **Consider the Target Audience (Class 6, Indian Government Schools, EWS, Limited English):**
    *   **English Proficiency:** This is the *biggest* hurdle. Even if they know the answer in their local language, articulating it correctly and understandably in English is tough. Look at the calibration anchors:
        *   "Happiness is find in innocence." (Pass rate 5%) - Grammatically flawed but conveyed the idea.
        *   "the right time to do everything, the right thing to do and the right people to work with he will nev" (Pass rate 50%) - Decent recall, minor grammatical issues.
        *   "1 Right of to equality 2. Right to freedom." (Pass rate 66%) - Very simple, mostly correct.
    *   **Content Knowledge:** "Natural resources" is a fundamental concept taught in social studies/EVS. Rajasthan's resources (like desert/sand, water scarcity, minerals) are often highlighted.
    *   **"Explain how it influences"**: This requires more than just listing. They need to connect the resource to daily life (e.g., "sand -> desert -> less water -> people wear specific clothes/travel far for water" or "minerals -> mining -> jobs"). This is a step up from simple recall.
    *   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** As noted, many students give blank or minimal responses.
    *   **"Basic" isn't basic:** Even if teachers think "natural resources in Rajasthan" is basic, for many struggling learners, it's not.

3.  **Calibrate Against Anchors:**

    *   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of a poem):** Abstract, requires deep comprehension and articulation. Much harder than the current question.
    *   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** Requires defining two concepts and giving examples. This is conceptual and requires slightly more precise language. The current question is somewhat similar in structure (list two, explain one), but the *content* (natural resources) might be more concrete than "sources of history." The explanation part is probably harder than just differentiating.
    *   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires personal expression, but also organization (6-8 lines) and specific details. The given examples show very fragmented answers for partial credit. This question is more open-ended but requires sustained writing. Our current question is more factual, but the explanation part requires similar sustained thought.
    *   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Pure recall from a story. If they remembered the story, it was straightforward. This is *much easier* than our current question, which requires conceptual understanding and explanation.
    *   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Pure recall of specific, well-known facts. Very easy, straightforward. Our question is harder.

4.  **Initial Instinct vs. Challenged Assumption:**
    *   *Initial Instinct:* "Most students would know about Rajasthan's sand or minerals. And water is a resource. Explaining influence shouldn't be too hard." -> Might lean towards 40-50%.
    *   *Challenged Assumption:* "Wait. 'Mention any *two* natural resources' - some might only get one. 'Explain how one of them influences' - this is where many will struggle with English and the explanatory depth. Look at the 'My favorite season' examples; they struggle with even simple sentences. 'Archaeological vs. Literary' (15%) is conceptual. This question asks for concept + recall + explanation."

5.  **Refined Estimate - Combining Elements:**
    *   The "mention two resources" part is probably closer to the 50% anchor if it were *just* that, but the specific resources of Rajasthan might trip some. Let's say 40-50% could list at least one.
    *   The "explain how one influences" part is the major difficulty. This is where the English limitations and the need for a coherent
