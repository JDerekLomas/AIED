I will analyze the question and rubric in the context of the calibration anchors and student profile.

**Question Analysis:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"
**Rubric:** Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why. (Max score: 1.5, implies partial credit for just a line or just a reason, but full credit requires both).

**Student Profile Considerations:**
*   **Limited English:** Students might struggle to articulate "why" in coherent English. They may be able to identify a line, but forming a descriptive reason could be difficult.
*   **Economically Weaker Sections:** Less exposure to abstract thinking or expressing personal preferences in a structured way.
*   **Average pass rate ~29%:** This indicates a significant struggle with even "basic" questions.
*   **Poem "The Last Bargain":** This poem is by Rabindranath Tagore, often taught in Indian schools. However, understanding it and *then* expressing a personal preference for a line *and* a reason in English is a multi-step cognitive task.
*   **"Why" question type:** These are generally harder than recall questions, as they require interpretation and articulation.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Pass rate 5%:** "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" This is very hard. It requires understanding the poem's core message *and* articulating it. Our target question requires understanding a line, choosing one, and explaining *why* they like it. The "theme" question is more abstract.
*   **Pass rate 15%:** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each." This requires factual recall and comparison, a structured answer. It's challenging but more about factual knowledge than personal interpretation.
*   **Pass rate 30%:** "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.' Talk about what you like to do, what you eat or wear..." This is a personal descriptive paragraph, similar in requiring personal expression. However, it's about a *very common and easy topic* ("favorite season") and gives clear prompts (what you do, eat, wear). The quality of responses for this was low (e.g., "Winter Sweater Baju..."). This suggests even simple personal descriptions are hard.
*   **Pass rate 50%:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" This is a direct recall question from a story, likely a common one. It's easier because it's about retrieving specific information.
*   **Pass rate 66%:** "Name any two Fundamental Rights..." Another direct recall question, again from a core civics topic. Very accessible if the student remembers.

**Challenging Initial Instincts:**

My first instinct might be: "Students read poems, they must have a favorite line, and can probably say 'because it's nice' or something."

*   **Re-challenge 1: Limited English.** "Because it's nice" might not get full credit. The rubric implies a *reason*. Articulating a comprehensible reason in English is the key hurdle. Many might just write the line, or the line and a very broken English reason. Even "Happiness is find in innocence" for the theme question (5% pass) shows the struggle.
*   **Re-challenge 2: "Basic" concepts aren't basic.** Choosing a *favorite* line and explaining *why* requires some level of literary appreciation and critical thinking, even if rudimentary. Many students may not have been taught to think this way about poetry. They might be taught to memorize lines or answer factual questions about the poem.
*   **Re-challenge 3: Exam anxiety/blank responses.** Given the 50% blank rate for the 50% pass rate question, students will omit if they are unsure.
*   **Re-challenge 4: Never practiced this exact question type.** While they might write about a favorite season, expressing a *reason* for liking a *specific line from a poem* is a more refined skill.

**Estimating the Difficulty:**

*   It's harder than direct recall (50-66%).
*   It's harder than differentiating historical sources (15%) because that's factual, not interpretive.
*   It's significantly harder than writing about "My favorite season" (30%) because that topic is universally familiar, and the prompts are very concrete. Here, the "why" is more abstract and specific to the poem.
*   It's easier than writing the *theme* of the entire poem (5%), as it focuses on just one line.

The closest anchor in terms of requiring personal expression and reasoning is "My favorite season"
