The question requires students to connect the Battle of Plassey to the expansion of British power, specifically focusing on its impact on Bengal. This involves understanding a historical cause-and-effect relationship and articulating it in English.

Let's break down the challenges for Class 8 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections with limited English:

1.  **Historical Knowledge:** While the Battle of Plassey is a significant event, students' retention of specific details about its *consequences* for British power beyond "British won" might be limited, especially if they struggle with the broader historical narrative.
2.  **Vocabulary and Concepts:**
    *   "Contribute to the expansion" requires understanding causality.
    *   "British power" and "dominance/control" are abstract political concepts.
    *   "Puppet nawab" (or similar phrasing) is a specific historical term that might not be universally known or remembered, especially by students with weaker English comprehension.
3.  **English Articulation:** Even if a student understands the concept, explaining it clearly and concisely in English, hitting the key points of political control over Bengal or the puppet ruler, is difficult.
    *   Students might struggle to form a grammatically correct sentence or paragraph.
    *   They might use very simplistic language that doesn't fully meet the rubric's expectation of explaining "establishment of British political dominance/control."
4.  **Recalling Specifics:** The rubric requires mentioning political dominance over Bengal or the puppet nawab. A general answer like "It helped the British become powerful" would likely not score. Students need to recall and state a more specific consequence.
5.  **Comparison to Anchors:**
    *   **Pass rate 5% (Poem theme):** Very abstract, requires deep understanding and articulation. Our question is less abstract but still requires specific recall and explanation.
    *   **Pass rate 15% (Archaeological vs. Literary sources):** Requires differentiation and examples, which is a conceptual understanding. This is likely harder than our question because it's a two-part differentiation.
    *   **Pass rate 30% (Favorite season paragraph):** This is a personal descriptive task, much easier to formulate sentences for, and allows for simpler vocabulary. Our question is more demanding in terms of specific factual recall and analytical explanation.
    *   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is pure recall of three specific items. If students knew the story, they could list them. Our question requires recall *and* explanation of a consequence. The question is less about simple listing and more about connecting cause and effect.
    *   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is a direct recall of two items, requiring minimal English to list. This is much easier than our question.

Our question falls somewhere between the 15% and 30% anchors. It's harder than simply listing facts (50% and 66% anchors) because it requires explanation and understanding of political consequences. It's likely harder than the 30% "Favorite Season" because it's not a personal descriptive task but a historical analytical one. It's probably easier than the 15% differentiation question as that requires two distinct definitions and examples.

Students might remember "British won Battle of Plassey" but struggle to articulate *how* that led to "expansion of British power" in a way that aligns with the rubric's requirement for "political dominance/control over Bengal" or "puppet nawab." Many might give vague answers like "British became powerful" or "They got control." These might not score.

Given the limited English, the need for specific historical recall *and* an explanation of political consequences, and the tendency for vague answers, a significant number of students will either leave it blank, provide an insufficient answer, or give a very general statement that doesn't meet the rubric's specifics.

Challenging the initial instinct: One might think "Plassey is important, they must know it." However, "knowing it" often means "British won," not necessarily "this led to political control over Bengal by installing Mir Jafar." The nuance required for a score of 1 is substantial for this demographic.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% and the difficulty of historical explanation for students with limited English, this question is on the more difficult side.
