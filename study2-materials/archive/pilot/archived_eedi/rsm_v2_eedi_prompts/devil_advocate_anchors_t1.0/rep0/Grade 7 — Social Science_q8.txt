I'll use the provided calibration anchors to estimate the pass rate for the given question.

The question asks about "main occupations of people in the rural areas of Rajasthan" and to "describe any one in brief." This requires:
1.  **Recall of general knowledge about Indian geography/social studies:** Students need to know common rural occupations, specifically those prevalent in Rajasthan (though common rural occupations like agriculture and animal husbandry would likely be accepted).
2.  **English comprehension:** Understanding "main occupations," "rural areas," "Rajasthan," and "describe in brief."
3.  **Basic writing ability:** To list at least two occupations and briefly describe one.

Let's compare this to the anchors:

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."** This requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and good English expression for a nuanced answer. The given question is more factual.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each.** This requires specific historical knowledge, understanding of a distinction, and providing examples. It's more complex than just recalling occupations. Students often struggle with "differentiate."
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season."** This is a personal response question, often easier as it draws on personal experience and less on rote memorization. The instruction to write a "short paragraph" and hit specific points (what you like to do, eat, wear) is a higher writing demand than just listing and briefly describing. However, it's about a familiar topic.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is a direct recall question from a specific story. It requires memory of a detail from a text, but the answer is very specific and limited, making it easier if the student knows the story.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India.** This is a direct recall question of specific facts (names of rights). It's very straightforward, just requiring memorization and listing.

The target question ("What are the main occupations of people in the rural areas of Rajasthan? Describe any one in brief.") falls somewhere between the 15% and 50% anchors, potentially closer to the higher end given the lower writing demand than the "favorite season" paragraph.

*   **Knowledge requirement:** Identifying occupations in a region (Rajasthan) is common social studies knowledge. "Agriculture" and "Animal Husbandry" are very common answers across India. This is less specific than "Fundamental Rights" but more specific than a poem's theme.
*   **English demand:** "Main occupations," "rural areas," "Rajasthan," "describe in brief" are fairly direct. The description needs to be "brief," which is less demanding than a "paragraph of 6-8 lines."
*   **Writing demand:** Listing two and briefly describing one. This is manageable even for students with limited English, similar to naming two rights.

Considering the commonality of the topic (rural occupations) and the relatively low writing barrier (listing and brief description), it should be easier than differentiating historical sources (15%) and probably comparable to or slightly harder than recalling specific questions a king asked (50%), because the king's questions are *very* specific and limited if they know the story. The "describe in brief" part adds a slight complexity compared to just listing. It's much easier than writing a paragraph or interpreting a poem.

Students might list "farmer" or "farming" and "rearing animals" or "animal husbandry." Even a simple sentence for description like "Farmers grow crops like wheat and bajra" would likely suffice.

I think it's easier than the "favorite season" paragraph (30%) due to lower writing demand and similar knowledge level (general studies). It's harder than just naming two fundamental rights (66%) because it involves recalling two things AND describing one. It's also less directly stated than the king's questions from a story (50%).

I'll place it above the 30% anchor, but not as high as the 50% or 66% anchors. The need to briefly *describe* one adds a hurdle that simply listing doesn't have. Many students might list two but struggle with even a single sentence description in English.

Let's adjust downwards from a first instinct of 40-45% due to the "describe in brief" part and the "limited English" constraint. Even simple descriptions can be hard.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 38%
