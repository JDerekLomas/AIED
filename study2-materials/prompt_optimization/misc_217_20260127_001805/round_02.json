That was a mistake I made before.\n\n2. To add fractions with different denominators, I need to find a common denominator first.\n\n3. The denominators are 5 and 7. I know I need to find the least common multiple (LCM).\n   \u2022 5 \u00d7 7 = 35 (This looks like the common denominator)\n\n4. Now I'll convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with denominator 35:\n   \u2022 3/5 = (3 \u00d7 7)/(5 \u00d7 7) = 21/35\n   \u2022 2/7 = (2 \u00d7 5)/(7 \u00d7 5) = 10/35\n\n5. Now I can add the numerators:\n   21/35 + 10/35 = 31/35\n\n6. Looking at the options, 31/35 looks right!\n\nThe answer is B) \\( \\frac{31}{35} \\)",
