**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Reading comprehension is a core skill; "evening" and "reading" are high-frequency vocabulary.)

**Computational complexity:** 0 (Language-based task.)

**Common error traps:** Minor (Potential for tense shifts—e.g., using "reads" instead of "read/loved"—though the rubric allows for flexibility; potential confusion between "reading" and other activities if the text contains distractors.)

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires recall and basic sentence construction; no partial credit for a 1-mark item, though the rubric is lenient on phrasing.)

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Not applicable to this item.)

**Psychometric Profile Analysis:**
For students from economically weaker sections in Hindi-medium schools, the primary barrier is decoding and syntax rather than conceptual depth. The question uses a standard "What did [Subject] love to do" frame, which is frequently practiced. Since the rubric allows for short phrases ("read books") and does not penalize for minor grammatical errors or lack of full sentences, the item accessibility is relatively high despite the English proficiency barrier.
