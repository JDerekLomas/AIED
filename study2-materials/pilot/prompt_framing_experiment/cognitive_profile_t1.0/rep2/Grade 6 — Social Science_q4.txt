- Concept familiarity: familiar (The Thar Desert is a staple of the Grade 6 geography curriculum and local identity in India.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step retrieval and description.)
- Common error traps: minor (Students may confuse "landform" with "state" or "city," or struggle to differentiate between the desert and the mountains.)
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; however, the rubric allows for two different correct answers. The "briefly describe" component adds a linguistic hurdle for students with limited English proficiency.
- Number friendliness: N/A (Non-mathematical item.)

Holistic Analysis: While the concept is culturally and academically familiar, the requirement to "describe" in English poses a significant barrier for students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds. Many students will likely identify the "Thar Desert" but may struggle to formulate a descriptive sentence in English, leading to partial marks or hesitation.
