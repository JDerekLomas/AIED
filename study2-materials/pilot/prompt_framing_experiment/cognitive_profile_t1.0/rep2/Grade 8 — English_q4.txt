**Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. While Grade 8 students are expected to know "breeze," students from Hindi-medium backgrounds and economically weaker sections often rely on a limited functional vocabulary. "Wind" is a high-frequency word, but "breeze" is a nuanced synonym that is often not reinforced in vernacular environments or basic textbooks.

**Computational complexity:** 1. This is a single-step lexical retrieval/matching task.

**Common error traps:** Minor. The most common trap is the "copying error," where a student identifies the general area of the text but extracts the wrong noun (e.g., "storm," "air," or "gust") or fails to recognize the specific semantic constraint of "light."

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This is a high-demand format for this demographic. Unlike multiple-choice questions where "breeze" could be identified through elimination, an open-ended "find the word" task requires the student to already know the meaning of "breeze" to locate it, or to have a high enough reading comprehension level to infer it from context. There is no partial credit.

**Number friendliness:** Not applicable (easy).

**Holistic Estimate:** In Indian government school contexts, vocabulary-based "find the word" questions in English are significantly more difficult than grammar or direct-retrieval comprehension questions. The linguistic barrier between "wind" (known) and "breeze" (less known) typically results in a high failure rate for this specific item.
