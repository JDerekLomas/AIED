**Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Division involving decimals is introduced in Grade 6 and reinforced in Grade 7 (NCERT Chapter 2: Fractions and Decimals). However, dividing a whole number by a decimal (as opposed to a decimal by a whole number) is less intuitive for students at this level.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** Students must first eliminate the decimal (usually by multiplying both terms by 10 to get 80 ÷ 72), simplify the resulting fraction or perform long division, and manage the recurring decimal output.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students from these backgrounds often struggle with the "reciprocal" nature of decimal division. Common errors include:
    *   Misplacing the decimal point (e.g., getting 0.11 or 11.1).
    *   Inverting the operation (calculating 7.2 ÷ 8 = 0.9).
    *   Stopping the division prematurely because 72 does not divide 80 evenly.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** Since there are no options to choose from, students cannot use estimation or process of elimination. They must correctly recall the procedure for handling a decimal divisor.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Hard.** The result is $1.11...$ (a recurring decimal). For students accustomed to "clean" answers in school textbooks, a non-terminating result often causes anxiety and leads them to believe they have made a mistake.

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given the language barrier and the shift from "rote" whole-number division to decimal division, many students will attempt to simplify $8/7.2$ to $80/72$, but the subsequent long division of $80 \div 72$ or simplification to $10/9$ will result in high attrition.
