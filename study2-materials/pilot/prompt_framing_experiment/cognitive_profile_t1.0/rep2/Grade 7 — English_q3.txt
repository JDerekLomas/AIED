- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The story "Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy is a standard text in the NCERT Grade 7 curriculum, making the plot highly recognizable).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (N/A for English; single-layer retrieval and synthesis).
- **Common error traps:** Major (Grammatical syntax in the prompt: "Why the king felt..." instead of "Why did the king feel..." may lead students with limited English proficiency to copy the question structure incorrectly. Students may also confuse the three specific questions with the "answers" themselves).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended; requires active recall and sentence construction. While the rubric says "any valid reason," the lack of partial credit (Max score 1) makes it high-stakes for students who struggle with English syntax even if they understand the story in Hindi.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A).

**Holistic Analysis:** While the story is culturally and academically familiar, the requirement to produce 2-3 coherent sentences in English is a significant barrier for students from Hindi-medium, economically weaker backgrounds. Many students will understand the "why" (the king wanted to be successful/powerful) but will struggle to articulate the three specific conditions in English to satisfy a 1-point rubric that demands an explanation.
