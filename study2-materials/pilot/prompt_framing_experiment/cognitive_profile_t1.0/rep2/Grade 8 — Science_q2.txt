Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Curd-making is a core example in the "Microorganisms: Friend and Foe" chapter of the Grade 8 NCERT syllabus and is also a culturally relevant household process).

Computational complexity: 1 (Simple recall and classification).

Common error traps: Minor (Students may confuse "bacteria" with "virus" or "fungi," or struggle with the specific spelling of "Lactobacillus" due to its Latin origin).

Format demand: Open-ended recall; the rubric specifies a 0.5 maximum score, suggesting an all-or-nothing requirement for the specific name, which increases difficulty for students with low English literacy despite knowing the concept.

Number friendliness: N/A (Non-numerical item).
