**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (The poem "The Squirrel" is a standard text in the NCERT Grade 7 curriculum used across Indian government schools).

**Computational complexity:** 1 (This is a single-step retrieval task).

**Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse "tail" with other features or struggle to translate the visual metaphor of a "question mark" into English, though the image is iconic in the text).

**Format demand:** Open-ended; requires recall and basic sentence construction. No partial credit per the 1-mark rubric. Limited English proficiency may lead to spelling or grammatical errors, though the core concept (question mark) is often rote-memorized.

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative item).

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the poem is a core part of the syllabus, the requirement to produce the specific phrase "question mark" in English poses a linguistic hurdle for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. However, due to the brevity of the poem and the high frequency of this specific question in rote-learning environments (test prep culture), many students will recognize the visual descriptor even if their functional English is low.
