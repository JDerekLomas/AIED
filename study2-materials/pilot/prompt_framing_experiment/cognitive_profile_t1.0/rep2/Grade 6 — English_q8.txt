- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Subject-Verb-Object is the foundational syntax introduced in early primary years).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step syntactical arrangement).
- Common error traps: Minor (Students may struggle with the placement of the article 'a' or confuse the subject 'He' with the object position, though the pronoun case helps).
- Format demand: Open-ended; requires exact recall of structure; no partial credit.
- Number friendliness: N/A (Text-based).

Holistic Analysis: While the vocabulary is basic (Level 1), Hindi-medium students often struggle with the English auxiliary verb placement ("is reading") vs. Hindi syntax ("voh kitaab padh raha hai"). However, "He is reading a book" is a prototypical sentence used in almost all introductory ESL textbooks in Indian schools. The high level of repetition for this specific structure offsets the linguistic barrier.
