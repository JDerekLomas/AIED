### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Less familiar.** While direct/indirect speech is introduced in Grade 7, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the systemic shift in syntax and "tense-backshifting" which does not always have a direct parallel in colloquial Hindi usage.
*   **Computational Complexity (Linguistic logic steps):** **4+ steps.** To reach the correct answer, the student must: (1) Identify the reporting verb, (2) Apply the conjunction "that", (3) Change the first-person pronoun "I" to the third-person "she" based on the subject, and (4) Change the present continuous tense "am reading" to the past continuous "was reading." 
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Common "procedural bugs" for this demographic include:
    *   **Pronoun Retention:** Writing "She said that *I* was reading..."
    *   **Tense Inertia:** Keeping it in the present tense ("She said that she *is* reading...").
    *   **Punctuation confusion:** Retaining quotation marks in indirect speech.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** This requires total recall of grammatical rules rather than recognition (as in multiple choice). While the rubric allows for minor variations, the structural integrity of the tense change is usually binary (correct/incorrect) in scoring practice.
*   **Number Friendliness (Linguistic accessibility):** **Moderate.** The vocabulary ("novel," "reading") is high-frequency and accessible, but the structural transformation remains high-effort.

**Holistic Estimate:** In an economically weaker section (EWS) context with limited English exposure, the jump from simple translation to "backshifting" tenses is a significant hurdle. Many students will provide a partially correct sentence (e.g., changing the pronoun but not the tense), resulting in a zero score under a strict 1-mark rubric.
