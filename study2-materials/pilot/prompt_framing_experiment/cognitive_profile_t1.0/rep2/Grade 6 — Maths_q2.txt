**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. Place value is a foundational topic introduced in primary grades (Classes 3-5) and revisited in Class 6 (Knowing Our Numbers).
*   **Computational complexity:** 1 step. It requires identification and mapping of a digit to its positional value without calculation.
*   **Common error traps:** Minor. The most common "procedural bugs" for this demographic include confusing "place value" (500) with "face value" (5) or miscounting zeros (50 or 5000).
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended. While no partial credit is available, the rubric allows for both the numerical value (500) and the word form (Hundreds), which helps students who may be stronger in conceptual naming than numerical representation.
*   **Number friendliness:** Easy. The number 7560 is a standard four-digit integer with no internal zeros in the tens/units place to confuse the student, and 5 is a "friendly" digit.

**Linguistic/Contextual Note:** In the Indian school context, "place value" is often drilled extensively. However, for Hindi-medium students, the transition to the English term (instead of *sthaniye maan*) can sometimes cause a slight delay in retrieval, though the core mathematical concept is robustly taught.
