**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Perimeter and area are core topics in Grade 6 and 7, but combining them in one problem increases the cognitive load.)

**Computational complexity:** 4+ (Step 1: Substitute values into the formula; Step 2: Solve for width using subtraction and division; Step 3: Use width to calculate area; Step 4: Manage units.)

**Common error traps:** Major (Students often confuse perimeter and area formulas, fail to divide by 2 when finding width, or provide only the width and forget to calculate the area as requested.)

**Format demand:** Open-ended. Requires recall of two distinct formulas and a multi-step algebraic process. With a maximum score of 1 and no partial credit, any procedural slip results in a zero.

**Number friendliness:** Easy (32, 10, and 6 are whole numbers and multiples of 2, minimizing calculation errors.)
