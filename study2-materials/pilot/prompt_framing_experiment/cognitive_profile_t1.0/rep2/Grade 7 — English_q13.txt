**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** **Familiar.** While articles are introduced in primary grades, the distinction between 'a' and 'an' based on phonetics (vowel sounds) is a core component of the Grade 7 English curriculum in India.
*   **Computational complexity:** **N/A.** (Language-based task).
*   **Common error traps:** **Major.** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the "an" before "elephant" due to a lack of phonetic correspondence in their native language's syntax. Additionally, the specific use of "the" for "zoo" (situational uniqueness) is a frequent point of confusion compared to the indefinite articles.
*   **Format demand:** **High.** The rubric requires the student to rewrite the "whole sentence" correctly. This increases the cognitive load, as errors in spelling or transcription of the provided words (e.g., "elephant" or "tiger") may occur, and the lack of partial credit (Maximum score: 1) makes the item "all-or-nothing."
*   **Number friendliness:** **N/A.** (Language-based task).

**Psychometric Analysis**
Given the socioeconomic context and the "whole sentence" requirement, the difficulty is high. While students may know the individual articles, the requirement to reproduce the entire sentence without error, combined with the lack of partial credit for getting 2 out of 3 articles right, significantly lowers the expected success rate.
