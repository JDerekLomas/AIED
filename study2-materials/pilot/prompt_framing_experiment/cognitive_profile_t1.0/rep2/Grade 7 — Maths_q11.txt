**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar**. Data representation is a core part of the NCERT Class 7 curriculum. Students are generally exposed to bar graphs in previous grades, making the basic concept recognizable.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps**. While the arithmetic is minimal, the cognitive load involves determining a scale (division/proportion), mapping values to the Y-axis, and physical plotting.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major**. For this specific demographic, choosing an "appropriate scale" is a high-order hurdle. Students often struggle with inconsistent spacing on the Y-axis (e.g., writing 135, 120, 95 directly on the axis instead of equal intervals like 10, 20, 30). Inadequate labeling of axes is also a frequent procedural bug.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended**. The rubric is "all or nothing" for the 1-mark maximum score. Without partial credit for the graph construction, many students who understand the concept but lack precision in scaling or labeling will fail to meet the full rubric requirement.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Moderate**. If the data includes non-multiples of 10 (e.g., 95 or 135), students find it difficult to plot the point accurately between grid lines, leading to measurement errors.
*   **Language Factor (Contextual):** For Hindi-medium students, the instruction "appropriate scale" is a technical term that may not translate intuitively without strong classroom drilling.
