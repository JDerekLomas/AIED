**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Desert adaptations (like the cactus) are a standard part of the Grade 6 NCERT Science curriculum (Chapter: The Living Organisms and Their Surroundings). However, for students in non-arid regions, it remains a theoretical concept rather than an experiential one.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **None (1).** This is a purely qualitative/descriptive biological item.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** Students often confuse "adaptation" with general growth. A common misconception is that all desert plants lack leaves entirely, rather than understanding that leaves are modified into spines. Language interference (Hindi to English) may lead to students knowing the concept but lacking the specific English vocabulary (e.g., "transpiration" or "succulent").
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** Open-ended questions are significantly more difficult for this demographic than Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs). It requires active recall and the ability to construct a sentence in English. While the rubric is generous (requiring only one point), the transition from "thinking in Hindi" to "writing in English" poses a barrier.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.**

**Holistic Estimate:**
While the science concept is foundational, the requirement to "Explain" in English for a student from a Hindi-medium, economically weaker background introduces a high linguistic threshold. Many students will understand that a cactus has thorns or deep roots but may struggle to articulate the functional "why" (to save/get water) in a way that satisfies a formal rubric.
