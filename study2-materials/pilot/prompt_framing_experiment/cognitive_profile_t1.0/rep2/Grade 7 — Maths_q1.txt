- Concept familiarity: Familiar (Integer multiplication is a core Grade 7 topic, typically introduced early in the curriculum.)
- Computational complexity: 2-3 (Step 1: Multiply absolute values; Step 2: Determine the sign based on rules.)
- Common error traps: Major (The most common error is applying addition rules—where a negative and a negative stay negative—to multiplication, resulting in -12.)
- Format demand: Open-ended (Requires recall of the sign rule without the scaffolding of options; no partial credit for a score of 1.)
- Number friendliness: Easy (3 and 4 are basic single-digit numbers within foundational tables.)
