**Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The term "fable" is introduced early in Grade 8 (e.g., "The Ant and the Cricket" in the NCERT syllabus), but the ability to provide a formal definition in English varies.

**Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical task).

**Common error traps:** Minor. Students often confuse a "fable" with a "folk tale" or a "fairy tale." Many may recall that it involves animals but fail to mention the "moral lesson" component, which is critical for full marks.

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This is high demand for students with limited English proficiency. While they may understand the concept in Hindi (नीतिकथा), articulating the definition in a grammatically correct English sentence is a significant barrier. Partial credit is not possible per the rubric.

**Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Holistic Analysis:** While the concept is taught, the transition from recognition to production (defining) in a second language is a steep climb for students from economically weaker sections with limited English exposure. Many will provide an incomplete answer (e.g., "a story about animals") that does not meet the full rubric requirement.
