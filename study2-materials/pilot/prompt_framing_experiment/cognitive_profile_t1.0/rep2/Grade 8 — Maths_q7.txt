**Concept familiarity:** familiar
(Division with remainders and basic sharing are standard by Grade 8, but the specific logic of "minimum required" for equal distribution—moving to the next multiple—is less practiced than simple division.)

**Computational complexity:** 2-3
(Step 1: Division/Remainder calculation. Step 2: Determining the total for the next multiple. Step 3: Distribution by class.)

**Common error traps:** major
(Students are highly likely to provide "3" or "3.75" as the answer to the first part due to rote division. Many may ignore the word "minimum" and focus only on the 300 provided. The two-part nature of the question increases the risk of a "halt error" where they stop after the first calculation.)

**Format demand:** Open-ended
(Requires exact logical deduction. With a binary score of 1 or 0, any error in the logic of rounding up or the subsequent class division results in zero credit.)

**Number friendliness:** moderate
(Multiples of 80 and 300 are relatively easy, but the lack of "clean" divisibility in the first step (300/80) is a hurdle for students with low confidence in numeracy.)

**Linguistic/Contextual factors:**
For Hindi-medium students, the phrasing "minimum number of chocolates required" (as opposed to "how many does each get") is a high-order linguistic shift. In many Indian government school settings, word problems in English act more as a test of reading comprehension than mathematical ability.
