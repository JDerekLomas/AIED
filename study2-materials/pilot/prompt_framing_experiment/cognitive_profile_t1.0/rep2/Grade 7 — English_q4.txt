- Concept familiarity: less familiar (While the story of "The Three Questions" is a standard text, transitioning from literal comprehension to real-life application/evaluation requires higher-order thinking skills that are often less practiced in rote-learning environments.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Non-mathematical; single-step conceptual processing.)
- Common error traps: major (Students often struggle with "Why" questions, providing a summary of the story rather than a personal "reason." Additionally, the dual-part nature of the question—opinion + reason—often leads to incomplete answers.)
- Format demand: Open-ended; requires sentence construction in English (productive skill). No partial credit per the 1-mark rubric.
- Number friendliness: easy (Not applicable.)

Holistic Analysis:
For students from economically weaker sections in Hindi-medium backgrounds, the primary barrier is the "Language-Cognition Gap." While they may understand the king's questions in their mother tongue, articulating a logical "reason" in English requires syntactic mastery (use of "because," "it is important for...") that many Grade 7 students at this proficiency level have not yet internalized. Most students will likely identify the questions from the text but fail to provide a coherent, original reason in English.
