**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Less familiar.** While the Active-Passive voice transformation is introduced in Grade 7, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the auxiliary verb shifts and the irregular past participle forms (blow-blew-blown). The distinction between "blew" and "blown" is a significant hurdle for ESL learners.
*   **Computational Complexity (Linguistic Steps):** **2-3.** The student must: 1) Identify the object and promote it to the subject position; 2) Determine the correct tense of "to be" (*were* based on *blew*); and 3) Recall/produce the correct Past Participle (*blown*).
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Common errors include using the wrong auxiliary (*are* instead of *were*), using the incorrect participle (*blowed* or *blew*), or failing to include the agent (*by the wind*). For Hindi speakers, the literal translation of passive structures often doesn't map directly to English syntax.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended/Exact.** The rubric requires a full sentence transformation. Since this is a 1-mark item with no specified partial credit, a single mistake in the verb form or spelling of "blown" results in a zero.
*   **Linguistic Friendliness:** **Moderate.** The vocabulary ("wind," "leaves") is basic, but the irregular verb "blow" increases the difficulty significantly compared to regular verbs like "play" or "kick."

**Estimated Success Rate:**
Given the systemic challenges in English language acquisition in this demographic—specifically the reliance on rote memorization and the high difficulty of irregular verb conjugation—only a minority of students will successfully navigate all three transformations (syntax, auxiliary selection, and participle form).
