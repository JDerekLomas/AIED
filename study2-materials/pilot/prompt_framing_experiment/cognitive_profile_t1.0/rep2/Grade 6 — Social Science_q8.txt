- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (While "Child Rights" is part of the Civics/Social and Political Life curriculum, students from EWS backgrounds often experience rights through the lens of duties or lack of access, making formal legal definitions slightly more abstract than personal experience.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (The task is qualitative, requiring only the retrieval and pairing of two concepts.)
- **Common error traps:** Major (Students often confuse "rights" with "needs" or "good habits" (e.g., "going to school" vs "right to education"). Furthermore, the rubric requires a 1-mark maximum for a two-part task; students may list the rights but fail to explain the importance, or provide a vague explanation that doesn't meet the rubric's threshold.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended; requires high-level recall and linguistic construction. The "all-or-nothing" nature of a 1-mark rubric for a multi-step question (Identify + Explain) increases difficulty significantly for students with limited English proficiency.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative item).
