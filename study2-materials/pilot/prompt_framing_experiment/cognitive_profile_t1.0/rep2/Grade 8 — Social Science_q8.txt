- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (This is a core topic in the NCERT/State Board Grade 8 Civics curriculum, usually covered in the first chapter).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative recall, no calculation required).
- Common error traps: Minor (Students may confuse "features" with "preamble keywords" or struggle with English spelling, but the rubric allows for broad interpretation).
- Format demand: Open-ended recall; however, the rubric is highly lenient, requiring only one feature for full marks (no partial credit needed for a 1-point item).
- Number friendliness: Easy (Not applicable).
