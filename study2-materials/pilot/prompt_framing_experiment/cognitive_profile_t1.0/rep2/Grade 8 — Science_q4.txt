**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The structure of a flame is a core topic in Grade 8 Science, Chapter "Coal and Petroleum" or "Combustion and Flame" in the NCERT curriculum).

**Computational complexity:** 1 (No mathematical calculations required).

**Common error traps:** Major (Students frequently confuse the "luminous" vs "non-luminous" zones. Many associate the bright yellow color with high heat, leading them to incorrectly select the middle zone).

**Format demand:** Open-ended; requires recall of the specific zone and the causal reasoning (hottest part/complete combustion). No partial credit per the 1-mark rubric.

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative question).

**Linguistic/Contextual Analysis:** For students from Hindi-medium or economically weaker backgrounds, the term "Goldsmith" (*Sunar*) is culturally relatable. However, explaining the "reason" in English poses a significant barrier. While they may know the fact, articulating "complete combustion" or "hottest part" in a second language reduces the success rate.
