Concept familiarity: Familiar (The concept of personification and basic creative writing are common in Grade 6, though the imaginative "leap" can be challenging for students used to rote memorization).

Computational complexity: 1 (Not applicable/Single cognitive operation of synthesis).

Common error traps: Major (Subject-verb agreement, switching back to third-person "The bird flies" instead of "I fly," and vocabulary limitations related to avian actions like "soaring" or "perching").

Format demand: Open-ended; requires recall and synthesis. Since the maximum score is 1, it is a binary "all-or-nothing" credit system, making it more difficult for students with limited English proficiency to hit all rubric criteria (clarity, creativity, and grammar).

Number friendliness: Easy (Not applicable).
