### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
The concept of HCF is a core component of the Grade 6 NCERT curriculum (Playing with Numbers). Students are generally well-practiced in the procedure of finding factors, though the application of HCF in a word problem context is more challenging than a direct "Find the HCF" prompt.

**Computational Complexity: 2-3 steps**
The student must:
1.  Identify the operation (HCF).
2.  Perform prime factorization or long division for both numbers (75 and 69).
3.  Identify the common factor to find the final result.

**Common Error Traps: Major**
For this specific demographic, the "language-to-math" translation is the primary trap. Students often confuse "maximum value" with Least Common Multiple (LCM) due to the word "maximum" sounding like "multiple." Additionally, the phrase "exact number of times" is a complex linguistic construction for Hindi-medium learners.

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
The question requires recall of the algorithm and the underlying logic. With a maximum score of only 0.5, there is negligible room for partial credit in most grading systems; it is effectively a binary "correct or incorrect" outcome.

**Number Friendliness: Moderate**
While 75 is a very "friendly" number (multiples of 5/25), 69 is less intuitive for students. Many students may struggle to quickly identify that 69 is divisible by 3 ($6+9=15$) and may incorrectly label it as a prime number under exam pressure.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the language barrier regarding the word "measure" and the "maximum" vs "HCF" conceptual leap, many students will either attempt LCM or fail to start the problem correctly.
