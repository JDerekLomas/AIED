- Concept familiarity: very familiar (Local cultural context is strong in Rajasthan's state curriculum, though English-medium testing adds a layer of difficulty).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step identification).
- Common error traps: minor (Confusion between Gangaur and Teej due to similar visual iconography/processions).
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; however, the rubric is binary (0.5 for identification), making it a high-stakes recall task despite the descriptive prompt.
- Number friendliness: easy (Not applicable).
