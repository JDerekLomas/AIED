**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Problems involving "ages" and multiples (thrice/twice) are staple word problems in Grade 8 NCERT/State Board curricula.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2–3 steps.** 
    1. Calculate father's current age ($12 \times 3 = 36$).
    2. Subtract to find the age difference ($36 - 12 = 24$). 
    *Note: A third step (adding 5 years to both and subtracting) is a common but unnecessary path.*
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** This is a classic "distractor" problem. Students in this demographic often struggle with the linguistic logic that the age difference remains constant. A significant portion will perform $(36 + 5) - (12 + 5)$ correctly, but many will mistakenly add 5 to only one person or, more commonly, add 5 to the current difference ($24 + 5 = 29$), assuming the gap grows over time.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** As an open-ended question with a binary rubric (Max score 1, no partial credit mentioned for the specific answer), there is no safety net for calculation errors or "logic jumps."
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The numbers 12, 3, and 5 are low-value integers that do not require complex long-form multiplication or division.

**Holistic Estimate:**
While the arithmetic is simple, the linguistic shift from "thrice" to "difference after 5 years" acts as a significant conceptual barrier for students with limited English proficiency. Many will revert to "pattern matching"—adding all numbers mentioned in the prompt ($36 + 12 + 5$) or calculating the father's future age ($41$) and stopping there.
