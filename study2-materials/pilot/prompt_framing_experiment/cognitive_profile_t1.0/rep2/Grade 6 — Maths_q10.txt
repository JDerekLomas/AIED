- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. Protractor use is introduced in Grade 5, but Grade 6 is where "obtuse" vs "acute" identification becomes a formal requirement in the Indian NCERT curriculum.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. The task is purely procedural (physical construction) rather than arithmetic.
- **Common error traps:** Major. The "double-scale" protractor is a significant barrier for ESL students. Without a strong grasp of the terms "acute" and "obtuse," students frequently read the inner scale instead of the outer scale (or vice versa), resulting in the supplement (e.g., drawing 70° instead of 110°).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Construction). This requires fine motor skills and exact alignment of the vertex and baseline. In many government school settings, access to high-quality geometry boxes (non-broken, clear protractors) is a constraint.
- **Number friendliness:** Moderate. 40° is a standard acute angle, but 110° (obtuse) is the primary "trap" number.
