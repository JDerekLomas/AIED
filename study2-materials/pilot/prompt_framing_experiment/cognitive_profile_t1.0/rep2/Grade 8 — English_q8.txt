**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** While Active-Passive voice is a core component of the Grade 8 English curriculum (NCERT/State Boards), the dual-sentence requirement increases the cognitive load. Sentence B ("has found") introduces the Present Perfect tense, which is significantly less practiced and more difficult for students than the Simple Past in Sentence A.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** For each sentence, the student must: 1. Identify the object/subject shift, 2. Select the correct auxiliary verb based on tense (was/has been), and 3. Use the past participle form.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with "be" verb selection. Common "procedural bugs" include:
    *   Tense shifting (e.g., changing "prepared" to "is prepared").
    *   Missing the "been" in Sentence B (e.g., writing "The successor has found...").
    *   Subject-verb agreement errors.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended / Exact.** The rubric specifies a maximum score of 1 and requires both transformations to be correct for full credit. There is no provision for partial credit for completing only Sentence A, which significantly lowers the success rate.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Moderate.** In a linguistic context, the vocabulary ("Successor," "Delicious") is moderately challenging for students with limited English proficiency.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given that Sentence B requires the Present Perfect Passive and the rubric requires both sentences to be correct for a single mark, many students will fail to achieve the full score despite potentially getting Sentence A right.
