- Concept familiarity: Familiar (The topic of physical properties of metals is a standard part of the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (This is a pure recall task with no mathematical operations.)
- Common error traps: Minor (Students often confuse "Malleability" with "Ductility." For Hindi-medium students, the scientific terminology in English is a significant hurdle.)
- Format demand: Open-ended recall; No partial credit. The student must produce the specific technical term.
- Number friendliness: N/A (Non-numerical question.)
