- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Conduction is a core, high-frequency topic in the Grade 7 Science curriculum, often introduced with this specific real-world example).
- Computational complexity: 1 (No calculations involved).
- Common error traps: Minor (Students may confuse the terms 'conduction' and 'convection' or use the general term 'heating' instead of the specific process name).
- Format demand: Open-ended; requires recall of specific terminology. While the rubric specifies 0.5 marks for part (a), the full correct answer requires both naming and a brief explanation. For students with limited English proficiency, explaining the molecular mechanism in part (b) is significantly more difficult than naming the process in part (a).
- Number friendliness: N/A (Qualitative question).
