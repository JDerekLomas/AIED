Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Photosynthesis is a core topic introduced in primary grades and reinforced in Grade 6.)
Computational complexity: 1 (The item requires simple factual recall/identification.)
Common error traps: Minor (Students may confuse "chlorophyll" with the process or struggle with the spelling of "Photosynthesis.")
Format demand: High (Open-ended recall is required. The rubric is binary/strict with a low maximum score, though the prompt asks for two distinct facts for only 0.5 points.)
Number friendliness: N/A (Non-numerical item.)

**Psychometric Profile Analysis:**
For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the conceptual hurdle is low as "prakash sanshleshan" (photosynthesis) is well-understood. However, the English spelling of "Photosynthesis" is a significant bottleneck. Furthermore, the 0.5-mark ceiling for a two-part question (Process + Kitchen/Leaf) makes the item high-stakes for a small reward, potentially leading to incomplete answers if the student only identifies one part.

Your estimate:
