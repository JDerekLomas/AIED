- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Seasons are a core part of the primary curriculum and daily life experience in India).
- Computational complexity: 1 (The task as per the rubric is a single identification/naming step).
- Common error traps: Minor (Students may confuse "season" with "weather" or "festival," or struggle with English spelling despite knowing the concept).
- Format demand: Open-ended recall; however, the rubric is binary (all-or-nothing for naming the season), making it a low-barrier identification task despite the prompt's request for a paragraph.
- Number friendliness: Easy (Not applicable to this linguistic task).
