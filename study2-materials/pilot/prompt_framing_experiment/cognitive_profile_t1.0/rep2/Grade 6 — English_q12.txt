**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** Very familiar. Antonyms are a foundational element of the Grade 6 English curriculum. "Up/Down" is a primary binary pair introduced in early primary years.
*   **Computational Complexity:** 1. This is a single-step retrieval task (lexical recall).
*   **Common Error Traps:** Minor. The primary risk is a spelling error (e.g., "douwn" or "don") rather than a conceptual misunderstanding. In the context of Hindi-medium students, the concept of "upar/neeche" is universal, and "up/down" are high-frequency loanwords often used in colloquial Hinglish.
*   **Format Demand:** Open-ended (recall). While recall is harder than recognition (multiple choice), the brevity of the required word ("down") minimizes the demand. The rubric is binary (0 or 1), allowing no partial credit for near-misses.
*   **Number Friendliness:** N/A (Verbal item).

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the high frequency of these words in basic vocabulary drills and everyday classroom instructions (e.g., "Stand up," "Sit down"), even students with limited English proficiency are highly likely to have mastered this specific pair by Grade 6.
