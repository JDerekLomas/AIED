- Concept familiarity: familiar (Theme identification is a standard requirement for Grade 6, though the abstract nature of "importance" can be challenging for those with limited vocabulary.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step conceptual retrieval.)
- Common error traps: major (Students often struggle to differentiate between a detail in the poem and the "most important" theme; language barrier often leads to literal copying of the first line rather than thematic synthesis.)
- Format demand: Open-ended; partial credit is possible based on the rubric, but the requirement to synthesize a theme in English increases difficulty.
- Number friendliness: N/A (Qualitative item.)
