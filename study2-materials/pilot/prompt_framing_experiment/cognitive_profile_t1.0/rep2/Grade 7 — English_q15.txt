- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. 'My Favourite Hobby' is a staple topic in the Indian school curriculum from primary grades onwards.
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No arithmetic steps; single cognitive task of composition).
- **Common error traps:** Major. While the topic is familiar, the "all or nothing" rubric (Max score 1) makes grammatical errors, tense inconsistency (mixing present and past), and syntax issues common "traps" that prevent a perfect score. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with subject-verb agreement and prepositional use in free-writing tasks.
- **Format demand:** High. Open-ended recall with no partial credit. The rubric requires three specific criteria (what, when, why) to be met within a cohesive paragraph; a single missing element or structural failure results in zero.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative task).

**Holistic Estimate:** While the topic is highly accessible, the lack of partial credit for a 7th-grade writing task significantly lowers the success rate. Students often provide a list of sentences rather than a "complete paragraph" or omit one of the three required prompts (specifically "when" or "why") due to limited English vocabulary.
