- Concept familiarity: familiar (Natural resources are covered in Grade 6 Geography, and Rajasthan's mineral wealth is a point of regional pride, though differentiating "natural" from "man-made" can sometimes be a hurdle).
- Computational complexity: 1 (No calculation required, but requires a two-part logical retrieval).
- Common error traps: minor (Students often confuse "natural resources" with "crops" or "industries." Linguistic interference may lead them to name items in Hindi but struggle with English spelling).
- Format demand: Open-ended (Requires high recall and the ability to construct a cause-effect sentence. The rubric specifies a maximum score of 1 with no mention of partial credit, making it an "all or nothing" demand for a multi-part question).
- Number friendliness: easy (Qualitative data only).
