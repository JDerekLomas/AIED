### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

**Concept familiarity: Familiar**
Algebraic identities and binomial multiplication are core components of the Class 8 NCERT curriculum (Chapter 9). While the concept is central, students from economically weaker sections (EWS) often face gaps in foundational variable manipulation from Class 6 and 7.

**Computational complexity: 4+ steps**
To reach the final simplified answer, a student must:
1. Distribute the first term: $3a(2a + 3b)$
2. Distribute the second term: $-2b(2a + 3b)$
3. Perform four distinct multiplications ($6a^2$, $9ab$, $-4ab$, $-6b^2$)
4. Combine like terms ($9ab - 4ab$)

**Common error traps: Major**
There are three significant "procedural bugs" common in this demographic:
*   **Sign errors:** Handling the negative sign in $-2b \times 3b$ often results in $+6b^2$.
*   **Variable confusion:** Misunderstanding $a \times a = a^2$ (often written as $2a$ or just $a$).
*   **Like-term identification:** Difficulty in realizing that $ab$ and $ba$ are equivalent and can be simplified.

**Format demand: Open-ended**
The question is open-ended, requiring recall of the FOIL/Distributive method rather than recognition (as in multiple-choice). Since the rubric requires a full expansion for a single point (binary scoring), there is no "cushion" for a student who makes a single sign error but understands the process.

**Number friendliness: Easy**
The coefficients (2 and 3) are small, single-digit integers. The difficulty is purely algebraic/structural rather than arithmetic.

**Language/Context Factor:**
For Hindi-medium students, the term "product" (गुणनफल) and "binomials" (द्विपद) are standard, but the symbolic nature of English-alphabet variables ($a, b$) acts as a secondary layer of abstraction.

### Holistic Estimate
Given the binary scoring (1 or 0) and the high probability of a sign error or a power error ($a \times a$), a significant portion of the cohort will demonstrate "partial mastery" but fail to produce the exact correct string required for the mark.
