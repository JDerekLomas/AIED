- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The Himalayas are a core topic in Indian geography curricula from Grade 4 onwards; however, Grade 7 focuses on deeper climatic and socio-economic impacts).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No arithmetic steps required).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse "significance" with "description," e.g., naming peaks instead of explaining impacts like climate barriers or river sources).
- **Format demand:** High (Open-ended recall). While the rubric says "any two points," the max score is 1, implying a binary pass/fail for the task. The linguistic barrier is significant for Hindi-medium students who must articulate complex geographical concepts (e.g., "monsoon winds," "perennial rivers") in English.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question).

**Holistic Estimation:**
Despite the familiarity of the topic, the transition from rote memorization of facts to "explaining significance" in English poses a substantial challenge for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. Many will understand the concept but struggle to structure a grammatically correct or "plausible" response in a second language.
