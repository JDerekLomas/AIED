**Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The Vedic period is a core component of the Grade 6 History syllabus (NCERT/State Boards). Students are generally introduced to the transition from pastoralism to settled agriculture during this unit.

**Computational complexity:** 1. This is a purely qualitative recall and descriptive task involving no mathematical operations.

**Common error traps:** Minor. The primary trap is the transition period itself; students may confuse the Early Vedic (pastoral) vs. Later Vedic (agricultural) dominance. However, the rubric accepts both, which mitigates this trap. Another minor trap is linguistic—students may know the concept in Hindi (Pashupalan/Krishi) but struggle to retrieve the specific English terminology.

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). Unlike multiple-choice questions, this requires active retrieval and sentence construction. For students with limited English proficiency, "describing one key aspect" poses a significant hurdle compared to simple identification. Partial credit is not mentioned in the rubric (Max score 1), implying an "all-or-nothing" demand which increases difficulty.

**Number friendliness:** Easy. Not applicable as there are no numerical values involved.

**Holistic Analysis:** While the content is foundational, the requirement to write a descriptive sentence in English will be the primary barrier for students from Hindi-medium, economically weaker backgrounds. Many will identify the occupation (Agriculture/Cattle rearing) but may fail to provide a coherent "key aspect" in English, leading to a loss of the single mark under a binary rubric.
