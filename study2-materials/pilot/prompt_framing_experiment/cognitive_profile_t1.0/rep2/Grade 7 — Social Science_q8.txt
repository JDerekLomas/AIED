- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Rajasthan's rural economy is a core part of the SCERT/NCERT Class 7 curriculum, and students often have lived experience or contextual knowledge of these livelihoods).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; single-step retrieval and description).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse "rural" with "urban" occupations or list industrial jobs, but the distinction is generally clear at this level).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires recall and basic sentence construction; the rubric is strict for a 1-mark question requiring both naming and description, which may penalize students with very low English literacy).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Not applicable).
