**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The Battle of Plassey is a cornerstone of the Grade 8 NCERT History curriculum ("From Trade to Territory"). It is frequently emphasized as a turning point, making the core event recognizable to most students.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** This is a qualitative historical inquiry requiring no mathematical operations.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, the phrase "contribute to the expansion" is linguistically dense. Many students may focus on describing *how the battle was won* (tactics/betrayal) rather than the *political consequences* (expansion of power) required by the rubric. Misunderstanding the "puppet nawab" concept as simple "winning a war" is a common conceptual gap.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended (High Demand).** Unlike multiple-choice questions, this requires active retrieval and the ability to construct a logical sentence in English. Without partial credit (as per the 0/1 rubric), students who understand the concept but cannot articulate it precisely in English will fail.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The date (1757) is provided in the prompt, reducing the cognitive load for rote recall.

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given the language barrier and the requirement to explain a political outcome (causality) rather than just identifying an event, many students will struggle to meet the specific rubric criteria in English, despite having the historical knowledge.
