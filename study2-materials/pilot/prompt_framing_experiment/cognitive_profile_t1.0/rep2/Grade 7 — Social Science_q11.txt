- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (NCERT Grade 7 Civics, Chapter 2: 'Role of the Government in Health' covers this extensively).
- **Computational complexity:** 0 (Non-mathematical item).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often conflate 'public' with 'private' in written explanations due to language interference, or provide two examples of one type rather than distinguishing between both).
- **Format demand:** High (Open-ended recall). While the concept is simple, the requirement to "evaluate" and "provide valid arguments/examples" in English is a significant hurdle for Hindi-medium learners. The rubric is binary (1 or 0), making it a high-stakes response.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Holistic Estimation:** While students understand the difference intuitively (e.g., government hospitals are free but crowded), the cognitive load of structured comparison and the language barrier for students from economically weaker sections often results in incomplete or disorganized written responses that fail to meet the "one valid argument for each" criteria under a binary rubric.
