- Concept familiarity: **Familiar** (The rock cycle is a core component of the NCERT Grade 7 Geography curriculum, specifically Chapter 2: "Inside Our Earth.")
- Computational complexity: **1** (Qualitative description only; no calculation required.)
- Common error traps: **Major** (Students often confuse the sequence of the cycle or conflate "sedimentation" with "metamorphism." For this specific demographic, a major trap is the English vocabulary—terms like "weathering," "erosion," and "sediments" are linguistically dense for ESL learners.)
- Format demand: **Open-ended** (Requires active recall and sentence construction in English. Since the rubric is binary (1 or 0) and requires a two-part explanation—breaking down and transporting—there is no room for partial credit.)
- Number friendliness: **Easy** (N/A)

**Holistic Estimate:**
While the topic is standard, the requirement to explain a process in English is a significant barrier for students from Hindi-medium, economically weaker backgrounds. They may understand the geological process conceptually but struggle to recall and articulate the specific English terminology required by the rubric.
