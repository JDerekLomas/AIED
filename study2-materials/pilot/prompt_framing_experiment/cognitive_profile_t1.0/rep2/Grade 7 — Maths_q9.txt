**Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The unitary method and basic multiplication are core parts of the Grade 6 and 7 curriculum. However, applying them to mixed fractions moves it toward "less familiar" for students with weak foundational bases.

**Computational complexity:** 2-3 steps. 
1. Convert the mixed fraction ($5 \frac{3}{4}$) into an improper fraction ($\frac{23}{4}$) or a decimal ($5.75$).
2. Multiply by the whole number ($10$).
3. Simplify/divide to find the final product ($57.5$ or $57 \frac{1}{2}$).

**Common error traps:** Major. For this specific demographic, the transition from whole numbers to fractions is a significant hurdle. Common errors include:
- Ignoring the fraction and multiplying $10 \times 5$.
- Incorrectly converting the mixed fraction (e.g., adding instead of multiplying the whole number and denominator).
- Conceptual confusion on whether to divide or multiply.

**Format demand:** Open-ended/Exact. Since the rubric requires identifying the correct operation and reaching the solution for 1 mark, there is no buffer for procedural slips.

**Number friendliness:** Moderate. While $10$ is a friendly number for multiplication, the denominator $4$ does not result in a whole number when multiplied by $10$ ($10 \times 3/4 = 7.5$), requiring the student to handle decimals or remainders.

**Holistic Estimate:** While the logic is simple, the combination of English-language word problem phrasing and mixed-fraction arithmetic presents a significant barrier for students in economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency.
