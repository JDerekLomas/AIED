**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. The Fundamental Rights are a core component of the Grade 8 Civics curriculum (NCERT) and are frequently reinforced through classroom displays, textbooks, and previous grade levels.
*   **Computational complexity:** 1. There are no mathematical operations involved; it is a straightforward retrieval task.
*   **Common error traps:** Minor. Students might confuse "Fundamental Rights" with "Fundamental Duties" or "Directive Principles," but the rubric's allowance for simplified phrasing mitigates the risk of failing due to precise terminology.
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This is higher than a multiple-choice question but eased by the fact that students only need to recall 2 out of 6 possible rights. The binary scoring (Max 1) means no partial credit, but the rubric is lenient on language.
*   **Number friendliness:** Easy. Recalling a count of "two" is the simplest form of list-based retrieval.

**Holistic Estimation**
Given that this is a high-frequency topic in Indian government schools and the rubric allows for Hindi-influenced or simplified English phrasing (e.g., "Equality right" or "Right to follow religion"), the item has high accessibility despite the English medium. The primary barrier is linguistic recall for the specific terms, but the conceptual weight is low.
