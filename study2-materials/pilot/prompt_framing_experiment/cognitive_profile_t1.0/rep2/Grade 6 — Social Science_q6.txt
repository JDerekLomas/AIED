**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Familiar.** This is a foundational topic usually taught in the first chapter of the Grade 6 History syllabus ("What, Where, How and When"). While the concepts are introductory, the distinction between "tangible" and "written" evidence is a key learning objective early in the academic year.
*   **Computational Complexity: 1.** This is a purely qualitative task requiring no mathematical operations.
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.** For Hindi-medium students, the vocabulary is a significant hurdle. The terms "Archaeological" and "Literary" are multi-syllabic and abstract. Students often confuse "Inscriptions" (Archaeological) with "Manuscripts" (Literary) because both involve writing. Additionally, students often provide a definition but forget the example, or vice-versa, failing the binary rubric.
*   **Format Demand: Open-ended.** This requires high-level recall and the ability to construct a comparative sentence in English. Since the rubric is "All or Nothing" (Max score 1), there is no safety net for students who understand the concept but struggle with English syntax or provide only a partial answer.
*   **Number Friendliness: N/A.**

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the linguistic barrier (English medium testing for Hindi-background students) and the dual-requirement rubric (definition + example for both types) without partial credit, many students will provide incomplete or linguistically garbled responses despite having a conceptual grasp.
