**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Familiar.** Properties of parallelograms (opposite angles are equal, adjacent angles are supplementary) are core Grade 8 NCERT topics. However, students from lower-resource backgrounds often struggle with the transition from visual identification to formal geometric reasoning.
*   **Computational Complexity: 1-2.** Finding $x$ usually involves a single subtraction ($180 - \text{given angle}$) or direct identification if it is an opposite angle. The requirement of an "explanation" adds a layer of complexity for ESL/Hindi-medium students.
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.** Students frequently confuse interior supplementary angles with equal opposite angles. For Hindi-medium students, translating the geometric logic ("Adjacent angles are supplementary") into English for the explanation is a significant barrier.
*   **Format Demand: High.** The rubric requires both the correct value and an explanation for a single point. No partial credit for just the number "110" makes this a "binary" success metric that penalizes students with weak English literacy.
*   **Number Friendliness: Easy.** Assuming the given angle is $70^\circ$ (to result in $110^\circ$), the arithmetic is simple mental subtraction.

**Estimation**
While the math is straightforward, the "all or nothing" rubric combined with the requirement for a written explanation poses a significant hurdle for students with limited English proficiency. Many will find the correct number but fail to provide a qualifying linguistic explanation.
