**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Less familiar.** While "Democracy" and "Role of Government" are introduced in Grade 7 (NCERT), the specific term "transparency" (*pardarshita*) is an abstract civic concept that is often difficult for students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds to internalize without concrete examples like the RTI Act.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** This is a qualitative, non-mathematical item.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students often confuse "transparency" with general "good governance" or "honesty." Common incorrect responses might include "government should work hard" or "don't take bribes," which do not specifically address the mechanisms of making information accessible.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** This is an open-ended, subjective question requiring higher-order thinking (Bloom's: Create/Suggest). It requires active recall and the ability to formulate a sentence in English, which is a significant barrier for ESL (English as a Second Language) learners.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.**

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given the language barrier and the abstract nature of the term "transparency" for 12-13 year olds who may not have high exposure to civic discourse outside of textbooks, most students will struggle to provide a specific mechanism (like digitizing records or public audits) required for the mark.
