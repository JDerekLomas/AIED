Concept familiarity: familiar (Pitcher plant is a core example in the NCERT Grade 7 Science curriculum, Chapter 1).
Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative recall and reasoning only).
Common error traps: major (Students often struggle to explain *why* a photosynthetic plant needs insects; they commonly assume it is for energy/food rather than nitrogen. Language barriers may also hinder the articulation of "insectivorous").
Format demand: Open-ended (High demand; requires active recall of specific terminology and conceptual explanation in English).
Number friendliness: easy (No numerical calculation required).
