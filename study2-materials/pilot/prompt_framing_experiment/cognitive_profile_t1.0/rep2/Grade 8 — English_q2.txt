- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Students are accustomed to identifying sensory details in comprehension passages, though connecting "sunset" to "birds returning" requires specific contextual inference).
- **Computational complexity:** N/A (Language task).
- **Common error traps:** Major (The primary trap is the linguistic barrier; students often struggle to paraphrase "returning to their nests" and may instead copy irrelevant text or provide generic answers like "noise" without the specific context required by the rubric).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall and sentence construction; since it is a binary 0/1 score, no partial credit is available for near-misses).
- **Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Holistic Estimate:** Given the English proficiency gap in EWS/Hindi-medium contexts, students often struggle with the "inference" step (linking sunset to specific bird behaviors) and the "production" step (writing a coherent English phrase) even if they understand the passage.
