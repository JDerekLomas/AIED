**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (This is a core pillar of the Grade 8 NCERT History curriculum, "From Trade to Territory," and is heavily emphasized in classroom instruction.)

**Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical item; requires single-step conceptual retrieval.)

**Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse specific battle dates or names, but the rubric only requires identifying the transition from traders to rulers, which is the central narrative of the textbook.)

**Format demand:** Open-ended; requires recall. However, the rubric is exceptionally lenient for a "Describe" prompt, requiring only a mention of their arrival as traders or the establishment of factories to earn the full 1 point.

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative historical question.)

**Psychometric Analysis:**
The item presents a high "facility value" (is easy) because the rubric is significantly decoupled from the verb "Describe." While a true description of the political transition is cognitively demanding for ESL/Hindi-medium learners, the rubric only asks for a basic fact (arrival as traders) that is repeated frequently in both Hindi and English instruction. The linguistic barrier is mitigated by the simplicity of the required answer.
