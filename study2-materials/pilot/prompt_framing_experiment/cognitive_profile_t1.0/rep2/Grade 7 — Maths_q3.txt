- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The formula for the area of a triangle is a core component of the Grade 7 Mensuration syllabus in India (NCERT/State Boards), typically introduced after the area of a rectangle.
- **Computational complexity:** 2-3 steps. (1. Recall formula, 2. Substitute values, 3. Multiply/Divide). 
- **Common error traps:** Minor. The most common "procedural bug" is forgetting the "1/2" and simply multiplying base × height (calculating the area of a rectangle instead).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. Requires recall of the formula from memory. While the rubric says "states or uses," a 1-mark maximum score usually implies an "all-or-nothing" exact answer in many Indian government school testing contexts.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. The numbers 8 and 6 are small, even integers, making the division by 2 mentally straightforward.

**Contextual Consideration:** For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the terms "base" (आधार) and "height" (ऊंचाई) are basic vocabulary, but the English phrasing "whose base is..." may pose a minor linguistic barrier compared to a direct "Find the area." However, the mathematical syntax is standard enough that most students will recognize the operation required.
