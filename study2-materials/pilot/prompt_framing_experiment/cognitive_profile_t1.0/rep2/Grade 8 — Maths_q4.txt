### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
Linear equations with one variable are a core part of the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum (Chapter 2). While the "cross-multiplication" method is standard, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often learn it through procedural drills ("Vajra-gunan"), making the pattern recognizable.

**Computational Complexity: 4+ steps**
To reach the final answer, a student must:
1. Identify and apply cross-multiplication.
2. Distribute the coefficients: $5x - 25$ and $3x - 9$.
3. Transpose terms ($5x - 3x = 25 - 9$).
4. Simplify to $2x = 16$.
5. Perform final division ($x = 8$).

**Common Error Traps: Major**
For this specific demographic, the most significant "procedural bugs" include:
- **Distribution Errors:** Multiplying the coefficient only by the variable and not the constant (e.g., $5x - 5$ instead of $5x - 25$).
- **Transposition Errors:** Failing to change the sign when moving constants or variables across the equals sign (especially with the $-9$ and $-25$).
- **Conceptual Confusion:** Attempting to subtract the denominators across the equals sign.

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
This requires full recall of the algebraic process. Since the rubric specifies a maximum score of 1 based on the initial step, but the prompt asks for the "fully correct answer," the lack of partial credit for an arithmetic slip at the end increases the difficulty.

**Number Friendliness: Easy**
The numbers (3, 5, 8, 16, 25) are all small integers within the standard multiplication tables. The final result ($x=8$) is a clean integer, which serves as a positive feedback loop for the student.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the language barrier (which makes word problems harder but keeps symbolic equations relatively accessible) and the high likelihood of sign-change or distribution errors, approximately 40% of students are expected to navigate all 4+ steps without a procedural lapse.
