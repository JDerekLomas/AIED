- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Agriculture is a core theme in the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum, specifically under 'Nutrition in Plants' and 'Soil'.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Qualitative reasoning; no calculation required.)
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse "nutrient deficiency" with "lack of water" or "pests." There is a linguistic risk where they understand the concept in Hindi but fail to recall the specific English terms for nutrients.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall of specific terminology like 'fertilizers' or 'NPK' without cues; no partial credit according to the rubric.)
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Non-numerical item.)

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the concept is culturally and academically relevant to students from rural or lower-income backgrounds, the linguistic barrier in English-medium testing is significant for this cohort. Expressing "stunted growth" and "nutrient deficiency" in a second language, coupled with the need for specific technical vocabulary (Nitrogen/Phosphorus/Potassium), creates a bottleneck. Many students will understand the "farming" logic but may struggle to provide the exact technical response required by a binary rubric.
