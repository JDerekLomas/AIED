### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Very familiar**
The "King and the Three Questions" (Leo Tolstoy) is a seminal text in the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum (*Honeycomb*). Most students in Indian government schools will have encountered this story multiple times through classroom readings and summaries.

**Computational Complexity: N/A**
This is a qualitative reading comprehension item.

**Common Error Traps: Minor**
The primary trap is a language barrier rather than a conceptual misunderstanding. Students may understand *why* (the motive) but struggle to articulate it in English. They might confuse the "reward" with the "answers" themselves or provide a circular response (e.g., "Because he wanted to give money").

**Format Demand: High**
As an open-ended question, it requires active recall and sentence construction rather than recognition (MCQ). For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the transition from understanding the story in their mother tongue to writing a grammatically correct sentence in English presents a significant barrier. While the rubric allows for "any similar reason," the lack of partial credit (binary 0/1) penalizes students with weak syntax.

**Number Friendliness: N/A**
This is a linguistic task.

**Contextual Consideration**
For students from economically weaker sections (EWS) and Hindi-medium backgrounds, the challenge is not the narrative logic (which is simple), but the **expressive vocabulary**. While they likely know the story, the "Maximum score: 1" rubric implies they must produce a coherent English phrase. Many will provide one-word answers ("questions") or fragmented English, which may or may not be accepted depending on the strictness of the evaluator.
