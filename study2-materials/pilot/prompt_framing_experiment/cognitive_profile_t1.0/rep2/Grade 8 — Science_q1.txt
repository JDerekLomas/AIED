**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. The topic of food spoilage and microorganisms is a core part of the Class 8 NCERT Science curriculum (Chapter 2: Microorganisms: Friend and Foe). Additionally, bread mould is a standard observational experiment.

**Computational complexity:** 1. No calculation is required; it is a purely qualitative observational and inferential task.

**Common error traps:** Minor. Students may confuse the specific agent (fungi/mould) with "bacteria" or general "moisture/dampness." However, most students in this demographic are familiar with the physical appearance of spoiled rot (Phaphundi/Ulli).

**Format demand:** Open-ended recall. While the student must produce the term, the rubric allows for flexibility (Mould/Fungi/Spoilage). This reduces the "exact word" penalty, though the transition from Hindi (Phaphundi) to English (Fungi/Mould) can be a hurdle for ESL learners.

**Number friendliness:** Not applicable (no numbers involved).

**Holistic Estimate:** Given that this is a highly relatable, real-world observation reinforced by both the textbook and daily life, a majority of students are expected to identify the cause, even if their English terminology is basic.
