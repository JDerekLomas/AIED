### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

*   **Concept familiarity:** **Familiar.** Basic probability using the "marbles/balls in a bag" model is a standard part of the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum (Data Handling chapter). However, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the English term "drawn at random" if the instructor hasn't bridged the vocabulary gap.
*   **Computational complexity:** **2–3 steps.**
    1. Addition: $4 + 6 = 10$ (Total outcomes).
    2. Formulation: Ratio of $\frac{\text{favorable}}{\text{total}}$.
    3. Simplification (optional but often expected): Reducing $\frac{4}{10}$ to $\frac{2}{5}$ or $0.4$.
*   **Common error traps:** **Major.**
    1. **Ratio Confusion:** Students often calculate the ratio of one color to the other ($\frac{4}{6}$) instead of the part-to-whole ratio ($\frac{4}{10}$).
    2. **Inverse Probability:** Calculating the probability of the white ball instead of the black ball.
    3. **Language Barrier:** Misunderstanding "favourable" in the context of the specific color requested.
*   **Format demand:** **Open-ended (Exact).** The rubric requires identifying both components. Without multiple-choice cues, students must recall the formula from memory. No partial credit is awarded for just identifying the total or the favorable count.
*   **Number friendliness:** **Easy.** The sum (10) makes division and decimal conversion straightforward, reducing the likelihood of calculation errors.

### Holistic Estimate
While the numbers are "friendly," the transition from Hindi to English medium often creates a barrier in interpreting word problems. In government school settings, the specific misconception of comparing parts (4:6) instead of the whole (4:10) is a frequent distractor that lowers the success rate.
