- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Rhyming words are a foundational skill introduced in primary grades and frequently practiced in Grade 8 poetry lessons).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step identification and matching task).
- Common error traps: Minor (Students may struggle with the phonetic similarity of "borrow/tomorrow" due to the irregular spelling of "borrow," or they might misread "rain/grain" if they have low decoding skills, but the visual mapping is straightforward).
- Format demand: Open-ended/Recall (Requires exact pairing; however, the rubric only asks for one pair, reducing the burden of recall).
- Number friendliness: N/A (Language-based task).

Holistic Analysis: While English proficiency is limited, "rhyming words" is one of the most accessible tasks for Hindi-medium students because it relies on phonetic matching rather than deep semantic comprehension of the stanza. The visual suffix "-ain" in both "rain" and "grain" provides a strong orthographic cue that aids students even if their vocabulary is limited. The primary barrier is the "Write" command (active production) versus multiple choice.
