- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. In the Indian Grade 6 curriculum (NCERT/State boards), the Present Continuous tense is a core topic. However, the term "verb phrase" is a metalanguage concept that may be less familiar than the action itself.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a single-step identification task.
- **Common error traps:** Major. For students with limited English proficiency, the most common error is "under-inclusion" (selecting only "playing" and omitting the auxiliary "are") or "over-inclusion" (selecting "playing football"). In Hindi, the auxiliary is often fused or follows a different pattern, leading students to focus solely on the main action word.
- **Format demand:** High. As an open-ended identification task without options, it requires pure recall/application. There is no partial credit; the student must precisely isolate "are playing."
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Language task).

Holistic Estimate: While the sentence is simple, the specific requirement to identify the *phrase* (auxiliary + participle) rather than just the action verb is a significant hurdle for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds who often equate "verb" strictly with the lexical action.
