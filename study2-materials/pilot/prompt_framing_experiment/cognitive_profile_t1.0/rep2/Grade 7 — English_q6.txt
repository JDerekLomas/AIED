- **Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. Grade 7 students in Indian government schools are generally trained to extract facts from poems (comprehension) rather than perform literary analysis or meta-commentary on a poet's "style."
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Single cognitive task).
- **Common error traps:** Major. Students often confuse "writing style" with "subject matter" (describing what the poem is about rather than how it is written). Limited English vocabulary makes it difficult to retrieve abstract adjectives like "informal" or "descriptive."
- **Format demand:** Open-ended recall. No options provided; requires active retrieval of specific literary vocabulary in a second language. No partial credit.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A.

Holistic Estimate: The abstract nature of "writing style" combined with the English language barrier makes this a high-difficulty item for this demographic. Most students will likely describe the plot of the poem instead of the style.
