- Concept familiarity: familiar (Evaporation is a core topic in Grade 7 Science, though the specific concept of "non-volatile solutes" affecting evaporation rates is often introduced conceptually rather than through rigorous experimentation in this demographic.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (The student only needs to compare three numbers in a table to identify the minimum value.)
- Common error traps: minor (Some students might confuse "fastest" with the "largest number" in the table, a common inverse relationship error in time-based data sets.)
- Format demand: Open-ended (Requires a written explanation for part B, which increases the linguistic demand for ESL/Hindi-medium students, though the rubric only explicitly scores part A.)
- Number friendliness: easy (Assuming standard integer or simple decimal values for time.)
