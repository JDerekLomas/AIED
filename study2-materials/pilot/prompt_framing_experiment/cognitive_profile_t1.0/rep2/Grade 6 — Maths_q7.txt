**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Temperature and unitary method are standard in Grade 6, but the elapsed time calculation across am/pm can be tricky).
**Computational complexity:** 2-3 steps (1. Calculate time difference; 2. Multiply rate by time; 3. Add to initial temperature).
**Common error traps:** Major (The "12-hour clock" transition is a significant hurdle; students often subtract 4 from 10 to get 6 hours by luck, or mistakenly count 2 hours if they don't bridge the noon gap correctly. Additionally, language barriers regarding "per hour" vs "at 4:00" may cause confusion).
**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires exact answer; no partial credit based on the 1-point rubric).
**Number friendliness:** Easy (Integers 10, 30, 2, and 4 are mentally manageable).

**Holistic Estimate:** While the arithmetic is simple, the linguistic demand of the word problem combined with the conceptual jump from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm (crossing the 12:00 threshold) poses a significant challenge for students with limited English proficiency and inconsistent foundational numeracy.
