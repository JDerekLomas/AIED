- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The concept of 'protective foods' is a core component of the "Components of Food" chapter in the NCERT Grade 6 curriculum, frequently emphasized in classroom teaching.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; requires simple conceptual retrieval.)
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse "vitamins" with "proteins" (body-building foods) or fail to distinguish between the deficiency of a vitamin vs. a mineral, often providing two vitamin deficiencies instead.)
- **Format demand:** High (Open-ended recall. For this specific demographic, the linguistic barrier is the primary hurdle; students may understand the concept but struggle to construct a coherent sentence in English. The rubric's "all or nothing" 1-mark maximum for a two-part question without partial credit is a high demand.)
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A)

**Holistic Analysis:** While the topic is well-drilled, the requirement to explain a concept in English and provide two distinct examples for only 1 mark makes the item psychometrically "hard" for this demographic. Many students will provide the examples but fail the verbal explanation or mix up the categories.
