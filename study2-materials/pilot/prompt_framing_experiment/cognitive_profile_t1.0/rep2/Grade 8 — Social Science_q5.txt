- **Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. While "biodiversity" is in the NCERT curriculum, the abstract link to "sustainable development" is often treated as a theoretical definition rather than a functional concept. Students from EWS backgrounds may lack exposure to extracurricular nature-based discourse that reinforces these terms.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. No mathematical calculation is required.
- **Common error traps:** Major. Students often conflate "biodiversity" simply with "planting trees" or "forests" generally, failing to articulate the "ecosystem services" aspect required by the rubric. There is also a high risk of "linguistic interference" where Hindi-medium students understand the concept but struggle to retrieve the specific English academic vocabulary (e.g., "pollination," "climate regulation") required for a full mark.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This is high demand. Since the rubric requires a specific explanation of ecosystem services for a binary score (1 or 0), there is no safety net for students who provide a vague or partially correct answer.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. Not applicable to this qualitative item.
