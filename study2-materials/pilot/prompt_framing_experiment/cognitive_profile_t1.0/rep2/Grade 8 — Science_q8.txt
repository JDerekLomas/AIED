- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Agricultural practices are core to the Grade 8 Science NCERT curriculum, and students from rural/EWS backgrounds often have lived experience with farming).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; requires conceptual definition).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse "weeds" with "pests" or "insects," but the distinction is generally well-taught).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires recall and articulation; linguistic barriers for Hindi-medium students attempting to answer in English may lead to grammatical errors, though the core concept remains accessible).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A).

**Analysis:** While the concept is highly intuitive for this demographic, the requirement to define it in English for a 1-mark "correct/incorrect" rubric creates a barrier. Students will likely understand the concept but may lose the mark if the evaluation is strictly based on specific English terminology rather than conceptual understanding.
