- Concept familiarity: less familiar (While "money" is a common object, "economic development" is an abstract macro-concept that is typically introduced in more depth in later grades. Digital money is a contemporary topic, but its formal role in economic frameworks is advanced for Grade 7.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (The item is qualitative/conceptual; no arithmetic steps are required.)
- Common error traps: major (Students from economically weaker sections often conflate "money" with "wealth" or "income" at a personal level, rather than understanding its functional role as a medium of exchange or store of value for an economy. Language barriers may lead to circular definitions.)
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; no partial credit possible as the maximum score is 1. The demand to "Analyze" and "Evaluate" requires high-order thinking and sophisticated English syntax, which is a significant barrier for Hindi-medium learners.
- Number friendliness: easy (N/A)
