### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
Linear equations in one variable are introduced in Grade 6 and reinforced in Grade 7. While students from economically weaker sections may have gaps in foundational math, the structure of a two-step equation ($ax + b = c$) is a core curriculum component.

**Computational Complexity: 2-3 Steps**
The item requires two distinct inverse operations:
1. Subtraction (Transposition of +2 to -2).
2. Division (Dividing 8 by 4).

**Common Error Traps: Minor**
The most common procedural "bugs" for this cohort include:
- Sign errors during transposition (adding 2 to 10 instead of subtracting).
- Inverse operation confusion (subtracting 4 instead of dividing).
- Combining unlike terms (attempting to add $4x + 2$ to get $6x$).

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
As a "Solve" prompt without multiple-choice options, it requires recall of the algorithm rather than recognition. The rubric is binary (max score 1), meaning no partial credit for the first step, which increases difficulty for students with weak arithmetic fluency.

**Number Friendliness: Easy**
The numbers (2, 4, 10) are small, positive integers. The result is a whole number ($x = 2$). This minimizes the cognitive load associated with fractions or negative integers, which often act as barriers for students with limited English/math proficiency.

**Linguistic/Contextual Factors**
The phrasing "Solve the following equation for $x$" is standard. However, for Hindi-medium students, the transition to English-only math terminology in Grade 7 can sometimes cause a delay in processing the instruction, though the symbolic notation is universal.
