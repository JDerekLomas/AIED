**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar**. The topic of heat and clothing is a staple of the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum (Chapter: Heat). It also aligns with daily lived experience in the Indian climate, making the concept intuitive.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **None (0)**. This is a purely qualitative, conceptual question.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor**. The primary trap for this specific demographic is "linguistic interference"—students may understand the science (reflection vs. absorption) but struggle to articulate the specific scientific terminology ("reflects," "radiant heat") in English.
*   **Format Demand:** **Moderate/High**. This is an open-ended "Explain" question requiring active recall and sentence construction. While the rubric is generous regarding phrasing, the requirement to provide *two* distinct reasons (one for color, one for fabric property) for a single mark increases the cognitive load for a student with limited English proficiency.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A**. No numerical data is involved.

**Holistic Analysis**
While the science is basic and culturally relevant, the linguistic barrier for Hindi-medium students in an English-medium assessment context typically suppresses scores on "Explain" items compared to "Identify" or "Multiple Choice" items. However, the rubric's acceptance of non-technical language (e.g., "bounce off") significantly aids this specific demographic.
