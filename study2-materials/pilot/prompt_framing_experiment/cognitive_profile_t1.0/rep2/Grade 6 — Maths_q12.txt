**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Less familiar.** While division is taught earlier, the phrasing "minimum number of pencils required" is a non-routine application of the Remainder Theorem. Students often struggle to distinguish between finding the quotient (current state) and the increment needed to reach the next multiple (120 - 112 = 8).
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** Students must perform division (112 ÷ 10), identify the remainder (2), and potentially calculate the difference to the next multiple (10 - 2 = 8) depending on how they interpret "required."
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** The primary trap is the "Remainder vs. Complement" confusion. Many students will provide '2' (the remainder/leftover) instead of '8' (the number required to make another full box). Additionally, the phrase "minimum number... required" is linguistically dense for ESL learners.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** Requires both calculation and interpretation. While the rubric suggests 0.5 marks for finding the quotient/remainder, the "fully correct" answer requires addressing both parts of the prompt.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** Dividing by 10 is the simplest form of multi-digit division. The numbers themselves do not present a barrier; the barrier is purely conceptual and linguistic.

**Analysis for target demographic:**
The Hindi-to-English transition is the biggest hurdle here. In Hindi, the distinction between *shesh* (remainder) and *kitne aur chahiye* (how many more needed) is clear, but in English, "minimum number required" is often misread as "the remainder" by students with limited proficiency. Given the low point value (0.5) and the dual-task nature of the question, many students will provide a partial answer or stop at the remainder.
