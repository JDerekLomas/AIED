**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. The Himalayas are introduced as early as Grade 3 in EVS (Environmental Studies). By Grade 6, the physical features of India are a core part of the NCERT curriculum.
*   **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; single-step retrieval).
*   **Common error traps:** Minor. The primary trap for this demographic is linguistic rather than conceptual (e.g., confusing the name of a peak like "Everest" or "K2" with a mountain range). Some students may struggle with English spelling, but the rubric focuses on identification.
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended recall. While recall is harder than recognition (multiple choice), the high cultural salience of the "Himalayas" and "Aravallis" in the Indian context lowers the retrieval threshold. Partial credit is available (0.5 max score implies 0.25 per range), which increases the likelihood of a non-zero score.
*   **Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative).

**Analysis for Target Demographic:**
Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds and economically weaker sections in India have high exposure to these geographical terms through oral tradition, local maps, and national symbols, even if their English literacy is developing. "Himalaya" is a cognate across Hindi and English, making it the most likely first answer. The second range (often Aravalli or Vindhya) is standard rote learning in Indian primary schools.
