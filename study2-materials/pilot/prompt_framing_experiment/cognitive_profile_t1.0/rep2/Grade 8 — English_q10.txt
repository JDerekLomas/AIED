**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The 'too...to' transformation is a staple of the Grade 8 grammar curriculum in State Boards, often drilled specifically for exams).

**Computational complexity:** N/A (This is a linguistic transformation task).

**Common error traps:** Major (Students often struggle with the structural "pruning" required. Common errors include retaining the negative "cannot" (e.g., "He is too weak to cannot walk") or keeping the intensifier "very" (e.g., "He is too very weak to walk"). For Hindi-medium students, the transition from two simple sentences to one complex structure with an infinitive can be cognitively taxing).

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires full recall of the syntax; no partial credit is available as per the rubric).

**Number friendliness:** N/A (The vocabulary is simple/high-frequency, which lowers the barrier to entry).

**Holistic Estimate:** While the vocabulary is accessible, the structural transformation requires a specific grammatical shift that contradicts direct translation from Hindi (where the negative particle would be retained). In economically weaker sections with limited English exposure, the success rate depends heavily on rote drill performance rather than fluid proficiency.
