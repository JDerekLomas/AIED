- Concept familiarity: familiar (Ruminants are a core topic in Grade 7 Science, NCERT Chapter 2; students from rural backgrounds have high contextual familiarity with cows/buffaloes).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative reasoning only).
- Common error traps: minor (Students may confuse "chewing the cud" with the structural difference of the stomach or struggle to name the "rumen" specifically).
- Format demand: Open-ended (Requires recall and sentence construction; since the rubric is binary [Max 1], no partial credit is awarded, increasing difficulty).
- Number friendliness: easy (No numerical calculation involved).

Holistic Analysis: While the concept is culturally and academically familiar, the linguistic barrier for students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds poses a challenge in articulating "cellulose digestion" or "four-chambered stomach" in English. However, the rubric is relatively lenient ("special/multiple stomachs"), which aids the success rate.
