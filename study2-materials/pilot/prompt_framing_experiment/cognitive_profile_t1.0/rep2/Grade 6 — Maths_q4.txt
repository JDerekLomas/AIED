**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity: Familiar.** LCM is a core topic in the Grade 6 NCERT/State Board syllabus. However, for students from economically weaker sections (EWS), gaps in foundational multiplication tables (12-20) often hinder mastery.
*   **Computational complexity: 4+.** Finding the LCM of three numbers requires multiple steps: identifying common factors, repeated division, and a final multi-step multiplication (e.g., 2 × 2 × 3 × 5).
*   **Common error traps: Major.** Students often confuse LCM with HCF (Highest Common Factor), stop the division process prematurely, or make errors in the final multiplication string.
*   **Format demand: Open-ended.** Requires recall of the division algorithm or prime factorization. Since the rubric specifies a "correct method" but the score is binary (1 or 0), there is no safety net for minor arithmetic slips.
*   **Number friendliness: Moderate.** While 12, 15, and 20 are "landmark" numbers, they require the student to navigate different divisibility rules (2, 3, and 5) simultaneously, which increases cognitive load for English Language Learners (ELL) who may struggle with word-based instruction of these rules.

**Estimated Success Rate:**
The shift from two numbers to three numbers significantly increases the failure rate in this demographic due to procedural "noise" and weak multiplication fluency.
