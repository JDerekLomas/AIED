- **Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. (While wars are common in history textbooks, "economic life" and "impact" are abstract concepts that require moving beyond simple rote memorization of dates and rulers.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1. (No arithmetic involved, but involves a single-step causal reasoning process.)
- **Common error traps:** Major. (Students often confuse "political" impacts—losing land/kings dying—with "economic" impacts. They may also struggle with the vocabulary of the question if it is not translated or simplified.)
- **Format demand:** High. (Open-ended recall. The lack of partial credit (binary 0/1) for a subjective assessment question increases difficulty.)
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. (N/A)

**Analysis:** For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, the word "Assess" and the abstract nature of "economic life" act as significant linguistic barriers. While they may understand that wars are "bad," articulating a specific economic consequence (e.g., loss of trade, high taxes, or destruction of crops) in English is a high-order task for this demographic at Grade 7.
