### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The Ashoka Pillar and the National Emblem are introduced in Grade 3-5 EVS (Environmental Studies) and revisited in Grade 6 History (The Mauryan Empire). However, while the *image* is very familiar, the historical nomenclature ("Lion Capital of Ashoka") is less frequently rehearsed in casual conversation.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** This is a purely qualitative, single-step recall task.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students from these backgrounds often confuse "National Emblem" with "National Symbol" or "National Animal." A common misconception among this demographic is that the lions are there simply because the lion is a "brave animal" or the "king of the forest," rather than a specific historical and political reference.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended/Recall.** Since the question is "Why" and requires "Explanation," it demands productive English vocabulary. Students who know the answer in Hindi (*Ashoka Stambh*) may struggle to translate "National Emblem" or "Lion Capital" accurately into English, leading to incomplete or technically incorrect responses under a strict rubric.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.**

### Holistic Estimate
While most students recognize the image, the requirement to link it specifically to the **Lion Capital of Ashoka** and use the term **National Emblem** in English represents a significant hurdle for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency. Many will provide descriptive answers (e.g., "because the lion is strong") rather than the technical historical identification required by the rubric.
