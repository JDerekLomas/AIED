- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Road safety is a recurring theme in EVS/Social Science and a visible part of urban/semi-urban life).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No mathematical operations required).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students might struggle to distinguish between the "importance" of rules and the "consequences" of breaking them, or provide two reasons that are essentially the same, e.g., "to avoid accidents" and "to stay safe").
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (High demand for EWS/Hindi-medium students. While the concept is simple, articulating two distinct reasons and a community-level impact in English is a significant linguistic hurdle).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question).

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the topic is culturally and academically familiar, the linguistic demand of the question—requiring three distinct components (two reasons + a community impact statement) in an open-ended format—poses a challenge for students with limited English proficiency. However, since the rubric is generous ("any two valid and logical reasons") and the subject matter is intuitive, a majority of students will be able to provide basic responses, though some may lose marks on the second part of the prompt.
