- Concept familiarity: very familiar (The topic of "My Best Friend" is a staple in Indian primary school curricula and common in ESL/EFL contexts.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (The task requires the single cognitive step of translating personal thought into a specific language structure.)
- Common error traps: minor (Primary traps include Mother Tongue Influence (MTI) leading to incorrect syntax, subject-verb agreement errors, and spelling "friend" as "freind.")
- Format demand: Open-ended; requires recall and synthesis of grammar and vocabulary; the rubric is binary (all-or-nothing), making it more difficult than a partial-credit item.
- Number friendliness: N/A
