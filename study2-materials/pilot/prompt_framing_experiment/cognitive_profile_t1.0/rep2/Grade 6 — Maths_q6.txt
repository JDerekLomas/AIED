**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Area of squares and rectangles is a core component of the Grade 6 NCERT syllabus (Chapter 10: Mensuration). However, while the formulas are practiced, the comparative application is often less ingrained than simple calculation.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** The student must perform three distinct operations: (1) $5 \times 4$, (2) $5 \times 5$, and (3) the subtraction $25 - 20$ to find "by how much."
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** For students in this demographic, two traps are prominent:
    1.  **Formula Confusion:** Mixing up Area ($l \times b$) with Perimeter ($2(l+b)$). 
    2.  **Square Area Error:** Calculating $5 \times 2$ or $5+5$ instead of $5 \times 5$.
    3.  **Linguistic Barrier:** In a second-language (English) context, the phrase "by how much" is a common "bottleneck phrase" that students may ignore, leading them to only name the shape without the numerical difference.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** Since it is a 1-mark item with no partial credit allowed per the rubric, any error in the three-step process (even a simple subtraction error at the end) results in a zero. This "all-or-nothing" demand significantly lowers the success rate.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The numbers (4 and 5) are within the basic multiplication tables and are very easy to manipulate mentally.

**Holistic Estimate**
While the math is simple, the transition from Hindi-medium to English terminology, combined with the three-step requirement and the "all-or-nothing" rubric, creates a high probability of procedural or linguistic slips.
