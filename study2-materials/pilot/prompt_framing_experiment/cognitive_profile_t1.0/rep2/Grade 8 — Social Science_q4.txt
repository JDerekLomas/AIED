- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The Panchayati Raj system is a core pillar of the Grade 6-8 Civics curriculum in India. Students from rural backgrounds have high contextual exposure, though students from urban EWS backgrounds may find it slightly more abstract.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a purely conceptual/theoretical question requiring no mathematical steps.
- **Common error traps:** Minor. The primary trap is "definitional blurring"—students may confuse the specific administrative role of the Panchayat with general government duties or social welfare tasks without using the technical term "local self-governance."
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This increases difficulty for students with limited English proficiency. While they may understand the concept in Hindi (Swa-shasan), articulating "local self-governance" or "grassroots administration" in English is a significant hurdle. No partial credit is mentioned, making it a high-stakes recall task.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. Not applicable to this item.
