### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The Angle Sum Property of a triangle (sum = 180°) is a core component of the Grade 6 geometry syllabus in India (NCERT/State Boards). However, for students in this demographic, transitioning from concrete shapes to abstract algebraic notation (finding `x`) can be a hurdle.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** 
    1.  Add the two given angles (e.g., $60^\circ + 40^\circ = 100^\circ$).
    2.  Subtract the sum from 180° ($180^\circ - 100^\circ = 80^\circ$).
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students often struggle with:
    1.  **Additive errors:** Miscalculating the sum of the two known angles.
    2.  **Concept confusion:** Confusing the property with supplementary angles (180°) vs. complementary angles (90°) or even the sum of angles in a quadrilateral (360°).
    3.  **Language barrier:** If the question is phrased in English without a clear diagram, ESL students may struggle to identify which angle is being asked for.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** This requires retrieval of the formula rather than recognition (as in MCQ). Since the rubric specifically looks for the value "80 degrees" for 0.5 marks, there is no room for error in the final calculation.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** Most textbook problems for Grade 6 use multiples of 10 or 5 (e.g., 60°, 40°), making the mental arithmetic straightforward.

### Holistic Estimation
While the math is simple, the combination of an open-ended format, the need for multi-step logical deduction, and the linguistic/contextual challenges faced by students in economically weaker sections (who may have higher rates of learning gaps) suggests that a significant portion of the cohort will miss one of the steps or misapply the property.
