Concept familiarity: familiar (This is a core topic in the Grade 8 NCERT History curriculum, specifically the chapter on "Tribals, Dikus and the Golden Age.")

Computational complexity: 1 (No arithmetic steps required, though it requires a 2-part synthesis.)

Common error traps: minor (Students often confuse general colonial impacts with specific tribal impacts, or struggle to differentiate between 'forest laws' and 'taxation' as distinct examples.)

Format demand: Open-ended/Recall (High demand; students must construct sentences in English. Since the rubric asks for two distinct examples for a single mark, there is no room for partial credit in the final scoring, making it a "high stakes" single point.)

Number friendliness: easy (No numerical data processing required.)
