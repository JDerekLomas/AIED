**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar.** The unitary method is a core component of the Grade 6 and 7 NCERT curriculum. The context of petrol and mileage is a high-utility, real-world scenario frequently discussed in Indian households, even among economically weaker sections.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** Students must first perform division ($55 \div 5$) to find the unit rate (mileage), and then multiplication ($11 \times 12$) to find the total distance.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** The primary risk is a "procedural bug" where a student might multiply $55 \times 12$ directly or invert the division ($5 \div 55$). However, the phrasing "Find how much mileage..." acts as a scaffold that guides them toward the correct first step.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** As an open-ended question with a binary rubric (1 or 0), there is no safety net for calculation errors. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle slightly with the word "mileage," though "petrol" and "distance" are common loanwords.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The numbers are highly "friendly." $55/5$ is a fundamental multiplication table fact ($11 \times 5$), and $11 \times 12$ is a standard mental math calculation taught in Indian schools.

**Estimated Success Rate:**
The linguistic barrier is minimized by the simplicity of the numbers and the familiarity of the "mileage" concept in a South Asian context. However, the requirement for an exact answer in an open-ended format without partial credit will lead to some loss due to careless arithmetic.
