**Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The "Acids, Bases and Salts" chapter is a core component of the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum. Indicators (natural and synthetic) are frequently demonstrated in classrooms.

**Computational complexity:** 1. This is a purely qualitative observational task requiring no arithmetic steps.

**Common error traps:** Major. Students often confuse the specific color changes for different natural indicators (e.g., mixing up how turmeric reacts vs. how hibiscus reacts). Turmeric stays yellow in acid, which students often perceive as "no reaction" rather than a definitive test result.

**Format demand:** Open-ended. This requires active recall and linguistic construction. Since the students are from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, articulating the procedural steps and the resulting color changes in English poses a significant barrier, even if the underlying science is understood. Partial credit is not available per the rubric.

**Number friendliness:** Easy. Not applicable as there are no numerical values.

**Holistic Analysis:** While the science concept is foundational, the requirement to describe a multi-step procedure in English for a 1-mark "all-or-nothing" question is high. Students will likely struggle with the "hibiscus" distractor (which has more complex color changes: green for base, dark pink/magenta for acid) and may fail to provide a complete "if/then" logical structure required for a full mark.
