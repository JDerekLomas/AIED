- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (This is a foundational concept introduced in primary classes and revisited in Grade 6.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No mathematical operations required.)
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse "movement" with "locomotion" or incorrectly identify natural non-living things like sun/clouds as living because they "move" or "grow" in size.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. Requires active recall and the ability to construct sentences in English. Since the target group has limited English proficiency, translating the known Hindi concepts (*sajeeb/nirjeeb*) into written English is the primary barrier. Partial credit is mentioned in the rubric (0.5 max), but the prompt asks for a "fully correct answer."
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question.)

**Holistic Estimate:**
While the concept is well-understood, the requirement to provide two characteristics for *each* category (four points total) in English poses a significant linguistic challenge for Grade 6 students from Hindi-medium, economically weaker backgrounds. Many will provide one point or use single words rather than full descriptions.
