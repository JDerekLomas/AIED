**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** Very familiar. Comparing and ordering numbers up to four digits is a core component of the Grade 5 curriculum and is revisited early in Grade 6 (Number Systems).
*   **Computational Complexity:** 1 step. The task requires a single cognitive pass of magnitude comparison rather than multi-step arithmetic operations.
*   **Common Error Traps:** Minor. The primary trap is the "length-is-magnitude" heuristic, where a student might overlook that 736 has fewer digits than the others. However, by Grade 6, most students distinguish between 3-digit and 4-digit values.
*   **Format Demand:** Open-ended (Recall/Organization). While it requires exactness, the rubric specifically rewards the identification of the smallest number, lowering the barrier for partial success, though the maximum score is binary (0.5).
*   **Number Friendliness:** Moderate. The numbers are distinct enough (3xxx, 4xxx, 5xxx, 7xx) that students do not need to compare digits beyond the thousands place, except to recognize the 3-digit outlier.

**Contextual Consideration:** For students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds, the term "ascending order" is the primary linguistic barrier. If the term is taught as *"badhte kram"* (increasing order), the mathematical logic is highly accessible. Given that this is a fundamental skill, the success rate is generally high.
