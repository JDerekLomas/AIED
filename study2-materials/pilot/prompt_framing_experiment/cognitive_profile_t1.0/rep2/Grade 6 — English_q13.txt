**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar.** Antonyms are a core component of the Grade 6 English curriculum in Indian government schools. "Slow/Fast" is one of the most basic pairings introduced in primary years.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **N/A.** This is a linguistic recall task.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** The primary trap is a spelling error (e.g., "fst" or "fastly") or providing a synonym instead of an antonym due to a misunderstanding of the word "opposite." Given the Hindi-medium background, students might know the concept (*tez*) but struggle with the specific English orthography.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** This requires pure recall rather than recognition (as in multiple choice). While the rubric specifies "fast," the lack of a word bank increases the difficulty slightly for students with limited English exposure. No partial credit is available.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.**

**Holistic Estimate**
While "slow" and "fast" are high-frequency sight words, the transition from Hindi-medium primary schooling to English subjects in Grade 6 often reveals a gap in active vocabulary recall and spelling accuracy among students from economically weaker sections. However, this specific pair is foundational enough to yield high success rates.
