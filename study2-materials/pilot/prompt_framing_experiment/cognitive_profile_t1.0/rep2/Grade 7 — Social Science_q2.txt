- Concept familiarity: **Familiar** (This is a core topic in NCERT Grade 7 Geography, Chapter 1. However, distinguishing between 'human environment' and 'human-made environment' is a common source of confusion.)
- Computational complexity: **1** (N/A; purely qualitative recall and application.)
- Common error traps: **Major** (Students frequently confuse 'human environment'—social interactions/structures—with 'human-made environment'—buildings/roads. Hindi-medium students often struggle with the English terminology for these nuanced distinctions.)
- Format demand: **Open-ended/High** (Requires active recall and sentence construction in English. With a max score of only 0.5, there is zero margin for error; any linguistic or conceptual slip usually results in a 0.)
- Number friendliness: **Easy** (N/A)

**Holistic Estimate:** The combination of a low-stakes point value (0.5) and the linguistic barrier for EWS/Hindi-background students makes this a high-hurdle item. While they may understand the concept in their native language, articulating a two-part definition and example in English at the Grade 7 level is a significant challenge.
