- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The distinction between clinical and laboratory thermometers is a core part of the NCERT Grade 7 Science curriculum, though application-based reasoning is harder than rote recall).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No calculations involved).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse the two types or fail to articulate the 'why'—the presence of the 'kink' or the range difference—even if they identify the name).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended requires recall; since the maximum score is 0.5, partial credit is unlikely, requiring a precise identification of the thermometer and a qualitative explanation.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Not applicable).

**Estimated Holistic Success Rate:**
The language barrier is the primary constraint. While the concept is taught, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle to explain the "why" (reasoning) in English, even if they can identify the "what" (clinical thermometer). The 0.5 mark cap suggests a binary grading approach where any linguistic failure in the explanation might lead to a zero.
