**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The distributive property is a core part of the Grade 8 Rational Numbers chapter in the NCERT curriculum. However, students often treat it as a "rule to memorize" rather than a tool for simplification.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **4+.** The process involves: 1) Identifying the common factor ($9/16$), 2) Factoring it out, 3) Finding a common denominator for the remaining fractions ($12$ and $9$), 4) Performing signed addition ($1/3 - 1/3$ or $12/36 - 12/36$), and 5) Final multiplication.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** The inclusion of a negative sign $(-3/9)$ is a significant hurdle for students from these backgrounds. Additionally, students often ignore the instruction to use the "distributive property" and instead attempt to calculate the two products separately, which increases the likelihood of arithmetic errors.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** As an open-ended item with a binary rubric (Max score 1), there is no safety net for a student who makes a minor calculation error despite understanding the property.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Moderate.** While the result ($0$) is "clean," the intermediate steps involving $4/12$ and $3/9$ require simplification or finding a common denominator of $36$. For a student struggling with English/Math vocabulary, the nested brackets and signs add cognitive load.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the socioeconomic and linguistic context, many students will struggle with the fractional arithmetic and the negative sign, even if they recognize the property.
