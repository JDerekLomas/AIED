### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
Profit, Loss, and Discount is a core chapter in the Grade 8 NCERT syllabus. While students are introduced to these concepts in Grade 7, the integration of Marked Price (MP) and Cost Price (CP) in a single problem is the standard "application" level for Grade 8.

**Computational Complexity: 2–3 Steps**
The student must navigate a multi-stage process:
1.  Calculate Selling Price (SP) from MP and Discount: $1200 - (10\% \text{ of } 1200) = 1080$.
2.  Relate SP to CP using the Profit percentage: $CP \times (1.08) = 1080$.
3.  Solve for CP: $1080 / 1.08 = 1000$.

**Common Error Traps: Major**
For students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency, "Marked Price" vs. "Cost Price" often causes semantic confusion. A common "procedural bug" is applying the 8% profit to the ₹1200 instead of the (yet unknown) CP, or simply subtracting 8% from the SP ($1080 - 8\%$), which is mathematically incorrect.

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
As a 1-mark item with no partial credit and an open-ended requirement, the student must reach the exact final integer. There are no options to provide a "hint" or allow for reverse-engineering.

**Number Friendliness: Easy**
The numbers are highly "friendly" (multiples of 10 and 12). The final result (₹1000) is a clean, round number, which helps students who might otherwise struggle with complex decimals.

**Holistic Estimate**
While the math is standard, the multi-step nature and the potential to confuse the base of the percentage (MP vs. CP) significantly lower the success rate in a government school context where English phrasing often acts as a barrier to identifying the correct formula.
