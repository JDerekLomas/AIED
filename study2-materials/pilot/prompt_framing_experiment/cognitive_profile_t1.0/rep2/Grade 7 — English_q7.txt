**Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. While Grade 7 students are taught "Parts of Speech," the word "around" is most frequently introduced and drilled as a **preposition** in Indian state curricula (e.g., "around the tree"). Using it as an **adverb** requires distinguishing between a prepositional phrase and an adverbial modifier, a nuance often missed by students with limited English proficiency.

**Computational complexity:** 1 (Single-step identification).

**Common error traps:** Major. The primary trap is the "Preposition Bias." In Hindi-medium contexts, "around" is often translated as a postposition (ke chaaron aur), leading students to reflexively categorize it as a preposition regardless of its syntactic function in the specific sentence.

**Format demand:** Open-ended recall (if no options provided) or exact identification. No partial credit.

**Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given the socioeconomic context and Hindi-medium background, most students will rely on rote memorization of word categories rather than functional syntactic analysis. Since "around" is classically taught as a preposition in foundational years, the majority will misidentify it here.
