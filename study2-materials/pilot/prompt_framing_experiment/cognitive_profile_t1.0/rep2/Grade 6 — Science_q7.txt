**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Familiar.** The "Balanced Diet" and food groups are core components of the Grade 6 Science curriculum (NCERT). However, for students from economically weaker sections, "milk" is often a luxury or limited resource, which may affect their practical association of it as a daily necessity compared to more available staples.
*   **Computational Complexity: 1.** There are no mathematical calculations required; this is a qualitative identification task.
*   **Common Error Traps: Minor.** A common trap here is the "language-interference" bug. Students might identify what is missing but struggle to name it in English, or they might get distracted by the second sentence ("Prepare diet chart"), which is technically not scored according to the provided rubric but adds significant cognitive load and time pressure.
*   **Format Demand: Open-ended (Recall).** This is a high-demand format for English Language Learners (ELL). Unlike a multiple-choice question where "Milk" is an option to recognize, students must retrieve the vocabulary word from memory. The inclusion of an unscored second task ("Prepare diet chart") creates "functional noise," where a student might spend time drawing a chart but fail to explicitly state the missing component.
*   **Number Friendliness: N/A.** No numbers involved.

**Holistic Analysis**
The discrepancy between the question (two tasks) and the rubric (one specific point) is the primary difficulty driver. Students with limited English proficiency often struggle with multi-part prompts. While the science concept is simple, the requirement to extract the specific answer from a paragraph and write it in English will lead to a significant number of incomplete or misaligned responses.
