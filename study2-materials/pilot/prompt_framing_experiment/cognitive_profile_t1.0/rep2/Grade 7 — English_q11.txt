Concept familiarity: Less familiar (While "adjective" is familiar, the distinction between a single-word adjective and an "adjective phrase" is often a source of confusion in middle school English grammar for ESL learners).

Computational complexity: 1 (Single identification step).

Common error traps: Major (The rubric defines the correct answer as "tiny," which is technically a single adjective, not an adjective phrase. Furthermore, students often confuse adjective phrases with prepositional phrases like "in our balcony").

Format demand: Open-ended/Exact (Requires specific identification; the misalignment between the question asking for a "phrase" and the rubric accepting a single word increases the likelihood of student confusion or teacher mis-grading).

Number friendliness: Easy (Not applicable).
