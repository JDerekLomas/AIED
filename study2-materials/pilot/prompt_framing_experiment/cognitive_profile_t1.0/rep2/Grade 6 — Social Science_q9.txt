- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Rajasthan's monuments like Hawa Mahal or Amer Fort are staple topics in Indian Social Science curricula, though recall varies).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical; requires a single retrieval and mapping task).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse the city—e.g., placing the Hawa Mahal in Udaipur—or struggle to articulate the "why" in English).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended/High. Despite being a 1-mark question, it requires four distinct pieces of information: Monument A, Monument B, City of A/B, and Significance of A/B. The rubric is "all or nothing" (Maximum score 1), making it high-stakes for students with low English literacy.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A).

**Holistic Estimate:** While the facts are culturally relevant, the linguistic barrier for Hindi-medium students to explain "why it is famous" in English, combined with a strict 1-mark rubric that allows no partial credit for just naming the monuments, will significantly lower the success rate.
