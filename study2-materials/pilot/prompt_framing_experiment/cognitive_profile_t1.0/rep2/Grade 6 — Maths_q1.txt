**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Familiar.** Divisibility and factors are core components of the Grade 6 NCERT curriculum (Chapter 3: Playing with Numbers). However, students often confuse "factors" with "multiples."
*   **Computational Complexity: 4+ steps.** To find all factors of 68, a student must test divisibility for at least numbers 1 through 8. This involves multiple division or multiplication checks ($1 \times 68, 2 \times 34, 4 \times 17$).
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.** 
    *   **The "17" Hurdle:** 68 is a challenging number because 17 is a prime number not commonly found in basic multiplication tables (1-10) which students from these backgrounds prioritize. 
    *   **Incomplete Sets:** Students often find (1, 2, 68, 34) but miss the pair (4, 17). 
    *   **Terminology Confusion:** Hindi-medium students may struggle if the term "factors" is not paired with the Hindi equivalent "गुणनखंड" (Gunankhand).
*   **Format Demand:** High. As an open-ended question with no partial credit (binary scoring 0/1), the student must recall the entire set perfectly. Missing a single factor results in zero marks.
*   **Number Friendliness: Hard.** While 68 is even, it is not a "landmark" number (like 50, 60, or 100). Its prime factorization involves 17, which is outside the comfort zone of many Grade 6 learners.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the binary rubric (all or nothing) and the difficulty of identifying 17 as a factor, a significant portion of students will likely provide an incomplete list.
