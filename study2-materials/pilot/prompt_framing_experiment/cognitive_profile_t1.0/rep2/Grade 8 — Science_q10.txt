Concept familiarity: familiar (Pasteurization is a standard topic in the "Microorganisms" chapter of the Grade 8 NCERT/State Board syllabus, often related to daily life).
Computational complexity: 1 (The task is purely descriptive; no calculations are required).
Common error traps: minor (Students often confuse "boiling" with "pasteurization" or fail to mention the critical "quick cooling" step, which is essential for the definition).
Format demand: Open-ended (This is a high-demand format for this demographic. Recalling and articulating a two-step process in English is challenging for students with limited proficiency, especially since the rubric requires both the "how" and the "why" for a single point).
Number friendliness: easy (While specific numbers aren't mandatory, the 70°C/30s figures are generally the only ones associated with this topic).
