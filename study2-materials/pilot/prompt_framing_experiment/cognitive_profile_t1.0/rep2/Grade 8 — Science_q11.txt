- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Thermal expansion and railway gaps are standard NCERT Grade 7/8 curriculum, though electrical conductivity is a different chapter).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Simple comparison/data interpretation from a table).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students might confuse the "most expansion" with the "highest melting point" or fail to connect the table in (a) to the general knowledge required in (b) and (c)).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. While the rubric only specifies part (a) for the mark, the presence of three sub-questions increases the cognitive load and potential for language-based fatigue for Hindi-medium students.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Assuming standard expansion coefficients or qualitative descriptors).

**Analysis:** The question is multi-part, yet the rubric only awards a point for part (a). For an ESL/Hindi-medium student from an EWS background, the table reading in (a) is highly accessible. However, the linguistic demand of processing three different prompts (expansion, railway engineering, and electrical conductivity) to get a single point may lead to omissions or confusion.
