**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar.** The topic of natural fibers and their suitability for different seasons is a core component of the Grade 6 Science curriculum (Chapter: Fiber to Fabric). Additionally, this is a high-relevance life skill; students from economically weaker sections often have direct experience with cotton as a functional necessity for the Indian climate.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **None (0).** This is a qualitative, conceptual question requiring no arithmetic or algebraic calculation.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** The primary trap is not a misconception, but a linguistic one: students may understand that cotton "soaks" sweat but struggle to recall or spell the scientific term "absorbent." However, the logic is intuitive.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** Open-ended questions require active recall rather than recognition. For students with limited English proficiency, the requirement to "Explain" and "Describe" in a second language poses a significant barrier even if the scientific concept is understood. They may provide one-word answers (e.g., "Sweat") which might not meet the rubric's demand for a "property."
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.**

**Holistic Estimate:**
While the concept is highly familiar and culturally relevant, the "Explain" command in English will suppress the success rate for Hindi-medium students. Many will understand *why* cotton is worn but may struggle to articulate the specific *property* (absorption/porosity) in a structured sentence.
