**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (This is typically the introductory chapter of the Grade 7 NCERT history curriculum, "How, When and Where").
**Computational complexity:** 1 (No calculation required).
**Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse "dates" as literal numbers/calendar days rather than the concept of "chronology" or "periodization").
**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall and sentence construction. Since students are often Hindi-medium, articulating this abstract concept in English poses a significant barrier even if they understand the history).
**Number friendliness:** Easy (No numerical data manipulation involved).

**Holistic Estimate:**
While the concept is foundational and frequently drilled, the linguistic demand of "explaining" in a second language (English) for students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds significantly lowers the success rate for a fully correct English response.
