**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The basic needs of plants—water, light, and nutrients—are core Grade 6 Science topics, though connecting specific symptoms to deficiency is an application-level task.)

**Computational complexity:** 1 (No mathematical calculation required.)

**Common error traps:** Major (Students often confuse "symptoms" with "needs." Many may describe *what* is happening—the leaves are yellow—rather than *inferring* the cause. Additionally, students might attribute yellowing to "disease" or "old age" rather than resource deficiency.)

**Format demand:** Open-ended; high demand. Since the students are from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, articulating an inference ("infer... about plant needs") and "explaining" it in English poses a significant linguistic barrier, even if they understand the biological concept. 

**Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question.)

**Holistic Estimate:** While the rubric is generous (accepting sunlight, water, or nutrients), the transition from observation to inference, combined with the English language production requirement for students from economically weaker sections, will significantly suppress the success rate.
