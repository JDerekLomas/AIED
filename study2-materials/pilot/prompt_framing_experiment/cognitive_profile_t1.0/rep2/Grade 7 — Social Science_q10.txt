- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (The Mauryan Empire and Ashoka are core components of the Grade 6/7 NCERT history curriculum in India).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; single-level retrieval and explanation).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often conflate Ashoka with other kings like Akbar; language barriers may prevent them from articulating "significance" versus simply listing facts like "Kalinga War").
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (High demand; requires active recall and sentence construction. The rubric is binary (0/1), which increases difficulty as partial credit for naming Ashoka without explaining significance is not permitted).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative/Narrative).
