Concept familiarity: familiar (Magnetism is a popular hands-on topic in Grade 6 Science, though formal terminology like "repel" is introduced here.)
Computational complexity: 1 (No calculation required; qualitative observation.)
Common error traps: minor (Confusion between North-North and North-South interactions; misinterpreting "observe" to mean something happens to the physical state of the magnet.)
Format demand: Open-ended (Requires recall of specific terminology; "push away" is acceptable, but linguistic barriers for Hindi-medium students may lead to difficulty articulating the answer in English.)
Number friendliness: easy (Not applicable.)
