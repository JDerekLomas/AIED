- Concept familiarity: familiar (Subjective preference is a common exercise, but articulating "why" in a second language is a significant leap for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-task output, but requires two-part logic.)
- Common error traps: minor (The "trap" here is omitting the "why" or providing a generic reason like "it is good," which may not satisfy the rubric's depth for a full 1.5 score.)
- Format demand: Open-ended (Requires high recall and productive language skills; partial credit is possible under the rubric, but full marks require grammatical synthesis.)
- Number friendliness: easy (Not applicable to this item.)
