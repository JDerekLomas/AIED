**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity: Familiar.** Mensuration (Area and Perimeter) is a core component of the Grade 6 syllabus in India. However, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the English terms "length" and "breadth" versus "lambaee" and "chauraee," though the formulas are well-drilled.
*   **Computational complexity: 2-3 steps.** The student must perform two distinct operations: multiplication for area ($15 \times 8$) and a multi-step addition/multiplication for perimeter ($2 \times [15+8]$). 
*   **Common error traps: Major.** There are three significant hurdles for this specific demographic:
    1.  **Formula Confusion:** Mixing up the formulas for area and perimeter.
    2.  **Unit Errors:** Forgetting to square the units for area (cm vs cm²), which is a common point of failure in state board evaluations.
    3.  **Language Barrier:** Identifying which number corresponds to which dimension in an English-sentence format.
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended recall. Since the rubric specifies a score of 1 for the correct area (and implies the perimeter is also required), there is no room for error. The lack of partial credit in a binary (0/1) rubric significantly lowers the success rate.
*   **Number friendliness: Moderate.** While 15 and 8 are manageable, the product (120) requires solid grasp of tables or carry-over multiplication, which can be a stumbling block for students with interrupted schooling.

**Holistic Estimate**
While the math is foundational, the combination of English-language delivery, the requirement of two different formulas in one question, and the rigid binary rubric (no partial credit) creates a significant barrier for students in economically weaker sections.
