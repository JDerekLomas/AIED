**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The "Iodine test for starch" is a foundational experiment in the Grade 6 NCERT Science curriculum (Chapter: Components of Food). It is one of the most commonly demonstrated experiments in school labs.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** There are no arithmetic or algebraic steps involved.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** Students often confuse the reagents (using copper sulfate/caustic soda instead of iodine) or fail to specify the final color change (Blue-Black). However, the rubric provided is lenient, requiring only the mention of "iodine."
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** This is an open-ended "Describe" question requiring generative language. For Hindi-medium students, the barrier is not the scientific concept, but translating their understanding into a grammatically correct English sentence. Since the rubric is "all or nothing" for 1 mark, students who know the answer but cannot phrase it in English may fail.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** No numerical data is required for this response.

**Holistic Analysis:** 
While the concept is a core part of the syllabus, the requirement to "Describe" in English poses a significant hurdle for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. Many will know "Iodine" is the key but may struggle to form the required descriptive sentence. The lenient rubric (only requiring the mention of iodine) offsets some of the linguistic difficulty.
