Concept familiarity: Familiar (Money and decimals are standard Grade 6/7 topics, but the specific conversion of low-denomination paise is decreasing in daily real-world usage).

Computational complexity: 4+ (Three separate multiplication steps, one summation step, and one final division/comparison step).

Common error traps: Major (The primary trap is the decimal conversion—10 paise as 0.10 vs 0.01; another is the confusion between the "count" of coins and the "value" of coins).

Format demand: Open-ended (Requires exact recall of the conversion rate 100 paise = 1 Rupee; the 0.5 max score suggests an all-or-nothing or very limited partial credit structure).

Number friendliness: Moderate (While 10, 5, and 16 are relatively simple, multiplying 16 by 0.50 requires fractional reasoning or long multiplication).

Psychometric Analysis: For students in Hindi-medium, economically weaker backgrounds, the linguistic barrier is low due to the use of "Rupee" and "paise," but the multi-step nature of the problem significantly increases the cognitive load. Many students may calculate the total value as 10 Rupees but fail to perform the final step of dividing by the 5-Rupee coin value, or they may struggle with the decimal placement for the 20-paise and 50-paise conversions.
