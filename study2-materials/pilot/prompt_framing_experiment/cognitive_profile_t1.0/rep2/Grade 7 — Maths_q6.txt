**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Conversion of mixed fractions to improper fractions and their multiplication is a core competency introduced in Grade 6 and reinforced in Grade 7. However, the multi-step nature of the operation often leads to procedural decay for students with inconsistent practice.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **4+ steps.** 
    1. Convert $1 \frac{1}{2}$ to $\frac{3}{2}$.
    2. Convert $3 \frac{1}{4}$ to $\frac{13}{4}$.
    3. Multiply numerators ($3 \times 13 = 39$).
    4. Multiply denominators ($2 \times 4 = 8$).
    5. Convert the improper fraction $\frac{39}{8}$ back into a mixed fraction ($4 \frac{7}{8}$).
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** In this specific demographic, common "procedural bugs" include:
    *   Adding the whole numbers and multiplying the fractions ($1 \times 3$ and $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4}$).
    *   Forgetting to convert the final answer back into a mixed fraction as requested.
    *   Errors in the multiplication table of 13.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended/Exact.** The rubric requires a 1-point "all or nothing" score. Since no partial credit is awarded for the intermediate steps (conversion to improper fractions), any small arithmetic slip results in zero points.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Moderate.** While 2 and 4 are easy, the product 39 and the subsequent division by 8 to return to a mixed fraction ($39 \div 8$) require a level of division fluency that can be a hurdle for students struggling with basic numeracy.

**Estimation:**
While the topic is standard, the lack of partial credit in the rubric combined with the five-step procedural requirement significantly lowers the success rate for students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds who may face "math-anxiety" or language interference when interpreting multi-step English instructions.
