- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Identifying characters is a core literacy skill; the "magic fairy" trope is a staple of Grade 6 narratives).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step retrieval from text).
- Common error traps: Minor (Students might confuse the fairy with other characters if the passage has multiple entities, or struggle with the spelling of "magical").
- Format demand: Open-ended (Requires recall and basic sentence construction; however, the rubric allows for short phrases, lowering the barrier).
- Number friendliness: N/A (Text-based item).

Additional Context: For Hindi-medium students, the primary hurdle is translating the internal concept ("pari") to the English label ("fairy"). Given the simplicity of the noun and its frequency in beginner English curriculum, the linguistic barrier is moderate.
