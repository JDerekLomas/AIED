**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. Photosynthesis is a core topic introduced in primary classes and revisited extensively in Grade 7. The term "green pigment" is a standard pedagogical anchor for this concept.
*   **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; single-step retrieval).
*   **Common error traps:** Minor. The primary trap is spelling. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, transliterating "Chlorophyll" into English can be challenging (e.g., "Clorofyl," "Chlorofyll"). However, the conceptual link is usually strong.
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This is more difficult than a multiple-choice question because it requires active retrieval and correct spelling. No partial credit is available for a 1-mark item.
*   **Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative item).

**Psychometric Analysis**
While the concept is ubiquitous in the NCERT/State Board curricula, the linguistic barrier for students from economically weaker sections (EWS) and Hindi-medium backgrounds slightly lowers the facility index. While most students will know the answer in Hindi (हरित लवक / क्लोरोफिल), providing the exact English term in an English-medium assessment requires specific vocabulary retention.
