Concept familiarity: familiar (Fractions and the "of" operator as multiplication are core Grade 6 and 7 topics in the NCERT/State curriculum).
Computational complexity: 4+ (Step 1: Convert first phrase to multiplication. Step 2: Multiply first pair. Step 3: Convert second phrase to multiplication. Step 4: Multiply second pair. Step 5: Find a common denominator to compare $3/8$ and $4/15$).
Common error traps: major (Students often fail to realize that comparison requires a common denominator; many might guess based on individual numerators/denominators or incorrectly perform cross-multiplication without understanding the resulting products).
Format demand: High (Open-ended "Show your calculations" requires procedural recall; the 1-point binary rubric makes this "all-or-nothing," penalizing minor calculation slips in finding the LCM).
Number friendliness: moderate (The denominators 8 and 15 are coprime, leading to a relatively large common denominator of 120, which is difficult for students with weak multiplication tables to manage mentally).
