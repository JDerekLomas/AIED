### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

*   **Concept familiarity:** **Very familiar.** Linear equations in one variable are a core part of the Grade 7 and 8 NCERT syllabus. Students are repeatedly exposed to the "transpose" method.
*   **Computational complexity:** **1 step.** The task requires a single inverse operation (subtraction) to isolate the variable.
*   **Common error traps:** **Major.** This is the primary hurdle for this specific demographic. 
    1.  **Negative Integer Fluency:** Students often struggle with $4 - 9$. In many Hindi-medium or under-resourced contexts, students may intuitively subtract the smaller from the larger and ignore the sign, resulting in $5$ instead of $-5$.
    2.  **Directionality of Transposition:** Some may incorrectly change the sign of the constant already on the right side.
*   **Format demand:** **Exact Answer.** While the rubric is binary (0 or 1), the open-ended nature means students cannot guess from options. However, since it is a short-response item, the recall demand is low compared to a word problem.
*   **Number friendliness:** **Easy.** The integers are single digits and well within the range for mental calculation.

### Analysis
While the algebraic procedure is simple, the "negative result" is a significant threshold concept. For students from economically weaker sections with potential learning gaps in foundational arithmetic (integers), the jump from $y + 4 = 9$ (result 5) to $y + 9 = 4$ (result -5) significantly drops the success rate.
