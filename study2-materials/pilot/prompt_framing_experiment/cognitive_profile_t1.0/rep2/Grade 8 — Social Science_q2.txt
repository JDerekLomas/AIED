- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (The Harappan Civilization is a cornerstone of the Grade 6 curriculum and is revisited in Grade 8/9; it is culturally significant and widely taught in Indian textbooks).
- Computational complexity: 1 (None).
- Common error traps: Minor (Students may confuse specific features with other civilizations or provide vague descriptions like "good houses" without technical terminology).
- Format demand: Open-ended (Requires recall of specific terminology; however, the rubric allows for multiple valid features, increasing the chance of success).
- Number friendliness: Easy (Not applicable).

Holistic Analysis: While the topic is highly familiar, the English language requirement poses a significant barrier for this specific demographic. Students may understand the concept (e.g., the drainage system) but struggle to articulate "well-planned grid layout" or "citadel" in English. The binary scoring (0 or 1) without partial credit further penalizes those with limited vocabulary.
