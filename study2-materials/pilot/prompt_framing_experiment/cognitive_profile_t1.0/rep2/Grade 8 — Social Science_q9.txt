- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Civics is a core part of the Grade 8 NCERT/State curriculum, and the concept of "Parliament" is introduced early.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; requires a single conceptual link.)
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse "Parliament" with "Government/Executive" or may focus solely on voting/elections rather than the function of the institution itself.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall and linguistic construction. Since the rubric allows for "law-making" OR "voice/representation," it is slightly more accessible than a "must-hit-all-points" rubric.)
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question.)

**Analysis of student context:**
While the concept is familiar, the language barrier for Hindi-medium students from economically weaker sections often leads to "locked" knowledge—they may understand the concept but struggle to articulate the specific keywords ("representative," "legislation," "sovereign will") required for a full mark in English. However, because the rubric is generous and accepts "citizens' voice" or "making laws," many will achieve the point through basic phrasing.
