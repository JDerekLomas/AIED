- Concept familiarity: **less familiar**. While 'biodiversity' is introduced in Grade 8 Geography/Science, connecting it to the abstract framework of 'sustainable development' is a higher-order conceptual leap for students at this level.
- Computational complexity: **1**. No mathematical calculation is required.
- Common error traps: **major**. Students often conflate biodiversity with simple "planting trees" or "animal protection" without understanding the systemic "ecosystem services" required by the rubric. Linguistic barriers in Hindi-medium backgrounds often lead to a rote-memorized definition of biodiversity rather than an explanation of its importance to sustainability.
- Format demand: **Open-ended**. This requires active recall and synthesis in English (a second or third language for this demographic). The rubric is binary (0 or 1), allowing no partial credit for vague or partially correct answers.
- Number friendliness: **easy**. Not applicable (no numbers involved).
