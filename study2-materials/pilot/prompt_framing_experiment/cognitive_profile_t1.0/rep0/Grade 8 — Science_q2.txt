Concept familiarity: Very familiar (The conversion of milk to curd is a staple practical example in Indian Science curricula and a common household phenomenon).
Computational complexity: 1 (Simple recall and classification).
Common error traps: Minor (Students may confuse "bacteria" with "fungi/virus" or struggle with the specific spelling of "Lactobacillus" despite knowing the concept).
Format demand: Open-ended recall. The 0.5 mark rubric suggests an "all or nothing" approach, which increases difficulty compared to a multiple-choice format.
Number friendliness: N/A (Qualitative response).

Holistic Analysis: While the concept is culturally and academically ubiquitous, the requirement to recall and spell a complex Latin-based scientific name ("Lactobacillus") poses a significant linguistic barrier for Hindi-medium students with limited English proficiency. Many students will likely know the "category" (bacteria) but may phoneticize or fail to recall the specific name accurately.
