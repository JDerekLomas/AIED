**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Prime factorization and finding factors are core components of the Grade 6 NCERT syllabus (Chapter 3: Playing with Numbers). Students are generally well-practiced in the definition of a factor, though the application varies with number size.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **4+.** To find all factors of 68, a student must perform multiple divisibility tests or division operations (checking 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.). Identifying the "middle" pair (4 × 17) requires a systematic approach to ensure no numbers are missed.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** The most common "procedural bug" is the omission of the factor pair (4, 17). While 2 and 34 are easily identified due to evenness, 17 is a prime number that many students do not encounter frequently in multiplication tables (which are typically memorized up to 10 or 12). Students often stop after (1, 2, 34, 68).
*   **Format Demand:** **High (Open-ended/Binary).** The rubric specifies a maximum score of 1 for "all correct factors." Since no partial credit is mentioned, a student who identifies 5 out of 6 factors receives a 0. This "all-or-nothing" demand significantly lowers the success rate compared to multiple-choice formats.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Hard.** For a Grade 6 student from a Hindi-medium background with limited exposure to larger prime products, 68 is a "difficult" number. Unlike 12, 24, or 36, 68 does not follow common 1–10 multiplication table patterns. The jump from 4 to 17 is mentally taxing for students who rely on rote skip-counting.

**Holistic Estimation**
Given the binary scoring and the likelihood of students missing the 4 and 17 pair, many students will provide an incomplete list. While they understand the concept, the computational rigor and the "exactness" of the rubric will filter out a large portion of the cohort.
