- Concept familiarity: Familiar (Wh- questions are standard for Grade 6, though performance depends heavily on the specific reading passage length and complexity).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step information retrieval).
- Common error traps: Minor (Students may confuse "where" with "when" or struggle with the past tense "did find" vs "found" in full-sentence responses, though the rubric is lenient).
- Format demand: Open-ended (Requires recall and basic spelling; no partial credit for a 1-mark item).
- Number friendliness: N/A (Language-based task).
