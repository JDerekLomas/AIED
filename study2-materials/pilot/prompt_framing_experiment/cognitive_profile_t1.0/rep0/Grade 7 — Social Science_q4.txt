**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Less familiar.** While "democracy" is a core theme in Grade 7 Civics (NCERT), the specific term "transparency" (*pardarshita*) is an abstract administrative concept. For students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English terminology acts as a significant barrier to accessing the underlying political concept.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** No mathematical operations are required.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students often confuse "transparency" with general "good behavior" or "honesty" by leaders. Without a strong grasp of the specific mechanism (e.g., Right to Information, public records), they are likely to provide vague moralistic answers (e.g., "Leaders should be good") rather than systemic suggestions.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** This is an open-ended "Suggest" item requiring productive vocabulary and retrieval. Even if the rubric accepts any plausible way, the student must translate a complex thought into a written sentence in English, which is a high hurdle for this demographic.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** Not applicable/No numbers involved.

**Holistic Estimate**
The linguistic barrier of the word "transparency" combined with the abstract nature of "governance" makes this a high-difficulty item for the target demographic. While the rubric is lenient (only one way required), the initial comprehension of the prompt will be the primary filter.
