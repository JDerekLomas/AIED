- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The Panchayati Raj system is a core pillar of the Grade 6-8 Civics curriculum in India and is a visible part of rural life, making the concept relatable, though the formal terminology can be challenging.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a purely conceptual/recall question with no mathematical component.
- **Common error traps:** Minor. Students may confuse the roles of different tiers (Gram Panchayat vs. Zila Parishad) or focus on specific functions (e.g., "building roads") rather than the systemic role of "local self-governance."
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. This increases difficulty significantly for ESL learners from Hindi-medium backgrounds. While the rubric is specific, expressing "self-governance" or "grassroots administration" in English requires high-order language production beyond simple recognition. No partial credit is mentioned for the 1-mark item.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. Not applicable to this item.

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the topic is culturally relevant, the linguistic barrier for students from economically weaker sections in English-medium testing is the primary hurdle. Students likely understand the *concept* in their mother tongue but may struggle to articulate the technical definition required by the rubric in English.
