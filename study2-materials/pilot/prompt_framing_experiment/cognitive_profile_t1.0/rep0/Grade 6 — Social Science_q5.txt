**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The Vedic period is a core component of the Grade 6 History syllabus (NCERT/State Boards). While students are introduced to the concept of "Pastoralism," the transition to "Agriculture" is a major theme, making both answers highly accessible.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** This is a purely qualitative recall task with no mathematical operations required.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** The main trap is the transition between the Early and Later Vedic periods; however, the rubric is inclusive, accepting both pastoralism and agriculture, which significantly lowers the risk of failure due to chronological confusion.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended / Recall.** Since students are from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the requirement to "Describe one key aspect" in English poses a significant linguistic barrier. Even if they know the term (e.g., "Gai" or "Kheti"), articulating a descriptive sentence in English increases the difficulty beyond simple recognition (MCQ).
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** Not applicable to this item.

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given the linguistic constraint (English proficiency) and the requirement to not just name but *describe* an aspect, many students will struggle to formulate the second half of the answer correctly despite knowing the subject matter.
