**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Less familiar.** While Grade 6 students encounter the Lion Capital in their history curriculum (Mauryan Empire/Ashoka), the specific link to current currency as a symbolic representation of the National Emblem is often treated as "general knowledge" rather than a core rote-learned fact. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the transition to explaining this in English adds a significant layer of difficulty.
*   **Computational Complexity: 1.** This is a purely qualitative, fact-based retrieval task.
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.** Students often confuse "why" (the historical source) with "what" (describing the animal). Many may provide literal answers (e.g., "because the lion is the king of the jungle" or "to make the note look strong") rather than identifying the **Lion Capital of Ashoka** or the **National Emblem**.
*   **Format Demand: High.** This is an open-ended "Explain" question requiring active recall and sentence construction. There is no recognition cue (as in Multiple Choice). For the target demographic, translating the concept from a Hindi mental model (*Ashok Stambh*) to the English technical term (*Lion Capital/National Emblem*) is a high hurdle.
*   **Number Friendliness: N/A.**

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the linguistic barrier for English Second Language (ESL) learners in economically weaker sections and the specific requirement to name the "Lion Capital" or "National Emblem" to earn the point, the success rate is expected to be low. Many students will understand the image but fail to use the technical vocabulary required by the rubric.
