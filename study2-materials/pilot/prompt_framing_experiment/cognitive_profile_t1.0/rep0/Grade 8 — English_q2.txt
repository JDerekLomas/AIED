- **Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. While students understand the concept of "sunset" and "birds," extracting auditory imagery from a text and articulating it in English is a sophisticated literacy skill for ESL learners from Hindi-medium backgrounds.
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical; single-step retrieval).
- **Common error traps:** Major. Students often struggle with the distinction between "what happened" (visual/narrative) and "what was heard" (auditory). Many may describe the sun setting rather than the sounds requested. Language interference (translating from Hindi "Awaaz") may lead to grammatical fragments that don't meet rubric standards.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. Requires active recall and sentence construction rather than recognition (MCQ). The rubric is specific; no partial credit is available for a 1-mark item.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Not applicable).

Holistic Estimate: The barrier here is not the concept, but the linguistic ability to identify specific sensory details and rephrase them in English. For students in this demographic, "What sounds..." is a high-order comprehension question.
