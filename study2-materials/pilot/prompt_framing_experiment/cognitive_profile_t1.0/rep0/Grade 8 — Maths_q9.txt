### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
Profit, loss, and discount are core components of the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum (Comparing Quantities). Students are frequently exposed to these concepts, though the multi-step nature of connecting MP (Marked Price) to CP (Cost Price) via SP (Selling Price) is often perceived as the "ceiling" of this unit's difficulty.

**Computational Complexity: 4+ steps**
This item requires a multi-stage cognitive load:
1. Calculate the discount amount ($1200 \times 0.10$).
2. Calculate the Selling Price ($1200 - 120 = 1080$).
3. Set up the Profit percentage relationship ($SP = CP \times 1.08$ or $CP = \frac{SP \times 100}{100 + P\%}$).
4. Perform the final division ($1080 / 1.08$).

**Common Error Traps: Major**
Students in this demographic often struggle with the "Base Value" fallacy. Many will incorrectly apply the 8% profit to the ₹1200 (Marked Price) or attempt to subtract 8% from the ₹1080 (SP) rather than dividing by 1.08 to find the CP. Additionally, Hindi-medium students often confuse the terminology (Ankit Mulya vs. Kray Mulya) when reading English-medium papers.

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
As a 1-mark item with no partial credit, it is high-stakes. The student must complete the entire procedural chain without a single arithmetic error to receive any credit.

**Number Friendliness: Easy**
The numbers are "friendly." 10% of 1200 is clean, and 1080 is perfectly divisible by 108. This reduces the cognitive load of the arithmetic, shifting the difficulty entirely to the conceptual application.

### Holistic Success Estimate
Given the linguistic barrier and the high probability of students applying the profit percentage to the wrong base, only those with a strong grasp of algebraic ratios will succeed.
