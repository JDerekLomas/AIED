- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Vitamins/minerals and "protective foods" are core concepts in the NCERT Grade 6 curriculum, often taught through rote-memorization-friendly tables).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; single-step conceptual recall).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse which specific deficiency leads to which disease, e.g., mixing up Vitamin C/Scurvy with Vitamin D/Rickets, or confusing "protective" with "energy-giving" foods).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (High demand for this demographic; requires constructing a sentence in English. While the concept is simple, expressing "fight against diseases" in a second language is a significant barrier. Partial credit is not mentioned in the rubric, making the "1 mark" all-or-nothing).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A).

**Analysis:** While the topic is highly familiar, the requirement to explain a concept and correctly name two distinct deficiencies in English will be a significant hurdle for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. Many will know the answer in their native language but struggle with the specific terminology (e.g., "deficiency," "protective," or the English names of diseases) required for a full mark.
