- **Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. (While 'money' is a known concept, 'economic development' is an abstract macroeconomic term often introduced at higher grade levels in the Indian NCERT/State Board curriculum. Grade 7 students typically focus on simpler concepts like 'Markets around us' or 'Trade'.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No direct arithmetic is required; however, the cognitive steps involve mapping an abstract concept to a systemic outcome.)
- **Common error traps:** Major. (Students from economically weaker sections often equate 'money' only with 'personal wealth' or 'currency notes' rather than as a 'medium of exchange' or 'capital' for development. The term 'Analyze' is a high-order command verb that may be misinterpreted by students with limited English proficiency.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. (Requires high-level generative recall and synthesis. Since the maximum score is 1 and requires both identification and explanation, there is no room for partial credit for a semi-coherent answer.)
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question).
