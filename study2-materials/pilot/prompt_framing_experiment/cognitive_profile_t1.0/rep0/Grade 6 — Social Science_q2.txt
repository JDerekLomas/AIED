- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. In the context of Rajasthan’s state curriculum (RBSE) and the cultural milieu of North India, figures like Maharana Pratap and Prithviraj Chauhan are household names and central to the Grade 6 History syllabus.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a simple retrieval task.
- **Common error traps:** Minor. The primary trap is spelling errors in English for Hindi-medium students (e.g., "Pratap" vs "Prtap") or potentially confusing Ancient vs. Medieval periods, though the iconic status of Rajasthani kings usually overrides chronological confusion.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended recall. While recall is harder than recognition, the high cultural salience of these specific names lowers the barrier. Partial credit is available (0.5 max score implies 0.25 per name).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. Not applicable in a mathematical sense, but the "two" required is a low cognitive load.

**Holistic Estimate:** Given the high cultural relevance and the specific inclusion of these figures in the "Hamara Rajasthan" (Our Rajasthan) textbooks used in government schools, most students will be able to name at least two figures even with limited English proficiency.
