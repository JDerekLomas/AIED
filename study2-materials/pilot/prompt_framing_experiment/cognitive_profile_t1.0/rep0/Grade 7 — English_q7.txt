**Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. While Grade 7 students are introduced to Parts of Speech, the distinction between a preposition and an adverb for words like "around," "up," or "down" is a nuanced grammatical concept often skipped in rote-learning environments.

**Computational complexity:** 1. This is a single-step identification task.

**Common error traps:** Major. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the word "around" is frequently taught in the context of position (prepositions). Without an object following the word ("around the field"), students are highly likely to default to "preposition" rather than "adverb" because they have been conditioned to associate specific words with specific categories regardless of syntax.

**Format demand:** Open-ended/Exact. Since this requires the specific term "adverb" without the benefit of multiple-choice options, the student must recall the spelling and the category perfectly. No partial credit is possible for a 1-mark item.

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Language task).

**Holistic Estimate:** In the context of Indian government schools and the specific demographic mentioned, the functional English level often lags behind the curriculum. Most students will identify "around" as a preposition or a noun due to limited exposure to intransitive adverbial usage.
