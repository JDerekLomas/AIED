- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Evaporation is a core Grade 7 NCERT concept, though the "impurity/salt" effect on boiling/evaporation rates is often an application-level extension).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Simple comparison of values in a table).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students might confuse "fastest" with the "highest number" on the table, failing to realize that a shorter time indicates a faster rate).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires a two-part response: a direct identification and a causal explanation. The linguistic demand of "explain why" is high for Hindi-medium students in an English-medium assessment).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Likely whole numbers or simple decimals).

**Analysis:** Part (a) is highly accessible, but part (b) requires articulating the concept of non-volatile solutes (salt) hindering evaporation. For students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency, translating the scientific reasoning into a coherent English sentence is a significant barrier, even if they understand the physical process.
