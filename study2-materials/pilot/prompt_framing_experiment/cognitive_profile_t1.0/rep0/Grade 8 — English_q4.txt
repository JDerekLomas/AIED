**Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. While Grade 8 curriculum covers weather-related vocabulary, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds and economically weaker sections often lack exposure to nuanced English synonyms. "Breeze" is frequently replaced by the generic "hawa" (wind) in their primary linguistic environment.

**Computational complexity:** 1. This is a single-step retrieval task.

**Common error traps:** Minor. The primary trap is "vocabulary overlap." Students may identify the word "wind" itself or other weather-related nouns (like "air" or "storm") found in the passage if they cannot distinguish the specific nuance of "light."

**Format demand:** Open-ended (recall). This increases difficulty significantly for this demographic. Unlike a multiple-choice question where they could recognize "breeze" through process of elimination, they must scan the text, understand the definition, and correctly extract the exact string. No partial credit is available.

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Language task).

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given the reliance on specific vocabulary recall and the linguistic transition from Hindi to English, many students will struggle to map the definition "light wind" to the specific term "breeze" unless it is a high-frequency word in their specific textbook.
