**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. Place value is a foundational pillar of the primary curriculum (Grades 3–5) and is usually the first unit revisited in Grade 6.
*   **Computational complexity:** 1 step (Identification/Retrieval). No arithmetic calculation is required.
*   **Common error traps:** Minor. Common "procedural bugs" include giving the face value (5) or miscounting zeros (50 or 5000). For Hindi-medium students, the terminology "place value" (sthaniye maan) is well-drilled, but they may occasionally confuse the English terms "tens" and "hundreds."
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). While there is no partial credit, the rubric is generous as it accepts both the numerical value (500) and the positional name (Hundreds).
*   **Number friendliness:** Easy. 7560 is a standard four-digit number with no internal zeros or complex decimals to confuse the student.

**Estimate**
Given that this is a core competency and the rubric allows for two variations of the correct answer, most students—even those with limited English—will recognize "place value" as a prompt to identify the 500 position.
