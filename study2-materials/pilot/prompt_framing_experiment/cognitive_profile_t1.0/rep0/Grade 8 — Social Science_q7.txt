**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The Battle of Plassey is a foundational topic in the Grade 8 NCERT History curriculum ("From Trade to Territory"). However, for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, articulating the transition from "mercantile interest" to "political dominance" in English presents a significant barrier.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** There are no arithmetic steps required for this item.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students often confuse the Battle of Plassey (1757) with the Battle of Buxar (1764). Many students might provide a purely descriptive account (who fought whom) rather than addressing the "expansion of power" aspect required by the rubric.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** This requires high-level recall and linguistic synthesis. In a second-language context, students often struggle to move beyond one-word answers to explain complex causal relationships like "puppet ruler" or "political control." No partial credit is available per the rubric.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The date (1757) is provided in the prompt, reducing the cognitive load of historical recall.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the linguistic barrier for EWS/Hindi-medium students in explaining a conceptual "how" question in English, and the strict rubric requiring an explanation of political dominance rather than just facts, the success rate will be low.
