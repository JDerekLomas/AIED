**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity: Familiar.** Articles are introduced early in Indian curricula (Grades 3-4). However, for Hindi-medium students, the concept is abstract because Hindi does not use articles. By Grade 7, students have seen these patterns frequently, though mastery remains inconsistent.
*   **Computational complexity: N/A.** This is a linguistic task requiring three distinct categorical decisions.
*   **Common error traps: Major.** 
    1.  **Phonetic vs. Orthographic:** Students often look for vowels (a, e, i, o, u) rather than sounds. While "elephant" starts with a vowel sound, the distinction between "a" and "an" is a frequent point of failure. 
    2.  **Definite vs. Indefinite:** The use of "the" for a specific location like "the zoo" is a common hurdle for ESL learners who may default to "a zoo."
    3.  **L1 Interference:** Hindi speakers often omit articles entirely (e.g., "I saw elephant").
*   **Format demand: Open-ended.** The rubric requires rewriting the *whole* sentence correctly. This increases difficulty significantly for students with low literacy, as they may fail the item due to spelling errors or punctuation mistakes elsewhere in the sentence, even if they know the correct articles. No partial credit is available.
*   **Number friendliness: N/A.**

**Holistic Estimate**
While the grammar rule is "familiar," the requirement to rewrite the entire sentence without error acts as a significant barrier for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. The lack of partial credit for getting 2 out of 3 articles correct will drive the success rate down.
