### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Multiplying binomials is a core competency in the Grade 8 algebraic expressions chapter. However, for students in Hindi-medium or economically weaker contexts, symbolic manipulation often remains abstract compared to arithmetic.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **4+ steps.** The process involves: 1) Distributing the first term, 2) Distributing the second term, 3) Performing four individual multiplications (coefficients and variables), and 4) Identifying and combining like terms.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** This item contains multiple "high-risk" zones:
    1.  **Integer Signs:** The negative sign in `(3a - 2b)` often leads to errors in the second distribution (`-2b * 3b`).
    2.  **Variable Powers:** Students frequently forget to square the variables (writing `6a` instead of `6a²`).
    3.  **Like Terms:** Misidentifying or incorrectly adding/subtracting the middle terms (`+9ab - 4ab`).
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** As an open-ended item with a binary rubric (0/1), there is no "safety net" for procedural slips. In a government school setting where English proficiency is low, the word "product" itself can occasionally be a linguistic barrier, though the algebraic notation usually signals the operation.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The coefficients (2 and 3) are small and manageable, which reduces cognitive load on basic multiplication, allowing focus on the algebraic process.

### Holistic Estimate
Given the lack of partial credit and the high probability of sign errors or power errors among students with limited remedial support, the success rate is likely to be below average.
