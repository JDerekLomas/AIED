Concept familiarity: Less familiar (Vocabulary acquisition in a second language is often a challenge for Hindi-medium students; "shining" is known, but "glowing" may not be in their active or passive lexicon).

Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step semantic matching).

Common error traps: Major (Students often struggle with "synonym hunting" in a foreign language. They may pick any word associated with light or a familiar adjective from the text regardless of meaning, or struggle to scan the passage effectively if their reading fluency is low).

Format demand: Open-ended/Recall (Requires exact spelling and identifying the specific word from the text; no partial credit).

Number friendliness: Easy (Not applicable).
