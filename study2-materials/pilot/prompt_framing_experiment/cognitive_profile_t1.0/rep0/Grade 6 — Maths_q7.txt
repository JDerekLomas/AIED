**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Temperature and rate are standard Grade 6 topics, though "rate of change" is often more intuitive than formal).

**Computational complexity:** 2-3 steps (1. Calculate time duration: 6 hours; 2. Calculate total increase: $6 \times 2$; 3. Final addition: $30 + 12$).

**Common error traps:** Major. For this specific demographic, the "12-hour clock" transition is a significant hurdle. Students often struggle to calculate the duration between "AM" and "PM" (e.g., $4 - 10$ resulting in confusion or $10 + 4 = 14$ hours). Additionally, "per hour" requires proportional reasoning which may be weak.

**Format demand:** Open-ended. Requires exact recall of the multi-step procedure. No partial credit per the rubric.

**Number friendliness:** Easy. The numbers (10, 30, 2, 4) are small integers, reducing the likelihood of calculation errors if the conceptual path is correct.

**Contextual Analysis:** For Hindi-medium students from economically weaker sections, the linguistic barrier of a word problem in English often leads to "number grabbing" (adding or subtracting the visible numbers 10, 30, 2, and 4) without comprehending the temporal logic. The transition from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM is the primary psychometric "distractor" in this item.
