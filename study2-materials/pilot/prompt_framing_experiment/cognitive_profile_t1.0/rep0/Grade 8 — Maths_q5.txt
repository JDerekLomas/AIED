**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The distributive property is a core part of the Grade 8 Rational Numbers chapter in the NCERT curriculum. However, applying it "in reverse" (factoring out) is generally less intuitive for students than expanding brackets.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **4+.** The item requires several distinct steps: 1) Identifying the common factor ($9/16$), 2) Setting up the addition of fractions with different denominators, 3) Finding a common denominator (LCM of 12 and 9), 4) Handling the signed number (addition of a negative), and 5) Final multiplication and simplification.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students in this demographic often struggle with:
    *   **Sign errors:** Adding a negative fraction is a frequent point of failure.
    *   **Fraction addition:** Many students incorrectly add numerators and denominators ($4/12 + -3/9 \neq 1/21$).
    *   **BODMAS/PEMDAS:** Without the distributive property, the calculation becomes much more tedious, increasing the likelihood of arithmetic slips.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** The rubric requires the application of a specific property. While the final answer is a single value, the process is rigid. Since it is a 1-mark item, there is likely no partial credit, making it an "all-or-nothing" demand.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Moderate.** While $9/16$ is not "friendly," the terms inside the bracket ($4/12 = 1/3$ and $-3/9 = -1/3$) simplify to zero. A student who simplifies the fractions *before* adding will find it very easy; however, many students will default to finding the LCM of 12 and 9 ($36$), which adds cognitive load.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the linguistic barrier (understanding the term "distributive property" in English vs. "वितरण गुणधर्म") and the high probability of errors in fraction operations among students from economically weaker sections with limited foundational support, the success rate is expected to be low.
