### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

*   **Concept familiarity:** **Less familiar.** While direct/indirect speech is introduced in Grade 7, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the conceptual leap of "tense shifting." In Hindi, reported speech does not always require the systematic back-shift of tenses (e.g., "am" to "was") that English demands, making the rule feel counter-intuitive.
*   **Computational complexity:** **3.** The student must perform three distinct linguistic transformations:
    1.  Addition of the conjunction "that."
    2.  Pronominal change ("I" to "she").
    3.  Tense shift ("am reading" to "was reading").
*   **Common error traps:** **Major.** Students frequently fail to change the pronoun (writing "She said that I was...") or neglect the tense shift (writing "She said that she is..."). For ESL learners, "am" to "was" is a common point of failure.
*   **Format demand:** **Open-ended.** This requires total recall of syntax and grammar rules. There is no recognition scaffold (like multiple-choice options), which significantly increases difficulty for students with limited English proficiency.
*   **Number friendliness:** **N/A** (Linguistic equivalent: The vocabulary—"reading," "novel"—is high-frequency and accessible, which lowers the barrier to understanding the sentence meaning, even if the grammatical transformation is difficult.)

### Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement for three simultaneous grammatical changes and the lack of a "tense-shift" equivalent in the students' native tongue, a significant majority will likely miss at least one component (most often the tense shift).
