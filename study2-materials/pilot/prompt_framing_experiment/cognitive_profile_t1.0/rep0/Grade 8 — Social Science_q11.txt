- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The impact of the British Raj on tribal groups is a core component of the Grade 8 NCERT History curriculum, specifically in chapters like "Tribals, Dikus and the Vision of a Golden Age.")
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No arithmetic/algebraic steps required; purely qualitative.)
- **Common error traps:** Major (Students often struggle with "distinct examples." Many provide circular arguments or vague statements like "it was bad for them" without specific historical evidence like Forest Laws or the transition to settled cultivation/labor.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended; high demand for recall and linguistic construction. While the rubric suggests 1 mark for a clear explanation, the requirement for "two distinct examples" in a short-answer format increases the cognitive load for students with limited English proficiency.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Not applicable as it is a non-numerical question.)

**Analysis:** While the content is a staple of the syllabus, the requirement to articulate two *distinct* historical shifts in a second language poses a significant barrier. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often understand the concept but struggle to structure the causal relationship (e.g., Forest Act -> loss of grazing rights -> migration) in English.
