**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Less familiar.** While the Angle Sum Property of a triangle is introduced in Grade 6 (NCERT), students in this demographic often struggle with applying it to "find the missing angle" in a geometric figure if they haven't achieved fluency in visualizing internal vs. external angles or formal geometric notation.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** (1. Summing the two known angles: $a + b$; 2. Subtracting that sum from 180: $180 - S$).
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students often miscalculate subtraction from 180 (regrouping errors) or confuse the property with 90 degrees. For Hindi-medium students, the transition to English variables like "Find the angle $x$" can occasionally cause a cognitive load delay.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** This requires recall of the theorem rather than recognition (as in MCQ). Since the rubric specifies a specific intermediate step ("Finds angle C... to be 80"), the 0.5-point constraint suggests an "all or nothing" or very narrow window for error, increasing difficulty.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** Standard geometry problems for Grade 6 typically use multiples of 5 or 10, making the mental arithmetic manageable if the concept is known.

**Estimated Holistic Success Rate:**
The combination of limited English proficiency (which complicates word-problem comprehension in geometry) and the requirement for a specific open-ended calculation typically results in significant "no-response" or "procedural error" rates in this specific demographic.
