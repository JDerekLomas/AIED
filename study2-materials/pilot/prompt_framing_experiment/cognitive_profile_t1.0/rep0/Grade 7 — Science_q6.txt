- Concept familiarity: familiar (Ruminants are a core topic in Grade 7 NCERT Science, Chapter 2: Nutrition in Animals. For rural/EWS students, cows are highly familiar, though the biological term "ruminant" may be less so.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (No calculation involved; purely conceptual/descriptive.)
- Common error traps: minor (Students may confuse the terms "rumination" with "digestion" or struggle to name the "rumen" specifically, though the rubric allows for "special/multiple stomachs.")
- Format demand: Open-ended (Requires recall and sentence construction. In an English-medium assessment, limited English proficiency will be a significant barrier for Hindi-medium background students to articulate the functional difference between cellulose and human-digestible food.)
- Number friendliness: easy (Qualitative question.)
