**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. Opposites (antonyms) of basic spatial directions are introduced in early primary grades (Grade 1-2). By Grade 6, "up/down" is a foundational vocabulary pair.

**Computational complexity:** 1 (Single-step retrieval).

**Common error traps:** None. The semantic relationship is unambiguous. The only minor risk is a spelling error (e.g., "douwn"), but the conceptual link is strong.

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). While it requires production rather than selection (MCQ), the word "down" is high-frequency and part of the basic sight-word vocabulary even for English Language Learners (ELLs). No partial credit is possible.

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Verbal item).

**Contextual Analysis for Indian Govt Schools:** For Grade 6 students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds, "up" and "down" are among the first English words acquired due to their use in classroom instructions (e.g., "Stand up," "Sit down," "Hands up"). Despite limited English proficiency, the directional "up/down" dyad is cross-linguistically reinforced and highly practiced.
