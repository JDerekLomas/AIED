**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. The transition of the East India Company from "merchants to masters" is a cornerstone of the Grade 8 NCERT history curriculum (Chapter 2: *From Trade to Territory*). It is heavily emphasized in classroom instruction and textbooks.
*   **Computational complexity:** 1. There are no mathematical steps involved.
*   **Common error traps:** Minor. The primary trap is a language barrier where students might understand the historical narrative in Hindi but struggle to articulate the "process" in English. However, the rubric is extremely lenient, requiring only the mention of their arrival as traders.
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). While the question asks to "Describe the process" (which suggests a high demand), the **rubric** only requires a single, simple fact: that they arrived as traders. This discrepancy between the prompt and the rubric significantly lowers the difficulty. 
*   **Number friendliness:** Easy. No numerical manipulation is required.

**Analysis for Target Demographic:**
For students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, the broad "Describe" prompt is intimidating. However, because the rubric only seeks the most basic foundational fact (arrival as traders)—which is the most memorized introductory sentence in this unit—most students will meet the minimum criteria even with limited English proficiency.
