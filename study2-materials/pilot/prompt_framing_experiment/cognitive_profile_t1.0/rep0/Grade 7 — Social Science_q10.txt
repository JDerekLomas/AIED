- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Ashoka is a central pillar of the Grade 6/7 History curriculum in India; students are generally well-acquainted with the Kalinga War and Dhamma).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative analysis only).
- Common error traps: Minor (Students may focus solely on the Kalinga War without explaining the broader 'significance' or 'impact' required for the full mark).
- Format demand: Open-ended/Recall (High demand; requiring the student to synthesize two points and articulate them in English, which poses a significant barrier for ESL/Hindi-medium students).
- Number friendliness: Easy (No numerical data required).
