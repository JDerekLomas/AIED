- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Leo Tolstoy's "Three Questions" is a staple in the NCERT Grade 7 curriculum).
- **Computational complexity:** 0 (Language/recall task).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse the answers with the questions or provide vague responses like "good things" instead of specific categories).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended; requires high linguistic recall. While the rubric suggests a 1-point binary, students often struggle to articulate three distinct clauses in English.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Analysis:** While the story is iconic and widely taught, the linguistic demand of recalling and writing three distinct complex phrases in English is a significant barrier for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited proficiency. Many will understand the gist but fail to produce the grammatically structured "triad" required for full marks.
