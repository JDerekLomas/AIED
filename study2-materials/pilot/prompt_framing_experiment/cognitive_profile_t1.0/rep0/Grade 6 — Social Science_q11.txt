- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Traffic safety is a standard part of EVS/Social Science curricula since early grades and is reinforced through social messaging).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No arithmetic involved; requires basic logical categorization).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students might provide two variations of the same reason, e.g., "to avoid accidents" and "to stay safe," which may be counted as one point depending on strictness; language barriers may hinder the explanation of the "community" aspect).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires recall and articulation. While the rubric says "Maximum score: 1," the multi-part nature of the question makes it high-stakes for a binary score).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Not applicable).

**Analysis:**
While the topic is highly familiar and relevant to daily life, the cognitive load is high for a 1-point question. The question asks for three distinct things: Reason 1, Reason 2, and a conceptual link to community functioning. For Hindi-medium students from economically weaker backgrounds, translating the abstract concept of "community functioning" into English is a significant hurdle. However, because the topic is socially ingrained, most students will grasp the core intent.
