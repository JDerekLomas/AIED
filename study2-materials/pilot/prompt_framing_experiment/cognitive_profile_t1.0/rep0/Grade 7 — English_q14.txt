- Concept familiarity: **less familiar** (While "opposite" is a familiar concept, the specific vocabulary word "ancient" is often introduced as a literary term rather than a functional one for Hindi-medium learners, who may more easily recognize "old.")
- Computational complexity: **1** (Single-step retrieval)
- Common error traps: **minor** (Students often confuse "ancient" with "old" and may provide "new" correctly, but many struggle to recall the specific academic pairing "modern." Spelling errors in "modern" are also frequent.)
- Format demand: **Open-ended** (Requires active recall and correct spelling without the aid of multiple-choice options; no partial credit is possible.)
- Number friendliness: **N/A** (Language task)
