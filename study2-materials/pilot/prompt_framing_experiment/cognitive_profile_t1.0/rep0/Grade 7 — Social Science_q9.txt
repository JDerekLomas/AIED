- **Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. (While wars are studied in Grade 7 History, "economic impact" is an abstract concept for 12-year-olds. They are more likely to recall names of kings or dates rather than systemic economic shifts).
- **Computational complexity:** 1. (No calculation required).
- **Common error traps:** Major. (Students often confuse "impact" with "outcome"—e.g., "The king won" instead of "The treasury was depleted." Language barriers may lead students to describe the violence of war rather than the economic consequences).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended/Recall. (High demand. The command verb "Assess" is cognitively taxing. Even though the rubric only requires one impact, the student must translate an abstract thought into a coherent English sentence).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. (Not applicable).

**Holistic Estimation:**
The transition from rote memorization of historical facts to "assessing" socio-economic impacts is a significant hurdle for Grade 7 students, especially those transitioning from Hindi-medium contexts where the term "economic life" (आर्थिक जीवन) may not be frequently utilized in their English vocabulary. Most students will likely provide a general narrative of the war rather than a specific economic consequence.
