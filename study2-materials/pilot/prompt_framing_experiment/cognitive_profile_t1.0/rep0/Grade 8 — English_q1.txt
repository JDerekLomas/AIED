- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Describing nature and colors is a standard curriculum component, though specific vocabulary may vary).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (N/A for English; single-step retrieval of information from memory or text).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students might name only one color instead of two, or use generic terms like "beautiful" or "red" which fail the specific rubric requirement).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires recall and sentence construction; no partial credit allowed per rubric, making it high-stakes for syntax and vocabulary).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A).
- **Contextual Note:** For students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds, the challenge lies not in the concept of a sunset, but in the precise English vocabulary ("shades," "painted") and the conjunction of two specific descriptors required for the full point.
