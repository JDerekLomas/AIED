### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
The concept of money and basic currency conversion is introduced in early primary grades. However, for Grade 7 students in Indian government schools, the use of "Paise" (10p, 20p) is increasingly rare in daily transactions (physical coins are out of circulation), making this a classroom-based abstract exercise rather than a lived-experience task.

**Computational Complexity: 4+ Steps**
The item requires several distinct stages:
1. Multi-step multiplication (10 × 10, 5 × 20, 16 × 50).
2. Conversion of total Paise to Rupees (dividing by 100).
3. Summation of the values.
4. Division by the target unit (Total ÷ 5).

**Common Error Traps: Major**
*   **Unit Mismanagement:** The most common trap is failing to convert Paise to Rupees, leading to an answer based on 1000 instead of 10.
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the prepositional structure "coins of... paise."
*   **Final Step Omission:** Many students will stop once they reach "10 Rupees" and fail to divide by 5 to find the number of coins.

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
The item requires exact recall of the conversion factor (100p = ₹1). Since the maximum score is 0.5, it suggests an "all or nothing" marking scheme or very limited room for partial credit, increasing the difficulty.

**Number Friendliness: Moderate**
While the multipliers (10, 5, 16) are relatively "friendly," the 16 × 50 calculation can lead to mental errors. The final division (10 ÷ 5) is simple, provided the previous steps were executed correctly.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the linguistic demand and the multiple conversion steps required before reaching the final answer, many students will likely provide "10" (the total value) instead of "2" (the number of 5-rupee coins).
