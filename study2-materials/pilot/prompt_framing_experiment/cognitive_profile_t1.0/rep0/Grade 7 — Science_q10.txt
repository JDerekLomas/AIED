Concept familiarity: familiar (Neutralization is a core Grade 7 NCERT topic, though the wasp/bee distinction is a specific application).
Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative reasoning; no calculation required).
Common error traps: major (Students frequently swap the two: misidentifying wasp stings as acidic and bee stings as alkaline. Language barriers may also lead students to describe the process without naming the specific "principle" of neutralization).
Format demand: Open-ended (Requires active recall of terminology and English syntax; no partial credit per rubric).
Number friendliness: N/A (Non-numerical item).
