**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Area of squares and rectangles is a core component of the Grade 5 and 6 NCERT curriculum. However, for students from economically weaker sections, "Area" is often learned as a rote formula ($L \times B$) rather than a conceptual understanding of spatial coverage.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** The student must: (1) Calculate the area of the rectangle ($5 \times 4$), (2) Calculate the area of the square ($5 \times 5$), and (3) Perform subtraction to find the difference ($25 - 20$). 
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** In the context of Indian government schools, two specific "procedural bugs" are prevalent:
    1.  **Confusing Area with Perimeter:** Adding sides instead of multiplying ($5+4=9$ and $5+5=10$).
    2.  **Language Barrier:** The phrase "by how much" (Hindi: *kitna adhik*) is often missed; students may identify the larger shape but fail to perform the final subtraction.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** Since this is not multiple-choice, there are no cues to guide the student. The lack of partial credit (per the 1-mark maximum score) makes the item "all-or-nothing," which significantly lowers the success rate for students who make a single calculation error.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The numbers (4 and 5) are within basic multiplication tables, reducing the cognitive load on pure arithmetic.

**Holistic Estimate:** While the math is simple, the multi-step nature of the question combined with the linguistic requirement to interpret "by how much" poses a significant challenge for students with limited English proficiency. Many students will correctly identify the square as "greater" but fail to provide the exact numerical difference required for the full mark.
