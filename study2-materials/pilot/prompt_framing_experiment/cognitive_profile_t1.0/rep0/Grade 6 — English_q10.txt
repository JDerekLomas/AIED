Concept familiarity: familiar (Determiners like 'some' and 'any' are introduced early, but the distinction between affirmative and negative/interrogative contexts often requires repeated drill.)
Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step identification.)
Common error traps: minor (The primary trap is the lack of "ear" for natural English phrasing; students may default to 'any' if they associate it with plurals indiscriminately or translate literally from Hindi equivalent 'kuch'.)
Format demand: exact (Multiple choice/binary selection requires an exact answer; no partial credit.)
Number friendliness: easy (Non-mathematical item.)
