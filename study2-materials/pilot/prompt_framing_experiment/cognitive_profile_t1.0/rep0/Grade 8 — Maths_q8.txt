**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The properties of parallelograms (opposite angles are equal, adjacent angles are supplementary) are core components of the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum. However, applying these to specific variables $x$ and $y$ requires a transition from rote memorization to geometric application.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** To find $x$ and $y$, students must identify the relationship (e.g., $180^\circ - \text{given angle}$ or equating to an opposite angle) and perform the subtraction.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English phrasing "Please find the angles..." may be less of a barrier than the geometric visual. However, common traps include confusing supplementary angles ($180^\circ$) with complementary angles ($90^\circ$) or incorrectly assuming all four angles are equal.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** The rubric requires not just the value (110) but also an **explanation**. For students with limited English proficiency, providing a written explanation for "why" (e.g., "Adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary") is a significant linguistic hurdle that exceeds the mathematical demand.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** Standard geometry problems at this level typically use multiples of 10 or 5, making the mental subtraction from 180 straightforward for most students.

**Holistic Estimate**
While many students may find the numerical value, the requirement for an explanation in a second language, combined with the "all or nothing" scoring (Maximum score: 1), significantly lowers the expected success rate.
