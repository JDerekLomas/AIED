**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The LCM is a core topic introduced in Grade 5 and reinforced heavily in Grade 6 in the Indian curriculum (NCERT). However, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may be more familiar with the term "Laghuttam Samapavartak" (ल.स.प.), making the English acronym "L.C.M." a slight linguistic barrier if not presented with the Hindi equivalent.
*   **Computational complexity:** 4+. Finding the LCM of three numbers requires several steps: setting up the division ladder or prime factorization trees, performing multiple divisions (2, 3, 5), and finally multiplying the factors (2 × 2 × 3 × 5).
*   **Common error traps:** Major. Common "procedural bugs" include: 1) Confusion between HCF and LCM; 2) Mistakes in multiplying the final string of factors; 3) "Stopping" the division process prematurely when one number is not divisible by the current divisor.
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended. This requires pure recall of the algorithm. Since the rubric specifies a "Maximum score: 1" without mention of partial credit, any computational slip leads to a total loss of marks.
*   **Number friendliness:** Moderate. While 12, 15, and 20 are small, 15 is not divisible by 2, and 20 is not divisible by 3. This requires the student to correctly "carry down" numbers during the common division method, a frequent point of failure for students with weaker foundational skills.

**Holistic Estimate**
While the procedure is standard, the lack of partial credit and the potential for linguistic confusion (L.C.M. vs. H.C.F.) in a high-pressure testing environment for students with limited English proficiency reduces the success rate.
