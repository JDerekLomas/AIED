**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The unitary method and basic multiplication are core components of the Grade 6 and 7 curriculum (NCERT). However, applying it to non-integer values is where proficiency often drops for this demographic.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** Students must (1) convert the mixed fraction ($5 \frac{3}{4}$) into an improper fraction ($\frac{23}{4}$) or a decimal ($5.75$), and (2) multiply by $10$.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students from these backgrounds often struggle with the "fraction-to-decimal" or "mixed-to-improper" conversion. Common errors include multiplying only the whole number ($10 \times 5 = 50$) and ignoring the fraction, or incorrectly adding the numbers ($10 + 5 \frac{3}{4}$).
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** Requires recall of the procedure. Since the rubric specifies a maximum score of 1 based on identifying the operation/solving, there is no buffer for minor calculation slips if the final value is wrong.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Moderate.** Multiplying by $10$ is "friendly" as it involves shifting a decimal point, but the presence of the fraction $3/4$ acts as a significant barrier for students with limited English/Math literacy who may perceive fractions as "different" types of numbers.

**Holistic Estimate**
While the math is foundational, the combination of mixed fractions and the requirement for an exact answer in an open-ended format typically results in high error rates among students in economically weaker sections who may lack consistent remedial support for fractional arithmetic.
