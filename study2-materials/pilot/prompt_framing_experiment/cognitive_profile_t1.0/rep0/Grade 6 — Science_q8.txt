**Concept familiarity:** Familiar. In Grade 6 Science (NCERT curriculum), the components of food and basic plant requirements are covered early. However, the specific diagnostic link between "stunted growth/yellowing" and "nutrients" is often a higher-order application of these facts.

**Computational complexity:** 1. This is a qualitative, conceptual question requiring no mathematical operations.

**Common error traps:** Major. For students from these backgrounds, the term "infer" and "evidence" are high-level academic vocabulary (Tier 2 words) often not mastered in English-medium instruction at this stage. Additionally, students often conflate any plant health issue with a simple lack of "water," missing the nuance of "nutrients" or "minerals."

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This requires the student to construct a sentence in English. For Hindi-medium background students, the transition from recognizing a concept to articulating a causal explanation in English is a significant barrier. While the rubric is generous, the lack of a word bank or options increases difficulty.

**Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Holistic Estimate:** While the science concept is foundational, the linguistic demand of "Explain" and "Infer" coupled with the need for English sentence construction for EWS/Hindi-medium background students significantly lowers the success rate. Most students will likely identify "water" correctly, but many will struggle to formulate the response or miss the nutrient deficiency aspect.
