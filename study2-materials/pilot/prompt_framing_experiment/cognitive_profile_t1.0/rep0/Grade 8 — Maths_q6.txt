**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Age-related word problems are a staple of Grade 8 linear equations and ratio/proportion units. However, the logic of "age difference" remains constant over time is a conceptual hurdle.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** 
    1. Multiplication (12 × 3) to find the father's current age.
    2. Subtraction (36 - 12) to find the current difference.
    3. (Optional/Trap) Adding 5 years to both and subtracting again.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students from these backgrounds often struggle with English phrasing like "thrice" (lexical barrier). The most common procedural trap is adding 5 to only one person or, more likely, adding 5 to the *difference* itself (thinking the gap grows over time).
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** Requires recall and exactness. Since it is a 1-point rubric with no partial credit, any minor calculation error or conceptual slip results in zero.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The numbers (12, 3, 5, 36) are low-magnitude and follow the standard 12-times table, which is usually rote-memorized in Indian schools.

**Psychometric Analysis:**
While the math is simple, the linguistic barrier ("thrice") and the conceptual trap (mistakenly increasing the age difference over time) will significantly lower the success rate among English Language Learners (ELL) in this demographic.
