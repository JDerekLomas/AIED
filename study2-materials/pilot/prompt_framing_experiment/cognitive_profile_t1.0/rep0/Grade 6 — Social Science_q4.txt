- Concept familiarity: familiar (The Thar Desert and Aravalli Range are core components of the Grade 6 Geography/State curriculum, though students may confuse "landform" with "state" or "city".)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Identifying a single entity and its trait.)
- Common error traps: minor (The main trap is the language barrier: translating the concept of "landform" into Hindi "Bhu-akriti" to understand the prompt, and the risk of naming a city like Jaipur instead of a geographical feature.)
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; requires both naming and describing for a very small point value (0.5), which may discourage detailed responses.
- Number friendliness: N/A (Non-mathematical item.)

Holistic Estimate: While the content is fundamental, the requirement to "describe" in English poses a significant hurdle for students from Hindi-medium, economically weaker backgrounds, often leading to incomplete answers despite knowing the concept.
