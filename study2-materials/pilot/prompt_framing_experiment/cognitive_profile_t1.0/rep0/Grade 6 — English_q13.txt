**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar.** Antonyms (opposite words) are a core component of the ESL/English curriculum from primary grades. "Slow/Fast" is one of the most basic pairs taught in early language acquisition.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** This is a single-step retrieval task. 
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** In the context of Hindi-medium students, the primary trap is "orthographic interference" (spelling errors) or "code-mixing" (knowing the concept in Hindi 'tez' but failing to recall the specific English label). However, given the simplicity of the word "fast," these are minimal.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** The item requires active recall rather than recognition (Multiple Choice). There is no partial credit; the student must produce the specific word.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** (Not applicable for this linguistic item, but the cognitive load is equivalent to a basic number bond).

**Contextual Analysis:**
While the students are from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, "Slow" and "Fast" are frequently used even in "Hinglish" contexts and basic classroom instructions. This specific pair is often introduced in Grade 2 or 3. By Grade 6, even with limited proficiency, this represents a fundamental vocabulary milestone that most students have internalized.
