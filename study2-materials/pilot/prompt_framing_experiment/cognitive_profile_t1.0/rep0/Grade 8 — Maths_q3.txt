### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
Probability is a standard component of the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum in India (Data Handling). Most students will have encountered the "favorable outcomes over total outcomes" formula. However, for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English term "random" or "drawn" may pose a slight linguistic barrier if the paper is not bilingual.

**Computational Complexity: 2-3 Steps**
1. Summing the balls ($4 + 6 = 10$).
2. Setting up the fraction ($4/10$).
3. Simplifying the fraction (optional but often expected: $2/5$ or $0.4$).

**Common Error Traps: Minor**
The most common error is the "ratio trap," where students compare black balls to white balls ($4/6$) instead of the total. Another minor trap is failing to simplify the fraction, though the rubric focuses on identifying the outcomes.

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
This requires recall of the formula. Since the rubric assigns a maximum score of 1 based on identifying the components, there is no room for partial credit in a binary scoring system. The lack of multiple-choice options increases difficulty as students cannot use process of elimination.

**Number Friendliness: Easy**
The numbers 4, 6, and 10 are highly "friendly." They allow for easy addition and the resulting denominator (10) makes decimal conversion or simplification straightforward for students with limited calculator access.

### Holistic Estimate
While the math is simple, the linguistic shift and the open-ended nature of the question in a resource-constrained environment typically lead to a moderate success rate.
