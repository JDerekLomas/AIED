**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Adaptations in desert plants are a core component of the Grade 6 Science curriculum in India, often taught using relatable examples like the Cactus).

**Computational complexity:** 1 (No arithmetic steps required).

**Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse "adaptation" with general growth or may struggle to distinguish between physical traits like "spines" and behavioral/functional traits like "water storage").

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall and sentence construction. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the linguistic barrier of explaining a biological mechanism in English—even if they understand the science—is a significant hurdle).

**Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question).

**Holistic Estimate:**
While the concept is well-taught, the open-ended nature of the question combined with the limited English proficiency of students from economically weaker backgrounds means many will struggle to articulate the "why" or "how" of the adaptation in English. They may provide one-word answers (e.g., "Cactus") which do not meet the rubric's requirement for a clear description of the mechanism.
