**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (This is the introductory chapter of the Grade 7 NCERT/State curriculum; the "Why, When, and How" of history is a foundational concept.)

**Computational complexity:** 1 (No mathematical operations are required; it is a purely qualitative explanation.)

**Common error traps:** Minor (The most common trap is a "circular definition" where students say "dates are important to know the date." Another trap is linguistic: students may understand the concept but lack the English vocabulary to express "chronology" or "sequence.")

**Format demand:** Open-ended. While it requires recall/generation, the rubric is generous. It accepts a variety of functional explanations (sequencing, timing, or framework) rather than requiring a verbatim textbook definition. No partial credit is available for this 1-mark item.

**Number friendliness:** Easy (No numerical calculation required.)

**Holistic Analysis:** Given the students' background, the primary barrier is English language production. However, because this is a core, high-frequency topic repeated in early-year assessments, most students will have memorized a functional phrase like "to know the order of events" or "to know when it happened." The lenient rubric compensates for limited proficiency.
