- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The present continuous tense is a core part of the Grade 6 curriculum, but the specific term "verb phrase" is often less emphasized than simply identifying the "verb").
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Single identification step).
- **Common error traps:** Major (Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the auxiliary verb. Common errors include selecting only "playing" [the main action] or including the object "football" as part of the action).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended recall (Requires exact identification of two words; no partial credit based on the rubric).
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Text-based item).
