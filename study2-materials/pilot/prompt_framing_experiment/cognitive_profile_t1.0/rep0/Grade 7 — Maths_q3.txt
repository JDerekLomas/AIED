- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Area of triangles is a core topic in Grade 7 NCERT curriculum).
- Computational complexity: 2-3 steps (Identify values -> Substitution -> Multiplication/Division).
- Common error traps: Minor (Students often forget the 1/2 factor or confuse the formula with that of a rectangle).
- Format demand: Open-ended/Recall (Requires exact answer; no partial credit based on the rubric).
- Number friendliness: Easy (8 and 6 are even numbers; $8 \times 6 = 48$ and $48 \div 2 = 24$ are simple mental calculations).
