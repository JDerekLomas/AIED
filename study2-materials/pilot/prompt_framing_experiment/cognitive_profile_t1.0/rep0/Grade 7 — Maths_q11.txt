**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Familiar.** Bar graphs are introduced in Grade 6 in the NCERT curriculum and revisited in Grade 7. While the concept is conceptually clear, the transition from simple pictographs to scale-based bar graphs is a significant pedagogical milestone for this age group.
*   **Computational Complexity: 2-3 steps.** Students must first analyze the range of the data, determine a common divisor for the scale (e.g., intervals of 10 or 20), and then translate each raw frequency into a specific height on the graph.
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.** For students in Indian government schools, the primary hurdles are:
    1.  **Scale selection:** Choosing an "appropriate" scale is an abstract task; many students default to a 1:1 scale which makes the graph physically impossible to draw on the provided paper.
    2.  **Linguistic Load:** The terms "maximum" and "minimum" are frequently confused or misinterpreted by students with limited English proficiency.
    3.  **Graph Construction:** Inconsistent spacing between bars and failing to start the Y-axis at zero are frequent procedural bugs.
*   **Format Demand:** Open-ended. This requires high recall and motor coordination (ruler usage, plotting). Since the rubric for part (a) is binary (Maximum score: 1), there is no safety net for students who understand the concept but make one minor scaling error.
*   **Number Friendliness: Moderate.** While the data usually consists of multiples of 5 or 10, the "six different classes" require six distinct plotting actions, increasing the probability of a clerical error that results in a zero under this specific rubric.

**Estimated Success Rate:**
The lack of partial credit in the provided rubric significantly lowers the expected success rate. While many students will attempt the graph and correctly identify "maximum/minimum," the technical requirement for a "consistent scale" and "correctly labeled axes" for a single point is a high barrier for students in resource-constrained environments.
