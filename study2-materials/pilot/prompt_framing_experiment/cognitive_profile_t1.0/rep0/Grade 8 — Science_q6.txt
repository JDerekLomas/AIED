- Concept familiarity: very familiar (Deforestation and its effects are core components of the Grade 8 EVS/Science curriculum and are frequently discussed in environmental awareness contexts).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative reasoning; no mathematical calculation required).
- Common error traps: minor (Students might identify the *action*—cutting trees—but fail to use the formal term "deforestation" or struggle to articulate long-term *consequences* like global warming or soil erosion in English).
- Format demand: Open-ended; requires active recall and sentence construction. While the rubric suggests flexibility, the linguistic barrier for Hindi-medium students to explain "sustained consequences" in English is high.
- Number friendliness: N/A
