Concept familiarity: Less familiar (While adjectives are taught, "adjective phrases" are often confused with simple adjectives in Grade 7; the rubric specifically asks for a single word "tiny" while the concept is a "phrase," creating misalignment).
Computational complexity: 1
Common error traps: Major (The instruction asks for an "adjective phrase," but the rubric accepts the single adjective "tiny." Students might search for a multi-word phrase like "in our balcony" due to its position or length, or be confused by the terminology).
Format demand: Exact (Open-ended recall of the specific word).
Number friendliness: Easy (Not applicable for English, but sentence structure is simple).
