**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Less familiar.** While Active/Passive voice is introduced in Grade 7, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the structural inversion of English syntax. In Hindi, the passive voice is constructed differently (*Karmavachya*), and the auxiliary verb requirements in English ("were" + past participle) are cognitively demanding for English Language Learners (ELLs).
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** To answer correctly, the student must: 1. Identify the object ("the leaves") and move it to the subject position; 2. Correctly identify the tense (Past Simple) and select the corresponding auxiliary ("were"); 3. Recall the irregular past participle of "blow" ("blown").
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** The primary trap is the irregular verb "blow-blew-blown." Many students will produce "blewed" or "blowed." Additionally, subject-verb agreement is a trap; students often use "was" instead of "were" because they focus on the singular "wind" rather than the plural "leaves."
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** This requires total recall of grammar rules and spelling. Since the rubric requires the exact transformation for 1 mark, there is no buffer for minor syntax or spelling errors.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A** (This is a linguistic item, but the "linguistic load" is high due to the irregular verb).

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given the reliance on an irregular verb and the plural subject-verb agreement in the passive form, this item will be challenging for students with limited English proficiency.
