**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The iodine test for starch is a cornerstone experiment in the Grade 6 Science curriculum (Chapter: Components of Food). While the concept is central, students in resource-constrained schools may only see it as a teacher demonstration rather than performing it individually.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** There are no mathematical calculations involved in this item.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students often confuse the reagents for different food tests (e.g., using Copper Sulphate or Caustic Soda, which are used for the protein test). Additionally, students frequently remember that a color change occurs but struggle to recall the specific "blue-black" result, often vaguely stating it "changes color" or turns "blue/purple/black" individually.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** This is an open-ended recall question. For students with limited English proficiency, "describing" a procedure is significantly harder than a multiple-choice selection. They must retrieve the specific vocabulary ("iodine") and construct a coherent sentence. The binary rubric (1 or 0) makes this difficult as it does not reward partial phonetic or structural attempts.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.**

**Holistic Estimation**
While the iodine test is a standard part of the syllabus, the requirement to produce a written description in English poses a significant barrier for Hindi-medium students from economically weaker sections. Many will recall the potato and the liquid but will struggle with the specific term "iodine" or the exact observation required for a full mark.
