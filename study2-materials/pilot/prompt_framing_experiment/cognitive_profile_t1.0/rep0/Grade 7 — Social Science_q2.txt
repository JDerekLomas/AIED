- Concept familiarity: **Familiar** (This is a core topic in NCERT Grade 7 Geography, Chapter 1. However, distinguishing between "human environment" and "human-made environment" often causes conceptual overlap for students.)
- Computational complexity: **1** (Non-mathematical; single-layered conceptual retrieval.)
- Common error traps: **Minor** (Students frequently confuse "human environment"—social/cultural structures—with "human-made environment"—buildings/roads. The Hindi-medium background may lead to "transliteration" errors where students describe people rather than the social environment.)
- Format demand: **High** (Open-ended recall in English is a significant barrier for students from economically weaker sections with limited proficiency. Constructing two distinct parts—definition and example—in a second language increases the cognitive load significantly.)
- Number friendliness: **Easy** (Not applicable.)

Holistic Analysis: While the concept is foundational, the requirement to produce a two-part written definition in English for a 0.5-mark question is a high hurdle for this specific demographic. Students may provide an example (easier) but struggle to articulate the abstract definition of "human environment" accurately.
