**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** **Familiar.** Linear equations in one variable are a core component of the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum. However, the fractional form (proportions) is often introduced later in the term, moving from simple addition/subtraction to cross-multiplication.
*   **Computational complexity:** **4+ steps.** To reach the final answer, students must: 1) Cross-multiply, 2) Apply the distributive property to two sets of parentheses, 3) Transpose variables to one side and constants to the other, and 4) Perform final division.
*   **Common error traps:** **Major.** This item contains three high-probability "procedural bugs":
    1.  **Distributive Property Error:** Multiplying $5 \times x$ but forgetting to multiply $5 \times 5$ (e.g., $5x - 5 = 3x - 3$).
    2.  **Sign Errors:** Mistakes during transposition (e.g., changing $-25$ to $+25$ correctly).
    3.  **Cross-multiplication Confusion:** Multiplying the numerators together or denominators together instead of diagonal multiplication.
*   **Format demand:** **Open-ended (Exact).** Since the rubric requires a specific value of $x$ for a single point, there is no buffer for minor calculation slips. For Hindi-medium students, the lack of word-problem context is a benefit, as the "language" is purely symbolic.
*   **Number friendliness:** **Moderate.** The numbers (3, 5, 25, 9) are small, but the final result $x = 8$ is a clean integer, which usually boosts student confidence during the process.

**Holistic Estimate**
While the algebra is standard, the multi-step nature of "distribute, transpose, and solve" leads to high attrition rates in a 1-mark, all-or-nothing scenario, particularly in schools where foundational arithmetic (like negative integer operations) may be shaky.
