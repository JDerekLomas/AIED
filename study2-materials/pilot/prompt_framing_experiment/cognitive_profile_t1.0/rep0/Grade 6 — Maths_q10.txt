**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** In the Indian NCERT curriculum, Grade 6 is the foundational year for "Basic Geometrical Ideas" and "Understanding Elementary Shapes." While students are introduced to angles in Grade 5, the formal use of a protractor to draw specific measures is a core Grade 6 competency.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** There are no arithmetic calculations required. The complexity is purely procedural/motor-sensory.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** The "Double Scale" trap is the primary hurdle. Students from these backgrounds often struggle with the orientation of the protractor, frequently reading the inner scale instead of the outer (or vice versa), resulting in a 70° angle instead of 110°. Additionally, precision errors (slipping of the tool) are common among students using low-quality geometry instruments often found in resource-constrained settings.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** This requires production (recall of procedure) rather than recognition (multiple choice). While the rubric specifies a maximum score of 1, the physical drawing must be precise within a $\pm 2^{\circ}$ tolerance to be considered "correct" in most government school assessments.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Moderate.** 40° is an acute angle and 110° is obtuse. The 110° angle is more difficult as it crosses the 90° perpendicular threshold, forcing the student to correctly navigate the protractor's scale beyond the midpoint.

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given the language barrier (understanding the instruction "protractor") and the high prevalence of the "inner/outer scale" confusion, many students will draw the supplement (70° for 110°). Precision issues due to lack of high-quality stationary also lower the success rate.
