- Concept familiarity: familiar (Theme identification is a standard curriculum requirement, though subjective interpretation can be challenging for this cohort.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step conceptual retrieval.)
- Common error traps: major (Students often struggle to distinguish between their own personal opinions and the specific "poet’s perspective." Language barriers often lead to "copy-pasting" random lines that do not answer the prompt.)
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; partial credit is possible per the rubric, but extracting a thematic "abstract" concept in English is high-demand for Hindi-medium learners.
- Number friendliness: N/A (Qualitative item.)
