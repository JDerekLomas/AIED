**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Fungal growth on bread is a staple observational experiment in the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum under the "Microorganisms" chapter).

**Computational complexity:** 1 (No arithmetic involved; direct identification).

**Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse the process with "bacteria" or general "rotting" rather than the specific biological term, but the rubric allows for "spoilage by microorganisms").

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall rather than recognition; however, the daily observation context provides strong scaffolding).

**Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question).

**Psychometric Profile:**
The item tests a fundamental biological concept that is highly relatable to the students' lived experiences (seeing spoiled food). While the English terminology "Mould" or "Fungi" might be a hurdle for Hindi-medium students, the rubric's flexibility regarding "Spoilage" or "Microorganisms" (often taught as *sukshma jeev* in Hindi) significantly lowers the barrier. The primary difficulty lies in transitioning from observation to technical nomenclature.
