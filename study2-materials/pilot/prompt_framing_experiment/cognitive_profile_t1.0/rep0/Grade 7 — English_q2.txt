### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
The "King and the Three Questions" is a classic parable (Leo Tolstoy) frequently included in the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum in India. Students are generally familiar with the narrative arc. However, translating the conceptual understanding into a written English response remains a challenge for Hindi-medium learners.

**Computational Complexity: N/A**
This is a qualitative language task; no arithmetic steps are involved.

**Common Error Traps: Minor**
The primary trap is a "language-interference" error rather than a conceptual misconception. Students may understand *why* (the motive) but struggle with the "to + verb" (infinitive) structure or the past tense agreement required by "did" in the question. They might provide a one-word answer ("Answers") which may or may not satisfy a strict examiner.

**Format Demand: Open-ended (High Demand)**
This item requires **recall and synthesis** rather than recognition (MCQ). For students with limited English proficiency, the transition from mental comprehension (in Hindi/mother tongue) to sentence construction in English is a high-threshold task. The rubric allows for "any similar reason," which lowers the demand slightly, but the lack of partial credit (binary 0/1) makes it harder for struggling learners.

**Number Friendliness: N/A**
Not applicable to this linguistic task.

**Holistic Estimate**
While the story is well-known, the requirement to produce an original sentence in English—accounting for grammar, vocabulary, and spelling—will be a significant barrier for students from economically weaker sections with limited English exposure. Many will provide partial or grammatically broken responses that may not meet the full criteria of a "correct reason" in a formal assessment.
