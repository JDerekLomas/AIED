- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (While the topic of child rights is included in the NCERT/State Board Civics curriculum for Grade 6, it is often taught theoretically rather than through lived application.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (The task requires retrieval and qualitative explanation, not mathematical processing.)
- **Common error traps:** Major (Students often conflate 'rights' with 'duties' or general moral behaviors. Furthermore, providing two distinct rights and then specifically pivoting to explain *only one* can lead to structural confusion or incomplete answers.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires high-level recall and linguistic construction. The 1-mark rubric is particularly punishing as it is binary—all or nothing—precluding partial credit for students who might know the rights but struggle to explain them in English.)
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (No numerical data involved.)

**Holistic Analysis:** 
The primary barrier for this specific demographic (EWS/Hindi-medium) is the linguistic demand of the "explain" component. While many students may recognize terms like "Right to Education," articulating the *importance* of that right in a second language without the safety net of partial credit makes the 1-mark threshold very difficult to achieve.
