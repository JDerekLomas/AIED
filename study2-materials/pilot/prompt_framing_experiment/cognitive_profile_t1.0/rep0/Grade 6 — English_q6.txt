- Concept familiarity: familiar (Subjective preference is a common task, but articulating "why" is more demanding than simple identification.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step qualitative task.)
- Common error traps: minor (Students often provide the "what" but omit the "why"; language barriers may lead to circular reasoning, e.g., "I like it because it is good.")
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall and synthesis; partial credit is available (0.75 for identifying the line, 0.75 for the reason).
- Number friendliness: N/A
