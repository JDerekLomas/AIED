- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The "spoon in tea" is the standard textbook example used to introduce Conduction in the NCERT Grade 7 Science curriculum (Chapter: Heat).
- **Computational complexity:** 1. There are no calculations involved; it is a conceptual identification and qualitative explanation task.
- **Common error traps:** Minor. Students may confuse the terminology with "Convection" (since tea is a liquid) or "Radiation." However, the solid nature of the spoon usually anchors the correct concept for most.
- **Format demand:** High for this demographic. While naming "Conduction" is a recall task, part (b) requires constructing a sentence in English. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, articulating the vibration/collision of particles or the transfer of energy through a solid medium poses a significant linguistic barrier, even if they understand the science.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. No numerical data involved.

**Holistic Estimate:** While many students will correctly identify "Conduction" for part (a), the requirement to "briefly explain" in English for part (b) will result in a significant drop-off in full marks due to language constraints.
