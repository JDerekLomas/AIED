**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** This is a foundational topic usually introduced in the first chapter of History in Grade 6 (NCERT/State Boards). While the terms are core vocabulary, they are abstract and often introduced early in the academic year.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** No mathematical steps are required.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** For students with Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English terminology ("Archaeological" vs. "Literary") is a significant linguistic hurdle. Common traps include swapping the definitions or failing to distinguish between "inscriptions" (archaeological) and "manuscripts" (literary).
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** This is an open-ended "Differentiate" task. It requires active recall of definitions, the ability to synthesize a comparison, and the production of specific examples in English. Since the maximum score is 1, there is no room for partial credit in this specific rubric, making it an "all or nothing" demand.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.**

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the socioeconomic and linguistic constraints, the multi-syllabic academic vocabulary ("archaeological") acts as a gatekeeper. While the concept is taught, the transition from Hindi concepts to English production in an open-ended format without partial credit significantly lowers the success rate for this specific demographic.
