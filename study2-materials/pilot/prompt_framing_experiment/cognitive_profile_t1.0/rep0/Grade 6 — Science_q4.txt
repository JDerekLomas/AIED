**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. This topic is covered in the "Fiber to Fabric" chapter of the NCERT Class 6 Science curriculum and relates to daily lived experience in India.

**Computational complexity:** 1. This is a non-mathematical, conceptual explanation task.

**Common error traps:** Minor. While the concept is simple, students often confuse the *property* (absorbent/porous) with the *effect* (keeps us cool). Some may provide circular reasoning ("We wear cotton because it is better for summer") without identifying a specific property.

**Format demand:** Open-ended. This requires active recall and sentence construction rather than recognition (MCQ). For Hindi-medium students, the linguistic demand of "Explain" and "Property" in English may pose a barrier even if they understand the science. No partial credit is available (1 or 0).

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative question).
