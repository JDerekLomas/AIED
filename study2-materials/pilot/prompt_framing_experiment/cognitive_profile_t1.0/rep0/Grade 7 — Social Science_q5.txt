- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The rock cycle is a core component of the Grade 7 Geography curriculum, specifically under the chapter 'Inside Our Earth'.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical; requires a single conceptual sequence.)
- **Common error traps:** Major (Students often confuse 'sedimentary' with 'metamorphic' or fail to distinguish between the processes of 'weathering' and 'metamorphism'. The distinction between the physical breakdown and the chemical change is a frequent point of confusion.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended; requires active recall of specific terminology and process sequencing. In a 1-mark rubric, failure to mention both breakdown (weathering) and transport (erosion) often leads to zero marks, as the transformation is incomplete.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Not applicable).

**Psychometric Analysis:**
For students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, the primary barrier is **linguistic encoding**. While they may understand the physical concept (stones breaking into sand), articulating "weathering," "erosion," and "sedimentation" in English is a high-order task. The lack of partial credit in this 1-point rubric significantly lowers the success rate, as many students will provide a partial description or use imprecise vocabulary.
