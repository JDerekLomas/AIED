**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. The Himalayas are introduced as early as Grade 3 in EVS (Environmental Studies). By Grade 6, the physical features of India are a core part of the geography curriculum.
*   **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical; simple retrieval).
*   **Common error traps:** Minor. The primary trap is a language barrier where a student knows the range in Hindi (e.g., "Himalaya Parvat") but struggles to spell it in English. Some students might list a peak (Everest) instead of a range.
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). While recall is harder than recognition (MCQ), the rubric is generous, allowing for any two of several major ranges. Partial credit is not applicable here as the max score is 0.5, implying this is a sub-part of a larger 1-mark question or a very low-stakes retrieval task.
*   **Number friendliness:** Not applicable (Qualitative).

**Analysis for Target Demographic:**
For students from economically weaker sections in Hindi-medium transitions, the "Himalayas" is a universal term. The "Aravallis" or "Vindhyas" are also culturally and geographically resonant in the Indian school context. Despite limited English proficiency, the phonetic spelling of these proper nouns is generally managed well by Grade 6 students.
