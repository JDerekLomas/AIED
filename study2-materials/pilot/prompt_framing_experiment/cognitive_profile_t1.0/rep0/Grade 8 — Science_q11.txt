- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Thermal expansion and electrical conductivity are standard Grade 8 NCERT topics, though connecting expansion to railway tracks is a classic application).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (The task is primarily data interpretation and conceptual recall).
- **Common error traps:** Major (The question structure is problematic: it asks three distinct sub-questions but the rubric only awards a score of 1 for answering part (a). Students may answer (b) and (c) correctly but miss the specific data-reading task in (a), or vice-versa).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended; requires specific identification from a table and conceptual justification. No partial credit allowed per the rubric.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Comparing values in a table).

**Analysis:** While the concepts are taught, the linguistic barrier for Hindi-medium students in an English-medium assessment is high. Furthermore, the "all-or-nothing" rubric for a three-part question creates a significant bottleneck. Students often struggle with the application of "why" (part b and c) in a second language, even if they can identify the data point in part (a).
