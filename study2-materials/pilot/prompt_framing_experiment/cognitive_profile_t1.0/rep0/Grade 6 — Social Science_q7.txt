- Concept familiarity: **Familiar** (Rajasthan's geography and minerals are core components of the state/regional curriculum, though distinguishing "natural resources" from "products" can sometimes be tricky for 6th graders).
- Computational complexity: **1** (No arithmetic involved; purely qualitative).
- Common error traps: **Minor** (Students may confuse man-made structures or crops with natural resources. The primary trap is providing the list but failing to provide the "influence/explanation" part of the prompt).
- Format demand: **High** (Open-ended recall requires active retrieval and sentence construction. The 1-mark maximum score is restrictive as it implies an "all or nothing" success for a two-part task, with no room for partial credit).
- Number friendliness: **Easy** (N/A).

**Analysis of context:** For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, the "Explain" component is a significant barrier. While they may know the resources (e.g., "Mica" or "Solar energy"), articulating the causal link between a resource and human life in English is cognitively demanding. The requirement to perform two distinct tasks (list + explain) for a single mark further lowers the probability of a "fully correct" response according to a binary rubric.
