**Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. While division is a standard Grade 8 skill, the "minimum number required" phrasing shifts the problem from a simple procedural calculation to a conceptual optimization problem (rounding up to the next multiple).

**Computational complexity:** 2-3 steps. 1) Division with remainder (300 ÷ 80); 2) Identifying the next multiple (80 × 4) or adding the deficit (300 + 20); 3) Dividing total chocolates by number of classes (320 ÷ 8).

**Common error traps:** Major. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the specific phrasing "minimum number... required to distribute... in equal quantity." Many will likely provide the answer "3" (quotient) or "60" (remainder) rather than 320. Additionally, many will attempt to divide the original 300 by 8 classes (37.5 chocolates), ignoring the "equal quantity per student" constraint.

**Format demand:** Open-ended/Binary. The rubric specifies a maximum score of 1 with no partial credit, making it an "all or nothing" demand. This significantly lowers success rates compared to multiple-choice items.

**Number friendliness:** Moderate. While the numbers are multiples of 10, the division 300 ÷ 80 results in a remainder, which often confuses students who are conditioned to expect "clean" answers in classroom exercises.

**Holistic Estimate:** The linguistic complexity of the prompt, combined with the non-intuitive step of rounding up to 320 before dividing by 8, presents a significant barrier for students with limited English proficiency.
