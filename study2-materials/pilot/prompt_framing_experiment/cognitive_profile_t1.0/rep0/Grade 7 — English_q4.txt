- Concept familiarity: less familiar (While the story "The Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy is a standard text, transitioning from literal comprehension to applying moral philosophy to "real life" requires a high level of abstract reasoning for Grade 7.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative reasoning; no mathematical steps.)
- Common error traps: major (Students often struggle to distinguish between what the King thought was important in the story and why those concepts matter in their own lives. Language interference—translating a complex justification from Hindi to English—often leads to fragmented or incoherent sentences.)
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; no partial credit (The 1-mark constraint makes it an all-or-nothing binary. Students must not only recall the three questions but also formulate an original "reason," which is a high-order skill.)
- Number friendliness: easy (Not applicable.)

Holistic Analysis: For students in Hindi-medium, economically weaker backgrounds, the "double burden" of decoding a philosophical question and encoding a response in a non-native language is significant. While many might understand the story's gist, articulating a logical "reason" in English that satisfies a rubric typically results in high omission or incorrect rates.
