### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
The concept of HCF is a core component of the Grade 6 NCERT curriculum (Playing with Numbers). Students are typically well-practiced in the procedure of finding factors, though the transition from abstract calculation to word-problem application is where many struggle.

**Computational Complexity: 2-3 steps**
1. Recognizing the need for HCF.
2. Prime factorization or division method for 75 and 69.
3. Identifying the common factor.

**Common Error Traps: Major**
For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the linguistic bridge is a significant hurdle. The phrase "maximum value... an exact number of times" is a technical register of English that is often misinterpreted. Students frequently default to Addition (summing the weights) or LCM (confusing "maximum" with the larger multiples) when they fail to decode the logic of the "measure."

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
The item requires recall of the algorithm and the underlying logic. With a maximum score of only 0.5, the rubric is likely "all-or-nothing," meaning students who make a minor calculation error (e.g., 75 = 3 × 25; 69 = 3 × 23) but identify the HCF method may still lose the full mark.

**Number Friendliness: Moderate**
While 75 is very familiar (multiples of 25/5/3), 69 is less intuitive for students. Many students initially perceive 69 as prime or struggle to immediately identify 3 as its factor (6+9=15), leading to procedural stalling.

### Holistic Estimate
Given the language barrier (ESL/Hindi-medium) and the tendency for students in economically weaker sections to rely on rote memorization over conceptual word-problem decoding, a significant portion will fail to identify that this is an HCF problem.
