- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (NCERT Grade 7 Civics, Chapter 2: "Role of the Government in Health," specifically contrasts these sectors).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical task).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often struggle to differentiate "features" from "examples" or may focus only on one sector without comparing).
- **Format demand:** High (Open-ended recall requires synthesizing information and constructing sentences in English, which is a significant barrier for students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds).
- **Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Holistic Estimation:** While the concepts are relatable to their lived experiences, the requirement to "evaluate" and provide "valid arguments" in English, combined with a binary rubric (0 or 1) that offers no partial credit for mentioning only one sector, significantly lowers the success rate for this specific demographic.
