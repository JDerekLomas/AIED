- Concept familiarity: familiar (The concept of 'Sansad' or Parliament is a core component of the Grade 8 Civics/Political Science curriculum in India, frequently emphasized in textbooks like NCERT.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (No arithmetic steps required; requires logical connection between 'democracy' and 'representation'.)
- Common error traps: minor (Students may confuse 'Parliament' with 'Government' or 'President', or provide a tautological answer like "It is needed because it is in the constitution" without explaining its role in representation.)
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; no partial credit is available as per the 1-mark rubric, which demands a specific conceptual link (law-making or representation).
- Number friendliness: easy (Not applicable, no numbers involved.)

The high language barrier for students from economically weaker sections often makes expressing abstract concepts like "will of the people" or "representative body" in English difficult, even if the concept is understood. Many students may struggle to articulate the specific link required by the rubric in a second language.
