### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

**Concept familiarity: Very familiar**
Linear equations in one variable are a core component of the Grade 7 and 8 NCERT syllabus. Students in Indian government schools are typically introduced to the transposition method early. However, the introduction of negative integers as results often marks the transition from purely procedural arithmetic to abstract algebraic thinking.

**Computational complexity: 1**
The item requires only a single step: subtracting 9 from 4 (or transposing +9 to -9).

**Common error traps: Major**
For this specific demographic, the primary hurdle is not the algebra, but the **integer operation**. Students often struggle when the subtrahend is larger than the minuend ($4 - 9$). Common "procedural bugs" include:
1. **Absolute difference error:** Calculating $9 - 4 = 5$ and ignoring the sign.
2. **Sign confusion:** Adding the numbers ($9 + 4 = 13$) or incorrectly applying "plus and plus is minus" logic.
3. **Language interference:** In Hindi-medium contexts, the conceptual grasp of "negative debt" vs. "positive assets" is often taught but frequently fails under the pressure of formal examination.

**Format demand: Open-ended**
As a "Find the value" question without multiple-choice options, there is no recognition scaffold. The rubric is binary (0 or 1), meaning no partial credit is awarded for setting up the equation correctly if the final integer subtraction is flawed.

**Number friendliness: Easy**
The numbers are single digits and do not involve fractions or decimals, which reduces the cognitive load on pure computation.

### Holistic Estimate
While the algebraic step is simple, the requirement to produce a negative result ($y = -5$) is a significant "discriminator" in government school settings. A large cohort of students will likely provide the answer `5` or `13`.
