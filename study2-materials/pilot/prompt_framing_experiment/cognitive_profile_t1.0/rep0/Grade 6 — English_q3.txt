**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar.** Information retrieval from a short text (Wh- question) is a foundational skill taught from early grades. The vocabulary ("love," "evening," "read") is high-frequency.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **N/A.** This is a linguistic retrieval task.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with tense consistency (e.g., using "love" instead of "loved") or subject-verb agreement. However, the rubric is inclusive of short phrases ("read books"), which mitigates these grammatical traps.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended recall.** Requires scanning the text and extracting the specific activity. While open-ended tasks are harder than multiple-choice, the lenient rubric allows for partial phrases, lowering the barrier for students with limited English syntax skills.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.**

**Holistic Estimate**
Given that the rubric accepts fragmented but correct semantic answers ("read books"), students with limited proficiency can still score the point even if they cannot construct a grammatically perfect sentence. The primary challenge for this demographic remains decoding the "Wh-" question word and locating the corresponding verb in the passage.
