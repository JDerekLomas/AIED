- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. Perimeter and area are core Grade 6 and 7 topics in the NCERT curriculum, though the "reverse" calculation (finding side from perimeter) is slightly more advanced than direct calculation.
- **Computational complexity:** 4+. The student must: 1) Substitute values into the perimeter formula, 2) Solve a multi-step linear equation (32/2 - 10), 3) Identify the width, and 4) Use that width to calculate area (10 x 6).
- **Common error traps:** Major. For this demographic, common bugs include: confusion between Area and Perimeter formulas, forgetting to divide the perimeter by 2, or providing only the width and forgetting the area (as it is a two-part question).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). The rubric specifies a binary score (Max score 1), meaning no partial credit for finding the width but failing the area. This significantly increases difficulty.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. 32, 10, and 6 are whole numbers that facilitate mental math and do not require decimal division.

**Language/Context Factor:** While the numbers are friendly, "Perimeter," "Length," and "Width" are technical vocabulary that Hindi-medium students often struggle to map to "Parimap," "Lambai," and "Choudai" if the paper is not bilingual.
