Concept familiarity: familiar (Fractions and the 'of' operator as multiplication are standard Grade 6/7 NCERT topics)
Computational complexity: 4+ (Requires: 1. Conversion of 'of' to multiplication, 2. Multiplication of first pair, 3. Multiplication of second pair, 4. Finding a common denominator for comparison, 5. Comparison of the resulting fractions)
Common error traps: major (Students often struggle with fraction comparison after multiplication; many may incorrectly guess based on the magnitude of individual digits or add the fractions instead of multiplying)
Format demand: Open-ended (Requires showing calculations; no partial credit according to the rubric increases difficulty)
Number friendliness: moderate (3/8 and 4/15 require a common denominator of 120, which is not immediately intuitive for students with weaker calculation fluency)
