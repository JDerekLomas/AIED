- Concept familiarity: very familiar (This is a core topic introduced in early primary grades and reinforced in Class 6.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (No mathematical calculations required.)
- Common error traps: minor (Students may confuse "movement" with "locomotion" or struggle to classify dormant seeds/eggs, but the basic characteristics are well-rehearsed.)
- Format demand: Open-ended (Requires active recall and linguistic construction. For Hindi-medium students, translating biological concepts like "respiration" or "reproduction" into English may pose a significant barrier, though partial credit for simple words like "eat" or "grow" is helpful.)
- Number friendliness: easy (Qualitative task.)

Holistic Estimate: While the concept is fundamentally simple, the requirement to provide two characteristics for both categories (four points total) in English—combined with the limited English proficiency of the demographic—will lead to many students providing incomplete or linguistically fractured responses.
