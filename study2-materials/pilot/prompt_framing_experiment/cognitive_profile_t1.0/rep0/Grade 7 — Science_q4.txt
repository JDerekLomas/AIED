**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (This is a core topic in the "Heat" chapter of the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum and aligns with daily lived experience in India).

**Computational complexity:** 1 (No calculations required; requires qualitative reasoning).

**Common error traps:** Minor (Students might confuse 'absorption' with 'reflection' or struggle to distinguish between the property of the color vs. the property of the fabric/cotton).

**Format demand:** High (Open-ended, requiring the production of two distinct scientific reasons in English. While the rubric allows for simple language, the requirement to "explain" and "state two reasons" increases the cognitive load compared to a multiple-choice question).

**Number friendliness:** Easy (Not applicable).

**Contextual Analysis:** For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the primary barrier is **linguistic encoding**. While the scientific concept (light colors reflect heat) is intuitive and well-taught, articulating "reflection," "absorption," and "radiation" in English poses a significant challenge. However, because the rubric is generous ("they bounce off the sun's heat"), it allows for functional English.
