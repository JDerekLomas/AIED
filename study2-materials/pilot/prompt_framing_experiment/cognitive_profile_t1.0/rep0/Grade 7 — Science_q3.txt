**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. Photosynthesis is a core topic introduced in primary classes and revisited extensively in Grade 7. The term "green pigment" is the standard descriptor used in NCERT textbooks.
*   **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a purely terminological recall task with no mathematical operations required.
*   **Common error traps:** Minor. The primary trap is spelling. Students often confuse "Chlorophyll" with "Chloroplast" (the organelle) or "Stomata" (the pores). However, the conceptual association between "green" and "chlorophyll" is very strong.
*   **Format demand:** High (Recall). This is an open-ended "Name the..." question. Unlike a multiple-choice question where the student can recognize the word, they must retrieve it from memory. For Hindi-medium students, transliterating or spelling the English technical term (क्लोरोफिल) can be a hurdle, though phonetic approximations are often accepted in state board scoring.
*   **Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Analysis**
While the concept is foundational, the linguistic barrier for students from economically weaker sections in India remains a factor. The shift from the Hindi "हरित लवक" (Harit Lavak) to the English "Chlorophyll" can cause friction, but since this is a high-frequency "keyword" in the curriculum, most students memorize it as a label.
