**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The "too...to" structure is a staple of the Class 8 English grammar syllabus in Indian state boards (SCERT/NCERT). However, while the transformation rule is frequently taught, internalizing the semantic shift (positive "very" to negative "too") remains a hurdle for ESL learners.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **N/A (2-3 linguistic transformations).** The student must perform three operations: 1) Replace the intensifier "very" with "too," 2) Remove the full stop and the repeated subject/modal auxiliary ("He cannot"), and 3) Introduce the infinitive "to" before the verb.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the "double negative" logic inherent in "too." Common errors include:
    *   Retention of the negative: *"He is too weak to cannot walk."*
    *   Incorrect preposition: *"He is too weak for walk."*
    *   Tautology: *"He is too weak that he cannot walk."*
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** This is an open-ended constructive response. There is no recognition (Multiple Choice) to scaffold the memory. The student must recall the exact syntax. Per the rubric, the answer must be exact, and in a 1-mark schema, partial credit is rarely awarded for "He is too weak walk."
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.** (Linguistic equivalent: High. The vocabulary "weak" and "walk" consists of high-frequency sight words familiar to Grade 8 learners).

**Holistic Analysis**
While the vocabulary is simple, the structural transformation requires a leap from literal translation (which often fails for "too...to") to grammatical abstraction. For students in economically weaker sections with limited English exposure outside the classroom, the tendency to retain the "cannot" is the most significant barrier to a perfect score.
