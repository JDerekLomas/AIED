**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Passive voice is introduced in Grade 7 and reinforced in Grade 8 in the NCERT/State Board curricula, though application remains challenging for ESL learners).

**Computational complexity:** 2-3 (Requires identifying the object, determining the correct tense of the auxiliary verb 'to be', and converting the main verb to the past participle).

**Common error traps:** Major (For Sentence A, students often struggle with the 'was/were' distinction. For Sentence B, the present perfect 'has been' is a significant hurdle; students frequently drop 'been' or revert to simple past).

**Format demand:** Open-ended recall; no partial credit allowed per rubric. This increases difficulty as a single spelling error in the participle or an incorrect auxiliary verb results in zero points.

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Language-based item). Note: The vocabulary ("Successor", "Prepared") may pose a decoding challenge for students with limited English proficiency.

**Holistic Analysis:** While the simple past (A) is a standard drill, the inclusion of the present perfect (B) in an "all-or-nothing" scoring rubric significantly lowers the success rate. Hindi-medium students often map passive voice to literal translations which may not include the "been" requirement, leading to high error rates in Sentence B.
