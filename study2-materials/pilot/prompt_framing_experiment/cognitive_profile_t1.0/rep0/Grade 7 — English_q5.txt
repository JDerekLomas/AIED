- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The poem "The Squirrel" is a standard text in the NCERT Grade 7 curriculum (Honeycomb). Most students will have encountered the specific imagery of the tail.
- **Computational complexity:** 0. This is a qualitative, reading comprehension item.
- **Common error traps:** Minor. The primary trap is linguistic—students may understand the visual concept but lack the English vocabulary to describe it as a "question mark" or may confuse the squirrel's physical attributes with its behavior (e.g., "he sat up straight to eat a nut").
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. This is a high-demand format for ESL/Hindi-medium learners as it requires active recall and sentence construction rather than recognition (MCQ). No partial credit is available for a 1-point item.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Analysis:** While the concept is simple and the text is a staple of the curriculum, the requirement to produce an open-ended English response is a significant barrier for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. Many will recall the image but struggle to spell "question mark" or structure the sentence correctly in English.
