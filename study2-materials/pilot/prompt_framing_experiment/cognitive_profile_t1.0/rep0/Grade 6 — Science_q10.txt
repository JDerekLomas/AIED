Concept familiarity: familiar (Photosynthesis is a core Grade 6 concept, but application to data is less practiced).
Computational complexity: 1 (Comparing values in a table).
Common error traps: minor (Confusion between "most" and "least"; mistaking "Partial Shade" for "Full Sunlight" if reading the table incorrectly).
Format demand: Open-ended (Requires English phrasing for parts b and c; no partial credit for the 1-mark maximum score).
Number friendliness: easy (Simple growth measurements in cm).
