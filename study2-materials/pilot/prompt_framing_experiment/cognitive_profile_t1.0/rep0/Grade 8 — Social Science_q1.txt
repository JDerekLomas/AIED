**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. The Fundamental Rights are a core component of the Grade 8 Civics curriculum (NCERT) and are often introduced as early as Grade 6. In the Indian context, these are frequently reinforced through classroom displays, morning assemblies, and civic celebrations.
*   **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a non-computational, pure retrieval task.
*   **Common error traps:** Minor. The most common trap for this specific demographic is linguistic—students may know the concept in Hindi (e.g., *Samanta ka Adhikar*) but struggle to recall the exact English terminology. However, since the rubric allows for "simplified phrasing," this risk is mitigated. Confusion between "Duties" and "Rights" is the only other significant conceptual trap.
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). While recall is harder than recognition (MCQ), the requirement to name only two out of six possible options provides high "surface area" for a correct response. The lack of partial credit (Max score 1) increases the demand slightly, but the flexibility of the rubric offsets this.
*   **Number friendliness:** Easy. The student only needs to retrieve a count of two items.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given that this is a high-frequency topic and the rubric is lenient toward English language learners by accepting simplified phrasing, most students—even those from economically weaker sections—will be able to recall "Right to Equality" and "Right to Freedom" or "Right to Education."
