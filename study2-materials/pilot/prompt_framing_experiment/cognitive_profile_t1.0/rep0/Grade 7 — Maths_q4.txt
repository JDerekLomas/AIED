**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Division involving decimals is introduced in Grade 6 and reinforced in Grade 7 (NCERT Chapter 2). However, students in this demographic often struggle with the specific scenario of a whole number divided by a decimal, as it is less intuitive than dividing a decimal by a whole number.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** Students must (1) shift the decimal or convert to fractions ($8 \div \frac{72}{10}$), (2) simplify or perform long division, and (3) handle a non-terminating result ($1.11...$), which adds significant cognitive load.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Common errors include:
    *   Misplacing the decimal (answering $0.11$ or $11.1$).
    *   Confusion between $8 \div 7.2$ and $7.2 \div 8$ (answering $0.9$).
    *   Inability to handle the remainder/repeating decimal.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** Open-ended division requires procedural recall. With a maximum score of 0.5, there is little room for partial credit, and the "all or nothing" nature penalizes minor calculation slips.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Hard.** The numbers $8$ and $72$ have a relationship ($8 \times 9 = 72$), but because the divisor is larger than the quotient of the whole numbers (i.e., $80/72$), the result is not an integer or a clean terminating decimal. This is highly counter-intuitive for students who rely on "mental math" shortcuts.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the linguistic barrier (interpreting the instruction in English) and the high likelihood of decimal placement errors among students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds, the success rate is expected to be low.
