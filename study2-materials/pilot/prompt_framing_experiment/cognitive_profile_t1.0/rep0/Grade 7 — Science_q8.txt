**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The study of natural indicators (turmeric, hibiscus, litmus) is a core component of the Grade 7 NCERT/State Board Science curriculum (Chapter: Acids, Bases, and Salts). While the theory is standard, the practical application is often restricted to classroom demonstrations rather than individual hands-on experience in resource-constrained schools.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** There are no mathematical calculations required. The complexity lies in logical sequencing (procedural steps).
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.**
    *   **Color Confusion:** Students frequently mix up the color changes (e.g., thinking turmeric turns red in acid).
    *   **The "Neutral" Gap:** Students often forget to mention that turmeric remains yellow in neutral solutions, leading to an incomplete explanation of how to "determine" the nature of the liquid.
    *   **Language Barrier:** Describing a process in English is significantly harder for Hindi-medium students than identifying a color in a multiple-choice format.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** This requires active recall and sentence construction. There is no partial credit (binary scoring 0 or 1), which significantly lowers the success rate as a partially correct explanation (e.g., getting one indicator right but the other wrong) results in zero marks.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.**

**Holistic Estimation**
While the concept is taught, the transition from a Hindi-speaking background to writing a scientific procedure in English, combined with the "all-or-nothing" rubric and the tendency to swap color outcomes under exam pressure, makes this a challenging item for this specific demographic.
