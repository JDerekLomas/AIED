**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (This is a core topic in Grade 8 Science under "Crop Production and Management" and is highly relatable to rural/semi-urban students with agricultural backgrounds).

**Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical; requires a conceptual definition).

**Common error traps:** Minor (Students might confuse "weeds" with "pests" or "insects," or provide a circular definition like "weeds are plants that need weeding").

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall and sentence construction in English. For Hindi-medium students, the transition to English terminology like "unwanted" or "compete for nutrients" poses a linguistic barrier even if the concept is understood).

**Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A).

**Holistic Estimate:**
While the concept is highly intuitive and grounded in daily life for students in these demographics, the requirement to produce a formal definition in English for a 1-mark "exact" rubric reduces the success rate. Many students will understand the concept but struggle to articulate the "unwanted" or "competition" aspect in precise English.
