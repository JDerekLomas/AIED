**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar**. The unitary method is a core component of the Grade 6 and 7 NCERT curriculum. The context of "mileage" is culturally relevant and frequently discussed in Indian households, making the logic intuitive.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps**. Step 1: Division to find the unit rate (55/5). Step 2: Multiplication to find the new distance (11 x 12).
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor**. The most likely errors are "inversion errors" (5/55) or stopping after the first step (finding 11 and assuming the task is done). However, the linear nature of the problem is generally stable for this age group.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended**. Since this is a 1-mark "all or nothing" question with no partial credit, any minor calculation slip (e.g., 11 x 12 = 122) results in a zero. This increases the "effective" difficulty for students with low precision.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy**. 55 and 5 are highly compatible. The 11-times table is one of the easiest for students to master, and 11 x 12 is a common mental math landmark.
*   **Language Barrier:** **Moderate**. While the math is simple, the phrasing "How much mileage (average) the car is giving?" contains vocabulary that Hindi-medium students might find slightly confusing if they haven't associated "mileage" with "unit rate" in an English-language context.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the strong alignment with the curriculum and the "friendly" numbers, most students will grasp the logic. However, the requirement for an exact answer in an open-ended format without partial credit usually suppresses scores by 15-20% due to "careless" arithmetic errors.
