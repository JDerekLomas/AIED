- Concept familiarity: very familiar (Gangaur is a major cultural touchstone in Rajasthan and extensively covered in the local SCERT curriculum).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step recall/identification).
- Common error traps: minor (Possible confusion with Teej due to similar visual iconography of processions and traditional dress).
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall and descriptive writing; however, the rubric only awards points for the name, making the "description" part of the prompt technically irrelevant for the score.
- Number friendliness: easy (Not applicable).
