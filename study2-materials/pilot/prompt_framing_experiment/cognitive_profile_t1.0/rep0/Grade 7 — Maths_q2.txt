**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Familiar.** At the Grade 7 level in the NCERT/State Board curriculum, linear equations in one variable are a core pillar. However, for students from economically weaker sections (EWS), the transition from arithmetic to abstract symbolic logic (algebra) is often a significant cognitive hurdle.
*   **Computational Complexity: 2-3 steps.** The student must perform two distinct inverse operations: additive inverse (subtracting 2) and multiplicative inverse (dividing by 4).
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.** Typical procedural bugs in this demographic include:
    1.  **Operation confusion:** Adding 2 to 10 instead of subtracting.
    2.  **Incomplete isolation:** Stopping after $4x = 8$ and providing 8 as the answer.
    3.  **Coefficient error:** Dividing 4 by 8 instead of 8 by 4, leading to $x = 0.5$.
*   **Format Demand:** Open-ended. As it requires recall of the transposition method rather than recognition (MCQ), students cannot guess. Since the rubric specifies a maximum score of 1 based on the final solution, no partial credit is awarded for the first step.
*   **Number Friendliness: Easy.** The integers are small and the results are whole numbers ($8$ and $2$), which minimizes arithmetic strain.

**Contextual Analysis**
While the math itself is "easy," the language of algebra acts as a secondary language. For Hindi-medium students, the shift from "char guna" (4 times) to the syntax of "4x" can be abstract. In government school settings with high pupil-teacher ratios, foundational gaps in basic division often hinder the final step of algebraic equations.
