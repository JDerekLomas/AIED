**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. In the Indian Grade 8 curriculum (NCERT/State Boards), fables (like Panchatantra or Aesop's Fables) are frequently used. However, while students recognize the *stories*, providing a formal English *definition* moves it from familiar to "less familiar" in a productive sense.
*   **Computational complexity:** N/A (0).
*   **Common error traps:** Major. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often confuse "fable" with "story" (kahani) or "folk tale." They often struggle to articulate the specific constraints of the genre (animals + moral) in English, leading to vague answers that don't meet the rubric's criteria.
*   **Format demand:** High. This is an open-ended recall task. Unlike multiple-choice where they could recognize the definition, they must generate it. Since the rubric requires three distinct components (short story, animals, moral), the "all or nothing" 1-point constraint is punishing for students with limited English proficiency.
*   **Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Analysis:**
For students from economically weaker sections in government schools, the barrier here is not the concept, but the linguistic encoding. While they likely understand what a fable is in their mother tongue, synthesizing "typically uses animals" and "imparts a moral lesson" into a grammatically correct English sentence is a significant challenge. Many will provide partial answers (e.g., "A story with animals") which, under a binary 0/1 rubric, would be marked incorrect.
