- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Multiplication of integers is introduced in Grade 7, though negative sign rules are often a point of confusion).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Single multiplication step).
- **Common error traps:** Major (The "Negative x Negative = Positive" rule is frequently confused with addition rules, leading students to produce -12 or -7).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires recall of the sign rule without the scaffolding of multiple-choice options; no partial credit possible for a 1-mark item).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (3 and 4 are basic multiplication facts).
