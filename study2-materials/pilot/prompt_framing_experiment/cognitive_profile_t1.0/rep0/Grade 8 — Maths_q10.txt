Concept familiarity: familiar (Geometry/Angle properties are core to Grade 8, but performance varies based on diagram visualization)
Computational complexity: 2-3 (Typically involves identifying a property and performing subtraction from 180 or 360)
Common error traps: major (Confusion between interior/exterior angles, vertical/linear pairs, and linguistic barriers in "stating reasons" in English)
Format demand: Open-ended (Requires recall and articulation; no partial credit allowed per the rubric makes this high-stakes)
Number friendliness: easy (Geometry problems at this level usually use multiples of 5 or 10)
