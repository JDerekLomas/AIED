- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The distinction between clinical and laboratory thermometers is a core part of the Class 7 NCERT curriculum and is practically relevant).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No calculations involved; it is a purely qualitative/conceptual question).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse "clinical" with "digital" or simply say "doctor's thermometer"; the "why" part regarding the 'kink' or prevention of mercury backflow is a common point of memory failure).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall of specific terminology and a causal explanation. The 0.5 mark limit makes the rubric strict, as there is little room for partial credit).
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Non-numerical item).

**Psychometric Analysis:**
While the topic is well-covered, the student demographic (Hindi-medium background/limited English) may struggle to articulate the "why" (the function of the kink) in English, even if they understand the concept. The low weightage (0.5 marks) for a two-part question creates a high demand-to-reward ratio. Many students will correctly identify the thermometer but fail to provide a scientifically accurate explanation for the second part of the question.
