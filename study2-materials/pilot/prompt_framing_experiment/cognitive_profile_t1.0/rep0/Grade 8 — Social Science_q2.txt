- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. The Harappan Civilization is a cornerstone of the Grade 6 curriculum and is revisited in Grade 8. In the Indian context, terms like "drainage system" and "grid pattern" are emphasized repeatedly in textbooks.
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical item).
- **Common error traps:** Minor. The primary trap is "linguistic interference"—students may understand the concept (e.g., the drainage system) but struggle to retrieve the specific English terminology, potentially defaulting to Hindi or simplified descriptions.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). While the rubric is flexible, the lack of cues/options increases difficulty for students with low English literacy. However, because the rubric accepts any one of four distinct features, the "surface area" for a correct answer is high.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A).

**Holistic Estimate:** While the concept is highly familiar, the requirement to "describe" in English poses a significant barrier for students from Hindi-medium, economically weaker backgrounds. Many will provide one-word answers (e.g., "Drainage") which may technically meet the rubric's "describes" criteria in a lenient classroom setting but fail in more rigid psychometric assessments.
