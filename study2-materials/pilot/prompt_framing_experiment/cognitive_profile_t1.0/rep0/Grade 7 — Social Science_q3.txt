- Concept familiarity: familiar (Equality is a core theme in the Grade 7 NCERT Civics curriculum, specifically the first chapter "On Equality.")
- Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative task requiring no arithmetic steps.)
- Common error traps: minor (Students often confuse "equality" with "sameness" or struggle to articulate the constitutional aspect, but the rubric's "OR" clause provides a safety net.)
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall and synthesis; however, the rubric is highly lenient (binary 0/1 score for providing either the concept OR an example), reducing the demand for a perfect academic response.
- Number friendliness: easy (Not applicable/No numerical manipulation required.)

Holistic Estimate: The lenient rubric is the primary driver here. While students with limited English proficiency may struggle to "explain" complex constitutional principles in English, the ability to provide a daily life example (like standing in a ration line or voting) is highly accessible. Since the rubric awards the full point for *either* the theory or the example, the success rate will be relatively high even in resource-constrained settings.
