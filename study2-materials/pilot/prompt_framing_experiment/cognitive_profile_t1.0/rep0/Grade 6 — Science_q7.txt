**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The "Balanced Diet" and "Components of Food" are core chapters in Grade 6 Science (NCERT). Students are generally aware of food groups, though the specific link between milk and its nutrients (calcium/protein) may vary in depth.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** There are no mathematical calculations required; the task is purely categorical and analytical.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** A potential trap is the phrasing "Prepare diet chart," which makes the question appear to be a two-part or long-answer task, despite the rubric only awarding a point for identifying "milk." Students might also focus on specific vitamins (e.g., Vitamin C) rather than the food group itself.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** This requires free recall rather than recognition (multiple choice). The prompt is slightly "noisy" because it asks the student to "Prepare a diet chart," which is a high-order task that exceeds the 1-mark rubric. For students with limited English proficiency, parsing the difference between the observation and the instruction to "prepare" can cause cognitive overload.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.** (Qualitative item).

**Psychometric Considerations for Target Demographic:**
Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the grammatical error in the prompt ("has ate") or the phrasing of "growing children of your age." However, "milk," "fruits," and "vegetables" are high-frequency English loanwords used in Indian classrooms. The primary hurdle is the discrepancy between the prompt's breadth (writing a chart) and the rubric's narrow focus.
