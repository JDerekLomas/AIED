Concept familiarity: familiar (Pasteurization is a standard topic in Grade 8 Science under 'Microorganisms', though application-based recall varies)
Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative description; no active calculation required)
Common error traps: minor (Students often confuse pasteurization with simple boiling or sterilization; they may miss the 'sudden cooling' step which is critical to the definition)
Format demand: Open-ended (Requires active recall and sentence construction; since the rubric is binary (max 1 score) and requires both process and purpose, students with limited English proficiency may struggle to articulate the two-step thermal shock)
Number friendliness: easy (The numbers 70°C and 15-30 seconds are mentioned in the rubric as optional, reducing the burden of rote memorization)

Holistic Estimate: The requirement to explain both the 'process' (heating and quick cooling) and the 'purpose' in a single-mark, open-ended format is a high hurdle for students with limited English proficiency. While the concept is familiar, the precision required to distinguish it from 'boiling' often leads to incomplete answers.
