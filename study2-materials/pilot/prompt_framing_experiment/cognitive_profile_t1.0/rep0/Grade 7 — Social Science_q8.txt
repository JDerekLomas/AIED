- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Local geography and livelihood are core components of the Grade 7 State Board/NCERT syllabus; students from rural backgrounds have high contextual resonance with these occupations).
- Computational complexity: 1 (This is a qualitative recall and description task with no mathematical operations).
- Common error traps: Minor (Students may list urban occupations like "factory work" or confuse Rajasthan's specific context with generic industrialization, but the rural context usually prevents this).
- Format demand: High (Open-ended recall in English is a significant barrier for Hindi-medium students, even if they possess the conceptual knowledge).
- Number friendliness: N/A

Holistic Estimate: While the conceptual knowledge is high due to lived experience, the requirement to name two items *and* describe one in English creates a significant linguistic hurdle for this specific demographic, likely leading to incomplete responses or code-switching.
