**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Very familiar.** Ordering natural numbers is a core competency introduced in Grade 3 and reinforced through Grade 5. By Grade 6, students are expected to handle numbers up to lakhs; four-digit numbers are well within their comfort zone.
*   **Computational Complexity: 1.** This is a non-computational task involving direct comparison/identification of place value. No arithmetic operations are required.
*   **Common Error Traps: Minor.** The main trap is the presence of a three-digit number (`736`) among four-digit numbers. Students with low proficiency might focus only on the leading digits (3, 5, 7, 4) and place `736` last rather than first. However, the rubric specifically rewards identifying `736` as the smallest, which mitigates the penalty for subsequent ordering errors.
*   **Format Demand:** The question is open-ended, requiring production rather than selection. While the rubric allows for partial credit (0.5 max) for identifying the first number, the prompt asks for the proportion producing the **fully correct** answer. The lack of English language complexity (mathematical symbols and simple instructions) benefits Hindi-medium students.
*   **Number Friendliness: Easy.** The numbers have distinct thousands-place digits (3, 5, 4), making comparison straightforward once the three-digit number is identified. There are no "close calls" (e.g., 3367 vs 3376) that require high-level attention to detail.

**Estimated Holistic Success Rate:**
Given the fundamental nature of the task and the lack of linguistic barriers, most students, even from economically weaker backgrounds, tend to perform well on basic place-value recognition.
