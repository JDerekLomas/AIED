- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The properties of magnets (attraction/repulsion) are a core component of the Grade 6 Science syllabus in India (NCERT Chapter: Fun with Magnets) and are often demonstrated through hands-on activities or visual aids.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. No arithmetic or algebraic calculation is required; it is a qualitative conceptual question.
- **Common error traps:** Minor. The primary risk is "interference" where students confuse the behavior of like poles with unlike poles. However, the physical intuition of "repulsion" is generally strong.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (recall). While partial credit is not possible for a 1-mark item, the rubric accepts various phrasings ("push away" or "repel"), which lowers the barrier for students with limited English vocabulary.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. No numbers are involved.

**Analysis of the Student Cohort:**
For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds or economically weaker sections, the primary barrier is the English terminology. While they understand the physical phenomenon (often referred to as "dhakka dena" or "piche hatna"), the transition to the scientific term "repel" can be a hurdle. However, because this is a fundamental, high-interest topic usually accompanied by classroom demonstrations, the success rate remains relatively high.
