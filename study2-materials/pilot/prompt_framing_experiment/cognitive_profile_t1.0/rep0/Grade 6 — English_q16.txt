- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Seasons are a core part of the primary curriculum and daily life experience).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (The task requires identifying a single category/concept).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students might confuse the English name for the season or focus on writing the paragraph while forgetting to explicitly name/identify the season clearly as per the 1-mark rubric constraint).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires recall of specific vocabulary in English; however, the rubric only asks for the name of the season for this specific mark).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A for this qualitative task).
