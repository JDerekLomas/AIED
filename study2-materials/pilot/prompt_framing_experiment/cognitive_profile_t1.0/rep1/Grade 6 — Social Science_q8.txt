- Concept familiarity: less familiar (While "rights" are in the curriculum, Grade 6 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle to distinguish specific legal rights from general moral duties or needs. The transition from local language to English terminology for civic concepts is often a barrier.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Logical steps: Recall 1, Recall 2, Synthesis/Explanation.)
- Common error traps: major (Students often confuse "rights" with "duties" or "needs" (e.g., "drinking water"). Additionally, the dual-part nature of the question—naming two *and* explaining one—often leads to incomplete responses where the explanation is omitted.)
- Format demand: Open-ended (High demand; requires productive language skills rather than recognition. Since the rubric specifies a max score of 1 with no mention of partial credit, the "all or nothing" nature increases difficulty significantly.)
- Number friendliness: easy (Non-numerical.)
