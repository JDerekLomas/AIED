- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Agriculture and crop nutrients are core components of the Grade 7 Science curriculum in India, often linked to the chapter "Nutrition in Plants").
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; qualitative reasoning only).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse "nutrient deficiency" with "pest infestation" or "lack of water," leading them to suggest pesticides or irrigation instead of fertilizers).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall of specific chemical terms like Nitrogen or Phosphorus. Since it's a binary score (0/1), students who describe the process without the specific terminology may lose the mark).
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (No numerical values involved).

**Psychometric Considerations for the Target Demographic:**
The vocabulary "stunted growth," "soil analysis," and "deficiency" poses a high linguistic barrier for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds or those with limited English proficiency. While the biological concept is well-known (farmers adding 'Khaad'), the demand to articulate this in English and provide specific nutrient names increases the item's difficulty significantly compared to a multiple-choice format.
