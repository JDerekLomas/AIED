### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
Area of rectangles and squares is a core component of the Grade 5 and 6 NCERT curriculum. However, for students from economically weaker sections (EWS), "Area" is often understood procedurally (Length $\times$ Breadth) rather than conceptually. The introduction of two different shapes in one problem moves this from "very familiar" to "familiar."

**Computational Complexity: 2–3 Steps**
The student must perform three distinct operations:
1. Calculate the area of the rectangle ($5 \times 4$).
2. Calculate the area of the square ($5 \times 5$).
3. Perform a subtraction to find the difference ($25 - 20$).

**Common Error Traps: Major**
There are three significant traps for this specific demographic:
1. **Perimeter vs. Area Confusion:** Many students mistakenly calculate the perimeter ($2(L+B)$ or $4 \times S$) instead of the area.
2. **The "Square" Side Trap:** In Hindi-medium contexts, the terminology for "side" (भुजा) and "length/width" (लंबाई/चौड़ाई) can sometimes be conflated if the student hasn't mastered the specific properties of a square.
3. **Language Processing:** The comparative phrasing "Which of the two" and "by how much" requires higher-order English decoding skills, which is a barrier for students with limited English proficiency.

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
Since the rubric requires a maximum score of 1 with no partial credit, any error in one of the three steps results in a total loss of marks. The lack of scaffolding (splitting the question into parts a, b, and c) increases the cognitive load.

**Number Friendliness: Easy**
The numbers (4 and 5) are very "friendly." They are single digits, fall within basic multiplication tables, and result in multiples of 10 or 5, which are easiest for mental calculation.

**Holistic Estimate**
While the math is simple, the combination of multi-step processing, the "all-or-nothing" grading rubric, and the linguistic challenge of a comparative word problem for Hindi-medium learners will lead to significant attrition.
