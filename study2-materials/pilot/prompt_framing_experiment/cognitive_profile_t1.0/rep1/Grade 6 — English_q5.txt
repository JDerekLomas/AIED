- Concept familiarity: familiar (Theme identification is a standard curriculum requirement, though subjective analysis is emerging at this grade.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step inferential task.)
- Common error traps: major (Students often struggle to distinguish between a literal detail in the poem and the "most important" abstract theme; language barrier leads to copying random lines.)
- Format demand: Open-ended; partial credit is possible per the rubric, but the requirement to synthesize a "most important" point without a word bank is a high-recall task.
- Number friendliness: N/A (Non-mathematical item.)

Holistic Analysis: For Grade 6 students in this demographic, "main idea" questions are challenging because they require moving from literal translation to figurative interpretation. While the rubric is generous (accepting general themes), the lack of English fluency often results in students leaving the answer blank or providing irrelevant verbatim quotes from the text.
