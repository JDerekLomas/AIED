- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (This is a foundational concept introduced in primary classes and revisited in Grade 6.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No mathematical calculations required.)
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse movement with life—e.g., cars moving—or struggle to articulate biological processes like "respiration" vs "breathing" in English.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. Requires active recall and sentence construction. While the rubric suggests 0.5 marks for one characteristic, the prompt asks for "two key characteristics for each," creating a discrepancy between the task demand and the provided rubric.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative task.)

**Contextual Analysis:** For students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds, the cognitive load is not in the science (which is intuitive), but in the linguistic retrieval of specific English terminology (e.g., "reproduction," "stimuli"). However, "grow" and "food" are high-frequency words that most students at this level can produce.
