- Common error traps: major (Students often struggle to articulate the "why" in English; they may provide a line but fail to explain it, or use "because I like it," which lacks depth. Language barrier is the primary trap.)
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; partial credit is possible (1 mark for the line, 0.5 for the reason).
- Number friendliness: N/A
