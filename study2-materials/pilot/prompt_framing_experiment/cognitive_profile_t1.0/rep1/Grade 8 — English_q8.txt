**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** While Active-Passive voice is a core component of the Grade 8 English curriculum (NCERT/State Boards), the "Present Perfect" tense in sentence B (has found) is significantly less practiced and more difficult for students to transform than the "Simple Past" in sentence A.
*   **Computational Complexity (Linguistic Steps):** **4+.** For each sentence, the student must: (1) Identify the object/subject, (2) Determine the tense, (3) Select the correct auxiliary verb ('was' vs 'has been'), and (4) Recall the Past Participle (V3) form. Sentence B requires a complex auxiliary chain.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the "Perfect" aspect, frequently omitting "been" (e.g., *The successor has found...*) or confusing the auxiliary tense (e.g., *The meal is prepared...*). There is also a tendency to keep the subject at the start.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended/Exact.** The rubric requires two full conversions for a single mark with no partial credit mentioned. This "all-or-nothing" demand significantly lowers the success rate, as a mistake in either sentence results in zero points.
*   **Linguistic Friendliness:** **Moderate.** Vocabulary like "Successor" and "Prepared" may pose spelling or comprehension hurdles for students with limited English proficiency, even if they understand the grammatical rule.
