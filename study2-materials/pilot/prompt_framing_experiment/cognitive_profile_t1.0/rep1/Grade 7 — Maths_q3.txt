- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The formula for the area of a triangle is a core component of the Grade 7 Mensuration syllabus in India (NCERT/State Boards), typically introduced after the area of a parallelogram.
- **Computational complexity:** 2-3 steps. (1. Substitution into formula, 2. Multiplication/Division, 3. Final calculation).
- **Common error traps:** Minor. The most common "procedural bug" is forgetting the `1/2` and calculating the area as a rectangle (`8 x 6 = 48`). For Hindi-medium students, the English terms "base" and "height" are standard, but may occasionally be confused with "length" and "breadth."
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. Requires recall of the formula rather than recognition (as in MCQ). Since the rubric specifies a maximum score of 1 with no mention of partial credit, the answer must be exact.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. Both 8 and 6 are even, making the division by 2 mentally straightforward. The product is within basic multiplication tables.
