- **Concept familiarity**: Familiar (Rajasthan’s minerals and geography are standard parts of the NCERT/State curriculum, though students often struggle to distinguish between "natural resources" and "manufactured products").
- **Computational complexity**: 1 (No arithmetic steps; purely qualitative).
- **Common error traps**: Major (Students often fail to address the second half of the prompt—the "explanation" of influence—or confuse "natural resources" with "crops" or "occupations").
- **Format demand**: Open-ended/Dual-part. Despite the 1-mark maximum, the question requires two distinct cognitive tasks: recall (listing) and synthesis (explaining influence). The lack of partial credit in a 1-point rubric for a multi-part question significantly lowers the success rate.
- **Number friendliness**: Easy (No numerical data required).

**Holistic Analysis**: While the subject matter is culturally relevant, the linguistic barrier for Hindi-medium students in an English-medium assessment is high. Translating the abstract concept of "influence on life" into a coherent English sentence is a significant hurdle for Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections. Most students will likely list the resources but fail to provide a qualifying explanation in English, leading to a zero under a "no partial credit" 1-point rubric.
