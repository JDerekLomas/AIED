Concept familiarity: **Very familiar** (The transformation of milk to curd is a daily household observation for these students, and this specific example is the primary case study in the "Microorganisms" chapter of the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum).

Computational complexity: **1** (No calculation required; direct retrieval).

Common error traps: **Minor** (The primary trap is phonetic/spelling-related. Students might misspell "Lactobacillus" or confuse the category—bacteria—with "virus" or "fungi" due to the general association of microorganisms with diseases).

Format demand: **Open-ended recall.** The rubric asks for two distinct pieces of information (name and category) but offers a maximum score of only 0.5. This suggests a "binary" success criteria where a missing category or a significantly misspelled name results in zero credit. For Hindi-medium students, writing the long Latin name "Lactobacillus" in English is a higher hurdle than identifying it in a multiple-choice format.

Number friendliness: **Easy** (Not applicable).
