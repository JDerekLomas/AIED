Concept familiarity: familiar (The story "The Three Questions" is a staple in the NCERT Grade 7 curriculum, making the context recognizable.)

Computational complexity: 1 (Minimal; this is a qualitative reasoning task.)

Common error traps: major (Students often struggle to bridge the gap between "textual recall"—what the king wanted—and "subjective application"—why it matters in real life. Language barriers frequently lead to "copy-pasting" irrelevant lines from the passage rather than generating an original reason.)

Format demand: Open-ended requires recall and synthesis; no partial credit is available for this 1-mark item, making it a "hit or miss" for students with limited English syntax.

Number friendliness: easy (Not applicable.)

Holistic Estimate: While the story is familiar, the requirement to formulate an original "reason" in English is a significant barrier for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. Most will struggle to articulate the abstract connection between the king’s philosophical questions and real-life utility, likely resulting in incomplete or grammatically incoherent responses.
