**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The "Iodine test for starch" is a foundational experiment in the Grade 6 Science curriculum (Chapter: Components of Food). However, while the concept is frequently taught, the practical hands-on experience in resource-constrained schools may be limited to teacher demonstrations.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** There are no arithmetic or algebraic steps required for this item.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** For students with limited English proficiency, the primary trap is "linguistic retrieval." Students often confuse the names of chemical reagents (e.g., substituting "iodine" with "iron" or "acid") or struggle to describe the specific color change (blue-black vs. blue or purple). 
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** This is an open-ended "Describe and State" item. Unlike multiple-choice questions, it requires active recall and the ability to construct a sentence in English. Since the rubric is binary (Max score 1), students who know the concept but cannot articulate the procedure in English may fail to meet the "describe" criteria.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.** This is a qualitative, descriptive task.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the socioeconomic and linguistic context, there will be a significant gap between *conceptual understanding* (knowing that iodine turns a potato dark) and *productive output* (writing the procedure in English). While the core idea is simple, the requirement to "describe" in an L2 (English) without the scaffolding of a word bank or options will lead to a high omission or partial-answer rate among Hindi-medium students.
