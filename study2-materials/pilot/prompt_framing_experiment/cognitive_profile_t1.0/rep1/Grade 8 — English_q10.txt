**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The 'too...to' structure is a standard transformation rule taught in Grade 8 grammar modules across State Boards and NCERT).

**Computational complexity:** N/A (Language task involving 2-3 syntactic transformations: substitution of 'very', insertion of 'too', and reduction of the second clause to an infinitive).

**Common error traps:** Major (Students frequently retain the negative 'not', e.g., "He is too weak to not walk," or fail to remove the second subject, e.g., "He is too weak he to walk." The semantic shift where 'too' implies a negative is a common conceptual hurdle).

**Format demand:** Open-ended/Exact (The rubric requires a specific transformation. While minor spelling errors might be ignored, the structural syntax must be precise. No partial credit is indicated).

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Lexical items "weak" and "walk" are high-frequency, which aids comprehension).

**Holistic Analysis:** While the vocabulary is accessible, the transformation requires a high degree of "internalized grammar" rather than just translation. For Hindi-medium students, the 'too...to' structure does not have a direct word-for-word equivalent in Hindi (which uses *itna...ki* / *so...that* structures), leading to L1 interference. Given the lack of partial credit and the tendency to retain the word "cannot," the success rate is often lower than teacher expectations.
