**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Adaptation is a core theme in the Grade 6 NCERT Science curriculum (Chapter: "The Living Organisms — Characteristics and Habitats"). Students from rural or economically weaker backgrounds often have high anecdotal familiarity with local flora (like Kikar or Cactus), though they may lack the formal scientific vocabulary.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** There are no mathematical operations involved; it is a purely qualitative/descriptive task.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** A common misconception is confusing "adaptation" with "acclimatization" or providing a general description of a desert rather than a specific physical/behavioral trait of a plant. Some students might describe an animal (like a camel) instead of a plant.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** This is an open-ended question requiring active recall and sentence construction. For Hindi-medium students in an English-medium testing environment, "linguistic encoding" is the primary barrier. Explaining *how* a structure saves water requires more cognitive load than a simple identification task. However, the rubric is generous, accepting a single descriptive point.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.**

**Holistic Estimate:**
While the concept is well-understood, the requirement to "explain" in English often results in students providing one-word answers (e.g., "Cactus") which may not meet the full rubric requirement for a "description." However, given that only one adaptation is required for full marks, a significant number of students will likely succeed by mentioning "spines" or "long roots."
