**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (The poem "The Squirrel" by Mildred Bowers Armstrong is a staple in the NCERT Class 7 curriculum, taught in nearly all government schools).

**Computational complexity:** 1 (This is a single-step retrieval task).

**Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse "tail" with other features or provide a one-word answer like "bent" instead of the specific textbook phrase "question mark").

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires recall and basic sentence construction; no partial credit according to the rubric, which may penalize students with very poor English syntax even if they grasp the concept).

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative item).

**Contextual Analysis:** For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the phrase "question mark" is visually intuitive, making the concept easy to grasp. However, the requirement to produce an English sentence ("How is the... described") creates a linguistic barrier. While the imagery is memorable, the transition from mental image to written English reduces the success rate.
