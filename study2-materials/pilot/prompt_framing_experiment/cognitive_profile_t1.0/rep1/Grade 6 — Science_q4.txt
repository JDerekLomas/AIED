**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar.** The properties of natural fibers (cotton) and their utility in the Indian climate are foundational topics in the Grade 6 NCERT Science curriculum (Chapter: Fibre to Fabric). This is also reinforced by lived experience in the Indian context.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **None (0).** This is a qualitative, conceptual question.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** Students might conflate "keeping cool" with "reflection of light" (color) rather than the "property of the material" (absorption/porosity). Some may struggle to move from a general observation ("it is cool") to a scientific property ("absorbs sweat").
*   **Format Demand:** **High (Open-ended).** This requires active recall and sentence construction. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the barrier is not the scientific concept, but translating their understanding into a coherent English sentence. The rubric is binary (0 or 1), which penalizes students who understand the concept but lack the vocabulary to name the property accurately.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.**

**Holistic Estimation:**
While the concept is highly relatable, the requirement to "explain" and "describe a property" in English poses a significant linguistic hurdle for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. Many will know *why* they wear cotton but may struggle to articulate terms like "absorbent," "porous," or "evaporation" in their second language.
