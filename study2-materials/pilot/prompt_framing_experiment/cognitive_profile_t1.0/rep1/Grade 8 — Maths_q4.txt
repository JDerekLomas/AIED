**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Linear equations with one variable are a core part of the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum (Chapter 2). However, while basic transposition is well-practiced, fractional forms requiring cross-multiplication often represent a transition from procedural fluency to conceptual application.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **4+ steps.** The student must: 1) Recognize the need to cross-multiply, 2) Apply the distributive property to both binomials [e.g., $5(x-5)$ and $3(x-3)$], 3) Transpose variables to one side and constants to the other, and 4) Perform final division.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** This item contains three high-probability "procedural bugs":
    1.  **Incomplete Distribution:** Multiplying the coefficient only by $x$ and not the constant (e.g., $5x - 5 = 3x - 3$).
    2.  **Sign Errors:** Mistakes during the transposition of negative terms across the equals sign.
    3.  **Reciprocal Error:** Inverting the cross-multiplication (multiplying 3 by $x-5$).
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** Requires full recall of the algebraic process. Since the rubric specifies a maximum score of 1 based on forming the equation correctly, there is no "safety net" for final calculation errors if the setup is flawed.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Moderate.** The integers (3, 5) are small and "friendly," but the resulting equation $2x = 16$ leads to $x=8$. While the final answer is an integer, the intermediate step of $25 - 9$ or $-9 + 25$ can be a stumbling block for students with weak foundational arithmetic.

**Contextual Consideration:** For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds in economically weaker sections, the linguistic barrier is low (the equation is symbolic), but "Math Anxiety" regarding fractions and the abstract nature of $x$ on both sides often results in high omission rates.
