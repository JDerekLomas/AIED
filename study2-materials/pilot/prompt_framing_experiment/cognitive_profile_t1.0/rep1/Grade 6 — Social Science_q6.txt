- Concept familiarity: **Familiar** (This is a foundational topic in the first chapter of Grade 6 History, but requires distinguishing between abstract categories).
- Computational complexity: **1** (No arithmetic involved; purely qualitative).
- Common error traps: **Major** (Students often confuse 'inscriptions'—which are both archaeological and text-based—leading to categorization errors. There is also a frequent linguistic mix-up between "artifacts" and "literature").
- Format demand: **High** (Open-ended recall. Since the rubric requires two definitions and two examples for a single point with no partial credit mentioned, the "all-or-nothing" demand is high).
- Number friendliness: **N/A** (Qualitative item).

**Contextual Analysis:** For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds in EWS settings, the term "archaeological" is a significant linguistic hurdle (phonetically and conceptually). While the concept is taught early, the requirement to produce a structured, two-part comparative answer in English without prompts significantly lowers the success rate compared to a recognition task (like MCQ).
