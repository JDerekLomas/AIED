Concept familiarity: Less familiar (While adjectives are taught, identifying "adjective phrases" is often a transitional concept in Grade 7. Furthermore, the rubric incorrectly identifies a single word "tiny" as a phrase, which contradicts standard grammatical instruction where a phrase usually requires more than one word.)

Computational complexity: 1 (Single step of identification)

Common error traps: Major (The primary trap is the rubric itself. A "phrase" typically consists of a group of words. Students trained to look for phrases might select "in our balcony" (adverbial/prepositional) or "a tiny bird" (noun phrase). Additionally, for Hindi-medium learners, the distinction between a qualifying word and a phrase is linguistically subtle.)

Format demand: Open-ended/Exact (The student must recall the specific term or underline the correct segment; no partial credit is available for a 1-mark item.)

Number friendliness: N/A (Text-based item)

Holistic Estimate: The discrepancy between the question (asking for a phrase) and the rubric (accepting a single adjective) will significantly lower the success rate. High-performing students may overthink the "phrase" requirement, while lower-performing students may struggle with the vocabulary.
