### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
The concept of money and basic currency conversion is introduced early in the Indian NCERT curriculum (Grade 3-4). However, at Grade 7, students are expected to handle these as decimal operations or unit conversions (Paise to Rupees). While familiar, the shift from physical counting to abstract multiplication of denominations can be a hurdle for first-generation learners.

**Computational Complexity: 4+**
The item requires several sequential steps:
1. Three separate multiplications (10×10, 5×20, 16×50).
2. Summation of those products (100 + 100 + 800 = 1000 paise).
3. Conversion from paise to Rupees (1000 ÷ 100 = ₹10).
4. A final division/comparison to find the number of ₹5 coins (10 ÷ 5 = 2).

**Common Error Traps: Major**
*   **Unit Misalignment:** Students often confuse "10 coins of 10 paise" (Value = 100) with the number of coins themselves, potentially adding 10 + 5 + 16.
*   **Decimal Placement:** For Hindi-medium students, the linguistic transition to "decimal" notation in currency can lead to errors (e.g., treating 50 paise as 0.5 or 5.0).
*   **Final Step Omission:** Many students will stop after calculating the total value (₹10) and fail to divide by 5 to find the number of coins requested.

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
The question requires full recall and a multi-step execution. Since the maximum score is 0.5, it suggests an "all or nothing" marking scheme in many state-level assessments, which penalizes students who make a minor calculation error despite understanding the process.

**Number Friendliness: Moderate**
The numbers (10, 20, 50) are "friendly" in isolation, but the variety of denominations increases the cognitive load. 16 × 50 is the most likely point of arithmetic failure for students struggling with mental math.

**Estimated Success Rate:**
Given the socio-economic context, the primary challenge is the "language-to-logic" bridge and the multi-
