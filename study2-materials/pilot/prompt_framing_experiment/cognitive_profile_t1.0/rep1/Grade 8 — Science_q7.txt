- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Composting and decomposition are core components of the Grade 8 Science curriculum and common in rural/semi-urban Indian contexts).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Qualitative reasoning only).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may fail to provide the "reasons"—the biological process of decomposition—focusing only on the visible change).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall and linguistic construction. Partial credit is technically possible, but the 0.5 max score limit makes the grading threshold very tight).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A for this item).

**Holistic Estimate:** While the concept is highly relatable, the requirement to "evaluate" and "give reasons" in English poses a significant barrier for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. However, since the concept is practically grounded, a majority of students will grasp the core idea even if their expression is limited.
