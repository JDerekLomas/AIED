**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar.** The "Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy is a staple text in the NCERT Grade 7 curriculum (Honeycomb). The concept of a king seeking answers via a reward is a common trope in both classical literature and regional folklore.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **N/A.** This is a linguistic/recall task.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** The primary trap is a "language barrier" rather than a conceptual misunderstanding. Students may know *why* (the reason) but struggle to translate the thought from Hindi/vernacular to English. Some may confuse the "reward" with the "punishment" or simply list the three questions instead of explaining the purpose of the announcement.
*   **Format Demand:** **High (Open-ended).** Unlike Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) where students can rely on recognition, this requires active recall and sentence construction. For students with limited English proficiency, grammar and syntax hurdles (e.g., using "because" correctly or verb tense consistency) can prevent them from reaching a "correct" response, even if they comprehend the story.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.**

**Holistic Estimate:**
While the story is well-known, the requirement to produce an original sentence in English (rather than selecting an option) is a significant barrier for students from economically weaker sections with limited English exposure. Many will provide fragmented or grammatically incorrect answers that may not meet the rubric's standard for a "correct reason" in the medium of English.
