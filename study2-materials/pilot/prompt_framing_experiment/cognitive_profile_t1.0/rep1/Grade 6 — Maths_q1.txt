**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The concept of factors is a core component of the Grade 6 NCERT curriculum (Chapter 3: Playing with Numbers). While the term "factors" is standard, Hindi-medium students recognize it as *'gunankhand'* (गुणनखंड).
*   **Computational Complexity:** **4+.** Finding all factors of 68 requires a multi-step divisibility check. A student must systematically test 1, 2, 4, and potentially higher divisors, then perform division to find the corresponding pairs (68 ÷ 4 = 17).
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** The most significant trap is the "missing middle." Students often find 1, 2, 34, and 68 easily but frequently overlook the pair (4, 17) because 17 is a prime number and not a common multiplication table result. There is also a risk of stopping after finding just a few factors.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** The question is open-ended and requires total recall. According to your rubric, the score is binary (0 or 1). There is no partial credit for finding 4 out of 6 factors, which significantly lowers the success rate.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Moderate to Hard.** 68 is not a "friendly" number like 24, 36, or 60. It sits outside the standard 1–10 multiplication tables. The factor 17 is particularly difficult for students from economically weaker backgrounds who may have gaps in rote memorization of higher-order tables.

**Holistic Estimate**
Considering the lack of partial credit and the difficulty of identifying 17 as a factor, many students will provide an incomplete set (e.g., 1, 2, 34, 68), resulting in a score of 0.
