**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Division involving decimals is introduced in Grade 6 and reinforced in Grade 7. However, dividing a whole number by a decimal (divisor > dividend) is less common in standard drills than the inverse.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** Students must first eliminate the decimal (multiplying both by 10 to get $80 \div 72$), simplify the fraction (to $10 \div 9$), and then perform long division to reach a quotient.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Many students from this demographic struggle with "decimal placement" in the quotient. A common "procedural bug" is reversing the division ($7.2 \div 8 = 0.9$) because $72$ is a multiple of $8$. Additionally, since the result is a repeating decimal ($1.11...$), students often get confused about where to stop or how to round.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** Requires procedural recall. While the rubric mentions setting up the division, the finality of the value "8 ÷ 7.2" usually demands a numerical result. Lack of multiple-choice options removes the ability to "guess and check."
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Hard.** The numbers are not "friendly." The divisor ($7.2$) is larger than the dividend ($8$) only in appearance, but $80/72$ results in a non-terminating repeating decimal. For students used to clean, integer results in government school textbooks, this creates cognitive dissonance.
*   **Language Factor:** The prompt is short, which aids limited English proficiency, but the mathematical "vocabulary" of decimals remains a significant hurdle for Hindi-medium students who may have transitioned terminology.
