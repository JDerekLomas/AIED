**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. In Grade 6, area and perimeter are core curriculum components. However, students often conflate the two formulas ($L \times B$ vs. $2(L+B)$).
*   **Computational complexity:** 2-3 steps. The student must perform two distinct operations (multiplication for area and addition/multiplication for perimeter).
*   **Common error traps:** Major. For this specific demographic, the most common "procedural bug" is providing only one of the two requested values. Furthermore, since the rubric only awards 1 mark for the area (120 sq. cm) but the question asks for both area and perimeter, there is a misalignment that might confuse students or lead to incomplete responses. Unit errors (cm vs. sq. cm) are also frequent.
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended. Requires retrieval of two separate formulas from memory. Since the rubric is "all or nothing" for the max score (implied by the 1-point limit), no partial credit is available for finding only the perimeter or making a minor calculation error.
*   **Number friendliness:** Moderate. While 15 and 8 are relatively small, the product (120) requires solid grasp of times tables or double-digit multiplication, which can be a hurdle for students with disrupted primary schooling.

**Holistic Estimate**
Considering the language barrier (identifying "length" and "breadth") and the high probability of students providing only one of the two requested measurements, the success rate for a fully correct response is moderate.
