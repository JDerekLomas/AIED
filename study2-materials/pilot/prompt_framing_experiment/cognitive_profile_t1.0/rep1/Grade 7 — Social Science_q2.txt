- Concept familiarity: familiar (This is a core topic in NCERT Class 7 Geography, Chapter 1).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step conceptual retrieval).
- Common error traps: minor (Students often confuse 'human environment' with 'human-made environment'—the former includes social structures like family/religion, while the latter refers to physical structures like roads/buildings).
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; for a 0.5 max score, rubrics are often "all or nothing," making it high-stakes despite the low point value. Linguistic expression is the primary barrier for Hindi-medium learners.
- Number friendliness: easy (Qualitative question).
