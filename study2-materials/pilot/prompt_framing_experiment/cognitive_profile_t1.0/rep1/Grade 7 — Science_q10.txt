- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Neutralization is a core Grade 7 NCERT topic, though the specific wasp/bee distinction is often a rote-memorized application).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Qualitative identification of the process).
- **Common error traps:** Major (Students often swap the two: failing to remember that wasp stings are alkaline and bee stings are acidic. Additionally, many students struggle to translate the concept of "canceling out" into the formal term "Neutralization" in English).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall of the term and a brief explanation; no partial credit for a 1-mark item).
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative).
