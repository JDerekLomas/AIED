Computational complexity: 2-3
Common error traps: major (confusion between supplementary and vertically opposite angles; failure to recognize interior/exterior relationships)
Format demand: Open-ended (requires synthesis of geometric properties and algebraic isolation; no partial credit)
Number friendliness: easy
