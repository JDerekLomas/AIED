- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Describing nature and colors is a standard curriculum component in Grade 8, though "shades" may be a new vocabulary nuance).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Single-step retrieval and description).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may focus on only one color—just "orange"—instead of the required two; linguistic interference might cause students to use "sun" instead of "sky").
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall and sentence construction; the rubric is binary with no partial credit, which increases difficulty for students with low English syntax proficiency).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question).

**Holistic Estimate:**
The primary barrier for this demographic is the transition from Hindi to English. While the concept is simple, the requirement to produce a specific multi-color description in a second language without cues will lead to many partially correct but technically "wrong" answers according to the strict rubric.
