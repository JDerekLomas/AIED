- Concept familiarity: less familiar (While 'wind' is common, the specific synonym 'breeze' is often introduced as literary vocabulary rather than functional daily English for ESL learners in these contexts.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step identification task.)
- Common error traps: minor (Students may identify related words like 'cool', 'air', or 'blow' if they cannot pinpoint the exact noun; there is also the risk of spelling errors.)
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall/exact extraction; no partial credit allowed as per the rubric.
- Number friendliness: N/A (Non-mathematical item.)
