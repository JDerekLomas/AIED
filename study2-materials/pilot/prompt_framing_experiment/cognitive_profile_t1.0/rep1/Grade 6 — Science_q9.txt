- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Vitamins and minerals as 'protective foods' is a core, foundational concept introduced early in the NCERT Grade 6 Science curriculum and frequently repeated in classroom drills).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical; requires simple qualitative explanation and identification).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse specific vitamin/mineral pairs, e.g., attributing Scurvy to a mineral or Rickets to a vitamin without naming the specific one, but the general concept of "protection" is usually well-retained).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall and sentence construction in English. For Hindi-medium students, translating "fight against diseases" into coherent English presents a significant linguistic hurdle, even if the concept is understood).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Not applicable).

**Analysis:** While the concept is highly familiar and considered a "low-order thinking" recall task, the requirement to explain "why" in English poses a challenge for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. Many students will know the answer in their mother tongue but may struggle to articulate the functional definition required by the rubric or may provide incomplete lists for part (b).
