**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Unitary method is a core component of the Grade 6 and 7 curriculum in Indian state boards).
**Computational complexity:** 2-3 (Step 1: Division to find the unit rate; Step 2: Multiplication to find the total distance).
**Common error traps:** Minor (Some students may invert the division—5/55—leading to decimal confusion, or calculate only the unit rate/mileage and forget the second part of the question).
**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires recall and structured execution; no partial credit according to the rubric increases difficulty).
**Number friendliness:** Easy (55 and 5 are highly compatible; 11 and 12 are standard multiplication table facts).

**Linguistic/Contextual Note:** For Hindi-medium students, terms like "mileage" and "average" are common loanwords in daily life, but the dual-task nature of the question (finding distance *and* mileage) may lead to incomplete responses despite the simple math.
