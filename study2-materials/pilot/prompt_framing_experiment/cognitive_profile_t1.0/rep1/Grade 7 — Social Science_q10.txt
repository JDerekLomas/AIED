- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Ashoka is a central figure in the Grade 6/7 NCERT curriculum and general cultural knowledge).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative reasoning; no mathematical operations).
- Common error traps: Minor (Students may confuse Ashoka with other Mauryan rulers or struggle to distinguish between historical facts and legends/Dhamma principles).
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; no partial credit is available as per the 1-mark rubric, increasing difficulty for students with low English proficiency who may struggle to frame sentences despite knowing the facts.
- Number friendliness: Easy (Not applicable).
