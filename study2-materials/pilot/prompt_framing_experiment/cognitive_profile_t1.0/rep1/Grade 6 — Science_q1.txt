Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Magnetism is a highly tactile and demonstration-heavy topic in the NCERT Class 6 curriculum).

Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative observation, no calculation).

Common error traps: Minor (Students may confuse North/South polarity rules or fail to use the specific scientific term "repel," though the rubric allows for "push away").

Format demand: Open-ended/Recall. Partial credit is unlikely given the 1-mark binary nature, but the rubric is flexible regarding vocabulary.

Number friendliness: N/A (Non-numerical).

Language considerations: For Hindi-medium/EWS students, the concepts of "North" and "South" in English are generally standard, but the phrasing "brought near" might be a minor linguistic hurdle. However, the physical phenomenon is a core classroom activity.
