Concept familiarity: less familiar (This topic is historically abstract and typically introduced toward the end of middle school; students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often find European history terminologies more challenging than local history).
Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative analysis only).
Common error traps: major (Students frequently confuse "Nationalism in Europe" with the "Indian National Movement" or fail to distinguish between 19th-century movements and earlier periods like the Renaissance).
Format demand: Open-ended (Requires high-level retrieval and synthesis in a non-native language; the rubric requires identification plus explanation for a single mark, leaving little room for partial credit).
Number friendliness: easy (No numerical data required).
