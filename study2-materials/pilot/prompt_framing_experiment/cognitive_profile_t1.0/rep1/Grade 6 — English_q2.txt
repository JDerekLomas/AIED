- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Identifying characters is a core literacy skill; the concept of a magical fairy is universal in primary storytelling).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step retrieval from the text).
- Common error traps: Minor (Students may confuse the protagonist with the fairy or struggle with the spelling of 'magical').
- Format demand: Open-ended/Recall (Requires production of words rather than recognition; however, the rubric allows for a single word 'fairy', lowering the barrier for students with limited syntax).
- Number friendliness: N/A (Qualitative item).
