### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The National Emblem is introduced early in EVS (Environmental Studies) in primary grades and revisited in Grade 6 History (Ashoka, the Emperor Who Gave Up War). However, linking the visual on a banknote specifically to the "Lion Capital of Ashoka" requires transitioning from general recognition to formal nomenclature.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** This is a purely qualitative/conceptual recall task with no mathematical components.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** Students often confuse "National Emblem" with "National Animal" (Tiger). Many may provide a functional or literal answer (e.g., "to make the money look official" or "because lions are powerful") rather than the historical/symbolic citation required by the rubric.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** Open-ended questions in English are significantly challenging for this demographic. While the concept is simple, articulating "Lion Capital of Ashoka" and "National Emblem" in English requires high-stakes retrieval and sentence construction. There is no partial credit (0 or 1), making the demand binary and rigid.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.** No numerical manipulation is required.

### Holistic Analysis
While the image of the lion is ubiquitous, the rubric demands specific terminology ("Lion Capital of Ashoka" and "National Emblem"). For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the cognitive load of translating these specific historical terms into English, combined with the lack of partial credit for "it's our national symbol," will suppress the success rate.
