**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Familiar.** The distributive property is a core component of the Rational Numbers chapter in Class 8 (NCERT). However, while the property is frequently taught, students often default to calculating the two products separately rather than factoring out the common term unless explicitly prompted.
*   **Computational Complexity: 4+ steps.** To solve efficiently, students must: 1) Identify the common factor ($9/16$), 2) Set up the addition of fractions, 3) Find a common denominator for $12$ and $9$ (LCM of $36$), 4) Perform signed addition $(12 + (-12))$, and 5) Multiply by the common factor.
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.** For students from these backgrounds, the presence of a negative rational number $(-3/9)$ is a significant hurdle. Common bugs include errors in sign conventions during addition and the tendency to simplify fractions incorrectly before applying the property (e.g., simplifying $4/12$ to $1/3$ but failing to find a common denominator later).
*   **Format Demand: Open-ended (Recall).** The rubric requires the application of the property. For students with limited English proficiency, the phrase "distributive property" may not trigger the correct procedural schema even if they can perform basic arithmetic. Without partial credit, the lack of an exact final answer (which is 0) or the specific intermediate step makes it high-stakes.
*   **Number Friendliness: Moderate.** While $9/16$ looks intimidating, the internal terms $4/12$ and $-3/9$ both simplify to $1/3$ and $-1/3$, leading to a final result of zero. Students who notice this shortcut will find it easy; those who do not will struggle with the 144-common denominator or complex cross-multiplication.

**Estimate**
In government school contexts, while the result (zero) is a "friendly" number, the multi-step fractional arithmetic combined with the requirement to use a specific property typically results in a high attrition rate.
