- **Concept familiarity:** familiar (Reading comprehension focusing on character motivation is a standard Grade 8 competency, though "expressing feelings" is a more abstract concept than literal action).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Single-step retrieval and synthesis of textual information).
- **Common error traps:** minor (Students may provide a literal/surface-level answer—e.g., "She liked to draw"—without capturing the depth required by the rubric regarding "thoughts and feelings").
- **Format demand:** Open-ended requires recall; no partial credit is available for this 1-mark item, increasing the difficulty for students with limited English vocabulary to paraphrase accurately.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative item).

**Analysis:** For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the challenge lies in transitioning from "understanding the story" to "articulating abstract emotions in English." While they may comprehend that Anika loves drawing, expressing it as a "way of expressing thoughts" requires specific vocabulary (express, thoughts, feelings) that may be a barrier.
