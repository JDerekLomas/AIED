**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Familiar.** Temperature change and time calculations are standard Grade 6 curriculum (Integers/Measurement). However, for this demographic, the 12-hour clock transition (AM to PM) can sometimes be a point of confusion if not heavily practiced.
*   **Computational Complexity: 2-3 steps.** 
    1. Calculate elapsed time (10 AM to 4 PM = 6 hours).
    2. Calculate total temperature increase (6 hours × 2°C/hr = 12°C).
    3. Add increase to the initial temperature (30°C + 12°C = 42°C).
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.** There are two significant traps:
    1. **Time calculation:** Students often subtract numbers directly (10 - 4 = 6) by luck, but if they attempt to calculate the span across the meridian (12:00) without 24-hour conversion, errors are frequent.
    2. **Language/Context:** For Hindi-medium students, the transition from "morning" to "evening" must be clearly mapped to AM/PM logic.
*   **Format Demand:** Open-ended/Exact. Since the rubric requires a single maximum score of 1 based on a specific calculation, there is no room for partial credit. Failure at any of the three steps results in a score of 0.
*   **Number Friendliness: Easy.** The numbers (10, 30, 2, 4) are small, whole integers that are very easy to manipulate mentally once the procedure is identified.

**Estimated Success Proportion**
Given the linguistic barrier (word problem in English) and the multi-step logic required for students from economically weaker sections who may have gaps in foundational numeracy:
