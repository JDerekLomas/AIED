**Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. While Grade 7 students are taught "Parts of Speech," the distinction between a preposition and an adverb for the same word (like "around") is a high-level nuance. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often map English words to a single functional category in their native tongue.

**Computational complexity:** 1 (Single identification step).

**Common error traps:** Major. "Around" is most frequently taught as a preposition (e.g., "around the tree"). Without a following noun phrase (object), it functions here as an adverb of place/direction. Most students will reflexively label it a preposition due to rote memorization of word lists.

**Format demand:** Open-ended/Recall. There are no options provided (MCQ), requiring the student to recall the specific terminology "adverb" and spell it correctly. No partial credit is possible.

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Non-mathematical).

**Holistic Estimate:** The transition from identifying basic nouns/verbs to distinguishing adverbial vs. prepositional usage of spatial words is a significant hurdle for English Language Learners (ELLs) in this demographic. The lack of an object in the sentence is a subtle cue that most students at this level will overlook, leading them to the "preposition" trap.
