### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

**Concept familiarity: Familiar**
Algebraic identities and binomial multiplication are core components of the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum (Chapter: Algebraic Expressions and Identities). By the time of assessment, students have typically encountered this procedure, though retention depends heavily on the quality of drill-and-practice in their specific classroom.

**Computational complexity: 4+ steps**
The student must:
1. Distribute the first term: $3a \times (2a + 3b)$
2. Distribute the second term: $-2b \times (2a + 3b)$
3. Perform four individual monomial multiplications (handling coefficients and variables).
4. Identify and combine like terms ($+9ab$ and $-4ab$).

**Common error traps: Major**
For this specific demographic, two major "procedural bugs" are prevalent:
1. **Sign errors:** The $-2b$ in the first binomial is a high-risk factor. Students often fail to distribute the negative sign to the second term of the second binomial, resulting in $+6b^2$ instead of $-6b^2$.
2. **Variable handling:** Misunderstanding exponents ($a + a$ vs $a \times a$) or failing to combine the middle $ab$ terms correctly.

**Format demand: Open-ended**
The rubric requires a full expansion. Since the maximum score is 1 (binary marking), there is no "safety net" for a student who performs the distribution correctly but makes a minor calculation error. This significantly lowers the success rate compared to a multiple-choice format.

**Number friendliness: Easy**
The coefficients (2 and 3) are small integers, minimizing the cognitive load on arithmetic and allowing the student to focus on the algebraic process.

**Contextual Consideration:**
While the math is standard, the linguistic barrier (English medium instructions) can sometimes cause Hindi-medium students to hesitate on the phrasing "Find the product," though "binomial" is a standard technical term they likely recognize.
