**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Unitary method and multiplication are standard in Grade 7, though applying them to non-integers is the primary challenge).

**Computational complexity:** 2-3 (Conversion of the mixed fraction $5 \frac{3}{4}$ to an improper fraction $\frac{23}{4}$ or a decimal $5.75$, followed by multiplication).

**Common error traps:** Major (Students may struggle with the mixed fraction format, potentially ignoring the fraction part and answering "50," or incorrectly converting the mixed fraction to $15/4$ or $8/4$).

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires recall of the procedure; however, since the rubric only awards 1 mark for the correct operation/result, no partial credit is available for "showing work").

**Number friendliness:** Moderate (Multiplying by 10 is easy, but the presence of the mixed fraction $3/4$ introduces significant friction for students with lower baseline numeracy).

**Contextual Factors:** For students in Hindi-medium or economically weaker contexts, "word problems" often present a linguistic barrier. While the scenario (bus/diesel) is relatable, the transition from basic multiplication to fraction multiplication represents a significant hurdle in this demographic.
