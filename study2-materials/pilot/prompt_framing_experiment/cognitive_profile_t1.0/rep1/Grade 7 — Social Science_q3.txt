- Concept familiarity: familiar (The Preamble and Fundamental Rights are core pillars of the Grade 7 Civics curriculum in NCERT/State boards.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Non-mathematical; requires a single-step conceptual application.)
- Common error traps: minor (Students often confuse 'equality' with 'sameness' or may describe a generic 'good deed' rather than a constitutional right.)
- Format demand: Open-ended; however, the rubric is highly lenient (OR condition), allowing for partial conceptual mastery to earn full marks.
- Number friendliness: N/A (Non-numerical item.)

The lenient rubric is the primary driver for a high success rate here. By allowing students to earn the full point via *either* a definition *or* an example, the item bypasses the language barrier that often prevents Hindi-medium students from articulating complex constitutional definitions in English. Most students can recall a concrete example (like Mid-day meals or voting queues) even if their formal "bookish" explanation is weak.
