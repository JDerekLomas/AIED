Concept familiarity: familiar (Heat transfer is a core topic in Grade 7 Science, specifically the chapter "Heat".)
Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative identification only.)
Common error traps: minor (Students often confuse 'conduction' with 'convection' or 'radiation', or use the Hindi term 'Chalan' but struggle with the English spelling.)
Format demand: Open-ended (Requires recall of a specific scientific term; partial credit is unlikely for a 0.5 mark item.)
Number friendliness: easy (No calculations involved.)
