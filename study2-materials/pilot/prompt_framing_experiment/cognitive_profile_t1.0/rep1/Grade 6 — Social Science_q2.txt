- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. In the context of Rajasthan's state curriculum and local cultural history, names like Maharana Pratap and Prithviraj Chauhan are deeply embedded in both textbooks and folk narratives, making them highly accessible even to students with lower academic proficiency.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a simple retrieval task.
- **Common error traps:** Minor. The primary trap is "chronological confusion" (mixing Ancient or Modern figures with Medieval ones), but since the most famous figures in Rajasthan's history fall into the Medieval period, the risk of an incorrect era is low.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended recall. While English proficiency is limited, the rubric accepts proper nouns (names), which bypasses complex sentence construction. Partial credit is technically not possible given the 0.5 max score for naming two, but the familiarity of the names reduces the recall burden.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative).
