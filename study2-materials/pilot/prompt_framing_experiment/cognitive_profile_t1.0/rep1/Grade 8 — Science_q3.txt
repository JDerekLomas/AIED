- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Physical properties of metals is a foundational, highly emphasized topic in the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; single-step recall).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students frequently confuse "malleability" with "ductility").
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires exact recall of a specific technical term; no partial credit for a 1-mark item).
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative question).

**Psychometric Analysis for Target Demographic:**
While the concept is taught early, the term "Malleability" is linguistically challenging for Hindi-medium students. In Hindi, the term is *Aaghatvardhaniyata* (आघातवर्धनीयता). While the students understand the real-world application (foil), the English spelling and phonetics of "Malleability" present a significant barrier. Students often remember the concept but fail to recall the exact English terminology required for a "correct" score in an English-medium assessment.
