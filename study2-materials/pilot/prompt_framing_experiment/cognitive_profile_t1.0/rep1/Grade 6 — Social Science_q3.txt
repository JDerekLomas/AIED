- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Gangaur is a major cultural touchstone in Rajasthan and is included in State Board textbooks; however, "Dhinga Gavar" is more regional).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Single-step identification and description).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students might confuse Gangaur with Teej due to similar rituals involving Goddess Parvati).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires visual recognition + written recall; the 0.5 max score suggests a low-stakes identification, but "describe how people celebrate" adds significant linguistic demand for ESL/Hindi-medium learners).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question).

**Holistic Analysis:** While the cultural content is highly relevant, the requirement to *describe* the celebration in English (the medium of the test) poses a significant barrier for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. Many will identify the festival but struggle to articulate the description accurately in English, though they would likely succeed in Hindi.
