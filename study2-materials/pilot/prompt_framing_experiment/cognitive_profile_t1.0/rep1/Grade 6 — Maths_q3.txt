**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** Very familiar. Comparing and ordering numbers up to four digits is a core component of the Grade 5 curriculum and is revisited at the start of Grade 6 (Number Systems).
*   **Computational Complexity:** 1 step. The task requires a single logical comparison of magnitude (place value analysis) rather than multi-step arithmetic operations.
*   **Common Error Traps:** Minor. The primary trap is the inclusion of a 3-digit number (736) among 4-digit numbers. While some students may focus only on the leading digits (3, 5, 7, 4) and place 736 last because it starts with '7', this is a well-covered misconception in Indian primary pedagogy.
*   **Format Demand:** Partial credit possible (per rubric). The rubric specifically rewards identifying the smallest number, which reduces the "all-or-nothing" pressure of the task. However, the 0.5 max score suggests a low-stakes, high-accuracy expectation.
*   **Number Friendliness:** Moderate. The numbers are not "round" (ending in 0 or 5), but they are distinct enough that students do not have to compare beyond the thousands or hundreds place to determine the order.
*   **Contextual Factor (EWS/Hindi-Medium):** The term "ascending order" (आरोही क्रम - Aarohi Kram) is a high-frequency vocabulary term in both English and Hindi medium math classes. The lack of word-problem framing reduces the linguistic barrier significantly.
