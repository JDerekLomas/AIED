**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The Battle of Plassey is a cornerstone of the Grade 8 NCERT History curriculum ("From Trade to Territory"). Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often recognize the term "Plassey ka Yuddh," though they may struggle to articulate the nuanced political consequences in English.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** This is a non-computational, qualitative historical analysis task.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students often confuse the Battle of Plassey (1757) with the Battle of Buxar (1764). Many tend to provide descriptive narrative details (who fought whom) rather than the analytical "contribution to expansion" (political dominance/puppet rulers) required by the rubric.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** Open-ended recall is significantly harder for English Language Learners (ELL). While the rubric allows for various ways to explain political control, the lack of partial credit (Maximum score: 1) means students who provide only factual dates or names without the "expansion" logic receive zero.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The date 1757 is provided in the prompt, reducing the cognitive load of chronological recall.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the linguistic barrier for students from economically weaker sections in Hindi-medium transitions, many will identify the event but fail to construct a grammatically or conceptually coherent explanation of "political dominance" in English.
