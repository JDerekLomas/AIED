**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (This is a core topic in the NCERT Class 8 Science textbook under 'Combustion and Flame'.)

**Computational complexity:** 1 (No mathematical calculation required; purely conceptual/recall-based.)

**Common error traps:** Major (Students often confuse 'luminous' vs 'non-luminous' zones. Many incorrectly assume the yellow/luminous zone is hotter because it is more visible, or they may correctly identify the zone but fail to provide the scientific reason—complete combustion and highest temperature.)

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires both identification and justification. Since the rubric is binary (1 mark), failure to provide the 'reason' usually results in zero marks in typical state/government evaluation patterns.)

**Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question, no numbers involved.)

**Linguistic/Contextual Analysis:** For Hindi-medium students, translating terms like "outermost zone" or "non-luminous" into English while explaining the reason (oxidation/complete combustion) poses a significant expressive barrier, even if the concept is understood.
