**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Properties of parallelograms (opposite angles are equal, adjacent angles are supplementary) are core components of the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum. However, the application often depends on whether the student identifies which property to use first.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** To find both $x$ and $y$, the student must perform two distinct logical steps: applying the supplementary angle rule ($180 - 70$) and the opposite angle rule (or repeating the supplementary rule). 
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds often struggle with "Format Demand" when an **explanation** is required in English. Common procedural bugs include assuming all angles in a quadrilateral are $90^{\circ}$ or confusing the properties of a parallelogram with those of a trapezoid.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** The rubric requires not just the value (110) but an "explanation." For students with limited English proficiency, articulating "adjacent angles are supplementary" or "linear pair" in a second language is a significant barrier, even if the mathematical intuition is correct. The "Maximum score: 1" suggests an all-or-nothing demand with no partial credit for just the number.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** Working with $180$ and $70$ is mentally straightforward and involves "round" numbers, minimizing calculation errors.

**Holistic Estimate**
While the math is accessible, the requirement for a written explanation in a second language, combined with the all-or-nothing rubric, will significantly depress the success rate for this specific demographic.
