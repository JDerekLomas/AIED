- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (This is a core topic in the Chapter "Crop Production and Management," and these crops are central to the Indian agrarian context/diet).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Single-step categorical classification).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Potential confusion between the sowing season and harvesting season, or mixing up the terms 'Kharif' and 'Rabi' despite knowing the crops).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended recall; requires exact classification.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative task).

**Psychometric Analysis:** 
For Grade 8 students in Indian government schools, "Wheat" (Gehu) and "Paddy" (Dhan) are culturally and academically ubiquitous. While English proficiency is a barrier for many, the terms "Kharif" and "Rabi" are used in both Hindi and English instruction. Given that the rubric only asks for the classification of Wheat (0.5 marks), the cognitive load is very low. Most students associate Wheat with the "winter" cycle due to its prominence in the textbook and local agricultural cycles.
