- Concept familiarity: very familiar (S-V-O structure is foundational for Grade 6, though "is reading" introduces tense complexity)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Linear sequencing of five units)
- Common error traps: minor (Students may struggle with the placement of the article 'a' or capitalize the wrong word, though 'He' is the likely starting point)
- Format demand: Open-ended (Requires recall of syntax rules; no partial credit based on rubric)
- Number friendliness: N/A (Verbal task)
