- Concept familiarity: familiar (The story "Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy is a standard text in the NCERT Grade 7 curriculum.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step retrieval and synthesis of information from the text.)
- Common error traps: major (Students often struggle with the grammatical inversion in "Why the king felt..." vs "Why did the king feel..." and may struggle to articulate the "if-then" logical causality required by the prompt.)
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; although the rubric says "Any valid reason," the requirement for 2-3 sentences in English is a high barrier for Hindi-medium students with limited proficiency. Partial credit is not possible for a 1-mark item.
- Number friendliness: N/A (Language-based item)
