- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Local geography and livelihoods are core components of the Grade 7 SCERT/NCERT curriculum; rural life is also part of students' lived reality).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical; requires simple retrieval and descriptive mapping).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students might confuse "rural" with "urban" or list modern service sector jobs found in cities, but most will naturally associate Rajasthan with farming/cattle).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires recall and basic sentence construction; the rubric is strict as a binary "Maximum score: 1", meaning no partial credit for just naming one occupation).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A).
