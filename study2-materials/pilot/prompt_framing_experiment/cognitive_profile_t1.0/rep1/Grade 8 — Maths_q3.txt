### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Basic probability (favorable outcomes over total outcomes) is a standard component of the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum. However, for students from economically weaker sections, the conceptual "randomness" is often taught through rote formulas rather than intuitive play.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** 
    1. Addition (4 + 6 = 10) to find the sample space.
    2. Fractional setup (4/10).
    3. Simplification (2/5), which is often required in Indian marking schemes even if not explicitly stated.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** The most frequent error for this demographic is the "Ratio Trap," where students express the probability as a ratio of the two parts (4/6) instead of part-to-whole (4/10). Language barriers may also lead students to confuse "black" with "white" if they misread the prompt.
*   **Format Demand:** **High (Open-ended).** This requires recall of the formula $P(E) = \frac{n(E)}{n(S)}$. Since the rubric implies an exact answer is needed for the 1-mark score, there is no cushion for calculation errors or failing to simplify the fraction.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The numbers sum to 10, making division and decimal conversion straightforward.

### Holistic Estimate
While the math is simple, the transition from Hindi-medium contexts to English-medium word problems often causes a "comprehension gap." Students frequently calculate the ratio of the two colors rather than the probability.
