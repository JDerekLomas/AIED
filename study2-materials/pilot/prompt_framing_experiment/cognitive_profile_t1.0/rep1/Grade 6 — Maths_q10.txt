**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** In the Indian Grade 6 NCERT curriculum (Chapter: Understanding Elementary Shapes and Practical Geometry), using a protractor is a core competency. However, for students from economically weaker backgrounds, consistent access to their own geometry box (instrument box) can sometimes be a limiting factor in practice.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** There are no arithmetic calculations required. It is a purely procedural, motor-skill task involving measurement and alignment.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** This is the primary hurdle. Students frequently struggle with the **inner vs. outer scale** of the protractor. For 110° (an obtuse angle), many students mistakenly mark 70° because they read the wrong scale or do not yet have a strong "sense" of what an obtuse angle should look like.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended/Exact.** The rubric is binary (0 or 1). There is no partial credit for a "near miss" or for drawing just one of the two requested angles (though the rubric specifically mentions 110°). The student must demonstrate precise motor coordination and correct scale selection.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Moderate.** 40° is a standard acute angle, but 110° is the "trap" number. Because it is greater than 90°, it tests whether the student understands the direction of the scale relative to the vertex.

**Estimation**
While the task is a standard curriculum requirement, the lack of partial credit combined with the high frequency of "scale reversal" errors (reading 70 instead of 110) among students with limited individual practice suggests a significant failure rate.
