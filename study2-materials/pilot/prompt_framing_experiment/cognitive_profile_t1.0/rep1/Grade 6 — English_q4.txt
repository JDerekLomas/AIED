- Concept familiarity: less familiar (Synonym identification in a second language is a high-order skill for Hindi-medium learners; "glowing" is less common than "shining" in basic vocabulary).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step identification).
- Common error traps: minor (Students often struggle with "parts of speech" matching or may copy the entire sentence instead of a single word).
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall/scanning; exact answer required; no partial credit.
- Number friendliness: N/A
