- Concept familiarity: **Familiar**. Pasteurization is a core topic in the Grade 8 Science chapter "Microorganisms: Friend and Foe." It is a standard concept found in NCERT and state board textbooks.
- Computational complexity: **1**. There are no calculations required, though there are specific numerical parameters (temperature/time) associated with the process.
- Common error traps: **Minor**. The primary trap is confusing pasteurization with boiling or general sterilization. Students may also struggle to articulate the "sudden cooling" aspect, which is critical to the process.
- Format demand: **High**. This is an open-ended "Describe and Explain" task. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the linguistic burden of constructing two distinct parts (process + purpose) in English is significant. Recalling the sequence of "heat then quick cool" is harder than recognizing it in a multiple-choice format.
- Number friendliness: **Easy**. The numbers involved (70°C, 15-30 seconds) are round and easy to remember, though the rubric does not strictly require them.

Holistic Estimate: While the concept is well-taught, the requirement to write a descriptive response in English poses a substantial barrier for this specific demographic. Students often understand the "why" (to kill germs) but struggle to describe the "how" (the specific sequence of heating and rapid cooling) with enough precision to meet the rubric.
