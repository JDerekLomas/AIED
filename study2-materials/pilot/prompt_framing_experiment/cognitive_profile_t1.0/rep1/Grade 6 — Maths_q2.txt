**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. Place value is a foundational topic introduced in primary grades (Classes 3-5) and revisited in Class 6 (Knowing Our Numbers).
*   **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a single-step identification task requiring no calculation, only retrieval of place-value positioning.
*   **Common error traps:** Minor. Students may confuse "place value" (500) with "face value" (5) or miscount the zero placeholders (identifying it as 50 instead of 500). However, the digit 5 is in a distinct position.
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended. While recall is required, the rubric is generous, accepting both the numerical value (500) and the positional name (Hundreds), which accommodates different linguistic teaching styles.
*   **Number friendliness:** Easy. The number 7560 is a standard four-digit integer with no internal zeros to cause positional confusion.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given that this is a core competency and the rubric allows for both linguistic and numerical answers, most students—even those with limited English proficiency—recognize the term "place value" as it is a standard loanword or heavily drilled in bilingual classrooms.
