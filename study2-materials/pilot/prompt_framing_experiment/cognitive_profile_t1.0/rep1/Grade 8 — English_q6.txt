**Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The "fable" is a standard component of the Grade 8 NCERT English curriculum (e.g., "The Ant and the Cricket"). However, while students recognize fables, the formal definition is often memorized as a rote string of words.

**Computational complexity:** Not applicable (0).

**Common error traps:** Minor. The primary trap is a "partial definition" where students identify that it involves animals but fail to mention the "moral lesson," or vice versa. Some may confuse it with a "folk tale" or "fairy tale."

**Format demand:** High. This is an open-ended recall task. Since the rubric requires two distinct components (animal characters + moral lesson) for 1 mark, students with limited English proficiency often struggle to construct a grammatically correct sentence in English even if they understand the concept in Hindi (Katha/Naitik Kahani). No partial credit is available per the rubric.

**Number friendliness:** Not applicable.

**Contextual Analysis:** For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds and economically weaker sections, the barrier is linguistic encoding. They may know a fable is a "story with a lesson," but articulating the full definition as per the rubric requires a level of English vocabulary (e.g., "imparts," "characters") that is often above their functional expressive level.
