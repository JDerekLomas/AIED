**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Evaporation and state changes are introduced in Grade 6 and reinforced in Grade 7; however, the concept of "impurities" slowing evaporation is often a higher-order application for this demographic).

**Computational complexity:** 1 (Requires simple comparison of values in a table; no calculations are needed for part A).

**Common error traps:** Major (Students often confuse "fastest" with the "largest number" in the time column. In Indian government school contexts, the inverse relationship between speed and time is a frequent cognitive hurdle).

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires both data interpretation and a causal explanation in English. While identifying Liquid A is simple, explaining the effect of solutes in Liquid C requires specific vocabulary that Hindi-medium learners may struggle to articulate).

**Number friendliness:** Easy (Comparing whole numbers or simple time durations).

**Holistic Estimate:** While most students will likely identify Liquid A correctly, the second part of the question requires a scientific explanation of why a solution evaporates slower than a pure solvent. For students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency, articulating "non-volatile solutes" or "surface area obstruction" in English poses a significant barrier, even if the conceptual intuition is present.
