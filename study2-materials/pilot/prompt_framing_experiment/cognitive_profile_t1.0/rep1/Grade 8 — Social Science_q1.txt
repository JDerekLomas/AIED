**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. Fundamental Rights are a core pillar of the Grade 8 Civics curriculum (NCERT) and are frequently reinforced through school assemblies, textbooks, and wall paintings in government schools.

**Computational complexity:** 1. This is a purely retrieval-based task requiring no mathematical processing.

**Common error traps:** Minor. The primary trap is "category confusion," where students might list duties (Fundamental Duties) or general human rights (e.g., "Right to Food") instead of specific Constitutional Rights. However, the most common rights (Equality, Liberty, Education) are deeply ingrained.

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). While recall is harder than recognition (MCQ), the rubric is generous, allowing for simplified phrasing. This significantly lowers the barrier for Hindi-medium students who may know the concept but struggle with formal English terminology (e.g., writing "Equality" instead of "Right to Equality").

**Number friendliness:** Easy. Recalling only two items from a list of six is a low cognitive load.
