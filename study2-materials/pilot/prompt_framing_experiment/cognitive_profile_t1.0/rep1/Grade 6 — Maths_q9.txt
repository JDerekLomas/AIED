### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
In the Grade 6 NCERT/State curriculum, the "Angle Sum Property of a Triangle" is a core competency. However, for students from economically weaker sections, the transition from recognizing a triangle to applying an abstract algebraic property (Sum = 180°) is often a significant leap. While the topic is "familiar" by the syllabus, internalizing the constant sum is a mid-year milestone.

**Computational Complexity: 2-3 steps**
The student must:
1. Identify the two given angles.
2. Sum them (e.g., $A + B$).
3. Subtract that sum from 180.
This requires multi-step operational logic beyond simple recall.

**Common Error Traps: Major**
Students in this demographic often face "procedural bugs" such as:
*   **Additive errors:** Miscalculating the sum of the two known angles.
*   **Subtraction errors:** Regrouping/borrowing errors when subtracting from 180 (a common struggle for students with weak foundational arithmetic).
*   **Property confusion:** Confusing the internal sum (180°) with a right angle (90°) or a full rotation (360°).

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
As an open-ended question, there is no "recognition" cue (as in Multiple Choice). The student must recall the 180° constant from memory. Since the rubric only awards 0.5 marks for the final answer, there is no room for error; a single arithmetic slip results in zero credit.

**Number Friendliness: Easy to Moderate**
Assuming standard textbook values (e.g., 60°, 40°), the numbers are usually multiples of 10. However, if the values require carrying or borrowing (e.g., 180 - 125), the difficulty spikes for students with limited primary-grade fluency.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the language barrier (understanding "Find the angle" in English) and the high reliance on accurate multi-step subtraction, many students will understand the *concept* but fail the *execution*.
