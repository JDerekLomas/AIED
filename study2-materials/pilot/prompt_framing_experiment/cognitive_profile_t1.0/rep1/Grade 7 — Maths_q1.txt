Concept familiarity: familiar (Integers are introduced in Grade 6 and reinforced in Grade 7).
Computational complexity: 1 (Single operation).
Common error traps: major (The "negative times negative" rule is frequently confused with addition rules, e.g., result remains negative, or confusion with -3 - 4).
Format demand: Open-ended (Recall of the sign rule is required; no partial credit for a wrong sign).
Number friendliness: easy (Basic multiplication table of 3 and 4).
