Concept familiarity: **Familiar** (Fractions and the "of" operator as multiplication are standard Grade 6/7 NCERT curriculum components).
Computational complexity: **4+ steps** (1. Translate "of" to multiply; 2. Multiply first pair; 3. Multiply second pair; 4. Find a common denominator to compare; 5. Final comparison).
Common error traps: **Major** (Students may add instead of multiply; cross-multiply incorrectly; or stop after finding 3/8 and 4/15 without performing the final comparison).
Format demand: **High** (Open-ended "Show your calculations" requires a constructed response rather than recognition; no partial credit is offered in the 1-point rubric).
Number friendliness: **Moderate** (The resulting denominators, 8 and 15, have a least common multiple of 120, which is high for mental calculation for students struggling with basic numeracy).

Holistic Estimate: The language barrier (translating "Which is greater" and "of") combined with the multi-step requirement to find a common denominator for comparison makes this a high-difficulty item for this specific demographic.
