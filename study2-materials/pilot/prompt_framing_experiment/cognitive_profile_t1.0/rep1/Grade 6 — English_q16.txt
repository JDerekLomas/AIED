- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Seasons are a core part of the primary environmental studies and early English curriculum in India).
- Computational complexity: 1 (The task involves a single primary output: identification/naming).
- Common error traps: Minor (Students may confuse "weather" with "season" or struggle with spelling, but the concept is clear).
- Format demand: Open-ended (Recall). While the prompt asks for a paragraph, the rubric specifically awards the mark for simply naming the season. This discrepancy between prompt length and rubric weight significantly lowers the difficulty for obtaining the mark.
- Number friendliness: Easy (Not applicable).
