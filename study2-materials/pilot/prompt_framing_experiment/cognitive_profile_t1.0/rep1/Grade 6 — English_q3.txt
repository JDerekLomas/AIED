**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Reading comprehension is a core skill; "evening" and "love to do" are basic vocabulary)
**Computational complexity:** N/A (Language task)
**Common error traps:** Minor (Potential tense errors like "Riya love to read" or mixing up "evening" with other times of day mentioned in a passage)
**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires recall and sentence construction, but the rubric allows for flexible, short phrases)
**Number friendliness:** N/A

**Analysis:** For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the primary hurdle is decoding the question and retrieving the specific detail from the text. While "read books" is a high-frequency phrase, constructing a grammatically perfect response in English is difficult. However, since the rubric accepts "read books" or "reading," the barrier for a "correct" score is significantly lowered.
