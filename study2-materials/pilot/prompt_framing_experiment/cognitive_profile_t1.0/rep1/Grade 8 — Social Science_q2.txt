- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. The Harappan Civilization is a foundational topic in the Class 6 and Class 8 NCERT history curriculum, often emphasized through visual aids in textbooks.
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (None). This is a qualitative recall task.
- **Common error traps:** Minor. Students may confuse specific features with later Vedic periods or struggle to articulate the "why" behind a feature, but the core descriptors (drainage, bricks) are robust in memory.
- **Format demand:** High. Open-ended recall in English is a significant barrier for Hindi-medium students. While the concept is simple, translating "Nali" to "Drainage" or "Paki eent" to "Baked bricks" requires active vocabulary retrieval. No partial credit is available (0 or 1).
- **Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Holistic Estimate:** While the concept is one of the most well-known in the social science syllabus, the requirement to construct a descriptive sentence in English will be the primary filter for students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds. Many will know the answer but may struggle to express it accurately enough to meet the rubric in an English-medium assessment.
