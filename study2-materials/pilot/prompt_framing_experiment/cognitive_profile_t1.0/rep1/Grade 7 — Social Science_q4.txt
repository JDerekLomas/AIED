**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Less familiar.** While "transparency" (paradarshita) is a key pillar of civics, it is an abstract systemic concept. For Grade 7 students, especially those from economically weaker sections, governance is often experienced as a series of bureaucratic interactions rather than an architectural concept. Distinguishing between "honesty" and "transparency" requires high-order conceptual clarity.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** This is a non-computational, qualitative item.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students often conflate "transparency" with general "good behavior" or "reducing corruption." Common traps include providing moralistic answers (e.g., "officials should be good people") rather than systemic suggestions (e.g., "Right to Information" or "digitization of records"). The language barrier further complicates the ability to articulate specific policy mechanisms in English.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** This requires pure recall and synthesis. There is no recognition (multiple choice) to guide the student. While the rubric is lenient (only one way required), the student must bridge the gap between a vernacular understanding of fairness and the English technical term "transparency."
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.**

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given the abstract nature of the term "transparency" and the linguistic challenge for Hindi-medium students to articulate systemic solutions in English, a significant portion of students will likely provide vague or irrelevant answers despite the lenient rubric.
