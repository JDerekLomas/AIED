Concept familiarity: less familiar (The abstract role of money in macro-economic development is often theoretical for Grade 7, and "digital money" may be a new curricular addition for students with limited device access.)

Computational complexity: 1 (No direct calculation required, though requires logical sequencing.)

Common error traps: major (Students often confuse "money" with "wealth" or "income" and struggle to distinguish between the medium of exchange and economic growth. Translating "economic development" into Hindi-medium conceptual frameworks adds linguistic interference.)

Format demand: Open-ended (Requires high-level generative synthesis—"Analyze" and "Evaluate"—rather than simple recall. No partial credit available for the 1-mark maximum score.)

Number friendliness: easy (Qualitative question.)
