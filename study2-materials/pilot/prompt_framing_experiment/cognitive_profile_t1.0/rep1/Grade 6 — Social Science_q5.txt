**Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The Vedic period is a core component of the Grade 6 History curriculum (NCERT), but students from economically weaker sections often struggle to distinguish between the Early Vedic (pastoral) and Later Vedic (agrarian) transitions, leading to some conceptual blurring.

**Computational complexity:** 1. This is a purely qualitative recall and descriptive task.

**Common error traps:** Minor. A frequent trap is the chronological confusion between the nomadic nature of early Aryans versus the settled agriculture of the later period. Language interference is also a factor; students may know the concept in Hindi (Pashupalan/Krishi) but struggle to retrieve the specific English terminology.

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This is a high-demand format for English Language Learners (ELL). While the rubric is binary (0 or 1), the requirement to "describe one key aspect" adds a linguistic burden beyond simple identification, which often leads to incomplete answers among students with limited English proficiency.

**Number friendliness:** Easy. No numerical calculation is required.

**Holistic Estimate:** While the subject matter is standard, the open-ended nature of the question combined with the requirement for a descriptive sentence creates a significant barrier for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. Many will correctly identify the occupation but fail to provide a "key aspect" in coherent English, thus failing the rubric for the full point.
