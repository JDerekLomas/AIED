**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar.** Antonyms (opposite words) are a core component of the ESL/English curriculum from the primary level. "Slow/Fast" is one of the most basic pairings taught in early English acquisition.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **Not applicable (1).** This is a direct retrieval task requiring a single linguistic association.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** The primary trap is a spelling error (e.g., "fastly" or "pust") or a language interference issue where the student knows the concept in Hindi (*tej*) but cannot recall the English word. However, "fast" is a high-frequency loanword often used even in vernacular speech.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** This requires active recall rather than recognition (as in multiple-choice). While the rubric is strict (exact answer), the brevity of the word "fast" minimizes the margin for error.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** Not applicable in a mathematical sense, but linguistically, both words are CVC (Consonant-Vowel-Consonant) or simple blends, making them phonetically accessible to Hindi-medium learners.

**Holistic Estimate**
While these students face significant socio-economic and linguistic barriers, "Slow/Fast" is a high-frequency functional pair reinforced through sports, rhymes, and daily instructions. In a Grade 6 context, even with limited proficiency, this represents foundational knowledge.
