**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Fungal growth on bread is a staple observational experiment in Class 8 NCERT Science, Chapter 2: "Microorganisms: Friend and Foe").

**Computational complexity:** 1 (No calculations required; direct conceptual identification).

**Common error traps:** Minor (Some students may attribute it generally to "dirt," "moisture," or "becoming old" without identifying the biological agent; others may confuse "fungi" with "bacteria").

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires recall of specific vocabulary. While the concept is intuitive, the linguistic barrier for Hindi-medium students to provide the English term "Fungi" or "Mould" increases difficulty).

**Number friendliness:** Easy (Not applicable).

**Holistic Estimate:** This is a high-recall item based on a common real-life observation and a core curriculum topic. However, the requirement to produce the specific term (rather than select from options) and the English proficiency barrier for this demographic will lead to some loss of marks for imprecise terminology.
