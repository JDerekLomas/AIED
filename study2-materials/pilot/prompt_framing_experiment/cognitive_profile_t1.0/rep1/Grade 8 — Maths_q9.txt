### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
Profit, Loss, and Discount is a core chapter in the Grade 8 NCERT syllabus. Students from economically weaker backgrounds often have high "street familiarity" with the concepts of discount and profit; however, the formal mathematical relationship between Marked Price (MP), Selling Price (SP), and Cost Price (CP) is often a source of academic confusion.

**Computational Complexity: 4+ steps**
The item requires a multi-stage procedural workflow:
1. Calculate the discount amount ($1200 \times 0.10$).
2. Calculate the Selling Price ($1200 - 120$).
3. Relate SP to CP using the profit percentage formula ($CP \times 1.08 = 1080$).
4. Solve for CP ($1080 \div 1.08$).

**Common Error Traps: Major**
There are two significant pitfalls for this demographic:
1. **The "Add-on" Error:** Students may mistakenly apply the 8% profit to the Marked Price rather than the Cost Price.
2. **Language Barrier:** In Hindi-medium contexts, the distinction between "Marked Price" (Ankit Mulya) and "Cost Price" (Kray Mulya) can be linguistically dense when presented in an English-medium assessment.

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
As per the rubric, this is a binary (0/1) score. Since no partial credit is awarded for the intermediate step (finding the SP of ₹1080), students who falter at the final algebraic division lose the entire mark.

**Number Friendliness: Moderate**
The numbers are chosen to be relatively clean ($1200$ and $1080$ are multiples of $12$ and $9$), and $1080/1.08$ results in a round integer ($1000$). This mitigates some calculator-dependency issues, though long division remains a hurdle.

**Holistic Estimate**
While the concepts are standard, the requirement to bridge two different percentage bases (MP and CP) without partial credit in an English-medium format presents a significant challenge for this specific cohort.
