**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity (Familiar):** Ratio and age-related word problems are core components of the Grade 8 curriculum in India (NCERT/State Boards). However, the "constancy of age difference" is a conceptual hurdle that often separates rote learners from conceptual learners.
*   **Computational Complexity (2-3 steps):** 
    1. Calculate father's current age ($12 \times 3 = 36$).
    2. Subtract to find the current difference ($36 - 12 = 24$).
    *Optional/Trap steps:* Adding 5 years to both ages ($17$ and $41$) and then subtracting.
*   **Common Error Traps (Major):** This item contains a significant "distractor" ($5$ years). Students with limited English proficiency often rely on **keyword modeling**. They may see "thrice" and "5 years" and attempt to incorporate the 5 into a calculation unnecessarily (e.g., adding 5 to the father's age but forgetting the son's, or incorrectly assuming the "thrice" ratio stays constant).
*   **Format Demand (Open-ended):** Requires exact recall and calculation. Since the rubric specifies a maximum score of 1 based on the calculation, there is no buffer for partial credit for students who understand the concept but make a minor arithmetic slip.
*   **Number Friendliness (Easy):** The numbers (12, 3, 36, 5) are small and well within the mental math capabilities of an average Grade 8 student. The difficulty is purely linguistic and conceptual, not arithmetic.

**Analysis for Target Demographic:**
Students from economically weaker sections in Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the English phrasing of "thrice" and "age difference between them after X years." While the math is simple, the linguistic decoding required to realize that the 5-year jump is irrelevant to the *difference* is a high-order thinking task for this cohort. Many will likely provide the father's future age (41) or a mismatched difference.
