### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

**Concept familiarity: Very familiar**
Linear equations in one variable are a core component of the Grade 7 and 8 NCERT curriculum. By Grade 8, students have been exposed to the "transposition method" multiple times.

**Computational complexity: 1 step**
The item requires a single inverse operation: subtracting 9 from 4.

**Common error traps: Major**
For this specific demographic, the "negative integer" result is a significant hurdle. Students frequently struggle with the rule of signs when the subtrahend is larger than the minuend ($4 - 9$). Common incorrect answers include $5$ (ignoring the sign) or $13$ (misapplying the transposition as addition).

**Format demand: Open-ended**
As a 1-mark question requiring an exact answer, there is no buffer for "near-misses." The student must independently recall the procedure and the integer subtraction rule without the recognition cues provided by multiple-choice options.

**Number friendliness: Easy**
The digits (9, 4) are single-digit integers, minimizing cognitive load on multiplication/division and allowing the student to focus entirely on the algebraic process.

### Holistic Estimate
While the algebra is "Level 1," the conceptual mastery of negative integers remains a bottleneck in Indian government school contexts. Many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may grasp the "shifting" of the number but fail the final calculation due to inconsistent foundational training in integer arithmetic from earlier grades.
