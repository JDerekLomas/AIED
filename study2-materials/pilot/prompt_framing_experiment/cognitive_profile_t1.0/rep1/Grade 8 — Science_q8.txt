- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Agricultural practices are core to the Grade 8 Science NCERT curriculum, and many students from economically weaker sections in India have direct or ancestral links to farming).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; conceptual recall only).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may define weeds simply as "bad plants" without specifying that they grow "along with the crop" or compete for resources, which is the scientific nuance required for full marks).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall and sentence construction in English. For Hindi-medium students, the transition to English terminology like "compete for nutrients" can be a barrier to a "fully correct" response even if the concept is understood).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question).

**Holistic Estimate:** While the concept is highly relatable, the requirement for a dual-part answer (definition + importance) in English often leads to partial responses or grammatical fragmentation among this specific demographic.
