- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Capitalization of proper nouns and sentence beginnings is a core Grade 3-5 competency, but often inconsistently applied by Grade 6 in ESL contexts.)
- **Computational complexity:** N/A (Language task)
- **Common error traps:** Major (The sentence contains four distinct capitalization requirements: start of sentence, two proper nouns [Riya, Meena], and a day of the week [Sunday]. Students often miss "Sunday" or the second name "Meena.")
- **Format demand:** Open-ended/Exact (Requires recall and simultaneous application of multiple rules; no partial credit allowed per rubric.)
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Language task)

**Holistic Estimate:** While the vocabulary is simple, the requirement for 100% accuracy across four different capitalization points is a high hurdle for students with limited English proficiency. Many will correct the start of the sentence and the first name but miss "Meena" or "Sunday."
