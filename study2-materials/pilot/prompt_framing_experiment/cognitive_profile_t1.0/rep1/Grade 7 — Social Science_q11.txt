- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Public vs. Private healthcare is a core chapter in Class 7 NCERT Social and Political Life, often discussed through the 'Story of Hakim Sheik' or 'Cost of a Cure').
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No arithmetic required).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse "healthcare" with general hygiene or focus only on the cost aspect without addressing the "service" or "quality" dimension).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (High demand). Requiring an "evaluation" and an "argument/example" in English is a significant hurdle for Hindi-medium students with limited proficiency. Recalling specific terminology (e.g., "infrastructure," "subsidized") is difficult even if the concept is understood.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question).

**Holistic Assessment:** While the concept is relatable to their lived experiences, the linguistic demand of "evaluating" and providing "valid arguments" in English, combined with a strict 1-mark rubric that allows no partial credit for a single feature, makes this a high-difficulty item for this specific demographic.
