- Concept familiarity: **less familiar** (For ESL students in this demographic, literary analysis terms like "writing style" are abstract concepts often introduced but rarely mastered at Grade 7. Students often confuse "style" with the "content" or "theme" of the poem.)
- Computational complexity: **1** (Non-mathematical task)
- Common error traps: **major** (Language barrier is the primary trap. Students may understand the poem but lack the specific English vocabulary—e.g., "informal," "descriptive"—to name the style. They are likely to provide a one-word summary of the plot instead of a stylistic descriptor.)
- Format demand: **Open-ended; no partial credit.** (Requires active recall of specific adjectives rather than recognition from a list. The rubric is binary (0 or 1), making it high-stakes for a subjective interpretation.)
- Number friendliness: **easy** (N/A)

Holistic Estimate: The intersection of limited English proficiency and the abstract nature of "writing style" makes this a high-difficulty item for this specific cohort. Most students will likely respond with a word related to the poem's topic (e.g., "nature," "sad") rather than its stylistic delivery.
