**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** HCF and LCM are core components of the Grade 6 NCERT curriculum. However, the application of HCF to real-world "measurement" problems is often less practiced than pure procedural calculation.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** Students must (1) interpret the word problem to identify the HCF operation, (2) perform prime factorization or division for 75 and 69, and (3) identify the common factor.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** The most significant trap for this demographic is the language barrier; "maximum value" is a linguistic cue for HCF, but students with limited English proficiency often confuse "maximum/largest" with LCM or simply add/subtract the two values. Additionally, 69 is frequently mistaken for a prime number by students at this level.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** Requires full recall of the HCF algorithm. While the rubric mentions identifying the HCF, the low maximum score (0.5) suggests an "all or nothing" grading style in many Indian school contexts, increasing difficulty.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Moderate.** 75 is very friendly (multiples of 25/5), but 69 requires the student to apply the divisibility rule for 3 ($6+9=15$) to realize it is not prime ($3 \times 23$).

**Estimated Success Rate:**
The primary barrier is the linguistic decoding of the word problem. For Hindi-medium students in economically weaker sections, mapping the English phrase "measure... an exact number of times" to the mathematical concept of a common divisor is a high-order cognitive task.
