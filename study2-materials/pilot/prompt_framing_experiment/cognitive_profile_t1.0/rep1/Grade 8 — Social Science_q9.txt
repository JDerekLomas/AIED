- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The concept of 'Sansad' and democracy is a core part of the Class 8 NCERT Civics curriculum).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical; requires a single conceptual link).
- **Common error traps:** Major (Students often confuse 'Parliament' with 'Government' or 'Constitution'. The abstract nature of 'sovereignty' and 'representation' is difficult to articulate in a second language).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall and sentence construction. No partial credit increases difficulty for those with limited English vocabulary who might understand the concept but cannot phrase it).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A).

**Holistic Estimation:** While the concept is taught, the linguistic barrier for Hindi-medium students in an English-medium assessment environment is high. Students may struggle to translate "law-making" or "will of the people" precisely enough to meet the rubric's specific requirements.
