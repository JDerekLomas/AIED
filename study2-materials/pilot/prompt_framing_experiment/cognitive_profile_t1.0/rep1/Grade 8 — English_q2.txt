- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Students at this level are accustomed to descriptive comprehension questions based on imagery/nature).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Singular step of identifying and retrieving specific information from the text).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse visual descriptions with auditory ones, or use the word "chirping" incorrectly; grammatical errors in phrasing may occur).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended requires recall; no partial credit (binary scoring 0/1 adds pressure for exactness in identification, even if language is simple).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question, no numerical processing required).

**Holistic Estimation:** While the concept of birds at sunset is intuitive, the linguistic barrier for Hindi-medium students in EWS schools often leads to difficulty in constructing a grammatically coherent sentence in English. Many students will understand the "sound" but may fail to articulate it correctly or may lift irrelevant sentences from the passage.
