**Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The topic of "Acids, Bases, and Salts" is a core component of the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum. Indicators (natural and synthetic) are standard laboratory demonstrations.

**Computational complexity:** 1. There are no arithmetic or algebraic steps involved in this qualitative observation task.

**Common error traps:** Major. Students often confuse the color transitions (e.g., thinking turmeric turns red for acid instead of base). Additionally, hibiscus (China rose) has a different color profile (magenta for acid, green for base), which may lead to "interference" or cognitive load issues if the student tries to describe both simultaneously without clear distinction.

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This is a high-demand format for this demographic. Since the rubric is binary (1 or 0), the student must accurately recall and articulate the specific color change in English (or their language of instruction) without the aid of recognition-based cues found in multiple-choice questions. For Hindi-medium students, the transition to writing descriptive scientific processes in English is a significant barrier.

**Number friendliness:** Easy. No numerical data is present.

**Holistic Estimate:** While the concept is taught, the requirement to describe a multi-step procedure and correctly identify specific color changes in an open-ended format—combined with the linguistic challenge for ESL learners—significantly lowers the success rate compared to a recognition task.
