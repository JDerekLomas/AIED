- Concept familiarity: **Familiar** (Perimeter and area of rectangles are core Grade 6 and 7 topics in the NCERT curriculum).
- Computational complexity: **4+** (Step 1: Substitute into formula; Step 2: Divide by 2 or distribute; Step 3: Subtract to find width; Step 4: Multiply length by width to find area).
- Common error traps: **Major** (Students often confuse perimeter and area formulas; many might stop after finding the width (6 cm) and forget to calculate the area; potential confusion with units).
- Format demand: **Open-ended** (Requires recall of two different formulas and a multi-step algebraic solution; the 1-point rubric is "all or nothing," increasing difficulty).
- Number friendliness: **Easy** (Integers 32, 10, and 6 are very manageable for mental math).
