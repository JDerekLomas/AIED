**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (This is a foundational theme in the Grade 8 NCERT History curriculum, covered extensively in the chapter "From Trade to Territory.")

**Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; requires a single conceptual narrative step.)

**Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse specific dates or battles, but the rubric only requires identifying their initial status as "traders," which is a core concept.)

**Format demand:** Open-ended; requires recall and sentence construction. However, the rubric is extremely lenient, requiring only a mention of "traders" or "factories" for a full mark, which mitigates the language proficiency barrier.

**Number friendliness:** Easy (No mathematical calculation required.)

**Holistic Analysis:** While the question asks for a "process" (which is cognitively demanding), the rubric only requires the student to identify the starting point (traders/factories) to get the full mark. Because this is a high-frequency topic in Indian schools and the marking criteria are very narrow/accessible even for students with limited English, a majority of students will be able to provide the specific keyword required for the point.
