**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Less familiar.** While Active/Passive voice is introduced in Grade 7, the transformation of irregular verbs (blow -> blew -> blown) is often a significant hurdle for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds who may not have high exposure to English verb conjugations outside of rote memorization.
*   **Computational Complexity (Linguistic equivalent):** **2-3 steps.** The student must: 1) Identify the object ("the leaves") and move it to the subject position; 2) Determine the correct tense of the auxiliary verb "to be" (past tense "were" for plural "leaves"); 3) Recall the past participle of "blew" ("blown").
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Common errors for this demographic include using the wrong auxiliary (e.g., "The leaves *was*..."), failing to identify the past participle (e.g., "The leaves were *blew* away"), or literal translation interference from Hindi syntax.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended/Exact.** Since it is a 1-mark item with a specific rubric, partial credit is unlikely. The student must recall the structure without a word bank or multiple-choice cues.
*   **Number Friendliness (Linguistic equivalent):** **Moderate.** The vocabulary is simple, but "blown" is an irregular form that is less intuitive than regular "-ed" endings.

**Estimated Success Rate:**
The shift from "blew" to "were blown" is the primary barrier for students with limited English proficiency, as "blown" is less common in basic conversational English than the base verb.
