- Concept familiarity: familiar (Ruminants and the four-chambered stomach are core components of the Grade 7 NCERT Science curriculum, Chapter 2: "Nutrition in Animals.")
- Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative reasoning; no mathematical steps.)
- Common error traps: minor (Students often confuse the name "rumen" with "rumination" or struggle to explain the chemical breakdown of cellulose, though the rubric only requires identifying the anatomical difference.)
- Format demand: Open-ended (Requires active recall and sentence construction. For Hindi-medium students, articulating "cellulose," "four chambers," or "rumen" in English poses a significant linguistic hurdle despite conceptual understanding.)
- Number friendliness: easy (Not applicable.)

Holistic Analysis: While the concept is foundational, the open-ended nature of the question in English creates a barrier for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. Many students will understand that "cows eat grass and have a different stomach" but may struggle to express the "why" or the specific "dietary link" (cellulose) required for a full mark under a strict rubric.
