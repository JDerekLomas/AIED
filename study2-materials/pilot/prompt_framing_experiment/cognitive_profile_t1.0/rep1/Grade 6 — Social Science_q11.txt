- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Traffic safety is a standard part of the EVS/Social Science curriculum from early grades, and even students from EWS backgrounds are exposed to road safety in urban/semi-urban contexts.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (No arithmetic involved; requires logical retrieval.)
- Common error traps: Minor (Students might focus only on personal safety and fail to address the "community functioning" part of the prompt, or struggle with the "two reasons" constraint.)
- Format demand: Open-ended/Recall (High linguistic demand. For Hindi-medium students in an English-medium assessment, articulating "community functioning" is a significant barrier. While the concepts are simple, the rubrics' requirement for two reasons plus a community analysis makes it a multi-part cognitive task.)
- Number friendliness: Easy (Not applicable.)

Holistic Assessment: While the topic is relatable, the linguistic barrier for this specific demographic (translating thoughts from Hindi to English) and the multi-part nature of the question (Reasons + Community impact) will lower the success rate for a "fully correct" response according to the rubric.
