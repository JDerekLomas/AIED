- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The distinction between clinical and laboratory thermometers is a core part of the NCERT Grade 7 Science curriculum, specifically Chapter 4: Heat).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No calculation required; purely qualitative).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse the terms "clinical" and "medical" or simply state "thermometer" without the specific type).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall of specific terminology and a causal explanation in English, which poses a significant hurdle for students with limited English proficiency).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A).

**Holistic Analysis:**
While the concept is well-practiced, the requirement to explain "why" (the presence of the kink/constriction and the prevention of mercury backflow) in a second language is a high cognitive load for this specific demographic. While many might identify the "clinical thermometer," the 0.5 mark limit suggests a binary or very strict rubric where the "why" component often leads to partial failure in expression despite conceptual understanding.
