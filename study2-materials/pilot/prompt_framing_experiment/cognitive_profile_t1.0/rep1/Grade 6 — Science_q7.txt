**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The "Balanced Diet" and "Components of Food" are core chapters in the Grade 6 Science NCERT/State curriculum. Students are taught to categorize foods into groups (energy-giving, body-building, protective).
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** There are no arithmetic calculations involved; it is a qualitative identification task.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** Students from economically weaker sections may not associate "milk" specifically with a missing nutrient if they perceive fruits and vegetables as the pinnacle of "healthy food." Additionally, some may list specific nutrients (calcium/protein) instead of the food group, though the rubric allows for this.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** This is an open-ended, multi-part question. While the rubric only scores the identification of "milk," the presence of the second prompt ("Prepare diet chart...") is a significant cognitive distractor. Students with limited English proficiency may struggle to parse the two-part instruction or may spend their time drawing a chart while failing to explicitly name the missing item.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.** The item is non-numerical.

**Psychometric Analysis:**
The linguistic barrier is the primary hurdle here. The phrasing "has ate" is grammatically poor, and the shift from a specific scenario (Kartik) to a general task (Prepare diet chart) increases the cognitive load for Hindi-medium students. Many students will understand the concept but may fail to provide the precise "exact" answer required by a 0/1 binary rubric due to expressive limitations in English.
