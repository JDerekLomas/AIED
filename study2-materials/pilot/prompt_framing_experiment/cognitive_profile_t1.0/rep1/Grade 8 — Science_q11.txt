- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Expansion is part of the Grade 7/8 heat curriculum, but relating it to electrical wire material requires cross-topic synthesis).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Scanning a table for the highest value; no calculations required).
- **Common error traps:** Major (The question contains three sub-parts (a, b, c) but the rubric only awards 1 mark for part (a). Students often struggle with multi-part questions, and weaker students may fail to identify the "most" if values are decimals or if they get distracted by the logic of part (b) or (c)).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended/Exact (Requires precise identification from a table; no partial credit according to the rubric).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Assuming standard coefficient values, usually provided in simple decimals).

**Analysis:** For students in government schools with limited English proficiency, multi-part questions often lead to "completion fatigue." While part (a) is a simple data-reading task, the phrasing of (b) and (c) requires higher-order linguistic processing and conceptual recall. The "all-or-nothing" rubric for a three-part query significantly lowers the success rate if a student skips or misinterprets the prompt structure.
