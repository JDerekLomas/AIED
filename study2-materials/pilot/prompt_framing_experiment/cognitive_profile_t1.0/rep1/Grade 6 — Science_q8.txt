**Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The basic requirements for plant growth (water, light, nutrients) are covered in Grade 6 Science (NCERT Chapter: Getting to Know Plants), though linking specific symptoms like "stunted growth" to "deficiency" is a higher-order application of that knowledge.

**Computational complexity:** 1. There are no arithmetic calculations required.

**Common error traps:** Major. Students often struggle with the word "infer," confusing it with "describe." In a bilingual context, "stunted" is a low-frequency vocabulary word that may act as a linguistic barrier. Students may also provide a generic answer like "the plant is dying" without identifying a specific "need" as requested.

**Format demand:** Open-ended. This requires active recall and sentence construction in English. While the rubric is generous (accepting any one of three factors), the lack of a word bank or options increases the cognitive load significantly for students with limited English proficiency.

**Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A). No numerical data processing is involved.

**Holistic Estimate:**
While the science concept is foundational, the linguistic complexity of the question ("stunted," "infer," "evidence") and the open-ended nature of the response pose significant hurdles for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. Most students will recognize the plant is "sick," but fewer will articulately link the symptoms to specific missing inputs in English.
