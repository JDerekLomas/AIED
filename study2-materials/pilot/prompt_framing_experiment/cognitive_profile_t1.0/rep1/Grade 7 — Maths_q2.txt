**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Linear equations in one variable are a core part of the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum. However, for students in economically weaker sections (EWS), the abstract nature of "transposition" (moving numbers across the equals sign) often remains a hurdle if the foundation in Grade 6 was weak.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** The student must perform two distinct operations: additive inverse (subtracting 2) and multiplicative inverse (dividing by 4).
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Common procedural "bugs" in this demographic include:
    1.  **Operation confusion:** Adding 2 to 10 instead of subtracting.
    2.  **Inversion errors:** Dividing 4 by 8 instead of 8 by 4.
    3.  **Variable isolation:** Combining $4x + 2$ into $6x$ (a very common misconception among Hindi-medium students transitioning to algebraic notation).
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** Since no options are provided (MCQ), there is no "recognition" cue. The student must recall the algorithm from memory. With a binary rubric (Max score 1, no partial credit mentioned), small arithmetic slips result in zero marks.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The numbers are small integers, and the result is a whole number ($x=2$), which provides psychological reinforcement to the student that they are on the right track.

**Holistic Estimate**
While the math is "simple," the language barrier in instruction often leads to rote memorization of steps rather than conceptual clarity. In a typical Indian government school setting with a binary scoring system, many students will fail at the transposition stage or through "sign" errors.
