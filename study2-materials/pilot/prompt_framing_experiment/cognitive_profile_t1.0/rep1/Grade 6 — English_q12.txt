**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. Opposites (antonyms) are a foundational component of the primary English curriculum (Grades 1-5). "Up/Down" is one of the first pairs taught.

**Computational complexity:** 1 (Single-step retrieval).

**Common error traps:** None. The semantic relationship is highly stable. The only potential "trap" is a spelling error (e.g., "doun"), but the concept remains accessible.

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). While it requires recall over recognition (MCQ), the brevity of the word "down" minimizes the barrier. No partial credit is possible.

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Verbal item).

**Holistic Analysis:** Given the socioeconomic and linguistic context, "up" and "down" are frequently used in classroom instructions ("stand up," "sit down," "look up"). Even for students with limited English proficiency, these directional terms are part of their "survival" vocabulary. At Grade 6, even in under-resourced schools, the vast majority of students will have mastered this basic antonym.
