**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. The physical features of India, specifically the Himalayas and the Aravallis, are introduced as early as Grade 3 in EVS (Environmental Studies) and revisited with more detail in Grade 6. For Hindi-medium students, the terms *Himalaya* and *Parvat Shreniya* are high-frequency academic vocabulary.
*   **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; single-step retrieval).
*   **Common error traps:** Minor. The primary trap for this demographic is linguistic: students may know the mountain ranges but struggle with English spelling (e.g., writing "Vindhyachal" instead of "Vindhya" or phonetic misspellings). However, geography is visually reinforced through maps, which aids memory. Some may confuse a peak (Kanchenjunga) with a range.
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended recall. This is more difficult than a multiple-choice question because it requires active retrieval. However, since the rubric allows for "any two" and the score is only 0.5, it implies a low-stakes identification task. The requirement for only two ranges out of many possibilities significantly lowers the difficulty floor.
*   **Number friendliness:** N/A (Categorical/Verbal data).

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the high cultural salience of the Himalayas and the repetition of this topic in the NCERT curriculum, even students with limited English proficiency are likely to recall "Himalayas" and "Aravalli" or "Vindhya." The linguistic barrier is mitigated by the fact that these are proper nouns that sound similar in Hindi and English.
