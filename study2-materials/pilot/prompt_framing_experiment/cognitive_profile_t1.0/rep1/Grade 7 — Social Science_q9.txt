- Concept familiarity: **less familiar** (While students study wars and kings, connecting them to "economic life" requires abstract systemic thinking beyond rote memorization of dates or names.)
- Computational complexity: **1** (No calculation required.)
- Common error traps: **major** (Students often confuse "economic impact" with "political impact" or simply describe the events of the war rather than the fiscal consequences. Language barrier with the word "Assess" may lead to confusion.)
- Format demand: **Open-ended/Recall** (High demand. No options provided; requires constructing a sentence in English, which is a significant barrier for Hindi-medium students.)
- Number friendliness: **easy** (Qualitative response.)

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given the demographic profile, the abstract nature of "economic life" in a second language, and the command verb "Assess" (which is cognitively higher than "Identify" or "List"), most students will struggle to articulate a distinct economic consequence such as revenue loss, trade disruption, or treasury depletion in English.
