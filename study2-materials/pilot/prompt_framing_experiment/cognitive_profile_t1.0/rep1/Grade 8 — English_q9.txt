- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. The word "quiet" is part of the basic functional vocabulary taught in primary classes and frequently used in classroom management ("Keep quiet").
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Single-step retrieval).
- **Common error traps:** Minor. Students might confuse "quiet" with "quite." Additionally, while the concept is familiar, the metalanguage ("synonym" and "antonym") often poses a barrier for Hindi-medium students who may know the words but not the technical English terms for "same" and "opposite."
- **Format demand:** Open-ended recall. The rubric is binary (0 or 1), meaning the student must successfully retrieve and correctly spell both/either (depending on strictness) to secure the point. No partial credit.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Verbal item).

**Holistic Estimate:** 
While "quiet" is a high-frequency word, the requirement to produce two different categories of words (synonym and antonym) in English without options (no multiple choice) increases the difficulty for students with limited active vocabulary. Many students will understand the prompt but may struggle to recall or correctly spell "silent" or "noisy" in a testing environment.
