**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Data handling and bar graphs are introduced in Grade 6 and reinforced in Grade 7. Most students recognize the visual format, though the "choice of scale" is a transition point from guided to independent thinking.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3.** Students must first determine the range of the data, then divide to establish a scale (e.g., 1 unit = 10 or 20), and finally plot six distinct bars accurately.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** For this specific demographic, common hurdles include: 
    *   Inconsistent spacing between bars.
    *   Failure to start the Y-axis at zero.
    *   "Scale mismatch" (e.g., marking 10, 25, 30, 55 on the axis directly from the data points rather than using equal intervals).
    *   Linguistic confusion between "Maximum" and "Minimum" in part (b) if the English terms are not reinforced with Hindi equivalents.
*   **Format Demand:** **High (Constructed Response).** This is a generative task. While part (b) is simple retrieval, part (a) requires precision. Since the rubric requires a "suitable and consistent scale" for the single mark, partial errors in scaling usually result in a zero score under strict rubrics.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Moderate.** Depending on the specific values (which usually range from 80 to 135 in standard NCERT-style problems), students often struggle to plot values that do not fall exactly on a grid line (e.g., plotting 125 on a scale of 10).

**Holistic Estimate:**
While many students can identify the "max" and "min," the requirement to independently choose and maintain a consistent scale on a blank or grid space is a significant barrier for students with limited remedial support or those who struggle with spatial-numerical mapping.
