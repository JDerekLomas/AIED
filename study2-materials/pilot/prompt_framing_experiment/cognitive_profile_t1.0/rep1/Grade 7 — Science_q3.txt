**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. Photosynthesis is a core topic introduced in primary grades and revisited extensively in Grade 7. The term "Chlorophyll" is frequently repeated in both English and Hindi-medium (क्लोरोफिल) textbooks.
*   **Computational complexity:** 1 (Single-step retrieval).
*   **Common error traps:** Minor. The primary trap is spelling (e.g., "Chlorophil" or "Clorophyl"), though in Science assessments for this demographic, phonetic approximations are often accepted if the core concept is identified. There is a slight risk of confusing it with "Chloroplast."
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended recall. This increases difficulty compared to multiple-choice, as it requires active retrieval and production of a complex scientific term without scaffolding.
*   **Number friendliness:** Not applicable (qualitative item).
*   **Contextual Factor (Language):** While students are from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds, "Chlorophyll" is treated as a technical loanword in Hindi instruction. Most students can vocalize the word even if English literacy is low.
