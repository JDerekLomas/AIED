Concept familiarity: familiar (Photosynthesis and plant growth are core Grade 6 topics, though application via data tables is less practiced than rote recall).
Computational complexity: 1 (Simple comparison of values in a table).
Common error traps: minor (Students might confuse "Partial Shade" with "Full Sunlight" if they misread the growth measurements; language barrier might lead to confusion between "most favourable" and "least growth").
Format demand: Open-ended (Requires English construction for parts b and c; no partial credit for the specific rubric provided).
Number friendliness: easy (Growth measurements are typically simple integers or decimals).
