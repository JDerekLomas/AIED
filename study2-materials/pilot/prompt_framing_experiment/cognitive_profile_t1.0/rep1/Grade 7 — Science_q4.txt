**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The concept of "Heat" and "Fibers to Fabrics" is a core part of the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum. Students have high daily exposure to this phenomenon due to the climate in India, making it a "lived experience" topic.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **None.** This is a qualitative, conceptual question requiring zero arithmetic steps.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** Students may focus on "sweat absorption" (capillary action) instead of "reflection/absorption of heat." While both are scientific properties of cotton, the prompt specifically asks for properties related to *color* and *fabric* in the context of light-colored clothes. The primary trap is a language barrier—knowing the concept in Hindi (*prakash ka paravartan*) but struggling to express "reflection" or "absorption" in English.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** This is an open-ended "Explain" question. It requires productive recall and the ability to construct a sentence. Unlike a Multiple Choice Question (MCQ), students cannot rely on recognition. The rubric allows for "plausible reasons," which lowers the bar for formal scientific terminology, but the requirement for *two* reasons for only 1 mark increases the density of the required response.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.** No numbers are involved.

**Holistic Analysis**
While the concept is intuitive and culturally relevant, the linguistic demand is the primary barrier for students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds. Constructing a two-part scientific explanation in English is significantly more difficult than identifying the correct reason from a list. However, since the rubric accepts simplified language (e.g., "bounce off heat"), a significant portion of students will likely secure the mark.
