### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

**Concept familiarity: Less familiar**
While "Indirect Speech" is part of the Grade 7 curriculum (NCERT/State Boards), it is often perceived as one of the most abstract and difficult grammar topics for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. The shift from "I" to "she" and "am" to "was" requires an internalizing of grammatical perspective that is often under-practiced in resource-constrained environments.

**Computational complexity: N/A**
(Not applicable to this subject).

**Common error traps: Major**
Students face a "triple-threat" of potential errors:
1.  **Pronoun Shift:** Failing to change "I" to "she" (influenced by literal translation).
2.  **Tense Backshift:** Retaining the present continuous ("is reading") instead of the past continuous ("was reading").
3.  **Syntactic Connective:** Omitting the "that" or failing to remove the quotation marks/comma correctly.

**Format demand: Open-ended (Recall)**
The item is open-ended, requiring the student to generate the entire sentence structure from memory rather than recognizing it from a list. In Indian government school contexts, where rote memorization of vocabulary is more common than procedural grammar application, this format significantly lowers the success rate.

**Number friendliness: N/A**
(Language complexity: Moderate. While the vocabulary "reading" and "novel" is simple, the functional grammar is complex).

### Estimated Success Rate
In the context of economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, many students may get one part of the transformation correct (e.g., adding "that") but fail to execute the simultaneous pronoun and tense shifts required for full marks.
