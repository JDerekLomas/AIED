**Concept familiarity:** familiar
(Division with remainders and basic sharing are core Grade 5-6 concepts. However, the specific "round up to the next multiple" logic in a word problem context is less frequently practiced than simple division.)

**Computational complexity:** 2-3
(Step 1: 300 ÷ 80 to find the remainder/quotient; Step 2: Determine the deficit to reach the next multiple of 80; Step 3: Divide the total chocolates (320) by the number of classes (8).)

**Common error traps:** major
(There are several linguistic and logical hurdles: 1. Students may answer "60" (the remainder) or "20" (the additional needed) instead of the "minimum total" of 320. 2. The phrase "minimum number... to distribute... in equal quantity" is linguistically dense for ESL learners. 3. Students may ignore the first part of the prompt and simply divide 300 by 8.)

**Format demand:** Open-ended (exact answer required)
(The rubric specifies a 1/0 scoring system with no partial credit, making it high-stakes for a multi-step problem.)

**Number friendliness:** moderate
(While the numbers involve zeros, which aids mental division, 80 does not go into 300 evenly, and the 8-class division requires the student to have correctly solved the first "rounding up" logic first.)

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given the linguistic complexity ("minimum number required" vs "extra required") and the two-part nature of the question where the second answer depends on a specific logical leap in the first, many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may perform the division correctly but fail to interpret the "rounding up" requirement.
