**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (LCM is a core topic in Grade 6 NCERT curriculum, introduced shortly after HCF).
**Computational complexity:** 4+ (Requires multiple steps: prime factorization or successive division, followed by multiplication of the factors).
**Common error traps:** Major (Confusion between LCM and HCF is very common; students often stop at the highest common factor or make errors in the multiplication phase of the division method).
**Format demand:** Open-ended recall; requires exact answer for the 1-mark rubric (high demand).
**Number friendliness:** Moderate (While 12, 15, and 20 are common, they require handling multiple prime factors like 2, 3, and 5).

**Linguistic/Contextual Note:** For students in Hindi-medium or EWS backgrounds, "L.C.M." is often taught as "Lasa" (लघुत्तम समापवर्त्य). While the math is universal, the English abbreviation can occasionally be a barrier if not explicitly paired with the vernacular term.
