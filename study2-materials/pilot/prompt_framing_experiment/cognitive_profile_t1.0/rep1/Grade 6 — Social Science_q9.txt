- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Rajasthan's monuments like Hawa Mahal or Amer Fort are staple topics in Indian Social Science curricula, though recall varies).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No arithmetic involved).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse cities—e.g., placing the Taj Mahal in Rajasthan—or struggle to articulate the "why" in English).
- **Format demand:** High (Open-ended recall). Despite the "1 point" max score, the prompt requires three distinct pieces of information: two names, one city, and one reason. This creates a high hurdle for a single point.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A).

**Analysis:** For students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds, the primary barrier is linguistic encoding. While they likely know the monuments (Hawa Mahal, Chittorgarh, Jaisalmer Fort), writing the "why it is famous" in English often leads to incomplete answers. Since the rubric requires multiple components for a single point with no partial credit, the success rate drops significantly.
