**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. Articles (a, an, the) are introduced in primary grades and are a staple of the Grade 7 English curriculum in Indian schools.
*   **Computational complexity:** N/A (Language task). However, cognitively, it requires three distinct linguistic decisions.
*   **Common error traps:** Major. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the concept of "articles" is difficult because Hindi (and many Indian regional languages) does not have direct equivalents for "a/an" or "the." Common bugs include:
    *   Confusing "a" and "an" (though "elephant" is a standard textbook example for "an").
    *   Omission of "the" before "zoo," as students often apply native language syntax where the definite article is absent.
*   **Format demand:** High. The rubric requires rewriting the *whole* sentence. Students often lose marks for only providing the three words (fill-in-the-blank style) or making transcription errors (spelling/punctuation) while rewriting, despite knowing the grammar rules. No partial credit is available.
*   **Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Analysis:**
While the grammar rule is basic, the requirement to rewrite the entire sentence correctly acts as a significant hurdle for students with low English literacy. The "the" before "zoo" is the most frequent point of failure, as its usage feels arbitrary to learners whose first language lacks definite articles.
