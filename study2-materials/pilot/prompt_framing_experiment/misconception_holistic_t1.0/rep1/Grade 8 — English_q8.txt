Step 1: The task requires knowledge of English syntax and grammar, specifically the transformation of active voice to passive voice. This involves identifying the subject, verb, and object, understanding tense consistency (Simple Past and Present Perfect), and the correct application of auxiliary verbs ("was", "has been") and past participles.

Step 2: Common misconceptions/errors include:
- Tense shifting: Using "is prepared" instead of "was prepared" (leads to incorrect answer).
- Misidentifying the object: Failing to move "A delicious meal" to the subject position (leads to incorrect answer).
- Subject-Verb agreement: Using "were" instead of "was" (leads to incorrect answer).
- Difficulty with the Present Perfect: Many students struggle with the "has been + past participle" construction in Sentence B (leads to incorrect answer).
- Omission of "by": Forgetting the agentive preposition (leads to incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The vocabulary ("chef", "meal", "king") is relatively common in standard textbooks.
- Sentence A uses a Simple Past structure, which is the most practiced form of passive voice.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- Language barrier: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often translate literally, which can lead to word order errors.
- Sentence B: The Present Perfect ("has found") is significantly more difficult for Grade 8 students than the Simple Past.
- Open-ended format: No options provided to trigger recognition; requires full recall and production.
- Scoring Rubric: The rubric only explicitly mentions Sentence A, but usually, in such tests, both parts must be correct to earn the point, or errors in B would penalize the student.

Step 5: Given the English proficiency levels in economically weaker section schools and the leap required to master the Present Perfect passive, many students will get Sentence A right but fail Sentence B or make tense errors.
