Step 1: Identify the conceptual skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, it requires cognitive processing skills: identifying causal relationships (why X is necessary for Y), understanding the functional definition of a democratic institution, and synthesizing abstract concepts (representation, legislation) into a written explanation.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Conflating "Government" with "Parliament": Students often believe the Parliament is simply the group of people who "run the country" (the Executive). This might lead to an answer about building roads or schools, which may fail the rubric's specific requirement for law-making or representation.
*   Democracy as "Voting only": Students may think democracy starts and ends at the polling booth, missing the deliberative role of Parliament.
*   Parliament as a building: Viewing it as a physical landmark rather than a functional body.
*   Language barrier: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may know the concept of "Sansad" but struggle to articulate "law-making body" or "representation" in English, leading to vague or incorrect phrasing.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   Familiar terminology: "Parliament" and "Democracy" are buzzwords frequently repeated in Civics textbooks and news.
*   Broad Rubric: The "AND/OR" in the rubric is generous; students only need to hit one of two major functions to get the point.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Open-ended format: No cues or options to trigger memory; requires active recall and sentence construction.
*   Language Proficiency: For students with limited English, explaining "will of the people" or "legislative functions" is linguistically demanding.
*   Abstraction: "Representation" is an abstract concept difficult for 8th graders in under-resourced schools to visualize compared to concrete services.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given the language barrier for Hindi-medium students and the requirement to move beyond a "Parliament is good" statement to a functional explanation (laws/voice), many students will likely provide answers that are too vague or focused solely on the Executive branch.
