Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, it involves spatial reasoning and geometric understanding. Students must visualize a "grid layout" (perpendicular lines/intersections), understand scale and division (Citadel vs. Lower Town), and recognize standardized units of measurement (uniform size of baked bricks).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
*   **Grid Layout:** Misunderstanding "perpendicular" or "right angles"; might think any cluster of houses is a grid. (Possible incorrect/vague answer).
*   **Chronological Displacement:** Thinking ancient civilizations lacked "engineering" and only used primitive mud. (Leads to omission of "baked bricks" or "drainage").
*   **Scale:** Difficulty distinguishing between a single building and city-wide planning.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** The Harappan Civilization is a "super-topic" in the Indian NCERT/State curriculum, heavily emphasized from Class 6 onwards.
*   **Low Threshold:** The rubric only requires *one* feature, and the concepts (drains, bricks, streets) are concrete and visual.
*   **Hindi-English Cognates:** Terms like "Drainage" or "Citadel" are often taught with their Hindi equivalents (Nikaasi, Kila), making the core concept accessible even with limited English.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
*   **Linguistic Barrier:** Describing a feature in English is significantly harder for Hindi-medium students than identifying one in a multiple-choice format.
*   **Open-ended format:** Requires recall rather than recognition.
*   **Vocabulary:** Words like "Civilization" and "Urban Planning" may be intimidating, even if the student understands the "City" (Shahar).

Step 5: Estimate proportion of students.
The high level of repetition of this specific topic in Indian schools acts as a safety net. Most students, even from economically weaker sections, memorize the "Great Bath," "Drains," or "Bricks" as keywords. The "describe" instruction is the main hurdle, but the rubric is lenient (accepting a simple description).
