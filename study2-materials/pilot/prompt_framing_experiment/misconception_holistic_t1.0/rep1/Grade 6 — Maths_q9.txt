Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required
- Identifying a triangle and its interior angles.
- Knowledge of the "Angle Sum Property of a Triangle" (sum = 180°).
- Basic arithmetic (addition of two angles and subtraction from 180).
- Understanding geometric notation (finding "x" as a missing value).

Step 2: Common misconceptions
- Sum of angles is 90° or 360°: This would lead to an incorrect answer (e.g., $90 - 100$ or $360 - 100$).
- Visual guessing: Estimating the angle based on appearance rather than calculation.
- Confusing interior and exterior angles: If the figure contains extended lines, students might calculate the supplementary angle instead.
- Simple arithmetic errors: Adding two given angles incorrectly (e.g., $50 + 50 = 110$).

Step 3: Factors making it easier
- The numbers involved are usually "friendly" multiples of 5 or 10.
- The Angle Sum Property is a core, heavily practiced competency in Grade 6.
- The figure provides a concrete visual cue, which helps students with limited English proficiency bypass the language barrier.

Step 4: Factors making it harder
- Open-ended format: No options to work backward from or to provide a "safety net."
- Language barrier: While the figure is visual, any accompanying text in English might confuse Hindi-medium students.
- Multi-step process: Requires a two-step calculation (Add, then Subtract).

Step 5: Holistic Estimate
Given that this is a standard, frequently drilled geometry problem, many students will recognize the pattern. However, for students from economically weaker sections with potential gaps in foundational learning, the jump from arithmetic to geometric reasoning often poses a challenge.
