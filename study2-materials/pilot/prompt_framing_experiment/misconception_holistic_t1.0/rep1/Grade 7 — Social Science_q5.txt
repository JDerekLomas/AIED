Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science (Geography) item, the cognitive skills involved include sequencing (logical ordering of events), understanding cycles (circular systems), and cause-and-effect reasoning. In a mathematical sense, this involves a multi-step process where $A \to B \to C$.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Instantaneous Transformation:** Students often think one rock turns into another immediately, ignoring the intermediate "sediment" stage. (Leads to an incorrect answer).
*   **Static Earth:** The belief that rocks are permanent and unchanging. (Leads to an incorrect answer).
*   **Confusion between Rock Types:** Mixing up the definitions of igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. (Leads to an incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Curricular Alignment:** The rock cycle is a core, frequently repeated topic in the Grade 7 NCERT/State Board syllabus.
*   **Visual Memory:** Most textbooks use a very distinct circular diagram which many students memorize visually.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, technical terms like "igneous," "sedimentary," "weathering," and "erosion" are difficult to recall and spell in English.
*   **Open-ended Format:** There are no cues or options to trigger memory; students must generate the technical vocabulary (weathering/erosion) themselves to meet the rubric.
*   **Process Detail:** The rubric specifically requires the "break down" and "transport" steps; many students may simply say "igneous becomes sedimentary over time," which would fail the specific rubric requirements.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given the English language barrier and the requirement for a specific two-step causal explanation (weathering + transport) in an open-ended format, many students will provide a partial or vague answer that does not satisfy the 1-point rubric.
