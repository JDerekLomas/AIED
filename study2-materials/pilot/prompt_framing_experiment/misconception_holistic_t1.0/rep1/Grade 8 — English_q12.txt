Step 1: Although the subject is English, the underlying cognitive skills for "storytelling based on images" involve logical sequencing, spatial-temporal reasoning (ordering events chronologically), and establishing cause-and-effect relationships (the fox falls *so* he cannot escape).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include reversing cause and effect or misinterpreting visual depth (spatial reasoning). However, the narrative of "The Fox and the Goat" is a culturally ubiquitous fable in Indian schools. Misconceptions are more likely to be linguistic (grammar/syntax) than conceptual regarding the plot.

Step 3: Ease factors: The context (fox and well) is a highly familiar moral story found in almost all NCERT and State Board Hindi/English textbooks. The visual prompts lower the barrier for comprehension compared to a text-only prompt.

Step 4: Hardness factors: The open-ended format requires sentence construction rather than simple identification. For Hindi-medium students with limited English proficiency, translating the familiar internal narrative into correct English grammar and vocabulary is a significant hurdle. Many students may understand the "what" but struggle with the "how" in a second language.

Step 5: While the story is familiar, the requirement to produce a coherent written response in English at a Grade 8 level for students from economically weaker sections with limited language exposure suggests a lower mastery rate for "fully correct" (grammatically sound and contextually accurate) answers.
