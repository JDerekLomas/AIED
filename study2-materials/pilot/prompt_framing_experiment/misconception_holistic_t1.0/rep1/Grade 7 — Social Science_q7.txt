Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, the underlying mathematical/quantitative concepts include the functions of money as a medium of exchange, a measure of value (ratio/proportionality), and a store of value. It also requires understanding the transition from physical units to digital representation (abstract numbering and electronic ledgers).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Money has intrinsic value rather than representative value (would not necessarily lead to an incorrect answer).
- Digital money is "invisible" or not "real" (might lead to an incorrect answer if the student cannot explain its "use").
- Equating wealth only with physical cash (might limit the "economic development" explanation).

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The "use of digital money" (UPI, PhonePe, GPay) is highly familiar in India, even among economically weaker sections, due to the widespread nature of the digital payment revolution.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- Language barrier: The terms "Analyze," "Economic Development," and "Evaluate" are high-level academic English commands (Tier 3 vocabulary) that Hindi-medium/ESL students often struggle to decode.
- Structure: It is an open-ended question requiring a written explanation for only 1 mark, which often leads to under-answering or vague responses.
- Scope: "Economic development" is an abstract macro-concept for a 7th grader.

Step 5: While students likely understand "money" and "digital payments" intuitively, the sophisticated English phrasing of the prompt and the requirement to "analyze" and "evaluate" in a second language will pose a significant barrier to a "fully correct" response according to the rubric's standard for an explanation.
