**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   Understanding of basic algebraic notation (variable $x$, coefficient 4, and constant 2).
*   Knowledge of the "Inverse Operations" principle (undoing addition with subtraction and multiplication with division).
*   Maintaining equality by performing the same operation on both sides of the equation.
*   Arithmetic fluency (subtraction $10 - 2$ and division $8 \div 4$).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Additive/Multiplicative confusion:** Students might subtract 4 instead of dividing by it, or divide by 2 instead of subtracting it. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Concatenation error:** Viewing $4x$ as $4 + x$ or $40 + x$. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Left-to-Right bias:** Applying operations in the order they appear without regard for algebraic priority (e.g., trying to divide everything by 4 before subtracting 2). (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Operational sign error:** Moving a term to the other side without changing the sign (e.g., $4x = 10 + 2$). (Leads to incorrect answer).

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Simple Numbers:** The result is a positive integer ($x=2$). There are no negative numbers, fractions, or decimals involved.
*   **Standard Form:** The equation follows the classic $ax + b = c$ format, which is the most drilled pattern in NCERT Class 7 textbooks.
*   **Minimal Language Barrier:** The word "Solve" is a high-frequency academic term that even students with limited English proficiency usually recognize in a math context.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Two-Step Process:** Requires a sequence of two distinct operations; many Grade 7 students struggle to transition from one-step to two-step logic.
*   **Open-ended Format:** There are no options to "plug back in" to verify the answer, which often helps students in this demographic.
*   **Abstract Nature:** For students from economically weaker backgrounds, abstract algebra without a real-world "word problem" context can sometimes feel disconnected from their intuitive sense of math.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
While the math is fundamental, the
