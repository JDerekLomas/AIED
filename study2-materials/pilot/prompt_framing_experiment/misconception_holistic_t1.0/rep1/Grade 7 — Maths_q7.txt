**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   Understanding the linguistic-mathematical bridge where "of" denotes multiplication.
*   Multiplication of fractions (multiplying numerators and denominators).
*   Comparison of fractions with unlike denominators (requires finding a Common Denominator or converting to decimals/cross-multiplication).
*   Simplification and basic arithmetic fluency.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Additive Misconception:** Adding fractions instead of multiplying (e.g., $1/2 + 3/4$). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Gap Thinking:** Thinking $3/8$ is smaller than $4/15$ because the "gap" between $3$ and $8$ is $5$, while $4$ and $15$ is $11$. This might accidentally lead to the right answer ($3/8 > 4/15$) but with wrong reasoning.
*   **Whole Number Bias:** Thinking $4/15$ is larger because $15$ and $4$ are larger digits than $3$ and $8$. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the word "of" is replaced by "ka" (का) in Hindi textbooks. A student with limited English proficiency might not immediately translate "of" to the multiplication operation.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   The numbers used are small, single-digit integers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 15), which reduces the cognitive load of the multiplication itself.
*   "Of" problems are a standard part of the NCERT Grade 7 curriculum (Chapter 2: Fractions and Decimals).

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Multi-step process:** This is not a one-step calculation. It requires two multiplications followed by a comparison.
*   **Comparison Difficulty:** $3/8$ and $4/15$ do not have a common denominator. Finding the LCM of 8 and 15 (which is 120) is a significant hurdle for struggling students.
*   **Lack of Scaffolding:** As an open-ended question without options, there is no "safety net" or cue to guide the student.
*   **Language:** The phrase "Which is greater" requires the student to interpret the final values, not just calculate them.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
While the multiplication is straightforward, the second step—comparing $3/8$ and $4/15$—is where many students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds stumble due to a lack of fluency in finding common denominators or a lack of conceptual understanding of fraction magnitude. Many will correctly find $3/8$ and $4/15$ but fail to compare them correctly or give up before the final step.
