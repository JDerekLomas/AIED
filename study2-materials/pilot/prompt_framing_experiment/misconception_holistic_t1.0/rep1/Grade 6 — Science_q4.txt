Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Science item, the underlying logical structure involves "cause and effect" reasoning and identifying properties of materials. No formal mathematical operations are required, but the student must categorize a material based on a functional attribute.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Misconception 1: "Cotton makes you cold."** Students may believe cotton has an active cooling property like ice. On this item, it might lead to a vague answer ("it is cold") rather than identifying a specific property like "absorption," potentially losing the mark.
*   **Misconception 2: Conflating "white color" with "cotton material."** Students often associate summer clothes with the color white (reflecting heat). If a student identifies "reflecting sunlight" as a property of *cotton* rather than a property of the *color*, it would lead to an incorrect answer according to the rubric.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Contextual Familiarity:** The context is highly relevant to daily life in India, where cotton clothing and extreme heat are universal experiences for students from economically weaker sections.
*   **Language Simplicity:** The core concepts (sweat/cotton) are taught early in both Hindi and English mediums.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, expressing "porous" or "absorbent" in English is a significant hurdle. They may know the concept but lack the specific English vocabulary required for a written response.
*   **Open-ended Format:** There are no cues or options to trigger recognition.
*   **Specific Property Requirement:** The rubric requires a "property," not just a benefit. A student writing "It keeps us cool" might fail to get the mark because they haven't described a *property* (like absorption).

Step 5: Estimate of correct responses.
Despite the familiar context, the requirement for a written explanation in English and the specific need to name a physical property (rather than a subjective feeling) will pose a challenge for many Grade 6 students in this demographic.
