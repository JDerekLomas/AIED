Step 1: This is a Social Science (History) item, not a mathematics item. However, the cognitive skills required include recall of historical facts, chronological categorization (distinguishing the Vedic period from the Harappan or Later Vedic periods), and descriptive writing.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Confusing the Vedic period with the Harappan civilization (leading to an answer of "trade" or "urban crafts") - Yes, leads to incorrect answer.
- Assuming "agriculture" was always the primary focus (ignoring the early Vedic shift from pastoralism) - No, the rubric allows both "pastoralism" and "agriculture."
- Chronological displacement (associating modern occupations with ancient times) - Yes, leads to incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The rubric is extremely generous, accepting both the early Vedic primary occupation (pastoralism) and the later Vedic primary occupation (agriculture). The "key aspect" requirement is part of the prompt but the rubric suggests the point is awarded for the identification. The topic is a core part of the Grade 6 NCERT/State Board curriculum.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: The "describe one key aspect" requires sentence construction in English, which is a significant barrier for students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds. The open-ended format is more difficult than multiple-choice. Students may struggle to recall the specific term "pastoralism" or "animal husbandry" in English, even if they understand the concept.

Step 5: While the content is foundational, the language barrier for EWS/Hindi-medium students in an English-medium assessment environment significantly lowers the success rate for a descriptive two-part question.
