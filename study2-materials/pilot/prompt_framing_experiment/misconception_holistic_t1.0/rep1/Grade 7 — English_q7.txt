Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While the subject is English, the structural logic involves classification and categorical reasoning. The student must identify the function of a word within a specific syntactic structure. "Around" acts as an adverb here because it lacks an object; if it were "around the track," it would be a preposition.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Word-Class Permanence:** Students often believe a word is always one part of speech (e.g., "around" is always a preposition). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Proximity Bias:** Students often mistake adverbs for adjectives if they are near verbs, or prepositions if they are commonly used spatially.
*   **Limited Vocabulary/Functional Grammar:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often learn grammar through translation. In Hindi, postpositions function differently, leading to confusion when an English word stands alone without a noun following it.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   The sentence is very short and uses basic vocabulary ("We," "ran").
*   "Around" is a common sight word.
*   The question is direct and uses standard grammatical terminology.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Ambiguity:** "Around" is most frequently taught as a preposition in primary grades. Differentiating it as an adverb requires a nuanced understanding of sentence structure (intransitive use).
*   **Language Barrier:** For ESL/Hindi-medium students, the abstract labels (Adverb, Preposition, Adjective) are often confused or memorized without deep functional understanding.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without multiple-choice options, students must recall the specific term "adverb" and spell it correctly, which is significantly harder than recognition.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the typical focus on rote memorization of parts of speech in this demographic, most students will likely label "around" as a preposition because that is how it is predominantly introduced. The distinction between a preposition and an adverbial particle is a high-level concept for Grade 7 students with limited English proficiency.
