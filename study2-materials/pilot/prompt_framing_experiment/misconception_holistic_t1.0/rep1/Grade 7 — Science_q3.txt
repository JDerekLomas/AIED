Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Science item, the cognitive skills involved include vocabulary recall and associating a specific biological term ("Chlorophyll") with its functional definition. In the context of the Indian curriculum (NCERT), this is a foundational factual recall task.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Confusing Photosynthesis with Chlorophyll:** Some students believe photosynthesis *is* the substance rather than the process. (Would lead to an incorrect answer).
*   **Confusing Stomata with Chlorophyll:** Students often mix up the structures (pores) with the pigment. (Would lead to an incorrect answer).
*   **Chloroplast vs. Chlorophyll:** Students may name the organelle instead of the pigment. (Would lead to an incorrect answer, though sometimes awarded partial credit in lenient classrooms).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Highly familiar context:** Photosynthesis is a "high-frequency" topic taught repeatedly from Class 4 onwards.
*   **Keyword association:** In Hindi-medium contexts, the term "Harit lavak" (Chloroplast) or "Parnaharit" (Chlorophyll) is heavily drilled.
*   **Single-word answer:** Requires minimal English syntax, reducing the barrier for English Language Learners.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Spelling:** For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, spelling "Chlorophyll" in English is a significant hurdle. If the rubric is strict on spelling, the difficulty increases.
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no options to trigger recognition; it requires pure retrieval.
*   **Language transition:** Moving from the Hindi "Parnaharit" to the English "Chlorophyll" can cause retrieval failure.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given that this is one of the most emphasized facts in the Grade 7 Science curriculum and is a "rote-memory" staple in Indian government school examinations, a majority of students will recognize the term, though spelling errors will be prevalent.
