Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is an English Language Arts (ELA) item, not a mathematical one. However, the cognitive skills required include identifying patterns in text, synthesis of information, and vocabulary retrieval.

Step 2: List common misconceptions/errors.
Students at this level often confuse "writing style" with "subject matter" (what the poem is about) or "emotional response" (how it makes them feel). In the context of this specific item, these misconceptions would lead to incorrect answers (e.g., writing "nature" or "sad" instead of "descriptive" or "simple").

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
The rubric is broad and accepts a wide range of synonyms. If the poem used is very simple, basic adjectives like "easy" or "good" might be accepted by lenient markers, though they are not technically "styles."

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
The open-ended format is very difficult for students with limited English proficiency. Describing "style" is an abstract meta-linguistic task. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may understand the style in their native language but lack the specific English tier-2 vocabulary (e.g., "informal," "direct," "descriptive") to provide a valid answer. The term "style" itself is often not explicitly taught as a vocabulary word in early ESL/ELL curricula.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the English language barrier, the abstract nature of "writing style" compared to "plot" or "theme," and the requirement to produce a specific type of adjective without a word bank, the success rate will be low.
