Step 1: Identify the scientific concepts and skills required.
The question requires knowledge of thermal physics, specifically heat transfer in solids. Students must identify the mode of transfer (Conduction) and explain the mechanism (vibration of particles/atoms and energy transfer through collisions within the solid lattice).

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
1. "Heat is a substance": Students may think heat flows like a liquid through the spoon. (Could lead to a correct identification but incorrect explanation).
2. "Convection in solids": Students might confuse conduction with convection, thinking the metal "moves" to carry heat. (Leads to incorrect answer).
3. "Heat rises": Students might believe the handle is hot only because it is "above" the tea, rather than due to the material's properties. (Leads to incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
- Familiar context: A spoon in tea is a classic, everyday example used in almost every Indian NCERT textbook.
- Visualizable: The scenario is concrete rather than abstract.
- Vocabulary: "Conduction" (चालन) is a key term heavily drilled in Grade 7 Science.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Language barrier: ESL/Hindi-medium students may know the concept but struggle to write the explanation in English.
- Open-ended: Part (b) requires constructing a sentence rather than selecting a choice.
- Rubric strictness: While the prompt asks for (b), the provided rubric only mentions (a), which might imply partial credit is difficult to obtain or that the explanation is the primary hurdle.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given that this is a "standard" textbook example, many students will recognize the term "Conduction." However, the requirement to "briefly explain" in English will be a significant barrier for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency, even if they understand the science.
