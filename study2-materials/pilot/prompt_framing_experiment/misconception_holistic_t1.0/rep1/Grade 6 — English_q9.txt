Step 1: Identify the linguistic and mechanical skills required.
The student must identify and apply three rules of English capitalization: starting a sentence with a capital letter, capitalizing proper nouns (names), and capitalizing days of the week. Additionally, they must apply terminal punctuation (a period/full stop).

Step 2: List common misconceptions/errors.
*   **Case Confusion:** Students may believe capital letters only appear at the start of a sentence and ignore internal proper nouns (*meena*, *sunday*). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Proper Noun Recognition:** Students might recognize "Riya" because it is at the start, but fail to recognize "Meena" as a name or "Sunday" as a category requiring capitalization.
*   **Punctuation Omission:** Students often forget the full stop if they focus solely on the spelling/capitalization.
*   **Transfer from Hindi:** In Hindi (the students' likely primary language), there is no distinction between upper and lower case. This is a significant barrier to internalizing capitalization rules.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   The vocabulary is extremely simple (*market*, *friend*, *went*) and familiar to Grade 6 students.
*   The names "Riya" and "Meena" are culturally familiar Indian names.
*   The sentence structure is a simple Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no multiple-choice cues; the student must produce the entire string correctly.
*   **Rubric Rigidity:** The rubric requires *all* changes (R, M, S, and the period) to be correct for a single mark. One small slip (e.g., forgetting the period) results in 0.
*   **Language Interference:** As mentioned, the lack of case in Devanagari script makes capitalization an abstract and often "invisible" rule for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the sentence is simple, the requirement for 100% accuracy across four distinct points of punctuation/capitalization is high for students who do not use English as their primary language and whose native script does not use case.
