Step 1: Identify the concepts and skills required.
The question requires recall of biological definitions (nutrition modes) and classification. Students must distinguish between self-sustenance (autotrophs) and dependency (heterotrophs) and provide relevant examples (e.g., green plants vs. animals/humans).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
1. "Plants eat soil/water": Students may think plants take in food rather than making it. This would lead to a wrong answer.
2. "Heterotrophs only eat meat": Students might ignore herbivores or fungi. This might still result in a correct answer if their example (e.g., "Lion") is valid.
3. Confusion between the terms: Because the Greek roots (auto/hetero) are not intuitive for Hindi-medium students, they often swap the definitions. This would lead to a wrong answer.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
- It is a foundational, high-frequency topic in the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum.
- In Hindi-medium schools, the terms "Swaposhi" (self-nourishing) and "Visamposhi" (different-nourishing) are more descriptive than the English terms, helping students who learn in their mother tongue.
- Examples (plants and animals) are highly familiar and part of daily life.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Language barrier: For students with limited English, spelling "autotrophic" and "heterotrophic" correctly is difficult.
- Format: It is a descriptive question requiring sentence construction, which is harder than multiple-choice for ESL/ELL learners.
- Rubric: The 1-mark limit is strict; failing to provide an example or swapping one definition results in zero.

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.
While the concepts are basic, the linguistic demand of writing out definitions in English for students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds is a significant hurdle. Many will understand the concept but struggle to articulate it correctly in English or may confuse the two technical terms.
