Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
- Data interpretation: Reading a table with two variables (Condition vs. Growth).
- Comparative reasoning: Identifying the maximum value (most favourable) and minimum value (least growth).
- Logical deduction: Connecting physical conditions (sunlight/darkness) to biological outcomes.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
- "More is always better": Students might confuse the number of days (10) with the growth measurement. (Potential for error).
- Misunderstanding "favourable": Some students may associate "favourable" with a specific condition they personally like rather than what the data shows. (Potential for error).
- Photosynthesis vs. Respiration: Students often believe plants only breathe at night or that "food" comes from soil rather than light. (Relevant for parts b and c).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
- The context (plants and sunlight) is highly familiar and intuitive.
- Part (a) is a simple retrieval task from a table.
- The numbers involved in 6th-grade growth charts are typically small and easy to compare.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
- English Proficiency: Terms like "favourable," "hindered," and "biological process" are high-level vocabulary for Hindi-medium students with limited English.
- Open-ended format: Students must construct sentences for (b) and (c) rather than selecting a choice.
- Scientific terminology: Identifying "Photosynthesis" requires specific vocabulary recall in English, which is a significant barrier for this demographic.
- Multi-part dependency: If they don't understand the prompt for (b), they cannot answer (c).

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While part (a) is accessible, parts (b) and (c) require specific English vocabulary ("Photosynthesis") and explanatory writing. In many Indian government school contexts, students may understand the concept in Hindi but struggle to express it accurately in English or recall the specific technical term required for full marks.
