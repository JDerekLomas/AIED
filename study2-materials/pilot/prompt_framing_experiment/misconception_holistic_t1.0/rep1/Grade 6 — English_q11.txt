Step 1: Identify the linguistic and grammatical concepts required.
The student must distinguish between a single verb and a verb phrase. This requires identifying the auxiliary verb (are) and the main verb (playing) and understanding that they function together as a single unit within the sentence structure.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Verb = Action:** Students often believe only the "action" word is the verb. This would lead them to answer "playing," which is incorrect per the rubric.
*   **One word per part of speech:** Students may believe a grammatical category can only be one word. This would also lead to "playing."
*   **Inclusion of the Object:** Some students may include the noun being acted upon ("playing football"). This would be incorrect.
*   **Confusion with Subject:** Some might identify the entire predicate or just the noun "children."

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** "Children," "playing," and "football" are high-frequency words likely known even to English Language Learners (ELL) with limited proficiency.
*   **Simple Sentence Structure:** The sentence follows a standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern with no clauses or complex modifiers.
*   **Common Tense:** Present continuous is one of the first multi-word tenses taught in Grade 6.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
*   **Terminology:** The term "verb phrase" is technical. Hindi-medium students may know the action but not the English meta-language for it.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without multiple-choice options, students must correctly decide where the phrase begins and ends without cues.
*   **Language Barrier:** For students from economically weaker sections with limited English exposure, "are" is often seen as a connector rather than part of the verb itself.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
While the sentence is simple, the specific requirement to include the auxiliary verb "are" in a "verb phrase" is a common stumbling block. Most students in this demographic will likely identify "playing" alone.
