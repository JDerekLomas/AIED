Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is an English language item, the underlying cognitive skills involve logical sequencing, pattern recognition (Subject-Verb-Object), and structural mapping. In a mathematical sense, it requires the student to understand a linear permutation where only one specific order satisfies the "rule" (grammar).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **L1 Interference (S-V-O vs S-O-V):** In Hindi, the structure is Subject-Object-Verb ("वह किताब पढ़ रहा है" -> He book reading is). This is the most significant hurdle. This would lead to "He a book reading is," which is incorrect for this item.
*   **Capitalization/Punctuation neglect:** Students may ignore that "book" starts the sequence in the prompt but "He" must start the sentence.
*   **Word-for-word translation:** Translating directly from Hindi mental models often leads to incorrect syntax in English.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **High-frequency vocabulary:** Words like "book," "reading," and "he" are introduced very early (Grades 1-3).
*   **Familiar context:** The act of reading a book is a standard classroom activity.
*   **Short length:** Only five words are involved, reducing the cognitive load on working memory.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the S-O-V vs. S-V-O shift is a high-level conceptual hurdle.
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no options to choose from; the student must generate the syntax from scratch.
*   **Auxiliary Verb Placement:** Placing "is" correctly before the participle "reading" is a common struggle for English Language Learners (ELLs).

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given the target demographic (economically weaker sections, Hindi-medium backgrounds), the primary challenge is the syntactic inversion between Hindi and English. While the words are simple, a significant portion of students will likely produce "He a book reading is" or "He reading a book is" due to native language interference.
