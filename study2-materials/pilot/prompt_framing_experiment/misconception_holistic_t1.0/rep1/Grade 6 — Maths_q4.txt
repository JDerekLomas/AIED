### Analysis

**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   Knowledge of multiples and skip counting.
*   Understanding the concept of "Common" and "Least" in the context of numbers.
*   Procedural fluency in either the **Prime Factorization method** or the **Common Division (Ladder) method**.
*   Basic multiplication and division facts (specifically for divisors 2, 3, and 5).

**Step 2: Common Misconceptions**
*   **Confusing LCM with HCF (Highest Common Factor):** Students often find the largest number that divides the set (which is 1 in this case). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Product Misconception:** Believing the LCM is simply the product of all numbers ($12 \times 15 \times 20 = 3600$). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Partial Division:** In the common division method, students often forget to "bring down" a number if it isn't divisible by the current prime, or they stop too early. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the abbreviation "L.C.M." is often taught alongside "ल.स.प." (Laghuuttam Samapavartak). If they only know the Hindi term, they might struggle with the English acronym.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Standard Numbers:** 12, 15, and 20 are "friendly" numbers frequently used in textbook examples.
*   **Clear Result:** The LCM is 60, a small, familiar number.
*   **Rote Procedure:** In Indian government schools, the common division method is heavily drilled and practiced as a mechanical algorithm.
*   **No Word Problem:** There is no complex linguistic "wrapper" or context to decode, which helps students with limited English.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Open-ended:** No options to work backward from or to provide a "hint" of the scale of the answer.
*   **Three Numbers:** Finding the LCM of three numbers is significantly more prone to calculation errors than finding the LCM of two.
*   **Execution Errors:** A single multiplication error in the final step ($2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5$) results in zero marks according to the 1-point rubric.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
The numbers are very common in the Grade 6 curriculum, and the method is highly procedural. However, the lack of partial credit (1 or 0) and the common confusion between HCF and LCM among students from these backgrounds typically lowers the success rate.
