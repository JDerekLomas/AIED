Step 1: Identify the concepts and skills required.
Although this is a Social Science item, the cognitive skills required include defining a structural system, understanding hierarchical governance (local vs. state/central), and articulating the concept of "self-rule." Linguistically, it requires the ability to translate the familiar Hindi concept of "Gram Panchayat" into formal English academic terms.

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
1. Confusing roles: Students may believe the Panchayat’s primary role is judicial (settling disputes) rather than administrative/developmental. This would lead to a partially incorrect or narrow answer.
2. Hierarchical confusion: Students might see the Panchayat as merely a branch of the state government rather than an independent tier of "self-governance."
3. Language barrier: Students may know what a Sarpanch does but lack the English vocabulary ("grassroots," "administration," "governance") to meet the rubric's specific requirements.

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
The context is highly familiar. Most students from economically weaker sections in India, especially those with rural connections, have direct exposure to the Panchayati Raj. The term "Panchayat" is a household word.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
The open-ended (constructed response) format is significantly harder for English Language Learners (ELL) than a multiple-choice format. The rubric requires specific terminology ("local self-governance," "grassroots") which is linguistically demanding for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. Without options to recognize, they must generate formal academic English.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
While the concept is familiar, the requirement to explain it in formal English for a Grade 8 level, combined with the "primary role" abstraction, will be a significant barrier for this specific demographic.
