Step 1: Although this is a Science item, the "mathematical" logic required involves comparative analysis (A vs. B) and categorization. It requires understanding the structural relationship between a biological "system" and its "sub-parts" (the rumen vs. a single stomach).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- All animals digest food the same way (Incorrect answer).
- "Cows have four stomachs" (Technically a misconception of four *chambers*, but would lead to a **correct** answer under this rubric).
- Humans can digest grass if it is cooked (Incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The context (cows) is highly familiar to students in rural or economically weaker sections in India.
- The "one key difference" requirement is a low threshold.
- The rubric is generous, accepting "special stomach" or "multiple sections."

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- English proficiency: Words like "digestive system," "ruminant," and "mention" are academic vocabulary that might baffle Hindi-medium students.
- Open-ended format: No cues or options to trigger memory.
- Requirement to link the difference to "diet" (cellulose/grass vs. human food) adds a layer of reasoning beyond simple recall.

Step 5: While the concept of a cow's stomach is a staple of Grade 7 NCERT Science, the language barrier for these specific students and the open-ended nature of the question pose significant hurdles.
