Step 1: The question is primarily a Science recall task rather than mathematical. However, cognitive skills required include identifying physical properties of matter and correlating a specific mechanical process (beating into sheets) with a technical term.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Confusing "Malleability" with "Ductility" (drawing into wires). This is the most likely cause of incorrect answers on this item.
- Confusing "Malleability" with "Plasticity" or "Elasticity" (though less common in Grade 8).
- A conceptual misunderstanding that "softness" is the property, rather than the ability to deform under compression.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The context is highly familiar (aluminum foil and food wrapping).
- This is a "low-order" recall question (knowledge level).
- "Malleability" is a foundational term emphasized in Grade 8 textbooks (NCERT).

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- Language barrier: "Malleability" is a difficult English word to spell and remember for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. In Hindi, the term is "आघातवर्धनीयता" (Aaghatvardhaniyata), which is also complex.
- Open-ended format: There are no options to trigger recognition; the student must recall the specific technical term from memory.
- Spelling errors: Students may lose marks if the rubric is strictly applied, especially given English proficiency issues.

Step 5: Considering the high emphasis on this specific property in Indian curricula and the familiarity of the example (foil), but balancing it against the linguistic difficulty of the term for this specific demographic:
