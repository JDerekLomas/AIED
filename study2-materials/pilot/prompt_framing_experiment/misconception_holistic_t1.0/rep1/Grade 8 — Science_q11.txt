Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   **Data Interpretation:** Reading and comparing values in a table.
*   **Ordering Decimals/Integers:** Identifying the "maximum" value from a set of data points (assuming the table provided expansion coefficients).
*   **Logical Reasoning:** Connecting the physical property of thermal expansion to real-world applications (railway tracks).
*   **Multivariate Analysis:** Balancing multiple properties (conductivity vs. expansion) to make a recommendation for electrical wires.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **"Bigger is better" for all contexts:** A student might think high expansion is good for wires, leading to a wrong choice in (c). 
*   **Confusing Heat and Electricity:** Students often conflate thermal conductivity with electrical conductivity.
*   **Decimal Place Value Misconceptions:** If the expansion values were decimals (e.g., 0.000023), students might misidentify which number is "larger."
*   **Language Interference:** For Hindi-medium students, the word "expand" might be less familiar than the concept of "phelna," potentially leading to confusion if they can't bridge the terminology.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** Railway tracks are a standard, rote-memorized example in Indian Science textbooks (NCERT).
*   **Direct Retrieval:** Part (a) is a simple observation task if the table is clear.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Complex Question Structure:** The item asks three distinct questions (a, b, and c) but the rubric only awards 1 mark for part (a). This is highly confusing; a student might answer (b) and (c) correctly but lose the mark if they fail part (a), or vice versa.
*   **Language Barrier:** The phrase "recommend for electrical wires" involves higher-order English synthesis which is difficult for ESL learners.
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no cues or options to guide the student.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While part (a) is simple data reading, the misalignment between the three-part question and the 1-point rubric suggests many students might provide incomplete answers or focus on the "why" sections (b and c) and skip the specific identification in (a) required by the rubric. Given the linguistic challenges and the multi-part nature of the task for a single point:
