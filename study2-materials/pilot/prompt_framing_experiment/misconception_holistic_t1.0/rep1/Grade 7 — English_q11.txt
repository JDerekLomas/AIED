Step 1: Identify the linguistic and grammatical concepts required.
The student must distinguish between parts of speech (adjective vs. noun/verb) and understand the concept of an "adjective phrase." However, the rubric contradicts the question: it asks for an "adjective phrase" (which technically doesn't exist as a multi-word phrase here, unless referring to "A tiny") but the rubric accepts the single word "tiny."

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Adjective vs. Adverb:** Students may confuse describing words with action words.
*   **Phrase vs. Word:** Students might look for a multi-word sequence because the question asks for a "phrase," potentially leading them to choose "in our balcony" (prepositional phrase) or "its nest." This misconception would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Vocabulary:** Students with limited English proficiency might not know the word "tiny," though "bird" and "nest" are generally familiar.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Simple Sentence Structure:** Subject-Verb-Object-Place is the most basic English sentence structure.
*   **Familiar Context:** Birds and nests are common, universal concepts.
*   **Rubric Lenience:** If the student identifies the single word "tiny," they get the point, even if they don't understand what a "phrase" is.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, identifying grammatical categories in English is significantly harder than in their native tongue.
*   **Terminology Confusion:** The term "Adjective Phrase" is more advanced than "Adjective." A student who knows "tiny" is an adjective might hesitate because they are looking for a "phrase."
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no options to choose from, requiring active recall.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the word "tiny" is relatively common, the mismatch between the question (asking for a phrase) and the rubric (accepting a word), combined with the English language barrier for this specific demographic, will likely cause confusion. Many students may guess "in our balcony" as it is the most prominent "phrase" in the sentence.
