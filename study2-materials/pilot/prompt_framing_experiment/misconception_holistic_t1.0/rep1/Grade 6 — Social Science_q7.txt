Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, it requires cognitive skills similar to multi-step problem solving: categorization (identifying "natural resources"), retrieval of localized data, and establishing a causal relationship (influence on life).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
1. Confusing "Natural Resources" with "Man-made Infrastructure" (e.g., listing "Roads" or "Schools"). This leads to an incorrect answer.
2. Confusion between "Natural Resource" and "Occupations" (e.g., listing "Farming" as the resource rather than soil/water). This leads to an incorrect answer.
3. Geographical conflation: Attributing resources found in other states (like Coal from Jharkhand) to Rajasthan. This leads to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
The context is highly familiar; Rajasthan’s minerals and desert climate are core components of the local state curriculum. Students living in the region likely have daily exposure to the "influence" of resources like water or sunlight.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
1. Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students with limited English, "Mention," "Natural Resources," and "Influences" are academic vocabulary words that may be difficult to decode.
2. Complexity/Rubric Mismatch: The question asks for two resources and an explanation of one, yet the maximum score is only 1. This "all or nothing" grading for a multi-part open-ended question is punitive.
3. Open-ended format: No cues or options are provided to trigger memory.
4. Writing requirement: Explaining "how" requires sentence construction in English, which is a significant barrier for this demographic.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
The high linguistic demand of the "explain" portion, combined with the low point value (giving no credit for partial knowledge), will result in many students failing to provide a complete, grammatically coherent answer in English, even if they possess the geographical knowledge.
