**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Concept of Unit Rate:** Understanding that the total distance is the product of the rate (km per litre) and the quantity (total litres).
*   **Operation Identification:** Recognizing that the problem requires multiplication of a whole number by a mixed fraction.
*   **Fractional Arithmetic:** Converting the mixed number $5 \frac{3}{4}$ into an improper fraction ($\frac{23}{4}$) and multiplying it by 10.
*   **Decimal/Fraction Simplification:** Calculating $10 \times \frac{23}{4} = \frac{230}{4} = 57.5$ or $57 \frac{1}{2}$.

**Step 2: Common Misconceptions**
*   **"Multiplication makes bigger, Division makes smaller":** Students often struggle when fractions are involved, but since $5 \frac{3}{4}$ is greater than 1, this misconception might actually lead them toward the correct operation (multiplication).
*   **Additive Thinking:** Some students might try to add 10 and $5 \frac{3}{4}$ (leading to $15 \frac{3}{4}$), which results in an incorrect answer.
*   **Ignoring the Fraction:** Students might multiply $10 \times 5$ and simply append the $\frac{3}{4}$ or ignore it entirely, leading to 50 or $50 \frac{3}{4}$. This results in an incorrect answer.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Familiar Context:** The "mileage" of a vehicle is a very common real-world scenario in Indian contexts.
*   **Simple Base Number:** Using "10" as the multiplier simplifies the arithmetic significantly, as it only requires shifting a decimal point or simple doubling/halving.
*   **Operation Familiarity:** Multiplication for "total distance" is a standard word problem archetype practiced heavily in Grade 6 and 7.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students with limited English, "How far" and "on X litres" might be confusing, though the mathematical structure is standard.
*   **Mixed Fractions:** Converting $5 \frac{3}{4}$ is a major hurdle for students with weak foundational skills. Many students in economically weaker sections (EWS) experience significant learning gaps in fractional operations.
*   **Open-ended Format:** Without options to choose from (MCQs), students cannot "guess and check" or use process of elimination.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
While the concept is straightforward, the combination of a mixed fraction and the English-language phrasing presents a significant barrier for Grade 7 students in this specific demographic. While many will identify the operation, a large portion will likely stumble on the fractional conversion or the calculation.
