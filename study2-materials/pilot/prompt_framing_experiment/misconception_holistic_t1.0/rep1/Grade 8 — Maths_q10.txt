### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills
*   **Geometric Properties:** Knowledge of the "Angle Sum Property of a Triangle" (sum = 180°).
*   **Linear Pairs:** Understanding that angles on a straight line sum to 180°.
*   **Algebraic Application:** Setting up and solving a basic linear equation (e.g., $x + 50 + 50 = 180$ or similar, depending on the figure's orientation).
*   **Reasoning:** Providing a logical justification (naming the property used).

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Incorrect Sum:** Thinking the sum of angles in a triangle is 90° or 360°. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Visual Guessing:** Assuming a triangle is isosceles or equilateral just because it "looks" like it, without checking marks. (May lead to incorrect $x$ if the figure is a scalene triangle).
*   **Exterior Angle Confusion:** Confusing the exterior angle with the interior angle. (Leads to incorrect $y$ if $y$ is external).
*   **Calculation Errors:** Simple subtraction errors from 180. (Leads to incorrect answer).

### Step 3: Factors Making it Easier
*   **Familiarity:** This is a "bread and butter" problem for Grade 8. The Angle Sum Property is heavily drilled in Indian state boards (NCERT/SCERT).
*   **Simple Numbers:** Usually, these problems use multiples of 5 or 10, making mental math easy.
*   **Visual Cues:** Geometric diagrams transcend language barriers, which helps Hindi-medium/ESL students.

### Step 4: Factors Making it Harder
*   **The "Reason" Requirement:** The rubric requires stating the reason. Many students can calculate the value but fail to write "Angle Sum Property," losing the mark according to the rubric.
*   **Language Barrier:** While the math is visual, the instruction "Find the angle measures" and the requirement to "state the reason" in English can be a hurdle for students with limited English proficiency.
*   **Dual Variables:** Finding both $x$ and $y$ adds a step. If they find $x$ but forget $y$, they fail the rubric.
*   **No Multiple Choice:** There is no "guess and check" strategy available.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
Given that these students are from economically weaker sections with language barriers, they often rely on rote-learned procedures. While they are usually proficient at the calculation $180 - (a+b)$, the requirement to provide a formal written "reason" in English and the multi-step nature of finding two variables $(x, y)$ usually sees a significant drop in "fully correct" scores.
