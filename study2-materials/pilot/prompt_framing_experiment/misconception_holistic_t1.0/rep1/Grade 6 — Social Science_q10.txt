Step 1: This is a Social Science (Geography/Culture) question, not a mathematical one. However, the logical processing involves categorization (regional festivals) and sequencing (naming followed by description).
Step 2: Misconceptions include confusing national festivals (Diwali/Holi) with state-specific ones (Pushkar/Gangaur) or confusing a "fair" with a "festival." Since the rubric only awards points for naming two distinct fairs/festivals, a student who describes one but fails to name two distinct ones would get 0 marks.
Step 3: The context is highly familiar to students in India. Even with limited English, "Rajasthan," "fair," and "festival" are recognizable loanwords or high-frequency vocabulary. Local knowledge often compensates for language barriers in Social Science.
Step 4: The item is hard due to the English proficiency barrier (writing a full sentence in English) and a restrictive rubric (it asks for a description but the rubric only allocates the 1 point for the names, which might confuse students on where to focus). The requirement for "two distinct" items and a "one sentence" description makes it a multi-part open-ended task.
Step 5: Given the English language barrier for Hindi-medium students and the specific requirement to name two state-specific items correctly to get the single point, many students may provide national festivals or struggle with the sentence structure.
