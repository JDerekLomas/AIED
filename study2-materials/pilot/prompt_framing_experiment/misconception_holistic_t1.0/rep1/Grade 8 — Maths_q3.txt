**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   Understanding the definition of probability as a ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes ($P(E) = \frac{n(E)}{n(S)}$).
*   Arithmetic addition to find the total number of outcomes ($4 + 6 = 10$).
*   Information extraction: Identifying "4" as the favorable outcomes for "black" and "6" as the non-favorable.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Ratio Misconception:** Expressing probability as "favorable to unfavorable" (4:6) instead of "favorable to total" (4/10). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Equiprobability Bias:** Thinking all outcomes are 50/50 regardless of quantity. This would lead to an incorrect answer (1/2).
*   **Whole Number Bias:** Providing the count (4) instead of the ratio. This would lead to an incorrect answer.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Familiar Context:** Bags and balls are a standard, concrete representation used in Indian textbooks (NCERT).
*   **Simple Numbers:** Adding 4 and 6 to get 10 makes the calculation trivial and decimal conversion (0.4) easy if needed.
*   **Direct Questioning:** The question asks for the black ball directly, which is the first number mentioned.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** Terms like "drawn at random" and "favorable outcomes" can be confusing for Hindi-medium students if they haven't been taught the English terminology.
*   **Open-ended Format:** Without multiple-choice options, students must recall the formula from memory without a visual cue.
*   **Simplification:** If a student reaches 4/10, they may be unsure if they must simplify it to 2/5 to receive the mark (though the rubric suggests 4/10 is acceptable).

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
Given that this is a standard "Type 1" probability question found in Grade 8 NCERT textbooks, most students will recognize the procedure. However, the linguistic leap for students from economically weaker sections and the common "favorable/unfavorable" ratio error will reduce the success rate.
