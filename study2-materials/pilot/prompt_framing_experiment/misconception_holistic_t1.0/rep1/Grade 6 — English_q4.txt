Step 1: This is a vocabulary-based comprehension item requiring semantic mapping (synonym identification). Students must scan a passage, hold the definition "shining brightly" in working memory, and identify a word that functions as a synonym.

Step 2: Common misconceptions/errors:
- Over-extension: Choosing any word related to light (e.g., "sun," "star," "lamp") rather than the specific adjective/verb describing the quality of light. This leads to an incorrect answer.
- Part of Speech Mismatch: Selecting a noun when an adjective/participle is required. This leads to an incorrect answer.
- Surface Scanning: Selecting the first word they don't recognize, assuming it must be the "complex" word they are looking for.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The phrase "shining brightly" uses high-frequency, basic vocabulary that even Hindi-medium students are likely to know. "Glowing" is a common word often introduced in early English language modules.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: 
- Open-ended format: No options are provided to trigger recognition; the student must recall or find the word independently.
- Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students, mapping English definitions to English synonyms is a higher-order task than translating to the mother tongue.
- Contextual dependence: The difficulty relies entirely on the complexity of the "passage" provided (not shown here), which might contain distracting words.

Step 5: Considering the student profile (economically weaker sections, Hindi-medium background), vocabulary-finding tasks in English are traditionally difficult. While the words are simple, the lack of multiple-choice options significantly lowers the success rate for students with limited English fluency.
