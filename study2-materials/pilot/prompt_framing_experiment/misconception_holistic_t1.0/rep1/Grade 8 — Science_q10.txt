Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a science question, it requires understanding magnitudes and sequences. Students must grasp the concept of "rate of change" (rapid heating and sudden cooling) and the chronological sequencing of events (Process A then Process B). It also involves quantitative literacy regarding temperature ($70^\circ\text{C}$) and time (seconds), even if the rubric does not strictly require the specific digits.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Boiling vs. Pasteurization:** Many students believe milk must be "boiled" (100°C) to be safe. This might lead them to describe a standard boiling process rather than the specific two-step pasteurization process.
*   **Cooling is passive:** Students often assume "cooling" means letting it sit at room temperature, rather than the "sudden/quick cooling" essential to the process.
*   **Duration:** A common misconception is that the longer you heat something, the safer it is; the idea of "short duration" ($15\text{--}30$ seconds) is counter-intuitive to domestic practices.
*   *Impact:* These lead to partially correct answers that may miss the "quick cooling" element required for the full mark.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **High Contextual Familiarity:** Milk preservation is a daily reality in Indian households. The term "Pasteurized" is printed on almost every milk packet (Aashirvaad, Amul, Mother Dairy) available in urban and semi-urban areas.
*   **Lenient Rubric:** The fact that specific numbers are not required significantly lowers the barrier for students with low rote-memory recall or language barriers.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** Describing a "process" requires syntax and transition words (first, then, because). For Hindi-medium students in an English-medium assessment, articulating the "sudden cooling" aspect is linguistically demanding.
*   **Open-ended Format:** There are no cues or options to trigger recognition; it requires pure recall and synthesis.
*   **Two-part Question:** The question asks for both the "process" and the "why" (preservation), but the rubric only awards 1 mark. This can lead to students providing only half the answer and losing the full mark.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
The concept is a staple of the Grade 8 NCERT syllabus (Chapter: Microorganisms). While the familiarity of milk is high, the requirement to explain a multi-step sequence in a second language (English) without a word bank makes it challenging for students from economically weaker sections who may not have reinforced these terms at home.
