**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Properties of Parallelograms:** Understanding that opposite angles are equal ($x = 110^\circ$) and adjacent angles are supplementary (sum to $180^\circ$).
*   **Transversal laws:** Recognizing the relationship between interior angles on the same side of a transversal.
*   **Reasoning/Communication:** Providing a written explanation for why $x = 110^\circ$ (e.g., "Opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal").

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Linear Pair Confusion:** Students might incorrectly assume $x$ and $110^\circ$ must add up to $180^\circ$ because they are "near" each other. This would lead to an incorrect answer ($x = 70^\circ$).
*   **Confusion with y:** If the student finds $y$ correctly ($70^\circ$) but mixes up the labels for $x$ and $y$, they fail the rubric.
*   **Terminological confusion:** Students might know the property but lack the English vocabulary to "explain" it as required by the rubric.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Simple Numbers:** $110$ is a "friendly" number to work with.
*   **Standard Visual:** Parallelograms are a core part of the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum, and this is a prototypical textbook problem.
*   **Direct Question:** There is no complex word-problem "story" to decode.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students with limited English, the instruction "give an explanation for it" is a significant hurdle. Even if they know $x=110$, they may fail to write a valid English sentence.
*   **Rubric Rigidity:** The rubric requires both the correct value AND an explanation for a single mark. Partial credit is not available.
*   **Multi-variable task:** Asking for both $x$ and $y$ increases the cognitive load and the chance of a transcription error.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
While the calculation is straightforward, the requirement for a written explanation in English, combined with the "all-or-nothing" scoring (0 or 1), will significantly lower the success rate for students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds. Many will provide the number but fail the "explanation" criteria.
