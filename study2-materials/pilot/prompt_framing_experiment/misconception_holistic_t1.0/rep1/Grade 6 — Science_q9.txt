Step 1: The item requires recall of biological classifications (protective foods) and specific associations between nutrients and deficiency diseases. It tests scientific literacy and descriptive writing rather than mathematical concepts.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include the idea that "protective foods" provide physical protection (like skin or bone strength) rather than immune support, or confusing vitamins/minerals with energy-giving foods (carbohydrates). In part (b), students often swap deficiencies (e.g., naming a vitamin deficiency for a mineral). These would lead to incorrect or partially correct answers.

Step 3: Ease factors: The topic "Components of Food" is a core, early-chapter topic in Grade 6. The term "protective" is somewhat intuitive. Examples like Scurvy (Vitamin C) or Anemia (Iron) are frequently drilled through rote memorization in Indian classrooms.

Step 4: Hardness factors: The open-ended format requires writing in English, which is a significant barrier for Hindi-medium/ESL students. The rubric requires a two-part explanation for a single mark ("fight disease" AND "keep healthy"), making it "all or nothing." Students may know the answer in their native language but struggle to articulate the specific scientific phrasing required by the rubric in English.

Step 5: While the content is familiar, the requirement to answer two distinct parts (a and b) for a single mark, combined with the language barrier and the need for descriptive writing, significantly lowers the likely success rate.
