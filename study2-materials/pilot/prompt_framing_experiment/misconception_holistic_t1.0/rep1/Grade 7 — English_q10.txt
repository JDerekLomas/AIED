Step 1: Although the subject is English, the analytical concepts required include logical sequencing, transformation rules (if-then logic), and set-mapping (pronoun mapping). Students must recognize the structure of direct speech and apply a multi-part algorithm: 1. Removal of punctuation, 2. Addition of the conjunction "that," 3. Pronoun shift based on the speaker, and 4. Tense backshifting (Present Continuous to Past Continuous).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- "Literalism": Keeping the pronoun "I" because they see the sentence as a fixed entity (would lead to an incorrect answer).
- "Tense Blindness": Believing the action is still happening now, thus keeping "am reading" (would lead to an incorrect answer).
- "Connective Omission": Forgetting the word "that" (might be accepted under "minor variations," but often leads to structural errors).
- "Quotation Retention": Keeping the quotation marks in the transformed sentence (incorrect).

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The vocabulary is very basic ("reading," "novel"). The sentence follows the most standard Subject-Verb-Object pattern. The reporting verb "said" is the most common and simplest form, requiring no change (unlike "said to" becoming "told").

Step 4: Factors making it harder: This is a constructed-response item (no options to choose from), which is difficult for English Language Learners (ELLs). Hindi-medium students often struggle with "backshifting" tenses because Hindi handles reported speech differently (often using the "as it was said" format). Changing "I" to "she" requires a level of syntactic processing that is often a hurdle for students with limited English exposure.

Step 5: Given the specific demographic (economically weaker sections, Hindi-medium background), while the sentence is simple, the transition from direct to indirect speech is one of the most mechanically complex tasks in Grade 7 grammar. Many students will likely get the pronoun right but fail the tense shift, or vice versa.
