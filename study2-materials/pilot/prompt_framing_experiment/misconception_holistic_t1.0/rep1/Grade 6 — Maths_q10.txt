Step 1: Concepts and skills required include understanding the definition of an angle, aligning the protractor's baseline and center point (vertex) correctly, reading the correct scale (inner vs. outer), and marking/connecting points accurately to form rays.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Scale Confusion: Reading the wrong scale (e.g., drawing 70° instead of 110°). This is highly likely to lead to an incorrect answer for 110°.
- Alignment Errors: Not aligning the vertex or the 0-line, leading to inaccuracies.
- Vertex Placement: Confusing the center mark of the protractor with the edge of the tool.

Step 3: Ease factors: The numbers (110° and 40°) are multiples of 10, making them easy to find on the scale. Drawing angles is a standard, procedural task heavily practiced in Grade 6.

Step 4: Hardness factors: The 110° angle is obtuse; many students struggle to identify that it should look "wider" than a right angle and mistakenly use the 70° mark. For students with limited English proficiency, the phrasing "draw angle having the following angles" is slightly ungrammatical and potentially confusing, though the intent is clear. The rubric only awards a point for the 110° angle, which is the more difficult of the two due to scale inversion.

Step 5: While procedural, the "wrong scale" error (drawing 70° for 110°) is the single most common mistake in protractor use at this level, often affecting nearly half of the student population in high-stakes or resource-limited environments.
