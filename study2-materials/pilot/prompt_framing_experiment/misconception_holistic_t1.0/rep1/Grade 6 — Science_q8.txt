Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Science item, the cognitive skills required include observation-to-inference logic (if P, then Q), understanding cause-and-effect relationships, and qualitative analysis of variables (growth and color as indicators of resource levels).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   "Plants eat soil": Students may think the plant is "hungry" but fail to use scientific terms like nutrients or minerals. (Correct under rubric)
*   "Sunlight is only for warmth": Students may not connect yellowing specifically to a lack of light/photosynthesis. (Incorrect if they focus only on temperature)
*   "Water is the only thing plants need": Students often default to "lack of water" for any plant problem. (Correct under rubric)
*   Misconception of "Inference": Students often describe the symptom again ("The plant is sick") rather than inferring the cause. (Incorrect)

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   Context: Gardening and farming are highly familiar to students from economically weaker sections or rural backgrounds.
*   Rubric: The rubric is extremely generous, accepting any one of three major factors (nutrients, light, or water).

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Language Barrier: The words "stunted," "infer," and "evidence" are high-level English vocabulary. Hindi-medium students may struggle to understand what the question is asking even if they know the science.
*   Open-ended format: Requires generating a sentence rather than picking an option.
*   Scientific Reasoning: Moving from an observation (yellow leaves) to a biological requirement requires a leap beyond rote memorization.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the linguistic difficulty of the prompt (specifically "stunted" and "infer") balanced against the very broad and forgiving rubric, many students will likely provide a simple answer like "It needs water" or "No minerals," but a significant portion will be tripped up by the English phrasing.
