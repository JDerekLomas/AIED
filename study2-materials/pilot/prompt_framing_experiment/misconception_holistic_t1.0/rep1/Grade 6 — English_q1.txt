Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is an English language item, the cognitive skills involved include information retrieval and spatial prepositional mapping. In a cross-disciplinary sense, it requires the ability to identify a specific "variable" (the location) within a set of data (the text).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
1. **Literal vs. Inferential:** Students may confuse where the book *was* with where it was *mentioned* (e.g., answering with the character's name or "in the house").
2. **Prepositional Errors:** Using "on the attic" or "at the attic." According to the rubric, these would likely still be marked correct if "attic" is present, so this misconception won't lead to an incorrect answer here.
3. **Vocabulary Gap:** For Hindi-medium students, the word "attic" is often a "Tier 3" vocabulary word. They may know the Hindi equivalent (*atariya* or *tand*), but not the English term, leading to an incorrect answer despite understanding the story.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
The rubric is highly flexible, accepting one-word answers ("attic"). The context of finding something is a universal human experience. The question follows a standard "Wh-" format which is heavily drilled in Indian government schools.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
The open-ended format (no options) is significantly harder for ELL (English Language Learner) students than a multiple-choice format. The word "attic" is the primary hurdle; it is not a common household feature in many urban Indian poor dwellings (which might have "lofts" or "shelves" instead), making the concept culturally distal.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given the English proficiency levels in economically weaker section schools and the specific vocabulary barrier of the word "attic," many students will likely locate the correct sentence in the text but may struggle to extract or spell the specific noun correctly without options.
