Step 1: Identify the concepts and skills required.
Though categorized under "mathematics education" in the prompt, this is a Social Science item. The required skills are: understanding historical causality, recalling specific policies (Forest Acts, Land Revenue systems), and the ability to articulate "impact" (cause and effect). Linguistically, it requires transitioning from Hindi-medium concepts to English expression.

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
1. Chronological confusion: Attributing modern tribal issues to the British era or vice versa (Might lead to an incorrect answer if the example is non-colonial).
2. Generalization: Assuming British rule was either entirely "good" (civilizing) or "bad" without specific evidence (Leads to vague answers that fail the "two distinct examples" requirement).
3. Conflating "Tribals" with "Peasants": Failing to distinguish between forest-based economies and agrarian economies (Could lead to partial credit or incorrect examples).

Step 3: Factors that make it easier.
1. High curriculum alignment: This is a core topic in Grade 8 NCERT History (Chapter: "Tribals, Dikus and the Vision of a Golden Age").
2. Emotional resonance: The narrative of struggle against exploitation is often culturally reinforced and easier to remember than abstract data.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
1. Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, explaining "disruption" or "exploitation" in English is a high cognitive load.
2. Structure: The rubric requires a "clear explanation" and "two distinct examples" for only 1 mark. This is a high-density requirement for a single point.
3. Open-ended format: No cues or options to trigger recognition; requires pure recall.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given the English language barrier and the requirement to provide two specific examples for a single mark, many students will provide a general sentiment (e.g., "British were bad to them") without the "distinct examples" required for the full score.
