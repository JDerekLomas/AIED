Step 1: This is a reading comprehension task based on the story "The Three Questions." While the prompt asks for mathematical concepts, in this context, the "logic" involves identifying cause-and-effect relationships and extracting specific information from a narrative text.

Step 2: Misconceptions in this context often involve "keyword matching" without understanding the syntax. Students might see the word "reward" and associate it with "winning a war" or "giving money to the poor" based on general prior knowledge rather than the text. However, since this is a standard textbook story, most students rely on rote memorization of the plot.

Step 3: Ease factors: The story is a staple of the NCERT Grade 7 curriculum. The context of a "King" and a "Reward" is very familiar in Indian folklore and storytelling. The question "Why..." is a foundational inquiry structure.

Step 4: Hardness factors: The open-ended nature requires students to construct a sentence in English. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the transition from understanding the reason (in Hindi) to articulating it (in English) is a significant barrier. They may know the answer but fail to produce a grammatically "correct" enough sentence for some evaluators.

Step 5: Given that this specific story is heavily emphasized in Indian government school classrooms and frequently appears in mock tests, a majority of students will recognize the required answer through a mix of comprehension and memorization.
