### Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required
*   **Knowledge of Formulas:** Recalling the perimeter of a rectangle ($P = 2(l + w)$) and the area of a rectangle ($A = l \times w$).
*   **Algebraic Manipulation:** Setting up an equation ($32 = 2(10 + w)$) and solving for an unknown variable (width).
*   **Arithmetic:** Basic addition, subtraction, and division to isolate the variable.
*   **Multi-step execution:** Using the derived width to calculate the final area ($10 \times 6$).

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Perimeter vs. Area:** Confusing the two concepts. If a student tries to divide 32 by 10 to find width, they will fail. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Incomplete formula application:** Adding only one length and one width ($10 + w = 32$). This would lead to $w = 22$, which is incorrect.
*   **Order of Operations (BODMAS):** Errors in solving $2(10 + w) = 32$, such as subtracting 10 before dividing by 2 ($32 - 10 = 22$, then $22/2 = 11$). (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Dimensionality:** Forgetting units or using square units for width. (May lead to partial credit loss, though the rubric is binary).

### Step 3: Factors making the item easier
*   **Simple Integers:** The numbers (32, 10, 6) are small and easy to work with mentally.
*   **Familiar Context:** Geometry (rectangles) is a standard part of the Grade 6 and 7 Indian NCERT curriculum.
*   **Standard Problem Type:** This is a "backwards" calculation problem commonly found in textbooks (finding dimensions from perimeter).

### Step 4: Factors making the item harder
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, terms like "Perimeter" (Parimap) and "Width" (Chaudai) might be confusing if the question is only in English.
*   **Multi-step requirement:** The student must find the width first to find the area. The rubric specifically looks for the width calculation, but the question asks for two distinct values.
*   **Open-ended:** No options to work backward from or to provide a "hint" of the scale.
*   **Rubric Rigidity:** The rubric awards 1 point for the width but mentions finding the area in the prompt; for many EWS/Government school students, completing both steps without error is a significant hurdle.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the math is foundational, the combination of multi-step logic (finding $w$ to find $A$) and the potential language barrier for English-language test items in this specific demographic usually results in a significant drop-off in performance. Many students may find the width correctly but fail to calculate the area, or make a mistake in the algebraic transposition.
