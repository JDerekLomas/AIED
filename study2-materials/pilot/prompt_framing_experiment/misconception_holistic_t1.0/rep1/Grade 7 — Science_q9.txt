Step 1: Identify the scientific concepts and skills required.
Students must recall the term "insectivorous" or "heterotrophic/partial heterotrophic nutrition." They need to understand the physiological trade-off between photosynthesis (energy production) and nitrogen deficiency in specific soils. They also need to retrieve a specific example (e.g., Venus flytrap or Sundew) from memory.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Misconception 1: Plants are only autotrophs.** Many students believe if a plant is green, it cannot eat "food" like animals do. This leads to confusion regarding why a green plant would trap insects.
*   **Misconception 2: Insects are the plant's "food" (energy source).** Students often think the plant eats insects because it can't make glucose, rather than for nitrogen.
*   **Misconception 3: Confusion of terms.** Hindi-medium students often know the concept as "Keet-bhakshi" (insect-eating) but may struggle to recall or spell the technical English term "Insectivorous."

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** The pitcher plant is a standard, vivid example found in almost all Grade 7 NCERT textbooks.
*   **Visual Language:** The phrase "trap-like structure" in the prompt provides a strong hint for the answer.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For students with limited English proficiency, explaining "Why" in part (b) is significantly harder than a multiple-choice question.
*   **Scientific Vocabulary:** The rubric specifically looks for "insectivorous." Spelling this long, complex word is a major hurdle for students from economically weaker sections with limited English exposure.
*   **Three-Part Requirement:** While the rubric mentions a score of 1 based on part (a), usually in Indian government school contexts, all three parts must be addressed. Part (c) requires specific rote memorization of an additional example.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the concept is well-taught, the combination of requiring a specific technical term in English and a written explanation of nitrogen deficiency makes this challenging for the target demographic. Many will understand the concept but fail to provide the exact technical English terminology required for full marks.
