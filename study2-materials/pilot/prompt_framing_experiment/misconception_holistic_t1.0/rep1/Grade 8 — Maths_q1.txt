Step 1: Concepts and Skills
*   Understanding of linear equations in one variable.
*   Application of the transposition method (moving terms across the equals sign).
*   Integer arithmetic, specifically subtracting a larger positive integer from a smaller one ($4 - 9$).

Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Sign Neglect:** Ignoring the negative sign when subtracting a larger number from a smaller one (resulting in $y = 5$). **Relevant here.**
*   **Inverse Operation Confusion:** Using the wrong operation when transposing (e.g., adding 9 to 4 instead of subtracting). **Relevant here.**
*   **Variable as a Label:** Treating $y$ as a shorthand for a word rather than a placeholder for a value. (Less likely to impact this specific calculation).

Step 3: Factors making it easier
*   **Simplicity:** The equation is a single-step linear equation.
*   **Low Linguistic Load:** The question uses minimal English ("Find the value of"), which is helpful for students with limited English proficiency.
*   **Small Numbers:** The numbers (9 and 4) are single digits and easy to manipulate.

Step 4: Factors making it harder
*   **Integer Result:** The result is a negative integer. For students in this demographic, the transition from whole numbers to integers often remains a significant hurdle.
*   **Constructed Response:** Without multiple-choice options, students cannot use "plug-and-test" strategies or recognize a negative sign among choices.
*   **Subtraction order:** Students often instinctively subtract the smaller number from the larger ($9 - 4$), leading to $5$.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the structure is simple, the "trap" of the negative result is the primary barrier. In many Indian government school contexts, mastery of integer subtraction lags behind procedural knowledge of transposition.
