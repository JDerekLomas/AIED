Step 1: The mathematical concepts required are minimal, as this is a science item. However, it requires logical categorization and proportional reasoning (darker = more absorption, lighter = less). It involves understanding heat transfer (radiation and conduction) and evaporation (latent heat).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- "White clothes produce coolness" rather than reflecting heat (Would lead to a correct but poorly phrased answer).
- "Cotton is inherently cold" rather than being breathable or absorbent (May lead to an incorrect answer if not linked to sweat/evaporation).
- Confusing "reflection" with "insulation."
- Thinking light colors "attract" cold.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- Highly familiar context: Students in India have direct lived experience with extreme summer heat and traditional cotton clothing.
- Low linguistic barrier for the concept: The idea that "white is cool" is common in local vernacular (Hindi: "thanda" or "safed rang dhoop nahi sota").
- Simple causal relationship (Color -> Heat; Fabric -> Sweat).

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- English Proficiency: Expressing "reflection" or "absorption" in English is difficult for Hindi-medium students.
- Open-ended format: Requires generating two distinct reasons rather than recognizing one.
- Scientific Vocabulary: The rubric asks for "scientific reasons," but the students might use colloquial language that doesn't meet the "properties of fabric" criteria.
- Double-barreled requirement: Must address both color and fabric (cotton).

Step 5: While the concept is intuitive, the requirement to explain two scientific properties in English, combined with the open-ended nature of the question, creates a significant barrier for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency.
