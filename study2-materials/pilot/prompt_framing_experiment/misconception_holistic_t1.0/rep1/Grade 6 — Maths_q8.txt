Step 1: Concepts and skills required include knowledge of the formulas for the area ($L \times B$) and perimeter ($2 \times [L + B]$) of a rectangle, basic multiplication and addition, and the ability to distinguish between square units and linear units.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
*   **Confusing Area and Perimeter:** Using the perimeter formula when asked for area, or vice versa. (Would lead to an incorrect answer).
*   **Additive Misconception:** Adding the length and breadth ($15+8=23$) and stopping there. (Would lead to an incorrect answer).
*   **Unit Confusion:** Using cm instead of sq. cm for area. While the rubric specifically asks for 120 sq. cm, many students forget the squared notation.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The numbers (15 and 8) are simple and within standard multiplication table range. "Length" and "Breadth" are standard terms in Indian textbooks (often preferred over "width"). The context is a standard geometric shape.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with "Breadth" if they are more accustomed to "Chaudai" (चौड़ाई).
*   **Double Task:** The question asks for two things (area and perimeter) but the rubric only specifies the area for the 1-mark score. This ambiguity can confuse a student—if they get the perimeter right but the area wrong, they fail.
*   **Format:** It is a free-response question, meaning there are no options to provide a "hint" or narrow down the possibilities.

Step 5: Holistically, while the math is foundational, the combination of two tasks for a single mark and the common tendency to swap the two formulas (Area vs. Perimeter) creates a significant hurdle for Grade 6 students in this demographic.
