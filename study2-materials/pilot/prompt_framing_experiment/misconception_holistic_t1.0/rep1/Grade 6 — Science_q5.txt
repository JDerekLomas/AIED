Step 1: This is a Science item, not a Mathematics item. However, the cognitive skills required include sequential recall (procedural steps) and cause-effect reasoning (chemical reaction resulting in color change).

Step 2: Misconceptions include confusing iodine with other chemicals (like caustic soda or copper sulphate used in protein tests), or believing that any liquid added will cause a reaction. These would lead to an incorrect answer. Students may also confuse the color change (blue-black) with other indicator results (like pink or orange).

Step 3: Ease factors: The context is highly familiar (potatoes are a staple in India). The iodine test for starch is a core, mandatory experiment in the Grade 6 NCERT Science curriculum, often performed as a demonstration or shown in textbooks with clear visuals.

Step 4: Difficulty factors: The open-ended "Describe" and "State" format requires English sentence construction, which is a significant barrier for Hindi-medium students with limited English proficiency. While they may know the science (Iodine + Potato = Blue/Black), they may struggle to articulate the "procedure" and "observation" in a structured way. The two-part requirement (procedure + observation) for a single mark increases the chance of a partial, and therefore incorrect, response.

Step 5: While the concept is foundational, the linguistic demand of describing a process in English for students from this specific demographic will significantly lower the success rate compared to a multiple-choice version of the same question.
