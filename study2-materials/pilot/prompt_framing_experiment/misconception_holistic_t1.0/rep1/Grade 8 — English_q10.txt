Step 1: Identify the linguistic concepts and skills required.
The student must understand the grammatical structure of "too...to" as a tool for combining two sentences into a complex sentence. This requires:
- Recognizing "very" as an intensifier to be replaced by "too."
- Identifying the second sentence as the result/consequence.
- Converting the finite verb "cannot walk" into a non-finite infinitive "to walk."
- Deleting the redundant subject and negative modal ("He cannot").

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions/errors.
- **Literal translation:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds might translate "He is very weak, so he cannot walk" directly, leading to "He is too weak that he cannot walk." (Incorrect)
- **Retention of the negative:** Students often think "too" is just a synonym for "very" and keep the "not," resulting in "He is too weak not to walk." (Incorrect)
- **Double "too":** Writing "He is too weak too walk." (Incorrect)
- **Incomplete transformation:** "He is too weak to cannot walk." (Incorrect)
Given the specific rubric, all these would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
- **High frequency:** This specific sentence ("He is very weak. He cannot walk.") is the standard textbook example used to teach this rule in Indian state boards.
- **Simple vocabulary:** "Weak" and "walk" are basic words familiar to English Language Learners (ELL).
- **Short length:** The brevity of the sentences reduces cognitive load.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
- **Open-ended format:** There are no options to trigger recognition; the student must recall the structural formula from memory.
- **Linguistic interference:** The concept of "too" implying a negative result is idiomatic and often contradicts the literal translation of "too" (which students often learn simply as "also" or "excessive").
- **English Proficiency:** For students with limited English, manipulating syntax is significantly harder than simple vocabulary recall.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the structure is a staple of the Grade 8 curriculum, the requirement to produce a perfectly grammatical transformation without cues is a high bar for students from Hindi-medium, economically weaker backgrounds who may have limited exposure to spoken English. However, because this exact example is often "drilled" in classrooms, many will recognize the pattern.
