Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required
The item requires knowledge of the unitary method (finding the value of one unit before finding the value of multiple units) or understanding direct proportion ($55/5 = x/12$). It also requires basic division ($55 \div 5$) and multiplication ($11 \times 12$).

Step 2: Common misconceptions
- Multiplicative vs. Additive reasoning: Some students might see the difference between 5 and 12 is 7, and add 7 to 55 ($55 + 7 = 62$). This leads to an incorrect answer.
- Calculation errors: Mis-multiplying $11 \times 12$ or mis-dividing $55 \div 5$.
- Confusion over the term "mileage": Students may calculate the distance (132 km) but fail to explicitly state the mileage ($11$ km/l) or vice versa, though the rubric focuses on the distance.

Step 3: Factors that make it easier
- Familiar context: Petrol and distance (mileage) are highly relevant and familiar concepts in Indian households, even for students from economically weaker sections.
- Simple numbers: $55 \div 5 = 11$ is a very easy division. Multiplying by 12 or 11 is a standard skill for Grade 7.
- Language: The sentence structure is relatively simple.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder
- English Proficiency: For Hindi-medium students, terms like "covers," "distance," and "mileage" might be hurdles if the test is only in English.
- Two-part question: The question asks for both distance and mileage. If a student only provides one, they might lose the mark depending on the strictness of the evaluator, though the rubric specifically looks for $132$ km.
- Open-ended format: No options (MCQs) to provide a hint or allow for "working backwards."

Step 5: Holistic estimate
The simplicity of the numbers (multiples of 11 and 5) and the extreme familiarity of the "mileage" context in the Indian cultural landscape significantly offset the language barriers. However, the multi-step nature and the open-ended format will cause some students to stumble.
