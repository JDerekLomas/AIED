Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science (History/Civics) question, not a mathematics question. However, the cognitive skills involved include factual recall, linking a visual symbol to its historical origin, and expressing a causal relationship ("Why").

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **The "Zoo" Misconception:** Students might believe lions are shown simply because they are strong animals or found in India. This would lead to an incorrect answer based on the rubric.
*   **The "Tiger" Confusion:** Students often confuse the National Animal (Tiger) with the symbol on the currency (Lion). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Historical conflation:** Students may know it relates to a "King" but fail to identify Ashoka or the concept of a "National Emblem."

Step 3: Factors making the item easier:
*   **Contextual Familiarity:** Every student, regardless of economic background, handles or sees Indian currency notes (context is highly familiar).
*   **Visual Aid:** The emblem is a constant visual presence in government schools and textbooks.
*   **Simplicity:** It is a single-mark recall question.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students with limited English, "currency notes," "shown," and "explain" may be difficult to parse, even if they know the answer in Hindi (*Ashok Stambh*).
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no options to trigger recognition; the student must generate the specific terms "Lion Capital of Ashoka" or "National Emblem" from memory.
*   **Rubric Rigidity:** The rubric requires two specific identifiers for 1 mark, which is a high bar for a 6th grader with limited English proficiency.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate:
While the visual is familiar, the requirement to explain the historical origin (Ashoka) and the official designation (National Emblem) in English will be a significant barrier for this specific demographic. Many will provide "common sense" answers (e.g., "because the lion is king") rather than the academic answer required by the rubric.
