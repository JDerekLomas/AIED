Step 1: This is a language literacy item, not a mathematical one. However, the cognitive skills required include reading comprehension, identifying character motivation, and synthesizing textual evidence into a coherent explanation.

Step 2: Common misconceptions/errors in this context include:
- Literalism: Thinking drawing is just "making pictures" rather than a form of expression. (Lead to incorrect/partial answer)
- Misinterpreting "mean": Thinking the question asks for a definition of the word "drawing" rather than its significance to the character. (Lead to incorrect answer)
- Personal Projection: Answering based on what drawing means to the student personally rather than to the character Anika. (Lead to incorrect answer)

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The vocabulary "drawing" and "hobby" are generally introduced early in English language learning. If the passage is short and the answer is explicitly stated (e.g., "Drawing was her way of expressing..."), students with basic scanning skills can find the answer.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: 
- Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students, articulating "expressing thoughts and feelings" in English is a significant hurdle, even if they understand the concept. 
- Open-ended format: No options to trigger recognition; requires active recall and sentence construction.
- Rubric Rigidity: The rubric requires two distinct ideas (more than a hobby + expression); students often provide only one-word or simple phrase answers (e.g., "It was her hobby").
- Abstract Concept: "Expressing feelings" is an abstract idea compared to concrete actions.

Step 5: Given the English proficiency barriers and the requirement to synthesize two ideas in a foreign language without the aid of multiple-choice options, a significant majority of students in this specific demographic will likely struggle to provide a response that meets the full rubric criteria.
