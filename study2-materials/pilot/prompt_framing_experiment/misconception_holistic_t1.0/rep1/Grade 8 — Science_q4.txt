Step 1: Identify the scientific concepts and skills required.
Students must understand the structure of a flame (zones of combustion), the relative temperatures of these zones (outermost vs. innermost), and the practical application of heat transfer. They need to connect the "outermost zone" with "complete combustion" and "highest temperature."

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Color-Heat Misconception:** Students often believe the yellow/luminous part of the flame is the hottest because it is the brightest or "most colorful." This would lead to an incorrect answer (middle zone).
*   **Proximity Misconception:** Students may think the part closest to the wick (innermost zone) is the hottest because it is the source. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Terminology Confusion:** Difficulty distinguishing between "luminous" and "non-luminous" terms in English.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Direct Textbook Correlation:** This is a "classic" textbook question found in almost all NCERT-based Grade 8 Science curricula (Chapter: Coal and Petroleum or Combustion and Flame).
*   **Rote Memorization:** Many students memorize the phrase "Goldsmith - outermost zone" without needing to understand the underlying thermodynamics.
*   **Familiar Context:** The image of a goldsmith using a metallic blowpipe is a standard illustration in Indian textbooks.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
*   **English Proficiency:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may know the concept but struggle to articulate the "Give reason" part in English (e.g., explaining "complete combustion").
*   **Open-ended format:** Without multiple-choice options, students must recall the specific terminology ("outermost," "non-luminous") from memory.
*   **Two-part requirement:** The rubric requires both the zone and the reason for the full mark.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the concept is a staple of the curriculum, the requirement to "Give reason" in English poses a significant barrier for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. Many will identify the zone but fail to explain the reasoning clearly enough to satisfy a strict rubric.
