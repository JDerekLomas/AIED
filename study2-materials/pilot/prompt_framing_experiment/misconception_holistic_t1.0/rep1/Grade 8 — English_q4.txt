Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a vocabulary and reading comprehension task within an English assessment. It requires the ability to scan a text for synonyms (lexical matching) and map a provided definition ("a light wind") to a specific target word ("breeze").

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- Literal Translation: Students may look for the word "wind" within the passage rather than a synonym. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Vocabulary Confusion: Students might confuse "breeze" with other weather-related words in the passage (e.g., "storm," "gust," or "air").
- Contextual Guessing: Students might select a word based on its position in a sentence rather than its semantic meaning.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- The word "breeze" is a relatively common "bridge" word often taught in early English language learner (ELL) curricula.
- The definition provided is literal and straightforward.
- If the passage is short, the search field is narrow.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- English Proficiency: For Hindi-medium students, "breeze" may not be part of their active or passive vocabulary.
- Open-ended format: There are no options to choose from; the student must identify and correctly spell the word from the text.
- Language barrier: The instruction itself is in English, which may be a barrier for students from economically weaker sections with limited exposure to the language.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically, estimate what proportion of students at this grade level would produce the fully correct answer.
While the task is simple for a native speaker, for Grade 8 students in this specific demographic (Hindi-medium, EWS), identifying a specific synonym in a second language without multiple-choice options is a significant challenge.
