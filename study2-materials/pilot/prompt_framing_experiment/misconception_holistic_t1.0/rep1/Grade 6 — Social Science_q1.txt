Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, it requires specific cognitive skills: categorization (identifying "mountain ranges" as a subset of geography), spatial memory, and retrieval of specific proper nouns from the Indian subcontinent.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Confusing individual peaks with mountain ranges (e.g., naming "Mount Everest" or "Kanchenjunga" instead of "Himalayas"). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   Confusing different landforms (e.g., naming rivers like "Ganga" or "Yamuna" as mountains). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   Geographic displacement (naming ranges outside India, like the "Alps" or "Andes"). This would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   Context: The Himalayas are a point of national pride and are taught repeatedly from early primary years.
*   Local relevance: Students often live near or have heard of regional ranges like the Aravallis or Vindhyas.
*   Low threshold: Only two names are required for a list that contains many acceptable options.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, the English term "mountain range" might be less familiar than "parvat shrinkhla."
*   Spelling: Students with limited English proficiency may struggle to spell names like "Himalayas" or "Western Ghats" correctly, though rubrics in these settings often ignore minor spelling errors if the phonetic intent is clear.
*   Open-ended format: No cues or options are provided to trigger memory.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the cultural prominence of the Himalayas and the repetitive nature of this topic in the Indian Social Science curriculum (NCERT/State Boards), a significant majority of students will be able to recall at least two names, even with language barriers.
