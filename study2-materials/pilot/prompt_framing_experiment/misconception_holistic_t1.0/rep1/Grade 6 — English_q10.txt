Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is an English language item, the underlying logic involves "Quantifiers" and "Set Theory" (specifically the distinction between non-zero existence in affirmative sets versus zero/interrogative sets). The student must identify the sentence as an affirmative statement and apply the rule that 'some' is used for positive existence, whereas 'any' is used for negative or inquisitive contexts.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
1. Overgeneralization: Students often think 'any' and 'some' are interchangeable synonyms for "a few." This would lead to an incorrect answer.
2. Negative Bias: Students may have only encountered 'any' in the context of "not any," leading them to choose 'some' by default (which leads to a correct answer).
3. Translation Error: In Hindi, the word 'kuch' (कुछ) can translate to both 'some' and 'any' depending on the context. If the student translates the sentence mentally to "Tokri mein kuch seb hain," they may find both options equally plausible, leading to a 50/50 guess.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
The vocabulary is extremely simple (apples, basket, there are). These are among the first nouns and structures taught in primary school. The context of fruit in a basket is a standard textbook example familiar to all students, regardless of socioeconomic background.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
The distinction between 'some' and 'any' is a nuanced grammatical rule that is often not mastered by English Language Learners (ELL) until later grades. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the lack of a distinct functional equivalent for 'any' in affirmative sentences creates a high reliance on rote memorization of the rule.

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.
Because the sentence is a simple affirmative statement and 'some' is the more common, "default" quantifier taught in early stages of Indian English curriculum, many students will select it by intuition or familiarity, even if they don't know the formal rule. However, the linguistic interference from Hindi will cause significant confusion for a large portion of the cohort.
