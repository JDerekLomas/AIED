Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, it requires structural mathematical logic: identifying a set of size $n=2$ and performing a $1:1$ mapping of an "explanation" to one element of that set. Skills include categorization and logical sequencing.

Step 2: 
- **Conflating Rights with Duties:** Students often think "going to school" is a duty rather than a right. This would lead to an incorrect answer if not framed as an entitlement.
- **Over-generalization:** Students may list general human rights (e.g., "freedom") without the specific "child" context required by the rubric.
- **Scope Misconception:** Thinking only of "Right to Education" and failing to identify a second distinct right.

Step 3:
- **Familiar Context:** The "Right to Education" (RTE) is heavily emphasized in Indian government schools and Mid-Day Meal schemes.
- **Low Complexity:** The number "two" is the smallest plural requirement, making the retrieval load relatively light.

Step 4:
- **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, "Explain the importance" is a high-order linguistic demand in English. They may know the concept but lack the vocabulary to explain *why* it is important.
- **Multi-part Task:** The question requires three distinct actions: name R1, name R2, and explain R1 (or R2). Students often miss the third part.
- **Rubric-Score Mismatch:** The maximum score is 1, but the task requires three distinct cognitive steps. Students often provide less effort for "1 mark" questions, leading to incomplete answers.
- **Open-ended format:** No scaffolding or options are provided to trigger memory.

Step 5: While the topic is culturally relevant, the combination of limited English proficiency and the three-part demand for a single mark will lead many students to provide only partial answers (naming rights without explanation).
