Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science (History) retrieval task, not a mathematics task. It requires memory recall of historical figures and the ability to categorize them within a specific temporal (Medieval) and geographical (Rajasthan) framework.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
1. Chronological Confusion: Students may struggle to distinguish between the Ancient, Medieval, and Modern periods, potentially naming a modern politician or an ancient figure. (Likely to lead to an incorrect answer).
2. Geographical Misalignment: Students might name famous Indian kings who are not specific to Rajasthan (e.g., Ashoka, Shivaji). (Likely to lead to an incorrect answer).
3. Literacy/Language Barrier: Hindi-medium students may know the names (e.g., महाराणा प्रताप) but struggle to transcribe them into English if the test is in English.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
The context is highly familiar. In the Rajasthan state curriculum, figures like Maharana Pratap and Prithviraj Chauhan are local icons and are taught extensively through storytelling, textbooks, and local culture. The "cost" of the question is low (only one name needed for the rubric, though the prompt asks for two).

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
The open-ended format (no options) requires active recall rather than recognition. For students with limited English proficiency, spelling phonetically complex names in English can be intimidating, even if they know the answer in Hindi. The rubric's requirement for "one" correct king despite the prompt asking for "two" may cause confusion, though it technically lowers the bar for success.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically.
Given that these historical figures are deeply embedded in the cultural identity of Rajasthan and are a core part of the Grade 6 curriculum, most students—even those from economically weaker sections—will be able to provide at least one name like "Maharana Pratap." The high cultural relevance offsets the language barrier for a single-word retrieval task.
