Step 1: Identify mathematical concepts and skills.
The item requires knowledge of the relationship between Marked Price (MP), Discount, Selling Price (SP), Profit Percentage, and Cost Price (CP). Students must perform a two-step calculation: first finding the SP using the discount on MP ($1200 - 10\%$), and then using that SP to work backward to find the CP given an 8% profit margin ($CP = \frac{SP}{1 + \text{profit}\%}$).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
1. **Additive vs. Multiplicative reasoning:** Students might incorrectly subtract the 8% profit from the 10% discount, thinking the total change is 2%. This leads to an incorrect answer.
2. **Base Value Confusion:** Students often calculate the 8% profit on the SP ($1080$) rather than the CP. This is a very common error at this level and leads to an incorrect answer.
3. **Confusion between MP and CP:** Some students treat MP as the "starting price" for profit calculations.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
The numbers are relatively "friendly." $10\%$ of $1200$ is an easy mental calculation ($120$). The resulting SP ($1080$) is easily divisible by $108$ (representing $108\%$), which simplifies the final division significantly. The context of "shopping" is familiar.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
1. **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students with limited English, terms like "marked price," "discount," and "cost price" can be confusing if the question isn't translated.
2. **Multi-step Reasoning:** The question requires chaining two distinct formulas. If a student fails the first step, the second is impossible.
3. **Open-ended Format:** There are no options to provide a "hint" or allow for back-solving.
4. **Reverse Percentage Calculation:** Calculating CP from SP and profit % is significantly harder for Grade 8 students than calculating SP from CP.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the numbers are simplified to assist the student, the conceptual jump required to correctly handle the "profit on cost price" while working backward from a "discounted marked price" is a high-level skill for Grade 8. In the specific demographic of economically weaker sections with language barriers, the "reverse percentage" step is where most students will struggle.
