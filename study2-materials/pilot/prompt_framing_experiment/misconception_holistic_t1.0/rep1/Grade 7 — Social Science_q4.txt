Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, the cognitive skills required include logical categorization and identifying cause-effect relationships. There are no direct mathematical concepts involved.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
1. Confusing "Transparency" with "Honesty": Students may think it simply means being a "good person," leading to vague answers like "appoint good leaders." This might result in a 0 if the rubric is strictly applied, though "hiring honest people" is borderline plausible.
2. Confusing "Transparency" with "Electricity/Infrastructure": Due to language barriers, students might associate the word with physical clarity (light/glass), leading to irrelevant answers.
3. Level of Government: Students often believe only high-level officials (PM/CM) are responsible, missing local governance improvements.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
1. Low threshold for success: The rubric only requires ONE plausible way for full marks.
2. High relevance: Topics like corruption and government services are frequently discussed in Indian households and media.
3. Common keywords: Students may have memorized terms like "RTI" (Right to Information) or "CCTV/Computers," which are often taught as standard answers.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
1. Language barrier: "Transparency" and "Governance" are high-level academic English vocabulary. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle to comprehend the question even if they know the concept (e.g., *pardarshita*).
2. Open-ended format: No options to trigger recognition; requires active recall and sentence construction in English.
3. Abstraction: "Governance" is an abstract concept for a 12-year-old compared to concrete topics like "Traffic Rules."

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the simple rubric (only one point needed) and the widespread teaching of "RTI" as a buzzword in Indian 7th-grade Civics, many students will provide a rote-learned answer. However, the linguistic complexity of the prompt will likely alienate a significant portion of the target demographic.
