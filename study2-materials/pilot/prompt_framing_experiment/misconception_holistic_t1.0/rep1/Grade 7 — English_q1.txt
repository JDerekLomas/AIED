Step 1: This is a literacy-based reading comprehension task, not a mathematical one. However, applying "mathematical" logic to the structure: students must identify a set of three specific variables (questions) and articulate them. The skill required is information retrieval and translation from a source text.

Step 2: Misconceptions in this context involve "narrative confusion." Students may confuse the King's *intent* (to be a successful ruler) with the *specific questions* he asks. Because this is an English item, limited proficiency might lead students to copy the wrong paragraph or use incorrect verb tenses. These would lead to an incorrect answer based on the rubric.

Step 3: Ease factors: The story "Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy is a standard, highly emphasized text in the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum (the primary curriculum for Indian government schools). The context of a "King" is a familiar trope in Indian storytelling. The "three" in the prompt provides a structural scaffold for the answer.

Step 4: Hardness factors: The question is open-ended (no multiple choice), requiring students to construct sentences in English. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the grammar required to explain "the right time to do everything" is complex. While they may know the story in Hindi, the rubric likely demands specific English phrasing.

Step 5: Because this specific story is almost universally taught as the first chapter of the Grade 7 English textbook ("Honeycomb") and is frequently emphasized in rote learning patterns common in these settings, many students will have memorized the answer even if their general English proficiency is low.
