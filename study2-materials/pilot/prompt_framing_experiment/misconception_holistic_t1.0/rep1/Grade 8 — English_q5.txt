Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While the item is labeled as "English," analyzing it through a mathematical/logical lens requires:
- Synthesis of information (mapping diverse variables—power, money, beauty—to a single outcome: lack of satisfaction).
- Abstract reasoning (moving from a concrete narrative to a generalized principle).
- Logical deduction (understanding that "Bargain" implies an exchange of value).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
- Conflating Plot with Theme: Students often summarize *what happened* (the man met a king, then a rich man) rather than *the message*. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Literal Interpretation: Thinking a "bargain" must involve money or physical goods. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Vocabulary Confusion: Misunderstanding "power" or "lustre" in a literary context. This would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
- The poem is a standard part of the NCERT curriculum (Grade 8, Honeydew).
- The central message (true happiness comes from freedom/innocence) is a culturally resonant value in many Indian households.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Language Barrier: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may understand the concept but lack the English vocabulary (e.g., "materialistic," "subjugation," "intangible") to express it.
- Open-ended format: No scaffolding or options to trigger recognition.
- High abstraction: Moving from Tagore’s poetic imagery to a concise "theme" is a high-order cognitive task.
- Maximum score of 1: No room for partial credit if the grammar is poor but the idea is present.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
The combination of the English language barrier for EWS/Hindi-background students and the high-level cognitive task of thematic synthesis makes this a difficult item. While students may grasp the story, articulating the abstract theme in English is a significant hurdle.
