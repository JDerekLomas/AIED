Step 1: Identify mathematical concepts and skills.
The student must understand the decimal positional system (Base-10). They need to map the digit '5' to its specific position (thousands, hundreds, tens, ones) and calculate its value based on that position ($5 \times 100$).

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
- Digit Value vs. Place Value: Students might simply write "5" (the face value). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Column Miscounting: Counting from left to right instead of right to left, identifying "5" as being in the "thousands" place. This leads to an incorrect answer.
- Confusion with "Place": Writing "Tens" or "Thousands" instead of "Hundreds."
- Language Interference: In Hindi, the terms *Sthaniya Maan* (Place Value) and *Ankit Maan* (Face Value) are often confused by beginners.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
- The number is relatively small (4 digits).
- The digit 5 is in a clean "hundreds" position without the complexity of decimals.
- "Place value" is a core topic heavily drilled in the Indian Grade 3-5 curriculum.
- The rubric allows for both the numerical value (500) and the name (Hundreds), which accommodates different teaching styles.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Open-ended format: There are no multiple-choice options to nudge the student toward the correct format.
- English Language Barrier: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the English phrasing "What is the..." if they haven't mastered the specific English vocabulary for math terms.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given that place value is one of the most emphasized topics in primary years in Indian government schools, and the number provided is a standard four-digit integer, a majority of students will recognize the task. However, the linguistic transition and the common confusion between face value and place value will trip up a significant minority.
