Step 1: Identify the linguistic concepts and skills required.
- Understanding of subject-verb-object structure (SVO to OVS).
- Knowledge of the past participle of the irregular verb "blow" (blown).
- Mastery of the auxiliary verb "were" for plural subjects in the past tense.
- Understanding the use of the preposition "by" for the agent.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
- "Be-verb" confusion: Using "was" instead of "were" because "wind" is singular (Incorrect).
- Tense shifting: Changing it to present passive "are blown" or past perfect "had been blown" (Incorrect).
- Irregular verb conjugation: Using "blowed" or "blew" as the past participle (Incorrect).
- Prepositional placement: Misplacing "away" (e.g., "The leaves were blown by the wind away") (Incorrect).

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
- The sentence is short and uses high-frequency vocabulary.
- The context (wind/leaves) is concrete and familiar.
- Passive voice is a core component of the Grade 7 grammar curriculum in India.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Irregular verb: "Blew/Blown" is significantly harder than regular "-ed" verbs.
- Plurality: Students often match the auxiliary verb to the original subject (wind) rather than the new subject (leaves).
- Phrasal element: The word "away" adds a layer of complexity in word ordering.
- Language barrier: Hindi-medium students often struggle with English auxiliary verb rules, as passive constructions in Hindi function differently.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the irregular verb "blown" and the plural subject "leaves" (requiring "were"), many students will likely produce "was blowed" or "were blew."
