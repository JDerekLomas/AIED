Step 1: The question is labeled as English, but analyzing the underlying logic and patterns: it requires identifying auditory and structural patterns (phonetics) and matching ending sounds. In a mathematical sense, this involves pattern recognition and set pairing.
Step 2: Common misconceptions include matching words based on visual spelling rather than sound (orthographic bias) or matching words that are semantically related (synonyms) rather than phonetically related. On this item, the "borrow/tomorrow" pair is an imperfect/slant rhyme in many Indian accents or may be visually confusing because "repay" is inserted awkwardly in the text ("He had repay it"), which might lead students to fail to recognize the pair. However, "rain/grain" is a very strong, perfect visual and auditory match.
Step 3: Factors making it easier: The words "rain" and "grain" are simple, high-frequency words. They share the same suffix spelling (-ain), making the visual pattern recognition easy even for students with low English fluency.
Step 4: Factors making it harder: The open-ended format requires students to extract and write the words. For Hindi-medium students, the word "stanza" might be unfamiliar terminology. The grammatical error in the fourth line ("He had repay it") may cause cognitive load or confusion when reading.
Step 5: Given that "rain" and "grain" are very standard vocabulary words in Indian primary curricula and the visual rhyme is identical, a majority of students will be able to identify at least one pair.
