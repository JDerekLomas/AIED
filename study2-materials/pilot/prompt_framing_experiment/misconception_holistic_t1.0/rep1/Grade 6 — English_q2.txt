Step 1: This is a reading comprehension task in English, not a mathematics item. The primary skill required is retrieving explicit information from a text and basic sentence construction or word recognition.

Step 2: Not applicable as there are no mathematical concepts. However, linguistic "misconceptions" (interference) include confusing the subject with the object or misinterpreting the preposition "inside."

Step 3: The context of a "fairy" is globally familiar and culturally accessible. The question uses simple "Who" interrogative logic, which is a foundational English skill. The rubric is highly inclusive, accepting one-word answers ("fairy"), which lowers the barrier for students with low English fluency.

Step 4: The open-ended format is challenging for Hindi-medium students who may know the answer in their native tongue but struggle to recall the English word "fairy." Lack of answer choices means students cannot rely on recognition. Limited English proficiency might lead students to copy an irrelevant sentence from the passage that contains the word "book."

Step 5: Given the simplicity of the answer and the lenient rubric, even students with limited English can typically identify a key character name from a text.
