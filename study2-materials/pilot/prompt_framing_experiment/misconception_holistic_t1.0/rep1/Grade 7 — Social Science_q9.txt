Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, it requires logical reasoning regarding resource allocation (revenue vs. expenditure), understanding of debt/loss, and the concept of "impact" (cause and effect).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Confusing "economic" with "political" (e.g., saying "the king died" instead of "the treasury was emptied"). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- The belief that winning a war always leads to immediate wealth, ignoring the cost of mobilization. This might lead to an incorrect answer if they cannot identify a specific impact.
- Difficulty distinguishing between a kingdom's treasury and individual wealth.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The rubric is generous (only one impact needed). Common sense allows students to guess that "war costs money" or "crops were destroyed." The concept of "paisa" (money) being lost in fights is familiar in a Hindi-medium/EWS context.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: The term "Assess the impact" and "economic life" are high-level academic English terms. For students with limited English proficiency, these words may be complete barriers to understanding what the question is asking. The open-ended format requires sentence construction in English, which is a significant hurdle for this demographic.

Step 5: While the concept is simple, the linguistic barrier (Academic English) for Hindi-medium students in Grade 7 is high. Many will understand the concept in their mother tongue but struggle to decode the prompt or express the answer in English.
