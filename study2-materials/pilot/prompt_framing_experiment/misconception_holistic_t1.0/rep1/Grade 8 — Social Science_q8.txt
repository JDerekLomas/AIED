Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science item. No mathematical concepts or skills are required, though students must utilize categorization and recall of a predefined list.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- Confusing "Fundamental Rights" with "Fundamental Duties": Might lead to an incorrect answer if they list a duty not considered a "key feature" of the structure.
- Confusing "Democracy" with "Constitution": Students may think they are the same thing. However, since Parliamentary Democracy is a feature, this misconception might actually lead to a correct answer.
- Misunderstanding "Secularism": Some students believe it means the absence of religion rather than equal treatment. However, the term itself remains a correct answer.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
- Low threshold for success: The rubric only requires "any one" feature.
- Familiarity: The Indian Constitution is a core pillar of the Grade 8 Civics curriculum and is frequently repeated in school assemblies (Preamble) and textbooks.
- Simple Vocabulary: Terms like "Fundamental Rights" (Maulik Adhikar) are common in Hindi-medium discourse.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
- Language Barrier: Students with limited English proficiency may know the concept in Hindi (e.g., "Dharmanirpekshta") but struggle to recall or spell the English term "Secularism."
- Open-ended format: No options provided to trigger recognition.
- Abstract concepts: Federalism and Secularism are abstract and difficult for 13-year-olds to define, even if they can name them.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically.
Because the rubric is extremely generous (requiring only a single term) and the topic is a "high-stakes" part of the Indian curriculum emphasized through rote memorization, most students will be able to recall at least "Fundamental Rights" or "Secularism." The primary barrier is English spelling/vocabulary for Hindi-medium learners.
