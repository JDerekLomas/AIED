### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Definition of Factors:** Understanding that a factor is a number that divides another number completely without leaving a remainder.
*   **Divisibility Rules:** Knowledge of rules for 2 (even numbers) and 4 (last two digits).
*   **Multiplication/Division Facts:** Proficiency in basic arithmetic to identify pairs (e.g., $2 \times 34 = 68$).
*   **Systematic Listing:** The ability to check numbers sequentially (1, 2, 3, 4...) to ensure no factors are missed.
*   **Knowledge of Primes:** Recognizing that 17 is a prime factor, which is the "key" to unlocking the larger factors (17, 34).

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Confusing Factors with Multiples:** Students might list $68, 136, 204...$ (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Incomplete Search:** Students often stop after finding the easy pairs $(1, 68)$ and $(2, 34)$, missing $(4, 17)$. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Excluding 1 or the Number Itself:** Some students believe factors must be smaller than the number but larger than 1. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Division Errors:** Mistakenly believing 3 or 6 are factors because 68 starts with 6 or ends with 8. (Leads to incorrect answer).

### Step 3: Factors Making the Item Easier
*   **Direct Language:** The prompt is short and uses standard terminology ("factors") which is heavily drilled in Grade 6 NCERT textbooks.
*   **Even Number:** The fact that 68 is even makes it immediately accessible for the first few factors (1, 2, 68, 34).
*   **No Linguistic Complexity:** For Hindi-medium students, "Factors" (गुणनखंड) is a primary vocabulary word in math; the English term is usually taught alongside it.

### Step 4: Factors Making the Item Harder
*   **The "17" Hurdle:** 68 relies on the factor 17. Most students in this demographic memorize tables up to 10 or 12. 17 is a prime number and not part of common skip-counting patterns, making the pair $(4, 17)$ very difficult to identify without long division.
*   **Binary Rubric:** The rubric is "all or nothing." Missing just one factor (like 17 or 4) results in a score of 0.
*   **No Scaffolding:** Being an open-ended question rather than multiple-choice means students cannot use "test-taking strategies" to guess the factors.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is foundational, the specific number 68 is a "trap" for Grade 6 students. Most will successfully find 1, 2, 34, and 68. However, a significant majority of students—especially those with limited fluency in higher-level multiplication tables—will fail to identify the pair $4 \times 17$. In a government school context where rote learning of tables often stops at 10 or 12, this specific item becomes quite challenging.
