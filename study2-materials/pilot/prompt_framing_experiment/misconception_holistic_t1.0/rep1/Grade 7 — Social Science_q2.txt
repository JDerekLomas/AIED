Step 1: Although this is a Social Science (Geography) question, it requires specific cognitive skills: defining a complex term, understanding cause-effect relationships (modification), and categorization. It requires distinguishing between "natural" and "human-made" structures.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Confusing "Human Environment" with "Human-made Environment" (buildings/roads). Human environment includes social/cultural interactions (religion, family), which students often omit. This leads to a partially incorrect answer.
- Believing "Environment" only means "Nature." This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Misunderstanding "modify" as "protect" or "destroy" exclusively, rather than the act of changing it to suit needs.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The topic is a foundational chapter in the NCERT Grade 7 curriculum. The concept of "modifying" nature (cutting trees, building dams) is tangible and often discussed in the context of climate change.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students with limited English, "modify" and "interactions" are difficult academic vocabulary words.
- **Open-ended format:** Without options, students must recall and construct complex sentences in English.
- **Rubric/Weightage:** 0.5 marks for a two-part answer (definition + example) is extremely low, providing very little margin for partial credit or error.
- **Abstraction:** Defining "human environment" is more abstract than simply listing things found in a city.

Step 5: Holistically, while the concept is familiar, the linguistic demand of defining it accurately in English and the specific distinction required by the rubric will be a significant hurdle for this demographic.
