Step 1: Identify the linguistic and cognitive concepts required.
The item tests vocabulary acquisition, specifically the concept of antonyms (opposites). Students must decode the English word "slow," retrieve its semantic meaning, and then find the corresponding English word for the opposite concept ("fast").

Step 2: List common misconceptions/errors.
*   **Synonym Confusion:** Students might provide a synonym (e.g., "gradual" or "lazy") instead of an antonym. On this item, it leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Translation/Code-switching:** A student may know the concept but only know the Hindi word "तेज़" (Tez) and not the English word "fast."
*   **Phonetic Approximation:** Spelling "fast" as "phest" or "fash." Depending on the strictness of the rubric, this might be penalized.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **High Frequency:** "Slow" and "fast" are high-frequency Tier 1 vocabulary words introduced very early in English language learning (usually Grade 1 or 2).
*   **Physicality:** The concept is concrete and easily demonstrated through movement, making it stick even for ESL learners.
*   **Short Word Length:** Both the prompt and the answer are short, reducing the cognitive load for students with limited English proficiency.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Open-ended format:** Unlike a multiple-choice question where "fast" might be recognized, the student must recall the word from memory.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students from economically weaker sections, exposure to English outside the classroom is minimal, making retrieval of even "simple" words inconsistent.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the students face socio-economic and language barriers, "slow/fast" is one of the most foundational pairs taught in Indian government school curricula (often via rhymes or basic grammar drills). Most Grade 6 students, even those struggling, will have encountered this specific pair multiple times.
