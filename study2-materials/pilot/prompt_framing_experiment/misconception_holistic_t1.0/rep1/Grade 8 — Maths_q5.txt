### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills
*   **Recognition of Structure:** Identifying the common factor ($9/16$) across two terms.
*   **Distributive Property (Factoring):** Understanding that $ab + ac = a(b+c)$.
*   **Rational Number Arithmetic:** Adding fractions with unlike denominators.
*   **Integer Operations:** Handling the addition of a negative fraction ($+$ and $-$ becoming $-$).
*   **Simplification:** Reducing fractions (e.g., $4/12$ to $1/3$ and $-3/9$ to $-1/3$).

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **BODMAS/Order of Operations:** Students may try to multiply first ($9/16 \times 4/12$) then ($9/16 \times -3/9$) and add the results. While mathematically valid, if the prompt strictly requires the "distributive property," they might lose marks or make calculation errors.
*   **Fraction Addition:** Common error of adding numerators and denominators ($4/12 + (-3/9) = 1/21$). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Sign Confusion:** Mistaking $+ (-3/9)$ as a subtraction of the entire term or incorrectly applying signs during multiplication. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Distributive Property Direction:** Students often learn $a(b+c) = ab + ac$ but struggle with the reverse (factoring out).

### Step 3: Factors Making it Easier
*   **Friendly Numbers:** The fractions $4/12$ and $3/9$ both simplify to $1/3$. If a student notices this, the expression becomes $\{9/16 \times 1/3\} + {9/16 \times (-1/3)}$, which equals $0$.
*   **Common Factor is Explicit:** The $9/16$ is clearly repeated, making the "common factor" easy to spot for students trained in pattern recognition.

### Step 4: Factors Making it Harder
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the phrase "distributive property" (वितरण गुणधर्म) must be recalled in English to understand the specific method required.
*   **Fraction Fluency:** Grade 8 students in economically weaker sections often struggle with fraction operations (LCD/denominators) if their primary schooling foundations are weak.
*   **Multiple Steps:** The student must identify the property, rewrite the expression, simplify the internal bracket, and then multiply.
*   **No Scaffolding:** Being an open-ended question without options increases the likelihood of a computational slip.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the final answer is a "clean" number (zero), the requirement to use the distributive property specifically, combined with the complexities of adding fractions with different denominators and negative signs, poses a significant challenge for this demographic. Many students will likely attempt direct multiplication (which is tedious and error-prone) rather than using the property.
