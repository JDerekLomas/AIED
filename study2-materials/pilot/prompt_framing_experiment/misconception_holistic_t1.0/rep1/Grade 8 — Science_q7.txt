Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While labeled "Science," the item requires logic and cause-effect reasoning. From a quantitative perspective, it involves temporal sequencing ("after some days") and qualitative evaluation of nutrient cycles.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   "Disappearance" vs. Decomposition: Students may think the waste simply "vanishes" rather than transforming. (Leads to incomplete reasoning).
*   Synthetic vs. Organic: Students might not distinguish between biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste (though the prompt specifies organic waste, making this less likely to lead to an incorrect answer here).
*   Static Soil: The belief that soil quality is fixed and cannot be improved by external inputs. (Leads to a failure in the "evaluation" part of the question).

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   Familiar Context: Most students from economically weaker sections or rural/semi-urban backgrounds have direct experience with composting, kitchen gardens, or waste management.
*   Low Mathematical Load: No calculations or abstract formulas are required.
*   Intuitive Logic: The idea that things "rot" is a common-sense observation.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students, articulating "decomposition," "humus," or "nutrients" in English is a significant hurdle.
*   Multi-part Question: The prompt asks for three things: observation (the change), reasoning (why it happened), and evaluation (soil health). Students often miss the third part.
*   Open-ended/Subjective: There are no cues or options to guide the student's response.
*   Low Point Value: At only 0.5 marks, students may provide a one-word answer ("Yes") rather than the multi-step explanation required by the rubric.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Despite the language barrier, the high level of familiarity with the practical context of "compost pits" in Indian government school curricula and home life suggests a high success rate for the conceptual core of the question.
