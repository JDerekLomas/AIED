Step 1: Identify the scientific concepts and skills required.
The item requires observational analysis and the application of biological knowledge regarding microorganisms. Students must link a visual phenomenon (color changes and patches on food) to the biological process of fungal reproduction and growth (mould).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- Spontaneous Generation: Students may think the patches are created by the bread itself or "dirt" rather than living organisms. (Leads to incorrect answer)
- Chemical Reaction: Students might believe the bread is simply "rusting" or reacting with air/water like a metal. (Leads to incorrect answer)
- Confusion with "Germs": Students often use the word "germs" or "bacteria" interchangeably. (Depending on the rubric's flexibility, "germs" might be marked wrong if the teacher seeks "fungi").

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
- Familiar Context: Bread (or roti) spoilage is a common household observation for students from all economic backgrounds.
- Descriptive Cues: The mention of "green" and "darker patches" over a timeline strongly triggers the memory of the "Fungi" chapter in the Grade 8 Science NCERT curriculum.
- Simple Vocabulary: The question uses basic language.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
- Open-ended Format: Without multiple-choice options, students must recall the specific term (Fungi/Mould) rather than recognize it.
- Language Barrier: Hindi-medium students may know the concept as "Phaphund" (फफूंद) but may struggle to recall or spell the English term "Fungi" or "Mould."
- Precision: If the rubric strictly requires "Mould" and rejects "Bacteria," students who understand it is a microorganism but pick the wrong kingdom will lose the mark.

Step 5: Estimate the proportion of students who would produce the fully correct answer.
While the context is highly familiar, the requirement to produce the English terminology in a written format for students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds poses a significant hurdle.
