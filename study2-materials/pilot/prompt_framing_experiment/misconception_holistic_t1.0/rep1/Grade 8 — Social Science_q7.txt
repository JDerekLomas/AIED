Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, the cognitive skills required include establishing causality (A lead to B), understanding temporal sequences (1757 as a turning point), and identifying the relationship between a part (Bengal) and the whole (India). In terms of information processing, the student must synthesize historical facts into a concise explanation of "expansion of power."

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
1. Chronological Confusion: Believing the British ruled all of India immediately after one battle. (Would lead to an overgeneralized but potentially "correct-enough" answer for a 1-mark rubric).
2. Conflating Battles: Confusing Plassey (1757) with Buxar (1764). (Would lead to an incorrect answer if they credit the Diwani rights specifically to Plassey).
3. Misunderstanding "Puppet Nawab": Thinking Mir Jafar became an independent ruler. (Would lead to an incorrect answer as it misses the "British power" aspect).

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- Familiarity: The Battle of Plassey is a cornerstone of the Grade 8 NCERT History curriculum and is heavily emphasized.
- Vocabulary: "Battle," "Power," and "India" are high-frequency words even for students with limited English proficiency.
- Single Point: The rubric only requires one major consequence for the full 1 mark.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- Language Barrier: Explaining causality ("contribute to") in English is significantly harder for Hindi-medium students than identifying a date or name.
- Open-ended Format: No options to trigger memory; requires active recall and sentence construction.
- Abstract Concept: "Political dominance" is an abstract concept compared to "Who won the battle?"

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically, estimate what proportion of students would produce the fully correct answer.
While the topic is very common, the requirement to explain the *contribution* to power (rather than just naming the winner) in a second language will pose a significant hurdle for students from economically weaker sections with limited English exposure. Many will know who won but struggle to articulate the "puppet nawab" or "dominance" aspect in English.
