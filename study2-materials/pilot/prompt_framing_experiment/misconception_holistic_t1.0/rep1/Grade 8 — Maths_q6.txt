Step 1: Identify mathematical concepts and skills.
The item requires: 
- Translation of the word "thrice" into a multiplication operation ($3 \times 12$).
- Understanding the property of age differences (constancy of difference over time).
- Basic arithmetic (multiplication and subtraction).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
- Addition Misconception: Adding 5 to both ages and then subtracting ($41 - 17$) or, more commonly, adding 5 to the current difference. (Result: Correct answer, despite extra steps).
- Linear Scaling Misconception: Thinking the "thrice" relationship remains constant over time (i.e., thinking the father will still be 3 times Rahul's age in 5 years). This leads to an incorrect answer.
- "Add 5" error: Calculating the father's current age (36) and then simply adding 5 to it (41), ignoring the question about "difference."

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
- Small, manageable numbers (12, 3, 5).
- Familiar context (ages of father and son).
- The "extra" information (after 5 years) is a distractor that doesn't actually change the mathematical result of $(36-12)$, making it robust against certain calculation errors.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Language Barrier: The word "thrice" is rarely used in colloquial Indian English; Hindi-medium students are more accustomed to "3 times" or "teen guna."
- Language Barrier: Distinguishing between "What will be the age" and "What will be the age difference" is linguistically dense for ESL learners.
- Multistep: It requires finding an intermediate value (father's age) before solving the actual prompt.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the math is Grade 4/5 level, the linguistic phrasing ("thrice," "age difference... after 5 years") acts as a significant barrier for Grade 8 students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. Many will calculate the father's current age (36) or future age (41) and stop there.
