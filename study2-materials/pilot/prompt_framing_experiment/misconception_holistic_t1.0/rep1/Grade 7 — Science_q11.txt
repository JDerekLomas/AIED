Step 1: Identify mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   **Data Interpretation:** Reading and extracting information from a tabular format.
*   **Ordering and Comparison:** Identifying the "minimum" value in a set of numbers (time) and correlating it with the "fastest" rate.
*   **Inverse Relationship:** Understanding that in the context of time, a smaller number represents a faster process.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **"Higher Number Equals More":** Students often associate larger numbers with "faster" or "better." On this item, this would lead to selecting Liquid C (longest time) as the fastest, resulting in an incorrect answer.
*   **Difficulty with Rate vs. Time:** Many students struggle to differentiate between the duration of an event and the speed of an event.
*   **Salt "Disappearing":** Some may believe salt evaporates with the water, leading to confusion in part (b) regarding the nature of solutions.

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** Liquids like petrol and water are part of daily life.
*   **Simple Numbers:** The table likely contains small, whole numbers or clear intervals.
*   **Part (a) is Direct:** Identifying the minimum value is a foundational skill.

Step 4: Factors that make the item harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, terms like "evaporate," "conditions," and "observed" may be barriers if the test is in English.
*   **Open-ended explanation:** Part (b) requires constructing a scientific argument in English, which is significantly more difficult than simple data retrieval.
*   **Inverse Logic:** The cognitive leap from "least time" to "fastest" is a frequent stumbling block for 7th graders.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While many students will correctly identify Liquid A for part (a) by intuition, the requirement for a scientific explanation in part (b) in a second language will significantly lower the "fully correct" (obtaining maximum score for both parts) rate.
