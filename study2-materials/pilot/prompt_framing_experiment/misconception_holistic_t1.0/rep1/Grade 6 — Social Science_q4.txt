Step 1: This is a Social Science (Geography) item, not a mathematical one. The skills required are factual recall of regional geography and descriptive writing.
Step 2: Common misconceptions include confusing "landform" (desert/mountain) with "state" or "climate." In this specific item, a student might incorrectly name "Jaipur" (a city) or "Hot" (a climate) instead of the Thar Desert.
Step 3: Ease factors: The context is highly familiar to Indian students, especially those in or near Rajasthan. The "Thar Desert" is a foundational topic in Grade 6 Geography. The rubric is lenient, accepting either the desert or the mountains.
Step 4: Difficulty factors: The item is open-ended. For Hindi-medium students with limited English proficiency, "briefly describe" is a significant barrier. They may know the answer is "Thar Desert" but struggle to write a description in English. The grammatical error in the prompt ("Name the one major landforms") may also cause minor confusion. The very low weightage (0.5 marks) suggests a low-stakes response is expected, but the language barrier remains the primary hurdle.
Step 5: While the factual knowledge is high, the English descriptive requirement for a Hindi-medium student body will lower the "fully correct" rate according to the rubric's demand for a description.
