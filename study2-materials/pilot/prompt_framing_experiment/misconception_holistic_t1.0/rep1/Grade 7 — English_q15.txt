Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a language arts (English) task, not a mathematical one. However, applying a mathematical lens to the underlying logic: the task requires sequential ordering (4-5 sentences), set categorization (identifying a "hobby"), and logical mapping (linking an activity to a time and a reason).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- Confusion between "Hobby" and "Daily Routine": Students might write about brushing teeth or sleeping. (Leads to incorrect answer).
- Sentence boundary errors: Writing one long run-on sentence instead of 4-5 distinct ones. (Leads to incorrect answer based on rubric).
- Language translation errors: Literal translation from Hindi to English resulting in incomprehensible syntax. (Leads to incorrect answer).

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- Familiar context: "My Favourite Hobby" is a standard essay topic in Indian primary education.
- Low volume: Only 4-5 sentences are required.
- Explicit prompts: The question tells them exactly what to include (what, when, why).

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- English Proficiency: For Hindi-medium students from economically weaker sections, constructing grammatically correct sentences in English is a significant hurdle.
- Open-ended format: No scaffolding or sentence starters provided.
- Rubric Rigidity: The 1-mark maximum implies an "all or nothing" scoring; any omission (e.g., forgetting to say "why") results in a zero.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically:
While the topic is very common, the combination of limited English proficiency in this specific demographic and the "all or nothing" rubric makes the success rate lower than expected for a Grade 7 item. Many students will likely produce 2-3 sentences or struggle with the "why" in English.
