**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Time Calculation:** Calculating the duration between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM (crossing the 12-hour noon meridian).
*   **Rate and Change:** Understanding "increase per hour" and applying it over a specific duration.
*   **Arithmetic Operations:** Multiplication (6 hours × $2^\circ$C) and Addition ($30^\circ$C + $12^\circ$C).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Calculation of elapsed time:** Students often subtract $10$ from $4$ (resulting in $6$, which ironically leads to the correct answer here) or fail to account for the cycle after 12:00 PM.
*   **Additive vs. Multiplicative increase:** Some students might add $2^\circ$C only once ($30 + 2 = 32$) instead of multiplying by the number of hours.
*   **Confusion with units:** Mixing time units with temperature units.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Familiar Context:** Jodhpur and temperature are relatable concepts.
*   **Simple Numbers:** The rate ($2$) and the base ($30$) are "friendly" numbers.
*   **Fortuitous Error:** A student who incorrectly subtracts $10$ from $4$ (ignoring AM/PM logic) still arrives at $6$ hours, leading them to the correct final temperature.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** Terms like "increases by... per hour" can be difficult for Hindi-medium students with limited English proficiency.
*   **Multi-step logic:** It requires finding the time interval first, then the total increase, then the final sum.
*   **Time conversion:** Transitioning from AM to PM is a frequent stumbling block for Grade 6 students.
*   **Open-ended format:** No options to provide a hint or allow for process of elimination.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
While the arithmetic is simple, the combination of the English language barrier for this specific demographic and the multi-step nature of the problem (Time $\rightarrow$ Rate $\rightarrow$ Addition) poses a challenge. However, the "lucky" mathematical coincidence (where $10$ to $4$ is $6$ hours, and $10$ minus $4$ is $6$) will likely inflate the success rate.
