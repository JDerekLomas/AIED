**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   Understanding division with decimals.
*   The ability to transform a divisor with a decimal into a whole number (e.g., multiplying both terms by 10 to get $80 \div 72$).
*   Knowledge of fractions and simplification (reducing $80/72$ to $10/9$) or long division resulting in a repeating decimal ($1.11...$).
*   Place value logic.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **"Division makes numbers smaller":** Students might expect a result smaller than 8 and struggle when the quotient is larger than 1.
*   **Decimal Placement:** A common error is ignoring the decimal and calculating $72 \div 8 = 9$ or $8 \div 72 = 0.11$, then placing the decimal point randomly. This *would* lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Commutativity Misconception:** Treating $8 \div 7.2$ as $7.2 \div 8$ because the latter is "easier" to calculate. This would result in $0.9$, an incorrect answer.
*   **Remainder handling:** Students may stop at a remainder instead of continuing into decimal places, which is often required in Grade 7.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   The numbers are small (single and double digits).
*   The divisor $7.2$ is close to a whole number, making estimation possible.
*   The operation (division) is a core part of the Grade 7 curriculum in India (NCERT Chapter: Fractions and Decimals).

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **The Divisor is a Decimal:** Dividing *by* a decimal is significantly harder for students than dividing a decimal *by* a whole number.
*   **Repeating Decimal:** The answer $1.11...$ is non-terminating. Students often find non-terminating results confusing and assume they have made a mistake.
*   **Language/Notation:** While the symbols are universal, the lack of "scaffolding" (multiple choice) makes it harder for students with low confidence.
*   **Economically Weaker Section (EWS) Context:** Students may have gaps in foundational multiplication/division tables (6, 7, 8, 9) due to disrupted schooling or lack of home support, making $80 \div 72$ intimidating.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
In many Indian government schools, while students are drilled in algorithms, dividing a whole number by a larger decimal number that results in a repeating decimal is a high-difficulty task. Many will likely invert the operation or fail to correctly shift the decimal point.
