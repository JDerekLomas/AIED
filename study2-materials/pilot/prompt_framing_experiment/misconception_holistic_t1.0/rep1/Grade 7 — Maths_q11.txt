Step 1: Skills required include data interpretation, choosing a linear scale (proportional reasoning), spatial organization on a grid, and identifying extrema (maximum/minimum).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Inconsistent scaling (e.g., jumping from 0 to 100 then 100 to 110). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Mislabeling axes or swapping X and Y. While technically incorrect, it often still allows for data representation.
- "Bar height" confusion: drawing bars based on the order of the table rather than the numerical value.
- Difficulty with "broken scales" if the data values are all large and close together.

Step 3: Ease factors: The context (school classes) is highly familiar. The task of finding "maximum" and "minimum" is a basic comparison skill. Bar graphs are a repetitive part of the Grade 6 and 7 curriculum.

Step 4: Hardness factors: The open-ended nature of "choose an appropriate scale" is a high-level cognitive task for students used to rote learning. For Hindi-medium students, English terms like "appropriate scale" or "maximum/minimum" may be barriers if not translated. Drawing a precise graph from scratch is time-consuming and prone to manual errors (using a ruler, equal spacing).

Step 5: While many students will correctly identify the max/min (part b), the rubric for part (a) is quite strict regarding the "suitable and consistent scale." In economically weaker sections where graph paper may be scarce or instruction focuses on arithmetic over geometry/graphing, the construction of the scale is a significant hurdle.
