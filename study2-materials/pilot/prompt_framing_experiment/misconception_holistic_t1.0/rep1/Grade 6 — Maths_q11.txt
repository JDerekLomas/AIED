**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Concept recognition:** Identifying that "maximum value" for "exact number of times" implies the Greatest Common Divisor or Highest Common Factor (HCF).
*   **Arithmetic skill:** Finding the factors of 75 and 69 or performing prime factorization.
*   **Division/Multiplication:** Basic fluency to verify factors (e.g., recognizing that 69 is divisible by 3).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **LCM vs. HCF Confusion:** Many students see the word "maximum" and associate it with "Multiple" (LCM) because they confuse the "Least" in LCM with smaller numbers and "Highest" in HCF with larger numbers. This would lead to an incorrect, very large answer.
*   **Additive reasoning:** Some may subtract the numbers ($75 - 69 = 6$) thinking the difference is the "measure," leading to an incorrect answer.
*   **Operational Trigger:** Students may simply add the two weights ($144$ kg) because "two bags" suggests a total.

**Step 3: Factors that make it easier**
*   **Familiar context:** "Bags of fertiliser" and "weights" are standard textbook examples in Indian NCERT Grade 6 curricula.
*   **Small numbers:** 75 and 69 are relatively small and manageable for prime factorization or division.
*   **Keyword cue:** The word "maximum" is a direct signal often taught by teachers to indicate HCF.

**Step 4: Factors that make it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium/ESL students, the phrase "measure... an exact number of times" is linguistically complex. Understanding that a "weight" refers to a physical object used for measurement (a "batta") rather than the weight of the bag itself requires high reading comprehension.
*   **Abstract Reasoning:** The concept of a measurement unit "fitting" exactly into two different quantities is a high-level abstraction for 11-year-olds.
*   **Number Property:** 69 is a tricky number; many students mistakenly believe it is prime because it doesn't appear in the basic 2–10 times tables as frequently as others.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
While the math is simple ($HCF(75, 69) = 3$), the linguistic density of the question and the common confusion between HCF and LCM at this grade level—especially for students with limited English proficiency—poses a significant barrier. In government school contexts, students often rely on rote memorization of "keywords," which may help some, but many will struggle to translate the word problem into the correct operation.
