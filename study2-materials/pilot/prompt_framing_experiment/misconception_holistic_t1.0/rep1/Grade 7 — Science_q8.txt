Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Science item, the underlying logical structure involves "if-then" conditional reasoning and classification. Students must create a comparative experimental design where they map observed physical changes (color) to specific categories (acid/base).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **The "Neutral" Blind Spot:** Students often forget that an indicator may stay the same color in a neutral substance. On this item, it might lead to a failure to distinguish between acid and neutral if using turmeric alone.
*   **Color Confusion:** Swapping the results (thinking turmeric turns red in acid). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Universal Indicator Assumption:** Thinking all indicators turn the same colors (e.g., assuming everything turns red in acid like litmus). This leads to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** Turmeric (*Haldi*) and Hibiscus (*Gudhal*) are highly familiar, everyday materials in Indian households, making the chemistry feel grounded.
*   **Direct Curriculum Link:** Indicators are a core, highly emphasized topic in Grade 7 NCERT Science.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students with limited English, "extract" and "determine" are academic terms that may be confusing.
*   **Open-ended Format:** Unlike a multiple-choice question, students must construct a sentence in English. This is the biggest hurdle for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency.
*   **Two-Part Requirement:** The question provides two indicators, requiring the student to organize a clear explanation for at least one (or both) to get the mark.

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.
While the science concept is foundational, the combination of an open-ended descriptive requirement and the English language barrier for this specific demographic significantly lowers the success rate compared to a recognition-based task.
