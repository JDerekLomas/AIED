Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a vocabulary question assessing semantic knowledge (antonyms). No mathematical concepts are involved.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Confusing Synonym for Antonym:** A student might provide a word with a similar meaning (e.g., "old"). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Part-of-Speech Mismatch:** A student might provide a noun instead of an adjective (e.g., "today"), though this is less common at this level.
*   **Translation Error:** A student from a Hindi-medium background might know the concept of "Prachin" (ancient) and "Adhunik" (modern) but may not have the English labels mapped to those concepts.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Standard Vocabulary:** "Ancient" and "Modern" are frequently paired in History/Social Science textbooks in Indian schools (e.g., Ancient India vs. Modern India).
*   **Simple Rubric:** Accepting both "modern" and "new" provides a safety net for students with more basic vocabularies.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For students from economically weaker sections with limited English exposure, "ancient" is a relatively "low-frequency" word compared to "big" or "hot."
*   **Open-ended format:** Without a word bank or multiple-choice options, students must recall the spelling and the specific word from memory rather than simply recognizing it.
*   **Hindi-English Mapping:** The mental translation step (Ancient -> Purana/Prachin -> Opposite -> Naya/Adhunik -> Modern) increases the cognitive load.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the concept is taught in Social Science, the English proficiency gap in government schools for EWS students remains high. The lack of options (multiple choice) significantly lowers the success rate compared to a recognition-based task.
