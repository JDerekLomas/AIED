Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required include place value (understanding thousands vs. hundreds), comparing multi-digit numbers, and the sequential logic of "ascending order" (smallest to largest).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include "length-is-magnitude" (thinking longer numbers are always larger, which actually helps here) and "left-to-right comparison" without checking place value. A specific misconception is treating each digit independently. However, since the smallest number (736) has fewer digits than the others, these misconceptions are less likely to lead to an error in identifying the first number.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The smallest number is the only 3-digit number among 4-digit numbers, making it visually distinct. The vocabulary "ascending order" is a standard part of the Indian Grade 6 curriculum. The rubric is very generous, awarding full marks (0.5) just for the first step.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English term "ascending" can sometimes be confused with "descending" if not well-drilled. The numbers themselves are large (in the thousands), which can be intimidating for struggling learners.

Step 5: Holistically, this is a foundational "low-floor" task. The clear visual cue of the 3-digit number and the lenient rubric significantly increase the success rate.
