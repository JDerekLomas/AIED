Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required:
*   Knowledge of algebraic terminology (understanding "product" and "binomials").
*   Application of the Distributive Property (FOIL method or horizontal/column multiplication).
*   Laws of Indices ($a \cdot a = a^2$).
*   Operations with integers (handling positive and negative coefficients).
*   Combining like terms (identifying that $ab$ and $ba$ are like terms and performing $9ab - 4ab$).

Step 2: Common misconceptions:
*   **Concatenation/Freshman's Dream:** Adding terms instead of multiplying or simply squaring individual terms (e.g., $6a^2 - 6b^2$). *Result: Incorrect.*
*   **Sign Errors:** Mismanaging the negative sign of the second binomial term ($-2b \times 3b = +6b^2$ instead of $-6b^2$). *Result: Incorrect.*
*   **Variable Confusion:** Treating $a$ and $b$ as the same variable or failing to square the variable during multiplication. *Result: Incorrect.*
*   **Incomplete Distribution:** Multiplying only the first terms and the last terms. *Result: Incorrect.*

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
*   The numbers (coefficients 2 and 3) are very small and familiar.
*   This is a "standard" textbook problem type; students in Indian government schools undergo heavy rote drill for "Find the product" exercises.
*   The variables $a$ and $b$ are the most common variables used in drills.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the word "product" or "binomial" may be less familiar than the Hindi equivalents (*गुणनफल* and *द्विपद*).
*   **Format:** The open-ended nature requires the student to remember the entire process without cues from options.
*   **Negative Sign:** The presence of $– 2b$ introduces a high probability of sign errors during the distribution phase.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate:
While the calculation is standard, the combination of the English phrasing, the negative sign, and the need to combine like terms correctly without a calculator or options creates multiple points of failure for students with weaker foundational skills.
