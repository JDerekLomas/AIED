Step 1: The question primarily requires visual identification and cause-effect reasoning. In an Indian curriculum context (NCERT), this relates to the chapter "Conservation of Plants and Animals." Skills include identifying deforestation and predicting environmental consequences (drought, global warming, habitat loss).

Step 2: Misconceptions include "Plants grow back instantly" or confusing "deforestation" with "reforestation." However, for this item, a major hurdle isn't a scientific misconception but a linguistic one—students might know the Hindi term "Jangal ki katai" but struggle to retrieve or spell the English terms "Deforestation" or "Consequences."

Step 3: Ease factors: The context is highly familiar and visual. Cutting trees is a common sight and a recurring theme in environmental studies since Grade 3. The rubric is generous ("Any sufficient description"), meaning simple English or even broken phrases might earn credit.

Step 4: Hardness factors: The question is open-ended (no options). Part (b) requires a multi-step ecological understanding (sustained cutting leading to long-term effects). For Hindi-medium/EWS students, the word "consequences" and "sustained" are advanced vocabulary that may be incomprehensible, even if they understand the picture.

Step 5: While the concept is simple, the language barrier regarding the specific terminology ("consequences") will prevent many students from providing a "fully correct" answer in English, even if they understand the science.
