Step 1: This is a Social Science (Civics/Political Science) item, not a mathematical one. The skills required include comparative analysis, categorization of public vs. private sectors, and evidence-based argumentation.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Public healthcare is always "free" (ignoring nominal registration fees).
- Private healthcare is always "better" (ignoring issues of unnecessary procedures or costs).
- Only the poor go to public hospitals and only the rich go to private ones. 
Since the rubric asks for any two features/differences, these misconceptions might actually lead to a "correct" answer under the broad rubric provided (e.g., mentioning "it is for the poor" might be accepted as a feature of public healthcare).

Step 3: Ease factors:
- Familiarity: Students from economically weaker sections often have direct, frequent experience with government hospitals (OHS/PHCs) and local private clinics.
- Low threshold rubric: The rubric only requires two features to get full marks.
- Language: "Public" and "Private" are common terms even in Hindi-medium contexts (Sarkari vs. Private).

Step 4: Hardship factors:
- Linguistic barrier: Limited English proficiency makes "Evaluate" and "valid argument" difficult to comprehend.
- Open-ended format: No cues or options to guide the student.
- Writing skills: Students may know the difference but struggle to articulate a "valid argument" in a second language.

Step 5: While the content is highly relatable to their lived experience, the linguistic demand of the word "Evaluate" and the requirement to write in English will hinder many. However, the generous rubric (1 mark for just two features) helps.
