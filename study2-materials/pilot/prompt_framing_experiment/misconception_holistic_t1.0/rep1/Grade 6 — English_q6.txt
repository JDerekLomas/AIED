Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a subjective English Language Arts (ELA) question, not a mathematical one. However, the cognitive skills required include identification (selection), synthesis (connecting the line to a reason), and expressive language (writing a justification).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
While not mathematical, common misconceptions or errors at this level include:
- Literalism: Thinking "like" refers to the literal content rather than personal preference.
- Confusion of "Line" vs. "Stanza": Identifying a whole paragraph/stanza instead of a single line. (Would lead to partial or no credit).
- Circular Reasoning: Saying "I like it because it is good." (Would fail the "why" rubric requirement).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
- Subjectivity: There is no "wrong" choice of line, reducing the fear of being incorrect.
- Familiarity: Students usually study the poem in class before the test.
- Rubric: The bar for "mentioning why" is often low in grading practices for this demographic.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
- Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students, explaining "why" in English is a significant hurdle. They may know why in their mother tongue but lack the vocabulary (adjectives, conjunctions like 'because') to express it.
- Open-ended format: No scaffolding or sentence starters are provided.
- Abstract reasoning: Identifying personal resonance with text is an abstract skill compared to rote memorization.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
Given the English proficiency constraints of students from economically weaker sections in Hindi-medium backgrounds, many will successfully identify a line (copying it from the paper), but a significant portion will struggle to articulate a coherent "why" in English that satisfies the rubric.
