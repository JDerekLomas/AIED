Step 1: Identify the concepts and skills required.
Although categorized as Science, this item requires cognitive linguistic skills: categorization, retrieval of biological traits (growth, movement, respiration), and the ability to express comparisons in writing.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Movement = Living:** Students often think anything that moves (like a car or clouds) is living. This could lead to a partially correct answer if they list "movement" for living, but an incorrect justification for non-living.
*   **Dormancy:** Thinking seeds or eggs are non-living because they don't move or breathe visibly.
*   **Confusion between "Dead" and "Non-living":** Students often struggle to categorize once-living things (like a wooden table) correctly. 
*   **Language barrier:** Hindi-medium students may know the concepts (*sajeeb/nirjeeb*) but struggle to retrieve the English terms (*reproduce/respire*).

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Familiar context:** This is a foundational topic taught from early primary grades.
*   **Broad Rubric:** The rubric is very generous; despite the question asking for "two key characteristics for each," the rubric suggests a score is awarded for providing just "one valid characteristic of living things."
*   **Low threshold:** Simple words like "eat," "grow," or "walk" are often accepted as valid characteristics at this level.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **English Proficiency:** For students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds, spelling "characteristics" or "reproduce" can be a barrier to attempting the written response.
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no cues or pictures to prompt their memory.
*   **Structural complexity:** "Differentiate" requires a structured comparison which is harder than simple recall.

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.
The mismatch between the question (asking for four total points) and the rubric (scoring based on one point) suggests that many students will receive the 0.5 marks even if their answer is incomplete. Because the concepts are fundamental and the grading threshold is very low, a majority of students will likely provide at least one correct characteristic.
