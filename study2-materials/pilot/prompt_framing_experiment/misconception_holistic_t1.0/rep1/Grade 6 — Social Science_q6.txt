Step 1: The item is for Social Science, not Mathematics. The primary cognitive skills required are classification, recall of definitions, and providing specific examples. It requires distinguishing between tangible material culture and written records.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Believing "history" only refers to written books (Literary).
- Thinking "archaeology" only means dinosaurs or fossils (Natural History vs. Human History).
- Confusing "Inscriptions" (Archaeological) with "Manuscripts" (Literary) because both involve writing.
- Misunderstanding "sources" as "places" (e.g., a museum) rather than the objects themselves.
On this item, confusing inscriptions with literary sources is the most likely cause of error.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- These are introductory concepts usually taught in the first chapter of Grade 6 History.
- The examples (coins, monuments, books) are concrete and tangible.
- It is a standard "textbook" question often practiced in class.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- The English word "Differentiate" is a high-level academic term that Hindi-medium students may struggle to decode.
- The rubric requires two definitions AND two examples for a single mark; if a student provides only one side or forgets an example, they get zero.
- "Archaeological" and "Literary" are long, phonetically difficult words for English Language Learners (ELL).
- The open-ended format requires generative writing rather than simple recognition.

Step 5: Given the language barrier and the strictness of the 1-mark rubric (requiring four distinct pieces of information: two definitions and two examples), many students will likely provide a partial or half-correct answer that scores zero.
