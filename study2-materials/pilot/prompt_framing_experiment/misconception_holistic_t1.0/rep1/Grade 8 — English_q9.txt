Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a language arts (English) question, not a mathematical one. It requires vocabulary recall, understanding of semantics (word meanings), and the ability to differentiate between words with similar meanings (synonyms) and opposite meanings (antonyms).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- Confusion between "synonym" and "antonym": Students often swap the two, providing the opposite for the synonym and vice versa. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Hindi-to-English translation errors: Students may know the concept in Hindi (पर्यायवाची/विलोम) but lack the English vocabulary to provide the correct written word.
- Phonetical spelling errors: Students might know the word "silent" but spell it "sailent," which may or may not be marked correct depending on the strictness of the evaluator.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- The word "quiet" is a very common "classroom word" frequently used by teachers ("Keep quiet"), making the base word highly familiar.
- The rubric allows for multiple correct answers (silent, calm, peaceful).

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- Open-ended format: There are no multiple-choice options to trigger recognition; it requires pure recall.
- Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, the instructions themselves ("Synonyms" and "Antonyms") are academic jargon that they may not understand even if they know the meaning of "quiet."
- Dual requirement: The student must get both parts correct to earn the 1 mark according to the rubric's "Maximum score: 1" structure (though partial credit is common in practice, the rubric implies an all-or-nothing approach).

Step 5: Estimate what proportion of students would produce the fully correct answer.
While the word "quiet" is familiar, the academic terms "synonym" and "antonym" are significant hurdles for EWS students in Hindi-medium contexts. Many will provide one correctly but mix up the labels or struggle to produce the written English spelling of the opposite (e.g., "noisy" or "loud").
