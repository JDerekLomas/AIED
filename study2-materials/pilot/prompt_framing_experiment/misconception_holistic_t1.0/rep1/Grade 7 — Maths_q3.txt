### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Knowledge of Formula:** Recalling the specific formula for the area of a triangle ($A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$).
*   **Substitution:** Correcting mapping the given values (base = 8, height = 6) into the formula.
*   **Arithmetic Operations:** Performing multiplication ($8 \times 6$) and division by 2 (or multiplying by $0.5$).
*   **Unit Awareness:** Understanding that area is measured in square units ($cm^2$), though the rubric suggests a score of 1 for the correct numerical value.

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **The "Rectangle" Error:** Students often forget the $1/2$ and simply multiply base $\times$ height ($8 \times 6 = 48$). **This would lead to an incorrect answer.**
*   **Additive Reasoning:** Some students add the dimensions ($8 + 6 = 14$) instead of multiplying. **This would lead to an incorrect answer.**
*   **Confusing Perimeter and Area:** Attempting to find the sum of sides (difficult here as the third side is unknown). **This would lead to an incorrect answer.**
*   **Misunderstanding "Height":** In complex diagrams, students struggle with slanted heights; however, since this is a word problem providing the value directly, this misconception is bypassed.

### Step 3: Factors Making the Item Easier
*   **Simple Numbers:** 8 and 6 are small, single-digit integers that are easy to multiply and divide by 2.
*   **Direct Language:** The question uses standard keywords ("base," "height," "area") that are common in both English and Hindi-medium instruction (*aadhar*, *unchai*, *kshetrafal*).
*   **Single-Step Execution:** Once the formula is recalled, it is a straightforward "plug and chug" problem.
*   **Familiar Context:** This is a "textbook" example of a standard geometry problem practiced extensively in Grade 6 and 7.

### Step 4: Factors Making the Item Harder
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students with limited English, "whose" or the sentence structure might be slightly confusing, though the mathematical terms are usually recognizable.
*   **Open-Ended Format:** There
