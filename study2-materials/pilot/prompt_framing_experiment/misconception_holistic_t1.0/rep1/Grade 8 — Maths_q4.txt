**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Cross-multiplication:** Understanding that for an equation $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, one can multiply $a \cdot d$ and $b \cdot c$.
*   **Distributive Law:** Correcting multiplying the constant by both terms in the binomial, e.g., $5(x - 5) = 5x - 25$.
*   **Transposition/Variable Isolation:** Moving terms with $x$ to one side and constants to the other.
*   **Integer Arithmetic:** Handling subtractions and potential negative signs during transposition.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Partial Distribution:** Multiplying 5 by $x$ but not by $-5$ (i.e., $5x - 5$). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Additive/Subtractive Errors:** Attempting to move denominators by adding/subtracting them instead of multiplying. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Sign Confusion:** Changing the sign of the constant incorrectly when moving it across the equals sign. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Reciprocal Confusion:** Multiplying the left numerator by the left denominator instead of the right. This leads to an incorrect answer.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Symmetry:** The numbers (3 and 5) are small, prime, and mirrored, making the structure easy to recognize.
*   **No Decimals/Fractions in Solution:** The result $x = 8$ is a clean integer, which provides psychological "confirmation" to the student.
*   **Standard Procedure:** This is a "textbook" example of a linear equation often drilled heavily in the NCERT curriculum.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** While the math is symbolic, the instruction "Solve the equation" may be a hurdle for Hindi-medium students if they are not familiar with English imperatives, though the symbols are universal.
*   **Lack of Scaffolding:** Being open-ended (non-MCQ), there are no "hints" to work backward from.
*   **Multiple Failure Points:** A mistake in any of the four steps (cross-multiplication, distribution, transposition, division) results in zero credit according to the rubric.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
Given the heavy emphasis on procedural drill in Indian government schools for the "Linear Equations in One Variable" chapter, many students will recognize the cross-multiplication pattern. However, the distributive property ($5 \times 5 = 25$) remains a high-frequency error zone for students from disadvantaged backgrounds with lower foundational literacy.
