Step 1: The question requires basic reading comprehension and the ability to link a visual metaphor (the "question mark" shape) to a physical description. While the subject is English, the underlying conceptual skill involves geometric visualization and pattern recognition.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include literalism (thinking the tail *is* a punctuation mark rather than looking like one) and linguistic interference (not understanding the word "tail" or "described"). In this specific item, a student might describe the squirrel's behavior (playing, eating) instead of its physical appearance.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The poem "The Squirrel" is a standard text in the NCERT curriculum used in Indian government schools. The imagery of the "question mark" is the most famous and emphasized line of the poem. The context is a common animal.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: The open-ended format requires writing in English, which is difficult for Hindi-medium students. Limited English proficiency may prevent them from formulating the sentence "an interrogation mark" or "a question mark for tail," even if they understand the concept. Many students may struggle to recall the specific vocabulary from the text under test conditions.

Step 5: Given the heavy emphasis on rote memorization of textbook questions in this specific demographic, many students will have memorized the phrase "question mark for tail." However, the language barrier and the requirement to produce a written answer rather than selecting one will significantly lower the success rate.
