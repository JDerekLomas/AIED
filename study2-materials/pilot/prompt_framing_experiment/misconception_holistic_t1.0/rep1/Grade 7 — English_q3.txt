Step 1: The question is labeled as "Subject: English," but your instructions ask for an analysis of "mathematical concepts and skills." In a cross-disciplinary sense, the skills required here involve logical reasoning, cause-and-effect mapping (if X then Y), and sequential logic. However, strictly speaking, there are no arithmetic or geometric concepts involved.

Step 2: Common misconceptions in logical reasoning at this level include "affirming the consequent" or circular reasoning. In this specific item, a student might incorrectly state that "he would never fail because he is the king" (misunderstanding causality) or fail to link the "answers" to "success."

Step 3: Factors making it easier include the narrative context (The Three Questions by Leo Tolstoy is a standard text) and the fact that the rubric allows for "any valid reason," providing a low threshold for the logic required.

Step 4: Factors making it harder are significant for this demographic:
- **Language Barrier:** The prompt is in English. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle to decode the syntax of "Why the king felt he would..." and "if he knew..."
- **Productive Skill:** It is an open-ended question requiring the construction of 2-3 original sentences in a second language, which is significantly harder than a multiple-choice math problem.
- **Instructional Gap:** Students may know the answer in Hindi but lack the English vocabulary (e.g., "right time," "avoid failure") to secure the mark.

Step 5: Given the English language proficiency barrier for students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, even if they understand the logic of the story, the requirement to explain it in 2-3 English sentences will result in a low success rate.
