**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Integer multiplication:** Understanding the operation of multiplication applied to negative numbers.
*   **Sign rules (Arithmetic Logic):** Applying the specific rule that the product of two negative integers is a positive integer.
*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Multiplying single-digit constants ($3 \times 4$).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Sign Confusion (Negative + Negative = Negative):** Students often confuse the rules of addition with multiplication. Because $-3 + (-4) = -7$, they may conclude that $(-3) \times (-4) = -12$. This **would** lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Sign Neglect:** Ignoring the signs entirely and treating it as $3 \times 4$. This would accidentally lead to the **correct** answer (12), though for the wrong reason.
*   **Overgeneralization:** Thinking that any operation involving two negatives must result in a negative. This **would** lead to an incorrect answer.

**Step 3: Factors that make it easier**
*   **Simple Numbers:** The numbers 3 and 4 are very basic, minimizing calculation errors.
*   **Familiar Notation:** The use of parentheses to separate the multiplication sign from the negative sign is standard in Indian NCERT textbooks.
*   **No Language Barrier:** The question uses minimal English ("Find the value of"), which is easily understood even by students with limited English proficiency or those from Hindi-medium backgrounds.
*   **Rote Memorization:** The rule "Minus minus plus" is often taught as a rhythmic chant in Indian classrooms, making it highly memorable.

**Step 4: Factors that make it harder**
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no options to nudge the student toward the correct sign.
*   **Abstract nature:** There is no real-world context to help the student "sense-check" why a negative times a negative is positive.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
In the context of Indian government schools, integer multiplication is a high-priority topic in the Grade 7 curriculum. While sign confusion is common, the simplicity of the digits (3 and 4) and the heavy emphasis on "sign rules" in drill-based practice usually result in a high success rate. Many students who don't fully understand the concept will still apply the memorized rule
