Step 1: The question requires biological classification and conceptual understanding of energy flow. While not purely mathematical, it involves binary logic (self-produced vs. externally acquired) and categorization.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include the belief that "making food" refers to the act of cooking (for humans), or that plants "eat" soil. On this specific item, the "cooking" misconception often leads students to incorrectly classify humans as autotrophs, resulting in an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Ease factors: These are foundational terms introduced early in Grade 7 Science (Chapter 1). The contrast between the two is a classic "rote-learning" staple in Indian curriculum, and the examples (plants vs. animals) are highly familiar.

Step 4: Difficulty factors: The linguistic barrier is significant; "Autotrophic" and "Heterotrophic" are complex Greek-rooted English terms that are difficult to spell and distinguish for Hindi-medium students. The open-ended format requires constructing a full sentence in English, which is a major hurdle for students from economically weaker sections with limited English exposure.

Step 5: While the concept is simple, the requirement to define both and provide examples in English, combined with the "cooking" misconception, will lead to partial or incorrect responses for many.
