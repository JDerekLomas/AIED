Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science (History) question, not a mathematics question. It requires recall of factual knowledge, specifically historical figures (kings) and their classification into a specific timeline (medieval) and geography (Rajasthan).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Chronological confusion:** Students might list ancient kings (e.g., Ashoka) or modern leaders. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Geographical confusion:** Students might list famous kings from other regions (e.g., Shivaji Maharaj or Akbar). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Terminology confusion:** Misunderstanding "medieval" due to limited English proficiency.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Familiar context:** For students in or near Rajasthan, figures like Maharana Pratap and Prithviraj Chauhan are cultural icons mentioned frequently in folklore, local language textbooks, and regional media.
*   **Low threshold:** The rubric only requires "any two" names, allowing for flexibility.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** The term "medieval" is a technical English term. Hindi-medium students might not immediately connect it to "Madhyakalin," leading to hesitation.
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no cues or options to trigger recognition; it requires pure recall.
*   **Writing constraint:** Students with limited English/literacy may know the names orally but struggle to spell them in a way the examiner accepts.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given the cultural significance of these figures in the Indian curriculum and Rajasthan's regional history, most students will recognize the names. However, the English medium of the question and the requirement to recall and spell two names correctly will pose a challenge for students from economically weaker sections with limited English support.
