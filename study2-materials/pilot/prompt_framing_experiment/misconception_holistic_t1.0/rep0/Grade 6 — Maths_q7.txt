**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Time Calculation:** Calculating the duration between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM (crossing the 12-hour meridian).
*   **Rate Application:** Understanding "per hour" as a multiplier.
*   **Multi-step Arithmetic:** Multiplying the rate by the duration ($6 \text{ hours} \times 2^\circ\text{C}$) and then adding that product to the initial temperature ($30^\circ\text{C} + 12^\circ\text{C}$).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Subtraction Error (Time):** Students might subtract 4 from 10 ($10 - 4 = 6$), accidentally getting the right duration, or do $10 + 4 = 14$. If they simply see the numbers 10 and 4, they may fail to realize 6 hours have passed.
*   **Additive Rate:** Some might add the rate only once ($30 + 2 = 32$) or add the end time to the temperature ($30 + 4 = 34$).
*   **12-Hour Clock Confusion:** Students often struggle with the transition from AM to PM. Some might count from 10 to 4 as 2 hours (10 to 12) if they get confused by the reset at 12.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Familiar Context:** Temperature and time are daily realities. Jodhpur is a familiar Indian city.
*   **Small, Whole Numbers:** The numbers (30, 2, 10, 4) are easy to manipulate mentally.
*   **Linear Growth:** The concept of something getting hotter as the day progresses is intuitive.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, "increases by... per hour" and the AM/PM distinction in English can be hurdles.
*   **Multi-step logic:** The student must hold the result of the first calculation (6 hours) in memory to perform the second (multiplication) and third (addition).
*   **Open-ended:** No options to provide a "hint" or allow for back-calculation.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
While the math is basic (6th-grade level), the combination of the AM/PM time jump and the multi-step nature of the word problem—compounded by English language constraints for this specific demographic—will lead to many "dropped" steps or calculation errors.
