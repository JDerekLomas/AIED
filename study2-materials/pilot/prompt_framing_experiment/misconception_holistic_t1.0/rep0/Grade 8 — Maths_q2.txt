Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required:
*   Knowledge of algebraic terminology (understanding "product" and "binomials").
*   Application of the Distributive Property (specifically the FOIL method or horizontal/column multiplication).
*   Laws of Indices (multiplying variables: $a \times a = a^2$).
*   Operations with integers (handling positive and negative coefficients).
*   Combining like terms ($9ab$ and $-4ab$).

Step 2: Common misconceptions:
*   **The "Freshman's Dream" for products:** Thinking $(3a-2b)(2a+3b) = 6a^2 - 6b^2$, ignoring middle terms. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Variable confusion:** Treating $a+b$ as $ab$ or $a^2$. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Sign errors:** Incorrectly distributing the negative sign from $-2b$ across the second binomial. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Misinterpreting "Product":** Students might attempt to add the binomials instead of multiplying. (Leads to incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
*   The numbers (coefficients) are small single digits (2 and 3).
*   The structure is a standard textbook "FOIL" problem, which is a heavily drilled skill in the Grade 8 Indian curriculum (NCERT/State Boards).
*   The variables $a$ and $b$ are the most common variables used in practice problems.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the English term "product of the binomials" may be less familiar than the Hindi equivalents "गुणनफल" (product) and "द्विपद" (binomial).
*   **Open-ended format:** No options to work backward from or to provide a hint of the expected structure.
*   **Multiple signs:** The presence of both a minus and a plus sign increases the likelihood of an arithmetic error.

Step 5: Holistic estimate:
In the context of Indian government schools, while students from EWS backgrounds face language barriers, "Algebraic Expressions and Identities" is a major unit in Grade 8. These specific types of procedural problems are the focus of intense rote practice and "chalk and talk" instruction. The simple coefficients make the computation accessible, but the requirement to correctly combine middle terms and handle the negative sign usually results in a significant number of errors.
