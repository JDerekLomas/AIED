Step 1: Identify the scientific concepts and skills required.
Students must recall the specific chemical reagent used for starch (iodine solution) and the specific color change associated with a positive result (blue-black). They must also possess the English writing skills to "describe" the procedure and "state" the observation.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Confusing reagents: Using Benedict's solution (sugar) or Copper Sulphate/Caustic Soda (protein) for starch. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   Color confusion: Expecting a generic change (like "turning red" or "turning green") rather than blue-black. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   Misunderstanding "iodine": Some students may confuse iodine with salt (iodized salt). (Leads to incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
*   Familiar context: Potatoes are a staple food and the "Iodine Test" is a foundational experiment in the NCERT Grade 6 Science curriculum.
*   Single-step experiment: The procedure is direct (drop liquid on food).
*   Low rubric threshold: The rubric only requires mentioning iodine, suggesting partial credit or a lenient marking scheme despite the two-part prompt.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
*   Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students with limited English, "Describe" and "Observation" are academic tier-2/3 words that may be intimidating.
*   Open-ended format: No multiple-choice options to trigger recognition; requires pure recall.
*   Specific terminology: Spelling "iodine" or describing "blue-black" correctly in a second language.

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.
While the experiment is a curriculum highlight, the requirement to "describe" and "state" in English, combined with the potential confusion between different food tests, makes this challenging for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. However, since the rubric only specifically asks for the mention of "iodine" for the full point, the barrier is lower than the prompt suggests.
