Step 1: Identify the concepts and skills required.
Although categorized as Social Science, the item requires cognitive skills: understanding the abstract concept of "transparency" (openness/accountability) and "governance" (the act of ruling/managing). It requires linguistic decoding and the ability to generate a constructive suggestion.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
1. Confusing "transparency" with "honesty" or "kindness": Students might suggest leaders should be "good people," which may be marked incorrect if not linked to systemic transparency.
2. Equating "governance" only with the Prime Minister or Police: This narrow view might limit their ability to think of systems like RTI (Right to Information).
3. Linguistic barrier: In Hindi-medium contexts, "transparency" (paradarshita) and "governance" (shasan) are academic terms. If the student doesn't know the English word, they cannot answer.
In this item, these misconceptions/barriers would lead to no answer or an irrelevant one.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
- The rubric is very generous: only one "plausible" way is needed for full marks.
- Familiarity with "corruption" (the opposite of transparency) is high in economically weaker sections; students often have lived experience of bureaucratic hurdles.
- Recent government focus on "Digital India" and "RTI" in curriculum makes these common "rote" answers.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Open-ended format: No cues to trigger memory.
- Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, the phrase "improve transparency in governance" is linguistically dense and abstract.
- Grade level: Grade 7 students (approx. 12 years old) are just beginning to transition from concrete to abstract political thought.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
The generous rubric (only 1 point, any plausible answer) significantly raises the success rate. However, the abstract English terminology will be a major barrier for students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds. Many will leave it blank or provide a generic "stop corruption" answer, which should be accepted under the rubric.
