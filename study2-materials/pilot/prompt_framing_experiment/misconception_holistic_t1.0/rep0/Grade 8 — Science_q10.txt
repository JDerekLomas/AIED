Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Science item, it requires understanding "Rate and Change" (temperature over time) and "Measurement" (specific values of 70°C and 15-30 seconds). Students must grasp the sequence of operations (heating followed by rapid cooling) and the concept of "suddenness" in temperature change.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
1. Boiling vs. Pasteurization: Students often believe pasteurization is simply boiling milk to kill all germs. This leads to omitting the "rapid cooling" step. (Likely to lead to an incorrect answer).
2. Duration: Students may think the milk needs to be heated for a long time to be safe. (Incorrect).
3. Preservation vs. Sterilization: Students may think pasteurized milk lasts forever without refrigeration. (May not affect this specific answer if the "process" is described correctly).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
1. Context: Milk is a daily household item, and the word "Pasteurized" is printed on almost all milk pouches (Amul/Mother Dairy) in India.
2. Rubric Lenience: The rubric does not require specific numbers, reducing the cognitive load of memorization.
3. Rote Learning: This is a classic "definition" question frequently emphasized in Indian textbooks (NCERT), making it a high-priority target for memorization.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
1. Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students, "Describe" and "Process" are academic English terms that may be intimidating. They might know the concept in Hindi (पाश्चुरीकरण) but struggle to construct the sentence in English.
2. Open-ended format: No cues or options are provided to trigger memory.
3. Two-part question: It requires the "Process" AND the "Why," increasing the risk of a partial (incorrect) answer.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
The familiarity of the topic and the leniency of the rubric (not requiring numbers) are strong boosters. However, the requirement to explain both the "how" and the "why" in a second language for EWS students creates a significant barrier. Many will provide a partial answer (e.g., "it kills germs") but miss the specific two-step temperature shock process required for the full mark.
