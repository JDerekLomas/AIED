Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, it requires spatial reasoning and categorization skills. Students must identify a subset (Rajasthan) within a set (India) and associate it with a specific physical attribute (landform).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Confusing state boundaries with national boundaries: Students might name the Himalayas (North India) or the Deccan Plateau (South India). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   Confusing "Landform" with "Climate": Students might describe "hot and dry" without naming the Desert.
*   Scale confusion: Students might name a city (Jaipur) instead of a landform. This leads to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   Familiar Context: Rajasthan's desert (Thar) is a culturally iconic part of the Indian curriculum and identity, often reinforced through stories and media.
*   Limited Options: There are only two major correct answers (Thar or Aravallis), one of which is highly distinct.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students, the phrase "major landforms" (bhū-ākṛti) might be difficult to decode in English.
*   Grammar/Syntax: The phrasing "Name the one major landforms" is grammatically incorrect (singular/plural mismatch), which can confuse students with low English proficiency.
*   Format: Open-ended "briefly describe" requires expressive language skills in English, which is a significant barrier for this demographic.
*   Low Reward: A maximum score of 0.5 for a two-part task (Name + Describe) reduces student motivation to provide a detailed answer.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
The familiarity of the Thar Desert will help many students identify the name, but the requirement to "briefly describe" it in English will be a significant hurdle for students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds. Many will get the name right but fail the description or leave it blank due to language constraints.
