Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, it involves spatial reasoning and geometric concepts (grid patterns, parallel lines, 90-degree intersections, and volumetric consistency in bricks). Students must understand the concept of a "layout" (spatial organization) and "proportions" (standardized brick sizes).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Confusing "urban planning" with modern technology (e.g., thinking they had electricity), which leads to an incorrect answer.
- Misunderstanding the scale of ancient cities (thinking they were small villages), which may hinder the description of "lower towns."
- Difficulty distinguishing between a "feature" (the design) and an "artifact" (a toy or pot).

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The Harappan Civilization is a foundational and heavily emphasized topic in the NCERT Grade 6 and Grade 8 curricula.
- Visual aids (maps and city plans) are central to the textbook lessons.
- The rubric is generous, accepting several different correct features.
- In Indian schools, "Grid system" and "Drainage" are often taught as rote-memorized keywords, which helps students with limited English.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- English proficiency: Translating the concept of "citadel" or "drainage" from Hindi (Durg/Apvah tantra) to English can be difficult.
- Open-ended format: No cues or options to trigger memory.
- Vocabulary: The word "civilization" and "urban planning" may be intimidating for ESL learners.

Step 5: Holistically, while the language barrier is a hurdle, this specific topic is one of the most rehearsed and "drilled" parts of the Indian History syllabus. Students from economically weaker sections often rely on rote memorization of these specific "key points" to pass exams.
