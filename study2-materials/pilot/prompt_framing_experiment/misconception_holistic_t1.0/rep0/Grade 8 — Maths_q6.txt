Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   Basic multiplication (calculating thrice the current age).
*   Understanding the concept of "age difference."
*   Temporal reasoning (calculating ages after a certain number of years).
*   Problem-solving involving multiple steps (calculating father's age first, then finding the difference).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
*   **The "Growing at Different Rates" Misconception:** Many students believe that if a father is three times older now, the ratio remains constant or the gap increases. This would lead to an incorrect answer (e.g., calculating 17 and 41, or thinking the gap grows).
*   **Additive vs. Multiplicative Reasoning:** Students might add 3 instead of multiplying by 3. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Ignore the "Difference" Instruction:** Students might simply calculate the father's future age (41) or Rahul's future age (17) and stop there.

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** Age problems are a staple of Indian Grade 8 curricula (NCERT).
*   **Simple Numbers:** 12, 3, and 5 are small, easy-to-manage integers requiring no complex calculation.
*   **Hindi-English Cognates:** The word "thrice" is often taught specifically in the context of word problems, and the structure of the sentence is relatively standard.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the word "thrice" might be less familiar than "3 times."
*   **Multi-step logic:** The student must find the father's current age (36), then either subtract 36 - 12 immediately or calculate 41 - 17.
*   **Distractor "5 years":** The inclusion of "after 5 years" is a classic cognitive trap. Many students will feel compelled to use the number 5 in a calculation (e.g., adding 5 to the difference) rather than recognizing that the difference remains constant.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options to choose from, there is no "hint" to guide them toward the constant difference.

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.
While the math is simple, the "age difference remains constant" is a conceptual hurdle that frequently trips up Grade 8 students. In the context of economically weaker sections where English proficiency is a barrier, many students will likely focus on the numbers 12, 3, and 5 and perform operations on them (like 36 + 5 = 41) without correctly identifying that the question asks for the *difference*.
