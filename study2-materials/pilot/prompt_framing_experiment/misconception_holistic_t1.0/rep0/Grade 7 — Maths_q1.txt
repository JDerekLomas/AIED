Step 1: Concepts and Skills
*   Integer multiplication (basic facts).
*   Application of the sign rule for multiplication (negative × negative = positive).
*   Understanding of notation (brackets used to separate signs).

Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Rule confusion (Addition vs. Multiplication):** Students often apply addition rules to multiplication (e.g., "negative plus negative stays negative"), leading to an answer of -12. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **"Greater Sign" rule:** Students incorrectly believe the product takes the sign of the "larger" number. Here, since both are negative, they might produce -12.
*   **Absolute value focus:** Ignoring signs entirely and just multiplying. This would lead to 12 (the correct answer), but for the wrong reason.

Step 3: Factors making it easier
*   **Simple numbers:** 3 and 4 are basic multiplication facts familiar to all Grade 7 students.
*   **Direct calculation:** There is no word problem or linguistic complexity, which helps students with limited English proficiency.
*   **Drill-heavy curriculum:** Indian government school curricula typically emphasize heavy rote practice of sign rules ($-\times- = +$).

Step 4: Factors making it harder
*   **Open-ended:** No options to prompt a "correction" of a sign error.
*   **Abstract nature:** There is no real-world context to help visualize why two negatives make a positive.
*   **Notation:** Brackets can sometimes confuse students who are not firm on operation symbols.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate
Given the heavy emphasis on procedural fluency and the "negative-negative-positive" mantra in Indian classrooms, most students will recognize the operation. However, the common confusion between addition rules ($-3 - 4 = -7$) and multiplication rules is the primary distractor. For many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the symbolic math is a "universal language" that bypasses English barriers, making this more accessible than a word problem.
