### Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required
*   **Knowledge of Geometric Properties:** Understanding the properties of parallelograms (opposite angles are equal, adjacent angles are supplementary).
*   **Angle Relationships:** Identifying linear pairs (angles on a straight line sum to 180°).
*   **Algebraic Application:** Setting up and solving simple linear equations (e.g., $x + 100 = 180$).
*   **Deductive Reasoning:** Using one found value to determine the next.

### Step 2: Common misconceptions
*   **Property Confusion:** Students often confuse properties of parallelograms with those of rectangles or trapezoids (e.g., thinking all four angles must sum to 360° but not knowing how to distribute them). *Likely to lead to an incorrect answer.*
*   **Linear Pair Error:** Mistaking supplementary angles (180°) for complementary angles (90°). *Likely to lead to an incorrect answer.*
*   **Visual Estimation:** Guessing the angle based on how "sharp" or "wide" it looks rather than using geometric theorems. *Likely to lead to an incorrect answer.*

### Step 3: Factors making the item easier
*   **Familiar Numbers:** Usually, these problems use "friendly" numbers like 100° or 60°, making the mental arithmetic (subtraction from 180) straightforward.
*   **Standard Visual:** Parallelograms are a "prototype" shape in Class 8 NCERT textbooks, meaning students have seen this exact figure many times.
*   **Low Linguistic Load:** The prompt is short and uses standard mathematical vocabulary ("find," "measure") that even students with limited English proficiency usually recognize.

### Step 4: Factors making it harder
*   **Reasoning Requirement:** The rubric requires "stating the reason." For Hindi-medium students in an English-medium testing environment, articulating "opposite angles of a parallelogram" or "linear pair" in English is a significant barrier.
*   **Multi-step:** Finding both $x$ and $y$ increases the chance of a computational slip.
*   **Open-ended:** Without options (MCQ), there is no "safety net" to prompt a correction if their calculation results in an illogical number.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the calculation is simple, the requirement to **state the reason** in a second language, combined with the rigorous rubric (all or nothing for 1 mark), makes this challenging for students from economically weaker sections who may have had less exposure to formal geometric proofs.
