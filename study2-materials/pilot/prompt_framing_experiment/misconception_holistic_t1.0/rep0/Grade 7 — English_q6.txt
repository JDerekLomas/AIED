Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is an English Language Arts (ELA) item, not a mathematics item. It requires literary analysis (identifying tone/style), vocabulary knowledge (adjectives like "descriptive" or "informal"), and the ability to synthesize textual evidence into a single descriptive term.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold.
*   **Confusion between "Content" and "Style":** Students often describe *what* the poem is about (e.g., "nature") rather than *how* it is written. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Literal Interpretation:** Students might summarize the plot instead of analyzing the author's craft. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Vocabulary Constraints:** Students may understand the style but lack the English vocabulary to name it.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
*   The rubric is flexible ("other appropriate word"), allowing for a range of synonyms.
*   If the poem is extremely simple (as is common in Grade 7 textbooks), words like "easy" or "simple" might be accepted.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students with limited English proficiency, "writing style" is an abstract concept that is difficult to translate and express in English.
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no options to choose from (no scaffolding), which is significantly harder for ELL (English Language Learner) students.
*   **Abstract Reasoning:** Identifying style requires higher-order thinking skills beyond basic comprehension.

Step 5: Estimate the proportion of students who would produce the fully correct answer.
Given the demographic (economically weaker sections, Hindi-medium background) and the abstract nature of "writing style" in a second language without a word bank, most students will likely struggle to provide a precise English adjective that satisfies the rubric.
