Step 1: Identify mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   **Data Interpretation:** Reading and interpreting a simple frequency/time table.
*   **Ordering Decimals/Integers:** Comparing numerical values to determine "least" and "greatest."
*   **Inverse Relationships:** Understanding that in the context of "speed" or "fastest," the smallest numerical value (shortest time) represents the highest rate.
*   **Variable Control:** Recognizing the "same conditions" implies a fair comparison.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Bigger is Better:** Students often equate "fastest" with the largest number in the table (120 minutes for Salt Solution). This would lead to an incorrect answer for (a).
*   **Unit Confusion:** If the table uses mixed units (e.g., minutes vs. hours), students may fail to convert. However, with uniform units, this is less likely.
*   **Solution vs. Pure Substance:** Misunderstanding that "Salt Solution" is a mixture. While this affects part (b), it might confuse the data reading in part (a).

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** Students in India are familiar with petrol and salt water; the physical phenomenon is observable.
*   **Simple Numbers:** The time values are likely whole numbers or simple decimals, requiring no complex calculation.
*   **Direct Question:** Part (a) is a direct retrieval task from the table.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, words like "evaporate" or "observed" may be barriers if the question isn't bilingual.
*   **Open-ended Reasoning:** Part (b) requires explaining the "why" (solute particles hindering evaporation), which is a high-order cognitive task for Grade 7.
*   **Inverse Logic:** The cognitive leap that "Fastest = Lowest Number" is a frequent stumbling block in lower secondary math/science.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While many students will correctly identify "Petrol" for part (a) because of real-world intuition, the scientific explanation in part (b) regarding the nature of the salt solution (non-volatile solute) is significantly more difficult for students from this demographic to articulate in English.
