Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, it requires specific cognitive and linguistic skills: identifying structural hierarchies (village vs. state), understanding the concept of "decentralization" (redistribution of authority), and correlating administrative functions with specific geographic units.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- The belief that all government power resides only in the Prime Minister or Chief Minister (incorrect answer).
- Confusing the Panchayat with a judiciary body only (Nyaya Panchayat), ignoring administrative/developmental roles (partially incorrect).
- Viewing the Panchayat as a branch of the central government rather than an independent "self-governance" tier (incorrect terminology).

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The context is highly familiar; many students in this demographic live in rural areas or have family ties to villages where the Panchayat is a visible presence. The term "Panchayati Raj" is frequently used in Hindi and local dialects, making the core concept accessible despite limited English.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: The "open-ended" format is a significant barrier for students with limited English proficiency; they may know the answer in Hindi but struggle to articulate "local self-governance" or "grassroots level" in English. The word "primary" requires students to distinguish between one main role and several secondary functions.

Step 5: Holistically, the students' lived experience with the subject matter is a strong advantage, but the linguistic barrier of an open-ended English-medium response and the requirement for specific academic terminology like "self-governance" will suppress the success rate.
