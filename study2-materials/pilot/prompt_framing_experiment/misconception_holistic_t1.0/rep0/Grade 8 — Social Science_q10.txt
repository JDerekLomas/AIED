Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science (History) question. However, from a cognitive and linguistic processing standpoint, it requires chronological sequencing (ordering events in time), cause-and-effect reasoning, and the ability to synthesize narrative information into a concise summary.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **The "Invader" vs. "Trader" distinction:** Students may believe the British arrived with an army ready for conquest immediately. This misconception would lead to an incorrect answer because the rubric specifically requires mentioning their initial status as traders.
*   **Monolithic "British Government":** Students often conflate the East India Company (a private corporation) with the British Crown/Government. While historically inaccurate, if they describe the "British" as traders first, they might still receive the point depending on the teacher's strictness with the term "Company."
*   **Conflating Eras:** Mixing up the Mughal era with the British Raj. This might lead to an answer that misses the "trader" transition phase.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** This is a foundational narrative in the Indian NCERT Grade 8 curriculum ("From Trade to Territory"). It is a "big picture" concept emphasized in almost every classroom.
*   **Low Rubric Threshold:** Despite the prompt asking to "Describe the process" (which sounds complex), the rubric only requires a single mention that they arrived as traders or established factories to get the full 1 mark.
*   **Keywords:** Even with limited English, students often memorize the keywords "Trade," "Company," and "Factory."

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, "Describe the process" is a complex English instruction. They may understand the history but struggle to formulate the sentence in English.
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no cues or options to trigger memory; it requires pure recall.
*   **Discrepancy between Prompt and Rubric:** The prompt asks for a "process" (implying a multi-step explanation), but the rubric only asks for a single fact. Students who overthink may get lost trying to describe battles (Plassey/Buxar) and forget to explicitly state the "trader" starting point.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given that the rubric is extremely lenient (only requiring the mention of "traders") and this is a central theme of the Grade 8 syllabus, a majority of students will be able to provide the necessary keyword, even if their English syntax is poor.
