Step 1: Identify the linguistic and grammatical concepts and skills required.
*   Identification of Subject (The wind), Verb (blew), and Object (the leaves).
*   Knowledge of Verb Tense: Recognizing "blew" as the past tense of "blow."
*   Passive Voice Transformation: Moving the object to the subject position, using the correct form of the auxiliary verb "to be" (were), identifying the past participle (blown), and using the agentive "by" phrase.

Step 2: List common misconceptions/errors.
*   Tense Confusion: Using "are blown" (present) instead of "were blown." This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   Irregular Verb Conjugation: Using "blowed" or "blew" instead of the participle "blown." This is a very common error for ESL learners and would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   Subject-Verb Agreement: Using "was" instead of "were" because they struggle with the plurality of "leaves." This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   Literal Translation: Translating from Hindi (where passive structure is different) often results in missing auxiliary verbs.

Step 3: Factors that make it easier.
*   The sentence is short and the vocabulary (wind, leaves, blow) is relatively common in early English textbooks.
*   The "by the wind" structure is a standard, well-practiced pattern in Indian English pedagogy.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
*   Irregular Verb: "Blow-Blew-Blown" is significantly harder than regular "-ed" verbs. Many students will default to "blowed."
*   Lack of Scaffolding: Being an open-ended (constructed response) item rather than multiple choice makes it much harder for students with limited English proficiency.
*   Plurality: "Leaves" is an irregular plural (leaf-leaves), which adds a layer of complexity to choosing "were."

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the irregular past participle and the requirement to produce the sentence from scratch without options, many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds will struggle with the specific conjugation and the auxiliary verb "were."
