**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Properties of Parallelograms:** Understanding that opposite angles are equal ($x = 110^\circ$) and adjacent/consecutive angles are supplementary ($x + y = 180^\circ$ or $110 + y = 180^\circ$).
*   **Angle Relationships:** Proficiency with parallel lines intersected by a transversal (interior angles on the same side).
*   **Algebraic Application:** Setting up a simple equation ($110 + y = 180$) to find the unknown.
*   **Explanation Skills:** Articulating the geometric property used (e.g., "opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal").

**Step 2: Common Misconceptions**
*   **Confusing Properties:** Thinking all four angles are equal (like a square) or all angles sum to $180^\circ$ (like a triangle). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Visual Guessing:** Estimating based on appearance rather than properties. If the diagram is not to scale, this leads to errors.
*   **Adjacent vs. Opposite:** Misidentifying which angles are equal. If a student thinks adjacent angles are equal, they would incorrectly state $y = 110$.
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may know the concept (समानांतर चतुर्भुज) but struggle to provide the "explanation" required by the rubric in English.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Simple Numbers:** $110$ and $180$ are "friendly" numbers for mental subtraction ($180 - 110 = 70$).
*   **Standard Problem:** This is a "textbook" problem frequently practiced in Grade 8 NCERT/State Board curricula.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Open-ended/No Choices:** Without multiple-choice options, there is no "safety net" or cue for the student.
*   **The "Explanation" Requirement:** The rubric requires an explanation for a full 1 mark. For ESL/Hindi-medium students, writing "Opposite angles are equal" in English is a significant hurdle, even if the math is correct.
*   **Two Variables:** Asking for both $x$ and $y$ increases the chance of a partial error or forgetting to complete the second half of the task.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
While the calculation is straightforward, the requirement for a written explanation and the specific language challenges faced by students from economically weaker backgrounds (limited English exposure) will likely lower the success rate for the "Maximum score." Many will find $x=110$ but may fail to explain it or find $y$ correctly.
