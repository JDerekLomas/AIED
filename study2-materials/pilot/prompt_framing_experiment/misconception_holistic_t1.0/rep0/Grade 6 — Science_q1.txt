Step 1: Identify the mathematical/scientific concepts and skills required.
*   Understanding of polarity (North vs. South poles).
*   Knowledge of the fundamental law of magnetism: "Like poles repel, unlike poles attract."
*   Spatial reasoning regarding the interaction between two physical objects.
*   Linguistic ability to describe a physical observation in English.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
*   "Magnets always stick together": Students may believe magnets are simply "sticky" regardless of orientation. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   "Only one end of a magnet is active": Thinking only one side has force. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   Confusing "Repel" with "Attract": Swapping the definitions of the two terms. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   Confusing magnetic poles with geographic directions (North/South): Thinking the magnets will point toward the Earth's poles rather than interacting with each other. (Leads to incorrect answer).

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
*   The context is highly concrete and often demonstrated through hands-on activities in classrooms.
*   The vocabulary "North pole" is repeated in the question, providing a clear cue of "like poles."
*   It is a foundational, binary-choice concept (attract or repel).

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
*   English Proficiency: For Hindi-medium students, the word "repel" or "observe" may be unfamiliar. They might know the concept in Hindi (प्रतिकर्षण/dhakka dena) but struggle to produce the English term.
*   Open-ended format: No options (MCQs) are provided to trigger recognition; the student must recall and spell the word "repel" or explain "push away."
*   Economically weaker background: Limited access to individual kits/toys; students may only have seen a single teacher demonstration rather than experimenting themselves.

Step 5: Estimate the proportion of students who would produce the fully correct answer.
While the concept is basic, the requirement to produce a written English response (rather than selecting an option) and the linguistic barrier for Hindi-medium students will significantly lower the success rate compared to a multiple-choice version.
