### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Knowledge of Formulas:** Recalling the area of a rectangle ($L \times W$) and the area of a square ($Side \times Side$).
*   **Multiplication:** Basic single-digit multiplication ($5 \times 4$ and $5 \times 5$).
*   **Comparison:** Identifying which of two numerical values is larger.
*   **Multi-step Arithmetic:** Subtracting the smaller area from the larger area to find the difference ("by how much").
*   **Units:** Understanding that area is measured in square units ($cm^2$).

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Perimeter vs. Area:** Students often confuse the two. If a student calculates perimeter, they would get $18$ cm for the rectangle and $20$ cm for the square. They would still conclude the square is "greater," but the "by how much" would be $2$ instead of $5$. **Incorrect Answer.**
*   **Additive Reasoning for Area:** Adding $5+4$ or $5+5$ instead of multiplying. **Incorrect Answer.**
*   **Side-Square Confusion:** Forgetting that a square has four equal sides and only using the given number once or doubling it ($5 \times 2$). **Incorrect Answer.**

### Step 3: Factors Making it Easier
*   **Simple Numbers:** The use of $5$ and $4$ is within basic multiplication tables (up to 10), which are heavily drilled in Indian government schools.
*   **Familiar Shapes:** Rectangles and squares are the primary focus of geometry at the Grade 6 level.
*   **Visual Intuition:** A square with a side of $5$ "feels" larger than a rectangle of $5 \times 4$, guiding students toward the correct comparison.

### Step 4: Factors Making it Harder
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, terms like "greater area" and "by how much" may be difficult to parse in English.
*   **Multi-step Process:** The student must perform two separate calculations, a comparison, and a subtraction. In a 1-point rubric, a mistake in any single step results in zero marks.
*   **Open-ended Format:** No options (MCQs) to provide a "hint" or allow for back-calculation.
*   **Lack of Diagram:** Students must mentally visualize or draw the figures themselves.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the multiplication is simple, the combination of the language barrier for ESL learners and the common confusion between area and perimeter in Grade 6 poses a significant hurdle. Furthermore, the 1-point rubric is unforgiving for students who make a minor subtraction error at the final step.
