Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a language production task, not a mathematical one. However, it requires logical sequencing and the ability to map personal attributes to descriptive language.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- Subject-Verb Agreement: Students often confuse "is" and "are" or "has" and "have" (e.g., "He have a tall boy"). This would lead to a score of 0 based on the rubric.
- Pronoun usage: Hindi speakers may struggle with gendered pronouns (using "he" for a female friend) because of the common gender-neutral "woh" in spoken Hindi.
- Spelling/Syntax: Applying Hindi syntax (Subject-Object-Verb) to English (Subject-Verb-Object).

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
- Familiar context: "Best friend" is a highly personal and relatable topic.
- Rote memorization: Many students in Indian government schools are taught to memorize basic introductory essays like "My Best Friend," making it a well-practiced task.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
- Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students with limited English, constructing two "grammatically correct" sentences is a high bar.
- Strict Rubric: The rubric requires both sentences to be relevant AND grammatically correct for a single point. A single missing "is" or a spelling error in a key verb results in 0.
- Open-ended: There are no cues or word banks to assist with vocabulary.

Step 5: Estimate the proportion of students who would produce the fully correct answer.
While the topic is simple, the requirement for perfect grammatical correctness is the primary hurdle for students from these backgrounds.
