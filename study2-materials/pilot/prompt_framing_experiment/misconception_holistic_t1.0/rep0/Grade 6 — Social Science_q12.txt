Step 1: This is a Social Science (History/Civics) item, not a mathematical one. No mathematical concepts are required. The skills involved are recall of factual historical knowledge and the ability to explain a symbolic relationship in writing.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Cultural/Biological: Thinking lions are on the notes because they are the "National Animal" (misidentifying the Tiger). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Aesthetic: Thinking they are there simply for decoration or because they look "brave." This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Historical: Confusing the Mauryan Empire with other dynasties or thinking the symbol is modern. This would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The context is highly familiar; every student handles currency. The "Lion Capital" is a staple of Grade 6 Indian History (Ashoka the Emperor) and Civics (National Symbols) curriculum.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students with limited English, "currency notes," "shown," and "Explain" may be difficult to process or respond to in English.
- Open-ended format: Students must recall specific terminology ("Ashoka," "Lion Capital," "National Emblem") rather than recognizing it from a list.
- Rubric Rigidity: The rubric requires two specific connections (Ashoka + National Emblem). Many students may provide only one.

Step 5: While the concept is foundational, the combination of the open-ended "Explain" prompt and the English language barrier for this specific demographic significantly lowers the success rate.
