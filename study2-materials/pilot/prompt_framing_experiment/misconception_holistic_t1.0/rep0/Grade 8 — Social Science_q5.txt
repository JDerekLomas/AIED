Step 1: Although this is a Social Science (Geography/Ecology) item, the underlying mathematical and cognitive skills involve understanding systems, variables (ecosystem services), and the causal relationship between biodiversity and sustainability (proportionality/stability).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- "Biodiversity just means having many animals/zoos." (Would lead to an incorrect/incomplete answer).
- "Sustainable development is only about saving money or electricity." (Would lead to an incorrect answer).
- Confusing "importance" with "definition." (Would lead to a partial or incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The topic is a standard part of the Grade 8 NCERT/State Board curriculum.
- High social relevance (climate change/pollution) is often discussed in assemblies or media.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- **Language Barrier:** "Biodiversity," "Sustainable Development," and "Ecosystem Services" are Tier 3 academic vocabulary. For Hindi-medium students, translating these concepts into an English explanation is a significant hurdle.
- **Open-ended format:** There are no cues or options to trigger memory; the student must construct a logical argument.
- **Abstract Reasoning:** Connecting biological variety to "life support systems" requires high-level synthesis rather than simple rote memorization.
- **Rubric Rigor:** The rubric requires specific mention of "ecosystem services," a technical term many students may not use even if they understand the general concept.

Step 5: Given the English language constraints and the requirement for a specific conceptual link in an open-ended format for EWS (Economically Weaker Section) students, the success rate is likely to be low.
