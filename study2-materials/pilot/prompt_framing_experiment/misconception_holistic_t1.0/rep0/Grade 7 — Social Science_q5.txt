Step 1: Although this is a Social Science (Geography) item, it requires logical sequencing and process modeling. The student must understand the cyclical nature of physical changes, the concept of decomposition (breaking down), and the causal relationship between external forces (weathering) and physical state changes.

Step 2:
- Misconception: The rock cycle is linear rather than cyclical. (Would not necessarily lead to an incorrect answer here as the question asks for a specific segment of the cycle).
- Misconception: Rocks are permanent and unchanging. (Would lead to an incorrect answer).
- Misconception: Sedimentary rocks are formed only underwater. (Might lead to an incomplete answer).
- Misconception: Confusion between "sediment" and "soil." (Might lead to an incorrect answer if they cannot describe the transformation process).

Step 3:
- The concept of "breaking down" is a concrete physical process.
- Igneous rocks (often associated with volcanoes) are a high-interest topic in Grade 7.
- The rubric only requires two main points (breaking down and movement) for full credit, which is relatively lenient for a "describe" prompt.

Step 4:
- Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students with limited English, terms like "igneous," "sedimentary," "weathering," and "erosion" are high-level academic vocabulary that are difficult to recall and spell in English.
- Open-ended format: No scaffolding or visual aids (like a diagram) are provided to trigger memory.
- Multi-step process: The student must articulate a transition involving multiple geological agents.

Step 5: Given the significant language barrier for this specific demographic and the requirement to produce a written explanation in English for technical geological processes without visual cues, many students will struggle to articulate the transition even if they understand the concept conceptually.
