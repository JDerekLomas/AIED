Step 1: The mathematical concepts include basic linear equations in one variable and integer arithmetic. Skills required are isolating the variable using inverse operations (subtraction) and performing the calculation $4 - 9$.

Step 2: 
- **Commutativity Misconception:** Students often believe they must subtract the smaller number from the larger number ($9 - 4 = 5$). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- **Sign Error:** Students may correctly identify the operation but struggle with the sign of the result (getting $5$ instead of $-5$). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- **Inverse Operation Confusion:** Some may add the numbers ($9 + 4 = 13$) thinking "addition stays addition." This would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: The numbers are small and single-digit, which reduces cognitive load. The equation is in a standard, one-step format ($x + a = b$) which is a fundamental drill in Grade 8. The language is minimal, which helps Hindi-medium students/ESL learners.

Step 4: The result is a negative integer. For many students in this demographic, the concept that $4 - 9$ is possible and results in a negative value is often a significant hurdle. Since it is open-ended (no options to provide a hint that the answer is negative), many will default to the natural number $5$.

Step 5: While the structure is simple, the transition from $4 - 9$ to $-5$ is a notorious "bottleneck" concept in middle school mathematics, especially where foundational arithmetic may be inconsistent.
