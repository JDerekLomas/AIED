Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science (Geography) question, the underlying cognitive skill involves identifying a single variable within a multi-causal system. There are no numerical calculations required, but the student must categorize environmental variables.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
1. Soil is "dirt" and has always existed (leads to ignoring "time" as a factor).
2. Soil is made of dead leaves only (leads to ignoring "parent rock").
3. Man-made actions (pollution/farming) are the primary "formation" factors rather than natural ones.
In this specific item, these misconceptions might lead a student to answer "pollution" or "planting trees," which would be marked incorrect according to the rubric.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
The topic of soil is a core part of the Grade 8 NCERT syllabus. The question asks for only *one* factor, providing multiple paths to success. Common words like "Time" or "Weather/Climate" are easy to remember and spell.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the term "parent rock" or "relief" may be difficult to recall in English. The open-ended format requires active recall rather than recognition. The word "influences" might be a linguistic barrier for students with limited English proficiency, even if they understand the geological process.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically:
Since "Climate" and "Time" are high-frequency words and the concept is a fundamental part of the introductory geography chapters, a significant number of students will likely provide a correct one-word answer. However, the language barrier and the shift from Hindi to English terminology will cause a notable portion of the cohort to struggle with the specific phrasing.
