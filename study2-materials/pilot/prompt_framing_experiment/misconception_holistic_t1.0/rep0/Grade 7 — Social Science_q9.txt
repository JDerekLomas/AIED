Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, the underlying logical structure requires identifying a causal relationship (cause and effect) and understanding the "economy" as a system of resources and labor. Skills include identifying variables (wealth, land, population) and predicting their change over time.

Step 2: Students often struggle with the abstract concept of "economic life," equating it only to physical cash rather than agriculture or trade. They may also hold the misconception that "winning" a war results in immediate economic gain without considering the cost of mobilization. These misconceptions would likely lead to incomplete or non-distinct answers (e.g., "they won land" without explaining how that land impacts the economy).

Step 3: The context of kingdoms and wars is familiar through storytelling and historical narratives. The rubric is generous, requiring only one distinct impact rather than a comprehensive analysis.

Step 4: The prompt uses high-level academic vocabulary ("Assess," "impact," "economic life") which is significantly difficult for students with limited English proficiency and Hindi-medium backgrounds. The open-ended format requires students to construct a sentence from scratch, which is a major barrier. Many may understand the concept but lack the linguistic tools to express a "distinct and plausible" reason in English.

Step 5: While the concept is graspable, the linguistic demands of the prompt combined with the abstract nature of "economic life" for 7th graders will lead to a low success rate.
