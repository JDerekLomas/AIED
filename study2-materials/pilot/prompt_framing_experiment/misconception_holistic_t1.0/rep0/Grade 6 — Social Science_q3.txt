Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
There are no mathematical concepts or skills required for this item. It is a Social Science question focused on visual identification and cultural knowledge.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
While not mathematical, common misconceptions include:
- Generalizing all Rajasthani festivals as "Teej" due to visual similarities (traditional dress, processions).
- Confusing Dhinga Gavar with Gangaur.
- Misidentifying the deity in the image.
Since the rubric accepts both Gangaur and Dhinga Gavar, the identification hurdle is lower, but descriptive errors may occur.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
- High cultural relevance: Rajasthan festivals are deeply embedded in the local culture of Indian government school students.
- Visual cue: The picture provides a direct prompt.
- Lenient rubric: Accepting two different (though related) festival names increases the chance of success.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Language Barrier: Students with limited English proficiency may struggle to "describe how people celebrate it" in English, even if they know the answer.
- Subjective Scoring: Descriptive questions are harder for students than multiple-choice.
- Low Point Value: 0.5 marks for a two-part question (identify + describe) is a high demand for a low reward, which might lead to incomplete answers.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
The familiarity of the festival in the Rajasthan context is high, and the rubric is forgiving regarding the specific name. However, the requirement to write a description in English will be a significant barrier for students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds.
