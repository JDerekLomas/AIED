Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
Strictly speaking, this is a language acquisition item rather than a mathematical one. However, the cognitive skill involved is identifying a binary relationship (opposition/negation) within a set of attributes.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
In a linguistic context, students often confuse synonyms with antonyms. A student might provide a word with a similar meaning (e.g., "leisurely") if they misunderstand the prompt "opposite." However, given the simplicity of the word "slow," the primary barrier is vocabulary recall in a second language rather than a conceptual misconception.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
The word "slow" is a high-frequency adjective often introduced in early primary years. The concept of speed is concrete and familiar to students from all socioeconomic backgrounds. The word "fast" is equally high-frequency and commonly paired with "slow" in rhymes, stories, and daily classroom instructions.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
The open-ended format requires the student to recall and spell the word "fast" correctly without the aid of multiple-choice options. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, while they understand the concept of *dheere* (slow) vs. *tez* (fast), they may struggle to recall the English equivalent under exam pressure or may make spelling errors (e.g., "fst").

Step 5: Estimate the proportion of students who would produce the fully correct answer.
Given that this is a Grade 6 level item and the vocabulary is effectively Grade 1-2 level English, the vast majority of students—even those from economically weaker sections—will have encountered this specific pair multiple times. The simplicity of the word "fast" makes it one of the most accessible antonyms in the English language.
