**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Formula Knowledge:** Recalling the formulas for the perimeter of a rectangle $P = 2(l + w)$ and area $A = l \times w$.
*   **Algebraic Manipulation/Reverse Operations:** Rearranging the perimeter formula to solve for an unknown dimension (subtraction then division, or division then subtraction).
*   **Multi-step Processing:** The student must first find the width before they can calculate the area.
*   **Unit Conversion/Management:** Ensuring the final answer is in cm and $\text{cm}^2$.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Confusing Perimeter and Area:** Students may multiply $32 \times 10$ or try to divide $32$ by $10$. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Additive Perimeter Error:** Adding only three sides (e.g., $10 + 10 + w = 32$) or assuming $P = l + w$. (Leads to $w = 12$ or $w = 22$; incorrect).
*   **Incomplete Solution:** Finding the width ($6\text{ cm}$) but forgetting to calculate the area. (Leads to incorrect answer based on a 1-point rubric).
*   **Linear vs. Square Units:** Using $\text{cm}$ instead of $\text{cm}^2$ for area.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Simple Numbers:** $32$, $10$, and the resulting $6$ and $60$ are all "friendly" whole numbers.
*   **Standard Context:** Rectangles are the most common shape used in Indian Class 7 geometry.
*   **Keywords:** "Perimeter," "Length," "Width," and "Area" are high-frequency vocabulary words even for Hindi-medium students.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For students with limited English, "width" might be less familiar than "breadth" (the term more commonly used in NCERT textbooks).
*   **Multi-step Requirement:** This is a "backward" problem. Most students are more practiced at finding perimeter from dimensions, not dimensions from perimeter.
*   **Strict Rubric:** Since the maximum score is 1, any slip in the
