Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, the implicit mathematical/cognitive skills include classification (identifying a subset "mountain ranges" within the set "India") and cardinality (recalling exactly "two" items).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- Confusing peaks with ranges: Students may name "Mount Everest" or "Kanchenjunga." This would lead to an incorrect answer as these are individual peaks, not ranges.
- Confusing states/regions with ranges: Students might name "Kashmir" or "Ladakh." This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Geographic displacement: Students might name ranges outside India (e.g., Alps, Andes) due to general knowledge interference.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- Familiarity: The Himalayas are culturally iconic and featured heavily in Hindi and English curricula.
- Low threshold: The rubric asks for "any two," allowing students to choose the most famous ones.
- Language: The sentence structure is simple and uses "Name," a common command word in Indian exams.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- Recall vs. Recognition: The open-ended format is harder than multiple-choice, especially for students with limited English vocabulary who might struggle with spelling (though rubrics usually overlook spelling in this context).
- Specificity: Students often conflate "mountains" with "mountain ranges," leading to the naming of peaks.
- Low stakes/High precision: The rubric gives only 0.5 marks, suggesting a very low margin for error for a multi-part recall task.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically.
Given that the Himalayas are taught extensively from early grades and are a point of national pride, most students will successfully name them. Finding a second range (like the Aravallis or Vindhyas) is the primary filter. For EWS students in Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English terminology might be a slight barrier, but the geographic facts are a staple of the "Social Studies" rote-learning culture.
