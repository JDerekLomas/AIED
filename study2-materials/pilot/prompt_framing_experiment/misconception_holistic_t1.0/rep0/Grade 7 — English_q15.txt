Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
There are no mathematical concepts involved in this item. It is an English language assessment requiring sentence construction, vocabulary retrieval, and functional writing.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- Misconception: "A paragraph is just a list of words." (Impact: Student provides a list of hobbies without sentences, leading to an incorrect answer.)
- Misconception: "I must use complex vocabulary to get a mark." (Impact: Student attempts words they cannot spell or use correctly, resulting in incoherent sentences and an incorrect answer.)
- Misconception: Lack of understanding of "why." (Impact: Student lists the activity but fails to explain the motivation, failing the rubric's specific requirement.)

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- Familiar Context: "My Favourite Hobby" is a standard, highly practiced topic in Indian primary and middle school curricula.
- Low Complexity: The requirement is only 4-5 sentences.
- Clear Prompts: The question explicitly lists what to include (what, when, why).

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students with limited English proficiency, translating thoughts into grammatically correct English sentences is a significant hurdle.
- Open-ended Format: No scaffolding or sentence starters are provided.
- Rubric Rigidity: To get the full 1 mark (all or nothing), the student must fulfill three distinct criteria (what, when, why) in a coherent paragraph.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically, estimate what proportion of students at this grade level would produce the fully correct answer.
While the topic is very familiar, the combination of limited English proficiency among economically weaker sections and the requirement to hit all three specific points in the rubric (what, when, why) to earn the single available mark makes it challenging for a majority to be "fully correct."
