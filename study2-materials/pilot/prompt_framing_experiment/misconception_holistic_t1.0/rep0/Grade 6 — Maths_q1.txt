### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Definition of Factors:** Understanding that a factor is a number that divides another number exactly (leaving no remainder).
*   **Divisibility Rules:** Knowledge of rules for 2 (even numbers) and 4 (last two digits).
*   **Multiplication and Division Facts:** Proficiency in basic arithmetic to find pairs (e.g., $2 \times 34$, $4 \times 17$).
*   **Systematic Listing:** The ability to check numbers sequentially to ensure no factors are missed.

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Confusing Factors with Multiples:** Students might list $68, 136, \dots$. (Leads to an incorrect answer).
*   **Incomplete Sets:** Finding obvious factors (1, 2, 68) but missing middle pairs. (Leads to an incorrect answer as per the rubric).
*   **Excluding 1 or the Number Itself:** Thinking factors must be smaller than the number or greater than 1. (Leads to an incorrect answer).
*   **Calculation Errors:** Misidentifying 68 as divisible by 3 (thinking $6+8=15$ instead of 14) or failing to divide 68 by 4 correctly. (Leads to an incorrect answer).

### Step 3: Factors that make it easier
*   **Simple Question Format:** The instruction is direct and avoids complex English vocabulary, which helps students with limited English proficiency.
*   **Even Number:** 68 is even, making the factor '2' an immediate and easy find for most students.
*   **Standard Curriculum:** "Factors and Multiples" is a core, heavily practiced topic in Grade 6 NCERT/State Board syllabi.

### Step 4: Factors that make it harder
*   **The Number 68:** Unlike 12, 24, or 36, 68 is not a "common" number in multiplication tables (Pahade). Students rarely memorize tables up to 17 or 34.
*   **Prime Factor 17:** Finding the factor 17 requires long division or knowledge of the 17-times table, which is a significant hurdle for students at this level.
*   **Binary Rubric:** The rubric requires *all* factors for 1 mark. Missing even one (like 4 or 17) results in 0 marks.
*   **Open-ended:** There are no options to nudge the student toward the correct range of numbers.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While students are familiar with the concept, the specific number 68 is challenging because it involves the factor 17, which is outside the comfort zone of basic 1-10 multiplication tables. In an economically weaker context where rote memorization of tables often stops at 10 or 12, many students will provide an incomplete list (1, 2, 34, 68) but miss (4, 17).
