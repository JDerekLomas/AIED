Step 1: The question is from Social Science, not Mathematics. However, the logical skills required include comparative analysis, classification of services (public vs. private), and evidence-based reasoning.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Viewing "Private" only as "better" without considering cost barriers.
- Assuming "Public" means "free" in all cases rather than subsidized.
- Confusing municipal services with private NGO services.
These misconceptions might lead to vague answers that fail to meet the "valid argument/example" criteria of the rubric.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- Familiarity: Students from economically weaker sections often have direct, frequent experience with both public (government hospitals) and private (local clinics) healthcare.
- High relevance: The topic is discussed frequently in community and school contexts.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- Language Barrier: The command verb "Evaluate" is high-level and may be unfamiliar to students with limited English proficiency.
- Open-ended format: Requires generating original sentences rather than selecting an option.
- Rubric constraint: Despite being a 1-mark question, the rubric requires two features and examples, which is a high cognitive load for a single point.
- Writing skills: Students may understand the difference but struggle to articulate "valid arguments" in written English.

Step 5: While the context is relatable, the combination of a high-level command verb ("Evaluate"), the requirement for two specific features plus examples for a single mark, and the English language barrier for Hindi-medium students makes this a challenging item.
