Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is an English language item, the mathematical/spatial reasoning involved is **shape recognition and metaphoric mapping**. Students must identify the geometric property of a curve and map it to a symbol (a question mark). In the context of the NCERT curriculum (where this poem "The Squirrel" by Mildred Bowers Armstrong is standard), it also requires recall of a specific visual description.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Symbol-Shape Confusion:** Students may struggle to connect the physical shape of a tail to the abstract symbol of a punctuation mark. (Likely to lead to an incorrect answer).
*   **Literal Interpretation:** Students from ESL backgrounds often interpret language literally; they may look for a color or texture rather than a figurative shape. (Likely to lead to an incorrect answer).
*   **Vocabulary Gap:** Confusing "tail" with "tall" or other phonetically similar words. (Likely to lead to an incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Familiarity:** The poem is very short (6 lines) and a staple of the Grade 7 English textbook (*Honeycomb*).
*   **Visual Aid:** The textbook usually includes an illustration of the squirrel where the "question mark" tail is the central focus.
*   **Rote Memorization:** In many Indian government schools, key descriptions are memorized for exams.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, writing "question mark" in English is a hurdle. Spelling errors (e.g., "qustion mark") might occur, though the rubric suggests flexibility.
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no options to prompt the memory; the student must recall and produce the phrase independently.
*   **Abstract Comparison:** The "question mark" is an abstract concept for a child who may not use that punctuation frequently in their own writing.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given that this specific question is a "classic" textbook question frequently practiced in classrooms, many students will have memorized the answer. However, the requirement to produce the English phrase "question mark" from scratch will be a significant barrier for students with limited English proficiency.
