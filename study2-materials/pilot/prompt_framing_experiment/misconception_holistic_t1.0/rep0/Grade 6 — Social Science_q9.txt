Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science item, not a mathematical one. However, the cognitive skills required include categorization (identifying "historical monuments" within the geographical boundary of "Rajasthan") and data retrieval. Mathematically, it requires basic counting (exactly two) and a one-to-one mapping of a monument to its city and its attribute.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
*   **Geographical Misplacement:** Students may name a monument in Delhi (like the Taj Mahal or Red Fort) thinking it is in Rajasthan. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Confusing Monument with City:** Students might list "Jaipur" and "Udaipur" as monuments rather than cities. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Vague Attributes:** Students might say a monument is famous "because it is old," which might not meet the rubric's requirement for "why it is famous."

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
*   **Familiar Context:** For students in India, Rajasthan’s monuments (Hawa Mahal, Amer Fort, City Palace) are culturally iconic and often featured in textbooks and media.
*   **Low Barrier to Entry:** Naming a monument is a low-level recall task.
*   **Rubric Leniency:** The rubric only mentions naming two monuments for the 1 mark, despite the prompt asking for city and reason. If the grader follows the rubric strictly, the difficulty drops significantly.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
*   **Language Barrier:** The prompt is in English. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle to understand "historical monuments" or "located in."
*   **Multi-part Question:** The prompt asks for four pieces of information (Name 1, Name 2, City, Reason) but the rubric only rewards the first part. This mismatch can confuse students.
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no cues or options to trigger memory.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically.
While the cultural knowledge is high, the English language proficiency barrier in government schools for economically weaker sections is significant. Many students may know the answer in Hindi but struggle to express it or misinterpret the multi-part English instruction.
