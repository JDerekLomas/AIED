Step 1: This is a Social Science (History) question rather than a mathematics item. The cognitive skills required include recall of historical facts, understanding cause-and-effect relationships, and the ability to synthesize abstract political concepts (nationalism, sovereignty).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include confusing "nationalism" with "patriotism" or "independence from colonial rule" (applying the Indian context to Europe), and anachronistic thinking (assuming modern borders always existed). On this specific item, students might incorrectly cite World War I or II (wrong century) or focus solely on the Indian freedom struggle due to contextual bias.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The French Revolution is a core, repeated theme in the Grade 8 curriculum. The rubric is generous, requiring only brief identification of factors that are often taught as "keywords" (e.g., "French Revolution," "Language").

Step 4: Factors making it harder: 
- **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, terms like "contributed," "sentiment," and "19th century" (which requires translating to the 1800s) are linguistically dense.
- **Open-ended format:** There are no cues or options to trigger recognition; it requires pure recall.
- **Abstract Concepts:** "Nationalist sentiment" is an abstract construct difficult for students with limited exposure to political philosophy.
- **Scoring constraint:** The rubric asks for two factors but the maximum score is only 1, which might lead to students providing partial answers that are technically incomplete.

Step 5: Given the heavy emphasis on rote memorization in the Indian school system, many students will recognize "French Revolution" as a default answer for "Europe" and "19th Century." However, the linguistic complexity and the requirement for two factors in an open-ended English format will pose significant hurdles for this specific demographic.
