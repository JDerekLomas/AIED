Step 1: Identify the conceptual skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, the "mathematical" logic involved relates to set theory and logical mapping (linking the institution "Parliament" to the functions of "Law-making" and "Representation"). It requires the ability to categorize a complex political entity by its primary functional definitions.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **The "Leader" Fallacy:** Students often believe laws are made solely by the Prime Minister or President. This would lead to an incorrect answer as it bypasses the role of the Parliament.
*   **Physical vs. Functional:** Students may define Parliament as a building (Sansad Bhavan) rather than a functional body. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Confusing Judiciary with Legislature:** Believing Parliament "punishes criminals." This would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **High Familiarity:** "Democracy" and "Sansad" (Parliament) are high-frequency keywords in the Grade 8 Civics curriculum.
*   **Rote Memorization:** In many Indian government schools, this specific question is a "back-of-the-chapter" standard, making it likely students have memorized a one-sentence definition.
*   **Flexible Rubric:** The rubric allows for either "law-making" or "representation," providing two pathways to success.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle to translate concepts like "Representation" or "Legislation" into English, even if they understand the concept.
*   **Abstract Nature:** Democracy is an abstract concept compared to more concrete history topics.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options (MCQ), students must recall and construct a sentence, which is significantly harder for students with limited English proficiency.

Step 5: Holistically, while the concept is foundational, the requirement to produce a coherent written sentence in English—combined with the abstract nature of "will of the people"—will be a significant barrier for students from economically weaker sections with limited English support.
