**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   Understanding the definition of probability as a ratio ($P(E) = \frac{\text{favourable outcomes}}{\text{total outcomes}}$).
*   Ability to calculate the total number of outcomes by adding two subsets ($4 + 6 = 10$).
*   Identifying the specific subset (black balls) as the numerator.
*   Simplification of fractions (though often not required for full marks in 1-point questions, it is a related skill).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Ratio Misconception (Part-to-Part):** Students might express the probability as the ratio of black balls to white balls (4/6). *Would lead to an incorrect answer.*
*   **Equiprobability Bias:** Thinking that since there are two colors, the probability must be 1/2 regardless of the counts. *Would lead to an incorrect answer.*
*   **Focus on the larger number:** Some students assume the "answer" must be the larger quantity or the difference. *Would lead to an incorrect answer.*
*   **Ignoring the "total":** Using only the number of black balls (4) as the answer without forming a ratio. *Would lead to an incorrect answer.*

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Familiar Context:** "Balls in a bag" is the standard introductory example for probability in NCERT textbooks.
*   **Simple Numbers:** 4 and 6 sum to a friendly base-10 denominator, making the calculation trivial.
*   **Direct Language:** The question is a standard "find the probability" prompt with no complex "not" or "at least" clauses.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, terms like "drawn at random" and "favourable outcomes" might be intimidating if the exam is only in English.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options (MCQ), students cannot work backward or use process of elimination; they must construct the ratio themselves.
*   **Arithmetic/Formatting:** Students may forget to add the balls together to find the denominator, a common error in early probability learners.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
Given that this is a "textbook perfect" problem that is heavily drilled in Grade 8 classrooms, the familiarity of the numbers (4 and 6) helps significantly. However, the linguistic transition from Hindi to English and the common error of using part-to-part ratios (4/6) instead of part-to-whole (4/10) will catch a significant portion of students.
