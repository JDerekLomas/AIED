Step 1: This is a literacy and reading comprehension item rather than a mathematical one. The primary skills required are decoding English text, understanding the "Where" interrogative (locational inquiry), scanning a passage for specific information (the object "old book"), and extracting the prepositional phrase ("in the attic").

Step 2: Common misconceptions/errors in this context include:
- **Interrogative confusion:** Mixing up "Where" (place) with "When" (time) or "Who" (person). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- **Literal matching error:** If the text says "She saw it in the attic," but the question asks where she "found" it, a student with limited vocabulary might not connect "saw/found."
- **Vocabulary gap:** Not knowing what an "attic" is (a concept less common in urban Indian slum housing or specific rural architectures), which may lead to misspelling or skipping the word.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The answer is a short, concrete noun phrase. The rubric is generous (allowing one-word answers), which helps students with limited English sentence-construction skills. The word "book" is high-frequency and easily recognizable.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: For Hindi-medium students from economically weaker sections, "attic" is an unfamiliar cultural and linguistic term (often referred to as *tand* or *atariya* in local dialects, but rarely taught in basic English primers). The open-ended format requires active recall and spelling rather than passive recognition. 

Step 5: While the task is a standard "locate information" exercise, the linguistic barrier (English medium) and the specific vocabulary ("attic") pose significant hurdles for this specific demographic.
