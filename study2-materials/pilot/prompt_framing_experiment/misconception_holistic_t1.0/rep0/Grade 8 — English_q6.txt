Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
As this is an English language item, there are no mathematical concepts involved. The task requires verbal recall, vocabulary retention, and the ability to construct a definition in English.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
While not mathematical, common misconceptions include:
- Confusing a "fable" with a "fairytale" (leads to incorrect/partial answer).
- Confusing a "fable" with a "myth" or "legend" (leads to incorrect answer).
- Believing any story with animals is a fable, even without a moral (leads to partial/incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
- The term "fable" is a standard part of the Grade 8 literature curriculum (e.g., "The Ant and the Cricket").
- The definition is often memorized as a rote phrase.
- The concept of a "moral" is culturally familiar in Indian schools (e.g., Panchatantra).

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Open-ended format: Students must recall the definition from scratch rather than recognizing it.
- Language barrier: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may understand the concept (e.g., "shikshaprad kahani") but struggle to articulate "imparts a moral lesson" or "characterizes" in English.
- Technical vocabulary: Words like "imparts," "typically," and "moral" are high-level for ESL learners.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the English proficiency gap and the requirement to produce a formal definition in writing without cues, many students will provide partial answers (e.g., "story with animals") or struggle with the English syntax required for a full mark.
