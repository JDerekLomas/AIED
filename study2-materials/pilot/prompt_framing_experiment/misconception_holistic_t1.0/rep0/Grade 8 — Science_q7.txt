Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While labeled "Science," the item requires logic and cause-effect reasoning. From a quantitative perspective, it involves temporal sequencing ("after some days") and qualitative evaluation of enrichment (increasing nutrient value).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   "Waste vanishes": Some students believe matter simply disappears rather than transforming. This leads to a correct observation of "change" but incorrect "reasoning."
*   "Decomposition is instant": Students might expect changes in 24 hours rather than "some days."
*   "Smell equals bad": Students often associate the smell of decomposition with something being "ruined" rather than "beneficial," potentially leading to an incorrect evaluation of soil health.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   Familiar context: Students from rural or economically weaker sections in India often have direct exposure to composting or kitchen waste management.
*   Low rubric threshold: The rubric only asks for a "noticeable change," which is a very low bar for 0.5 points.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Language barrier: The complex English phrasing ("evaluate," "beneficial," "significant changes") is very difficult for Hindi-medium/ESL learners.
*   Multi-part structure: The question asks for three things: observation, reasoning, and evaluation.
*   Open-ended: No prompts or scaffolding are provided.

Step 5: Holistically, while the concept is familiar to their lived experience, the linguistic complexity of "evaluate if this is beneficial" combined with the need to write an open-ended English response will hinder many students. However, the low score weight (0.5) suggests the expected answer is brief.
