Step 1: Identify the scientific concepts and skills required.
Students must understand the concept of natural indicators (turmeric and hibiscus) and how they change color in the presence of acids and bases. They must apply the specific color changes (turmeric turns red in base; hibiscus turns dark pink/magenta in acid and green in base) to identify an unknown liquid.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Indicator confusion: Thinking turmeric turns red in acid (leads to incorrect answer).
*   Color overlap: Confusing the color change of hibiscus with turmeric.
*   Neutrality: Not realizing that no color change in turmeric doesn't strictly prove "acid," it could be "neutral" (though usually accepted at this level).
*   Reversibility: Thinking the color change is permanent or represents a chemical destruction of the material.

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
*   Familiar materials: Turmeric (*haldi*) and hibiscus (*gudhal*) are ubiquitous in Indian households and gardens, making the context highly concrete.
*   Hands-on curriculum: This is a standard practical experiment in NCERT Grade 7 Science textbooks.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
*   Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, describing the process in English is significantly harder than identifying a multiple-choice option.
*   Open-ended format: The student must recall the specific colors and construct a logical "if-then" statement.
*   Redundancy: Providing two indicators (turmeric and hibiscus) might confuse a student into thinking they must use both or describe the complex color changes of both to get the 1 mark.

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.
While the materials are culturally familiar, the requirement to write a descriptive explanation in English for a student with limited proficiency is a major hurdle. Many students will know the answer but struggle to articulate the "if-then" logic clearly enough to satisfy a rubric.
