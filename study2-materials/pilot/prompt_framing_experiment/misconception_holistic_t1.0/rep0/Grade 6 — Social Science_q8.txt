Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, it requires logical categorization and structural thinking. Students must identify a subset (2 rights) from a larger set (Universal/Child Rights) and perform a qualitative expansion (explanation) on one element of that subset.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Confusing "rights" with "duties" (e.g., "going to school" is seen as a chore/duty rather than a right). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Confusing general human rights with child-specific rights (e.g., right to vote). This might be pardoned by the rubric but is technically a category error.
- Difficulty distinguishing between a "right" and a "wish" (e.g., "right to toys").

Step 3: Ease factors: The topic of "Child Rights" (Right to Education, Right against Child Labour) is a core, recurring theme in the Indian NCERT/State curriculum. The context is personally relevant to the students' lives.

Step 4: Hardship factors: 
- Language Barrier: Explaining the "importance" requires complex sentence construction in English, which is a significant hurdle for Hindi-medium students.
- Compound Task: The question requires three distinct actions (Name 1, Name 2, Explain 1). Many students may provide names but omit the explanation.
- Rubric Rigidity: The maximum score is only 1 mark for a multi-part answer, meaning any omission (e.g., forgetting to explain) results in a score of 0.
- Abstract Reasoning: Explaining "importance" is an abstract task compared to simple rote recall.

Step 5: While the concept is familiar, the combination of a low-point-value multi-step task and the English language barrier for explaining "importance" will lead to many partial responses that fail the "fully correct" criteria.
