Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required:
*   Knowledge of the definitions of area and perimeter.
*   Application of formulas for a rectangle: Area = $L \times B$ and Perimeter = $2 \times (L + B)$.
*   Basic multiplication ($15 \times 8$) and addition skills.
*   Understanding of units (sq. cm vs. cm).

Step 2: Common misconceptions:
*   **Formula Confusion:** Using the perimeter formula to find area or vice versa. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Additive Area:** Adding the sides ($15 + 8$) instead of multiplying. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Unit Neglect:** Providing the correct numerical value but incorrect or no units. (The rubric specifically asks for 120 sq. cm).
*   **Incomplete Calculation:** Calculating only one of the two requested values (Area or Perimeter). Since the rubric awards 1 point for the area, missing the perimeter might still result in credit depending on the strictness of the evaluator, but technically the question asks for both.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
*   **Simple Numbers:** $15$ and $8$ are small, familiar integers.
*   **Standard Context:** This is a "textbook" problem style very common in Indian classrooms.
*   **Direct Instruction:** These formulas are heavily drilled in Grade 5 and 6.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the English terms "breadth" and "perimeter" can be confusing if not translated or if the teacher hasn't reinforced them.
*   **Two-in-One:** The question asks for two different calculations. If a student forgets one, they may lose the point.
*   **Open-ended:** No options to guide the student or trigger memory.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate:
While the calculation is simple, the "double" requirement (Area and Perimeter) combined with the linguistic barrier for ESL learners in EWS categories often leads to students providing only one of the two values or confusing the formulas.
