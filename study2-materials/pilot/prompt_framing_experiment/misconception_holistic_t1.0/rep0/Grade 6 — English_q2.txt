Step 1: This is a reading comprehension item for an English language assessment, despite the prompt's reference to mathematics. The required skills include literal comprehension, identifying a specific character (subject) within a narrative, and basic sentence construction or retrieval in English.

Step 2: Since the item is not mathematical, mathematical misconceptions do not apply. However, linguistic misconceptions include "Subject-Verb-Object" confusion and "Wh- question" confusion (e.g., confusing 'Who' with 'Where'). If a student confuses 'Who' with 'Where', they might answer with the location (the book) instead of the character (the fairy).

Step 3: Ease factors: The question is a direct literal retrieval task. The word "fairy" is a high-frequency vocabulary word in children's literature. The rubric is lenient, accepting one-word answers, which benefits students with limited English proficiency.

Step 4: Difficulty factors: The open-ended format requires recall and spelling rather than recognition. For Hindi-medium students, the transition to English sentence structure is challenging. If the text was not provided alongside the question (memory-based), the difficulty increases significantly.

Step 5: Given the simple vocabulary and the direct nature of the "Who" question, but accounting for the language barrier and the open-ended format for economically disadvantaged/Hindi-medium learners, roughly 65% of students are expected to correctly identify the "fairy."
