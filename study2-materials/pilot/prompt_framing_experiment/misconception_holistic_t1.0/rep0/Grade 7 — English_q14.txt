Step 1: This is a vocabulary-based language item rather than a mathematical one. The skill required is the retrieval of antonyms from long-term memory and understanding the semantic relationship between words (opposites).

Step 2: Misconceptions in this context include:
- Confusing synonyms with antonyms (would lead to an incorrect answer like "old").
- Phonetic confusion (associating "ancient" with similar-sounding but unrelated words).
- Translating the concept correctly into Hindi (*Prachin*) but failing to retrieve the specific English target word (*Modern*).

Step 3: Factors making it easier: "Ancient" is a high-frequency word often introduced in Grade 6 Social Science (History) textbooks. The concept of "opposite" is well-practiced from primary grades.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the word "ancient" is academic vocabulary, not everyday conversational English.
- **Open-ended format:** Without options (MCQs), students must recall and spell the word correctly rather than just recognizing it.
- **Limited English proficiency:** Students may know the concept in Hindi but lack the specific English vocabulary to provide a written response. "Modern" is a relatively sophisticated word for an ESL learner in Grade 7.

Step 5: Given the English proficiency gap in economically weaker sections and the lack of multiple-choice cues, many students will likely leave this blank or provide a synonym like "old."
