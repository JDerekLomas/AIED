**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Concept recognition:** Identifying that "measuring an exact number of times" refers to the concept of factors/divisibility.
*   **Strategic selection:** Recognizing that "maximum value" in the context of common factors requires calculating the Highest Common Factor (HCF).
*   **Calculation:** Executing the HCF algorithm (prime factorization or long division) for the numbers 75 and 69.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **HCF vs. LCM Confusion:** Students often see "maximum" and "exact number of times" and default to LCM (Least Common Multiple) because they associate "total/both" with larger numbers. This would lead to an incorrect answer (1725).
*   **Keyword dependency:** Some students only look for the word "maximum" to trigger HCF. While this might lead to the correct method here, it fails if they don't understand the underlying division logic.
*   **Additive thinking:** Thinking they need to find the difference between the bags (6 kg) rather than a common factor. This would lead to an incorrect answer.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Familiar Context:** Fertiliser/wheat bags are common in NCERT textbooks used in Indian schools.
*   **Small Numbers:** 75 and 69 are relatively small and manageable for 6th graders.
*   **Curriculum Alignment:** Finding HCF using word problems is a core part of the Grade 6 "Playing with Numbers" chapter.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium/ESL students, phrases like "exact number of times" and "measure the weight of" are linguistically complex. Understanding that a "weight" is a physical object used for measurement, not just a property, can be confusing.
*   **Abstract logic:** The idea of a "weight that measures another weight" is more abstract than simple sharing or grouping.
*   **Open-ended:** There are no options to provide a hint or allow for "plug-and-check" strategies.
*   **Low Reward:** A score of 0.5 for a multi-step word problem may lead to low student motivation or effort compared to simple computation tasks.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
While the math is straightforward (HCF of 75 and 69 is 3), the linguistic complexity for students with limited English proficiency, combined with the common confusion between HCF and LCM, presents a significant hurdle. In a typical Indian government school setting, many students will struggle to translate the word problem into the correct mathematical operation.
