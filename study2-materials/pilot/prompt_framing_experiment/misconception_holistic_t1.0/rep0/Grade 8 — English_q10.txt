Step 1: The core linguistic "mathematics" here involves syntactic transformation and logical equivalence. Skills required include identifying the adjective ("weak"), recognizing the cause-effect relationship between two independent clauses, and applying a specific grammatical formula ($Subject + is + too + adjective + to + verb$).

Step 2:
- **Misconception: Literal Translation.** Students might translate "very" as "too" but keep the second sentence intact: *"He is too weak. He cannot walk."* (Incorrect)
- **Misconception: Redundancy.** Students often keep the negative "not" because the second sentence is negative: *"He is too weak to not walk."* (Incorrect)
- **Misconception: Subject repetition.** Including the pronoun again: *"He is too weak he to walk."* (Incorrect)
- **Misconception: Tense mismatch.** Changing "is" or "walk" incorrectly. (Incorrect)

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The vocabulary ("weak", "walk") is basic and likely familiar even to Hindi-medium students.
- This is a classic "drilled" transformation in Indian English grammar syllabi (often taught as a formulaic rule).
- The context is concrete and easily relatable.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- **English Proficiency:** For EWS students in Hindi-medium settings, the "too...to" structure is idiomatic and does not have a direct word-for-word parallel in Hindi (where one might say "He is so weak that he can't walk").
- **Open-ended format:** There are no options to trigger recognition; the student must recall the structure perfectly.
- **Syntactic complexity:** It requires removing the subject "He" and the modal "cannot" from the second sentence, which is a high-level abstraction for an ESL learner.

Step 5: While this is a common drill exercise, the requirement to drop the "cannot" while maintaining the negative meaning is a notorious stumbling block for students who rely on literal translation. Given the English proficiency barriers in the specific demographic described, many will produce "He is too weak that he cannot walk" or "He is too weak to cannot walk."
