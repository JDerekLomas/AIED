Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science item, but it requires cognitive skills such as retrieval of categorized information, understanding of systemic frameworks, and English-to-Hindi conceptual translation.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Conflating Rights with Features:** Students often think "Fundamental Rights" are the *only* part of the Constitution. (Result: Correct answer).
*   **National Symbols vs. Constitutional Features:** Students might list the Flag or Anthem. (Result: Incorrect).
*   **Democracy as a single concept:** Students may say "voting" instead of "Parliamentary Democracy." (Result: Incorrect/Partial).
*   **Difficulty with Abstract Terminology:** Words like "Federalism" or "Secularism" are difficult to spell and conceptualize in English for Hindi-medium students. (Result: Incorrect).

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   The rubric is extremely generous; only one feature is required for full marks.
*   "Fundamental Rights" is a heavily emphasized topic in Class 8 Civics and is easy to memorize.
*   The topic is a core part of the national curriculum and frequently tested in practice exams.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   The open-ended format requires recall rather than recognition (no options provided).
*   Language barrier: Students may know the concept in Hindi (e.g., *Dharmanirpekshta*) but struggle to write "Secularism" in English.
*   Abstract nature: Concepts like "Federalism" are harder to grasp than concrete facts.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given that the rubric accepts any single feature (including simple ones like "Fundamental Rights" or "Written Constitution") and that this is a "high-stakes" familiar topic, a majority of students will be able to provide at least one correct term.

Given that the rubric is very generous (only one feature needed) and "Fundamental Rights" is a heavily drilled topic in Indian schools, a majority of students will likely provide at least one correct term, despite language barriers.
