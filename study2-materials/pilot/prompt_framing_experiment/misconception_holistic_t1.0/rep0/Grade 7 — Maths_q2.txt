Step 1: Mathematical concepts/skills required:
- Knowledge of algebraic notation (understanding $4x$ as multiplication).
- Understanding the principle of equality (balancing both sides).
- Mastery of inverse operations (subtraction to undo addition, division to undo multiplication).
- Basic arithmetic (10 - 2 and 8 / 4).

Step 2: Common misconceptions:
- "Combining unlike terms": Student adds $4x + 2$ to get $6x$. (Leads to incorrect answer).
- "Operation reversal": Student adds 2 to 10 instead of subtracting. (Leads to incorrect answer).
- "Variable as a label": Treating $x$ as a symbol without numerical value.
- "Order of operations": Attempting to divide by 4 before subtracting 2. (Leads to incorrect answer/fractions).

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The numbers are small, positive integers.
- The result is a whole number (no fractions/decimals).
- The "variable on one side" format is the most standard, well-practiced equation type in Grade 7 NCERT curriculum.
- Minimal English language burden; "Solve for $x$" is a highly recognizable phrase even for Hindi-medium students.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- Lack of multiple-choice options (no chance to "plug and in" or guess).
- It is a two-step process requiring sequential logic.
- For students with weak foundations, the transition from arithmetic to abstract algebra is a significant cognitive hurdle.

Step 5: Holistic estimate:
Given that this is a "textbook" example of a two-step equation and uses very "friendly" numbers, a majority of students who have attended regular instruction will succeed, though a significant portion will still struggle with the abstract nature of the variable or the specific order of operations.
