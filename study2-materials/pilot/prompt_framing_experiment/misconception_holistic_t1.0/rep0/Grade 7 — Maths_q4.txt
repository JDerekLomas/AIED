**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   Understanding division with decimals.
*   Conceptualizing a divisor that is larger than the dividend (8 < 7.2 is false, but 8 ÷ 7.2 results in a repeating decimal).
*   Knowledge of equivalent fractions or powers of 10 to shift decimals (converting $8 \div 7.2$ to $80 \div 72$).
*   Simplification of fractions or long division execution.
*   Handling recurring decimals ($1.11...$).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **"Division always makes things smaller":** Students might expect a result smaller than 8, which is true here, but may get confused by the proximity of the numbers.
*   **Commutative property error:** Students often divide the larger number by the smaller one ($7.2 \div 8$) because it "feels" easier. This would lead to $0.9$, an incorrect answer.
*   **Decimal placement:** Ignoring the decimal entirely and calculating $8 \div 72$ or $80 \div 7.2$, leading to $0.11$ or $11.1$.
*   **Rounding/Termination:** Students may stop at $1.1$ and not know how to represent a non-terminating decimal.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   The numbers are small (single and double digits).
*   The rubric allows for "setting up the division" as a success metric, which lowers the barrier if they don't reach the final quotient.
*   Decimal division is a core part of the Grade 7 curriculum in India (NCERT Chapter 2).

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** While the numbers are universal, "Find the value of" might be less familiar than a direct Hindi instruction like "मान ज्ञात कीजिए".
*   **Non-terminating result:** $80/72$ simplifies to $10/9$ or $1.11...$. Students at this level are often more comfortable with decimals that terminate (like $0.25$ or $0.5$).
*   **Whole number divided by decimal:** Students usually find it easier to divide a decimal by a whole number ($7.2 \div 8$) than a whole number by a decimal ($8 \div 7.2$).

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
Given the specific demographic (limited English, EWS), students often rely on rote procedural steps. The conversion to $80 \div 72$ is a standard taught procedure, but the recurring nature of the result and the "divisor > dividend" intuition check will trip up many. However, because the rubric awards points for the *setup* (converting to $80 \div 72$), the success rate for the 0.5 marks is higher than if a perfect decimal answer were required.
