Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science question, the underlying analytical skills involve identifying **causality** (cause and effect) and **temporal sequencing**. Students must connect a discrete historical event (the battle) to a systemic change (expansion of power).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
*   **Instant Rule:** Students often believe the British took over all of India immediately after one battle. (Would lead to a partially correct but imprecise answer).
*   **Military vs. Political Power:** Students may focus solely on the "fighting" (tactics) rather than the "political outcome" (puppet rulers). (Might lead to an incorrect answer based on the rubric).
*   **The "Nawab" role:** Confusion between the British East India Company and the British Crown. (Usually does not prevent a correct answer for this specific item).

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
*   **High Familiarity:** The Battle of Plassey is a "anchor point" in the Indian NCERT curriculum and is heavily emphasized in textbooks.
*   **Keywords:** Terms like "Mir Jafar" and "Siraj-ud-Daulah" are often rote-memorized.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the phrase "contribute to the expansion" is linguistically complex. Understanding "expansion of power" requires higher-order English decoding.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options (MCQs), students struggle to structure their thoughts in English, often losing the mark because they cannot articulate the "puppet nawab" or "political control" concept clearly.
*   **Abstract Reasoning:** Moving from "who won" to "how it changed power structures" is a significant cognitive leap for Grade 8.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically:
While the topic is very common, the combination of the open-ended format and the language barrier for economically weaker/ESL students significantly lowers the success rate for a "fully correct" answer that meets the rubric's specific requirement of explaining *how* it led to dominance.
