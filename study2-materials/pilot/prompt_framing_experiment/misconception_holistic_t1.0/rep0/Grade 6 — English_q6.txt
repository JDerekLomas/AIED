Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a language arts (English) question, not a mathematics question. However, applying a logical/analytical framework, it requires:
*   Comprehension of a poetic text.
*   Selection of a specific data point (a "line").
*   Articulating a justification (reasoning).
*   Syntax and vocabulary in English to convey a subjective preference.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Misunderstanding the word "line": Students may think it refers to a physical line or a sentence rather than a poetic unit. (Likely to lead to incorrect formatting).
*   Literalism: Thinking there is a "correct" line to like rather than a personal choice. (May lead to blank answers if they are unsure).
*   Confusing "why" with a summary: Providing a summary of the poem instead of a personal reason. (Will lead to partial credit or zero).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   Subjectivity: There is no single "right" answer, allowing for flexibility.
*   Short length: Students only need to identify one line.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students with limited English, "Why" is a cognitively demanding prompt requiring complex sentence structures (e.g., "because...").
*   Open-ended format: No scaffolding or options provided.
*   Abstract task: Explaining "liking" something requires meta-cognition and specific emotional/descriptive vocabulary that EAL (English as an Additional Language) learners often lack.
*   Rubric requirement: The rubric specifically requires a "why," which is the primary hurdle for students with low English proficiency.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given the target demographic (economically weaker sections, Hindi-medium background), the transition to expressing subjective reasoning in written English is a significant barrier. While many might identify a line, a large majority will struggle to provide a coherent "why" in English that satisfies the rubric.
