Step 1: This is a literacy and critical thinking item rather than a mathematical one. However, applying the required analytical framework: the skills required are reading comprehension (recalling the king's three questions), evaluative reasoning (connecting a story to "real life"), and sentence construction in a second language.

Step 2: Common misconceptions/errors:
- Literalism: Students may think "real life" refers only to their own immediate surroundings (poverty/rural life) and feel the king's concerns (ruling a kingdom) are irrelevant, leading to a "No" without a valid general reason.
- Language Interference: Hindi-medium students often struggle with the "Do you think..." prompt, responding with a simple "Yes" or "No" without providing the required reason.
- Content Confusion: Misidentifying the king's questions as those he asked the hermit rather than the general philosophical questions.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The story (Leo Tolstoy's "Three Questions") is a standard text in the NCERT Grade 7 curriculum. The concept of "right time" and "right people" is morally intuitive even for younger students.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- Open-ended format: No scaffolding or options.
- English proficiency: Formulating a "reason" in English is a significant barrier for students from economically weaker sections with limited exposure to the language.
- Subjectivity: The rubric requires a "valid reason," which requires higher-order thinking (evaluation) rather than simple retrieval.

Step 5: While many students will understand the story in their native language, the combination of the abstract "real life" connection and the requirement to write a coherent reason in English will be a significant hurdle for this specific demographic.
