Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required
- Unitary Method: Finding the value of one unit (distance per 1 liter) before finding the value of multiple units.
- Division: Dividing 55 by 5 to find the rate (mileage).
- Multiplication: Multiplying the rate (11) by the given quantity (12).
- Understanding of "Mileage": Real-world application of rates and ratios.

Step 2: Common misconceptions
- Additive thinking instead of multiplicative: A student might see the difference between 5 and 12 is 7, then add 7 to 55 (Result: 62). This leads to an incorrect answer.
- Inverse Proportion confusion: Some students struggle to distinguish between direct and inverse proportion (e.g., "more petrol = more distance" vs. "more workers = less time"). However, petrol/distance is a very intuitive direct proportion.
- Operation reversal: Dividing 5 by 55 instead of 55 by 5.

Step 3: Factors making it easier
- Familiar context: "Mileage" and "Petrol" are common terms in Indian households, even in low-income areas where motorcycles are prevalent.
- Simple numbers: 55 and 5 are very easy to divide (multiples of 11), and multiplying 11 by 12 is a standard mental math task.
- Direct proportion: The relationship is linear and intuitive.

Step 4: Factors making it harder
- Two-part question: The prompt asks for two things: the distance for 12 liters AND the mileage. The rubric, however, only scores the distance. A student might calculate the mileage (11) but forget to do the second step, or vice-versa.
- Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, the word "covers" or "mileage" in an English-only paper might be a hurdle, though these specific terms are often used as "loanwords" in Hinglish.
- Open-ended: No options to guide the student if they make a calculation error.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the math is simple, the requirement to perform a two-step process and the potential for language confusion in a word-problem format usually results in a significant number of errors in this demographic.
