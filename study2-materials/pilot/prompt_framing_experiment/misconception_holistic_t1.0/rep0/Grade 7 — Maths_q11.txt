Step 1: Skills required include data interpretation, spatial reasoning for axis construction, selecting a consistent scale (ratio/proportion), and comparing whole numbers.
Step 2: Common misconceptions include inconsistent scaling (e.g., jumping from 0 to 80, then 80 to 90), mislabeling axes, or failing to start the scale at zero. On this item, the "choose an appropriate scale" instruction often leads to errors where students simply write the given data points directly on the Y-axis without equal spacing.
Step 3: Ease factors: The context (school classes) is highly familiar. Comparing numbers for "maximum" and "minimum" is a low-level cognitive task. Bar graphs are a staple of the Grade 6 and 7 curriculum in India.
Step 4: Harder factors: Drawing a graph from scratch is time-consuming and requires motor precision. For Hindi-medium students with limited English, "appropriate scale" is a technical term that may be misunderstood. The rubric is quite strict—a student must get the axes, labels, AND scale correct to get the single point for part (a).
Step 5: While many students will correctly identify the max/min, the technical requirements of part (a) (scaling and labeling) often result in partial errors. In many government school settings, the jump from reading a graph to constructing one with a self-selected scale is a significant hurdle.
