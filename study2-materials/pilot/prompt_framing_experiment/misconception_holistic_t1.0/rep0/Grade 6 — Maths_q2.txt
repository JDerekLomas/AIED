Step 1: The item requires an understanding of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, specifically the distinction between "face value" and "place value." Students must identify the position of a digit (ones, tens, hundreds, thousands) and multiply the face value (5) by its positional value (100).

Step 2: 
- **Confusing Face Value with Place Value:** Student answers "5." (Leads to incorrect answer)
- **Confusing "Place" with "Place Value":** Student answers "Hundreds" (Accepted by rubric) or "Third place." 
- **Column Miscounting:** Counting from left to right instead of right to left, identifying the 5 as being in the "tens" place (50). (Leads to incorrect answer)
- **Zero-as-Placeholder Confusion:** Misunderstanding how the trailing zero affects the value. (Leads to incorrect answer)

Step 3: The context is a standard, decontextualized math problem familiar to Indian classrooms. The number 7560 is relatively small (within the thousands), which is a range students have practiced since Grade 3 or 4. The digit 5 is in a clear, non-ambiguous position.

Step 4: The open-ended format (VSA - Very Short Answer) requires active recall rather than recognition. For ESL/Hindi-medium students, the term "Place Value" (स्थानीय मान - Sthānīya māna) is a specific technical term; if they do not recognize the English vocabulary, they may fail despite knowing the math. However, this is one of the most frequently drilled vocabulary pairs in early middle school English-medium bridge materials.

Step 5: Given that this is a fundamental, highly drilled competency in the Indian curriculum, and the rubric allows for both the numerical (500) and word-based (Hundreds) response, a majority of students are likely to succeed, though language barriers and face-value confusion will persist for some.
