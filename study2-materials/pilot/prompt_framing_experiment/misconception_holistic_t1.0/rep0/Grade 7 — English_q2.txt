Step 1: This is a reading comprehension item based on a classic narrative text ("The Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy). The skills required include literal comprehension, identifying cause-and-effect relationships within a story, and the ability to formulate a response in English.

Step 2: Common misconceptions/errors include:
- Conflating the "reward" with the "answers" (e.g., thinking the king gave a reward to the wise men regardless of their quality).
- Misinterpreting the "Why" as "What" (describing the reward instead of the reason for it).
- Linguistic interference: Translating the thought correctly in Hindi but failing to construct a grammatical English sentence. Given the rubric's flexibility ("any similar reason"), minor grammatical errors likely won't penalize the student if the meaning is clear.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The story is a staple of the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum used in Indian government schools. The "Three Questions" motif is culturally familiar and follows a predictable "quest" narrative. The vocabulary in the question is basic.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: The open-ended format is challenging for students with limited English proficiency. While they may understand the story in Hindi, the leap to writing a coherent English sentence is significant for students from economically weaker sections with limited exposure to the language outside school. The lack of multiple-choice options removes the possibility of recognition-based answering.

Step 5: While the story is familiar, the requirement to produce a written response in English acts as a significant barrier for this specific demographic. However, because it is a direct, literal question from a core text often heavily drilled in classrooms, a moderate number of students will recall the standard answer.
