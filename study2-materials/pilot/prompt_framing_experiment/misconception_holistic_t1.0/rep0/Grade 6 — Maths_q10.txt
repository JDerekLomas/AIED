Step 1: Concepts and skills
- Understanding the definition of an angle and its representation.
- Proficient use of a physical tool (protractor).
- Distinguishing between the inner and outer scales on a protractor.
- Identifying vertex and base arm placement.

Step 2: Common misconceptions
- **Scale Confusion:** Students often read the wrong scale (e.g., reading 70° instead of 110°). This leads to an incorrect answer for (a).
- **Alignment Errors:** Not aligning the "center point" or the "zero line" of the protractor correctly with the vertex and base ray. This leads to an incorrect answer.
- **Directionality:** Drawing the angle opening from left-to-right vs. right-to-left and getting confused about which 0 to start from.

Step 3: Factors making it easier
- **Familiarity:** This is a standard, procedural task heavily practiced in the NCERT curriculum.
- **Simple Numbers:** 110 and 40 are multiples of 10, making them easy to locate on the scale.
- **Language:** The English is minimal and uses "keywords" (protractor, draw, angle) that even students with limited English proficiency recognize.

Step 4: Factors making it harder
- **The "Obtuse" Trap:** 110° is an obtuse angle. Students frequently default to the acute supplement (70°) because they are more accustomed to the 0–90 range.
- **Physical Tool Access:** In economically weaker sections, students may lack a high-quality, clear protractor or a sharp pencil, leading to precision errors.
- **Composite Task:** The rubric only awards 1 mark for the 110° angle, but the prompt asks for two angles, which might confuse students regarding how much work is required for the "point."

Step 5: Holistic estimate
While the task is a standard curriculum requirement, the "double-scale" confusion on protractors is the single most common error in Grade 6. For a student from a Hindi-medium/EWS background, the procedural instruction is clear, but the precision and scale-choice errors typically result in a significant portion of the class drawing 70° instead of 110°.
