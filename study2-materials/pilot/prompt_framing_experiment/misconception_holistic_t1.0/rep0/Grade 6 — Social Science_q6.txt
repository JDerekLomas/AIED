Step 1: The item is for Social Science, not Mathematics. However, analyzing the cognitive skills required: students must categorize evidence (classification), understand temporal causality (history as a study of the past), and use comparative logic ("differentiate"). They must also recall specific definitions and retrieve concrete examples from memory.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Thinking "archaeology" only refers to dinosaurs/fossils (Biological vs. Historical remains). This would lead to an incorrect example.
- Confusing "literary" with "literal" or simply "old stories," failing to recognize that literary sources must be written/recorded documents.
- Overlap confusion: Believing an inscription is purely literary because it has writing, rather than archaeological because it is a physical artifact. This could lead to a categorization error.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The topic is usually the first chapter of the Grade 6 History syllabus (Ancient India).
- These are "high-frequency" terms in Indian state board textbooks.
- The rubric is generous, accepting a wide range of physical objects as examples.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the terms "archaeological" and "literary" are phonetically difficult and long. In Hindi, they are *Puratattvik* and *Sahityik*. If the test is in English, the vocabulary becomes a significant barrier to entry.
- **Complexity of the Command:** "Differentiate" is a high-level cognitive task. It requires two definitions and two examples, all for a single mark.
- **Open-ended Format:** There are no cues or options to trigger recognition; it requires pure recall.
- **Economic Context:** Students from economically weaker sections may have less exposure to museums, libraries, or historical sites, making these concepts purely abstract rather than lived.

Step 5: In an Indian government school context, while the concepts are foundational, the requirement to provide two definitions and two examples in English for just one mark is a high threshold. Many students will provide a partial answer (only one side of the difference) or mix up the examples.
