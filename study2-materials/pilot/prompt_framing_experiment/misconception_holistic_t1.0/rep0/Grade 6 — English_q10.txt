Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is an English language item, the underlying mathematical concept involves "Quantifiers" and set theory logic. Students must understand the distinction between non-zero quantities in affirmative sets (some) versus null or conditional sets (any) often used in negative or interrogative contexts.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
1. "Any" means "every": Students might think "any" refers to an arbitrary selection from the basket. This leads to an incorrect answer.
2. Translation interference: In Hindi, the word 'कुछ' (kuch) can often be used interchangeably in contexts where English requires specific quantifier rules. This makes the distinction between "some" and "any" purely grammatical rather than conceptual, leading to errors.
3. Sound-based selection: Students often choose words based on what "sounds right." If they have heard "any" more often in general English instruction, they may misapply it here.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
- Familiar context: "Apples in a basket" is a concrete, standard example used in textbooks.
- Binary choice: Having only two options (some/any) provides a 50% chance of guessing correctly.
- Affirmative structure: The sentence is a simple Subject-Verb-Object structure, which is the first form taught in ESL/ELL curriculum.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Hindi-medium background: The nuance between "some" and "any" is notoriously difficult for Hindi speakers because the distinction is not mapped 1:1 in their native tongue.
- Lack of "Not": Usually, students are taught that "any" goes with "not." Without a "not" or a question mark, they must rely on the positive rule for "some," which is often less emphasized than the "any" rule in remedial drills.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the binary choice format, the familiar vocabulary, and the typical focus on these specific quantifiers in Grade 6 Indian NCERT/State Board curricula, most students will recognize the pattern, though a significant portion will struggle with the linguistic nuance.
