Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is an English Language Arts (ELA) reading comprehension item, not a mathematical one. The skills required include:
- Scanning a text for specific information (locating the "sunset" section).
- Vocabulary recognition (identifying colors/descriptive adjectives).
- Syntactic construction (forming a sentence in the past tense).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- Misinterpretation of "How": Students might describe the process of the sun setting rather than the appearance of the sky. (Would lead to an incorrect answer).
- Tense mismatch: Using "looks" instead of "looked." (Might lead to partial credit or incorrect depending on strictness, but here the rubric focuses on content).
- Vocabulary confusion: Mixing up "shades" with "shadows." (Would lead to an incorrect answer).

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
- Familiar context: Sunsets are a universal experience.
- Simple vocabulary: "Orange" and "pink" are basic color words usually learned in primary years.
- Direct retrieval: If the text explicitly states these colors, it is a low-level literal comprehension task.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
- Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students, translating the visual description from the text into a grammatically correct English sentence is a significant hurdle.
- Specificity of Rubric: The rubric requires *both* colors (orange and pink). Students who mention only one, or use general words like "beautiful" or "bright," will fail to get the mark.
- Open-ended format: No options to trigger recognition; requires active recall and production.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically.
While the concept is simple, the requirement for a specific two-color description in a second language, combined with the linguistic challenges faced by students from economically weaker sections in government schools, suggests a moderate success rate. Many will provide partial or overly generalized answers (e.g., "It was red").
