Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science (History) question rather than a Mathematics question. The cognitive skills required involve recall of historical facts (Early vs. Later Vedic periods) and descriptive writing.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
1. Chronological Confusion: Students often conflate the Early Vedic (pastoral) and Later Vedic (agricultural) periods. This might lead to providing only one answer when the rubric accepts both, which actually helps the student in this specific case.
2. Terminology: Students may understand the concept of "keeping cows" but lack the formal English vocabulary (pastoralism/animal husbandry). This would lead to an incorrect answer if they cannot express it in English.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
- Flexible Rubric: The rubric allows for either agriculture or pastoralism to be correct, ignoring the nuance of which specific Vedic sub-period is being discussed.
- Familiarity: The concept of "farming" or "cows" is highly relatable to students from economically weaker or rural backgrounds.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students, "occupation" and "aspect" are difficult academic English words. They may know the answer but fail to understand the prompt.
- Two-Part Task: The question asks to "Identify" AND "Describe." Since the rubric only offers 1 mark, students might stop after the first part, or lose focus if they cannot formulate a descriptive sentence in English.
- Open-ended format: No options (MCQs) are provided to trigger recognition.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the content is foundational, the English language proficiency required to decode the prompt ("occupation," "aspect") and produce an original descriptive sentence will be a significant barrier for this specific demographic.
