Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a vocabulary and reading comprehension item in an English language assessment. No mathematical concepts or skills are required.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
In the context of English language learners from Hindi-medium backgrounds:
- Literal Translation: Students might look for a word that translates directly to a Hindi equivalent of "shining" (like "chamkila") and fail to find the specific synonym "glowing" in the text.
- Decoding vs. Comprehension: Students may be able to read the words phonetically but lack the semantic depth to pair synonyms.
- Difficulty with Part of Speech: Students might identify a related noun or verb instead of the specific adjective/participle "glowing."
- These would likely lead to an incorrect answer or a blank response.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- Short passage: If the text is short, the search space is limited.
- Visual cues: "Glowing" is a sensory word that may have been reinforced through imagery in lessons.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- Language Barrier: For EWS students in Hindi-medium settings, "shining brightly" is a complex descriptor. They may know "sun" or "light" but not the nuanced vocabulary.
- Open-ended format: No options are provided to trigger recognition; the student must perform a recall/search task.
- Spelling: Students might find the word but struggle to transcribe it correctly.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically, estimate what proportion of students at this grade level would produce the fully correct answer.
Given the limited English proficiency and the requirement to identify a specific synonym without multiple-choice support, many students will struggle to bridge the gap between the definition and the specific text.
