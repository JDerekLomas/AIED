Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is an English language item, the underlying cognitive skills involve logical sequencing, pattern recognition (Subject-Verb-Object structure), and set theory (ensuring all elements of the set are used exactly once).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
1. Mother Tongue Interference (L1): In Hindi, the syntax is Subject-Object-Verb (He a book reading is). This would lead to an incorrect answer like "He a book is reading."
2. Capitalization/Punctuation over Syntax: Students may focus on starting with a capital letter or ending with a period rather than logical flow.
3. Word Omission: Students often drop "a" or "is," failing to recognize the requirement to use all "elements" in the set.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
The vocabulary is extremely basic (Tier 1 words). "He," "is," "reading," and "book" are among the first words taught in Grade 3-4 in Indian government schools. The context of reading a book is highly familiar and universal.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
The open-ended format (no multiple-choice options) increases the cognitive load. For students with limited English proficiency, the "is + -ing" (present continuous) construction is often more difficult than the simple present. The L1 interference (Hindi syntax) is a significant barrier for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds.

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.
The simplicity of the vocabulary offsets the structural difficulty. In Grade 6, even in economically disadvantaged schools, this specific sentence pattern is a standard drill in English textbooks (SCERT/NCERT). Most students will recognize the "He is..." pattern through rote practice, even if they struggle with more complex grammar.
