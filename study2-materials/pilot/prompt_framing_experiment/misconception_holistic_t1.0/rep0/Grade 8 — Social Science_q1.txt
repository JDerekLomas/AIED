Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, the underlying cognitive skills involve categorization and recall. The "mathematical" equivalent here is set theory—identifying elements that belong to a specific defined set ("Fundamental Rights") versus a broader set ("Human Rights" or "Duties").

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Confusing Fundamental Rights with Fundamental Duties (e.g., "respecting the flag"). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Confusing Rights with general legal provisions or benefits (e.g., "Right to a ration card"). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Misunderstanding the hierarchy of laws, though the rubric allows for simplified phrasing which mitigates this.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The context is highly familiar; this is a core "rote" topic in the Indian Civics curriculum (NCERT/State boards).
- The "Two" requirement is low (there are six main categories).
- The rubric is lenient, allowing for simplified language or Hindi-influenced translations ("Equality right," "Freedom right").
- It is a high-frequency exam topic, often drilled in classrooms.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- English language barrier: Students may know the concept in Hindi (मौलिक अधिकार) but struggle to recall the specific English terminology.
- Open-ended format: No options to trigger recognition; requires pure recall.
- Specificity: Students often conflate "Rights" with "Duties."

Step 5: Given that this is a "must-know" topic heavily emphasized in Grade 8 across all Indian boards, and considering the lenient rubric for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, a high proportion of students will successfully name at least two.
