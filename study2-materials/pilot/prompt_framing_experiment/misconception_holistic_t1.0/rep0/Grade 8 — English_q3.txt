Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is an English Language Arts (literary analysis) item, not a mathematics item. The required skills involve reading comprehension, identifying character motivation, and articulating abstract concepts (expression of feelings) in writing.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
While not mathematical, common cognitive hurdles include:
- Literalism: Thinking "drawing" only means a physical action rather than a symbolic one.
- Misinterpreting "mean": Students might think the question asks for a definition of the word rather than its significance to the character.
These would likely lead to incorrect or incomplete answers on this item.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
The context of "drawing" is a universal, concrete activity that students from all socioeconomic backgrounds can relate to. The vocabulary in the question itself ("What did... mean to...") is a standard question stem.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Open-ended format: No options to prompt the student.
- English Proficiency: For Hindi-medium students, translating the internal concept of "expressing thoughts and feelings" into a grammatically correct English sentence is a high-order task.
- Rubric Rigidity: The rubric requires two distinct ideas (not just a hobby + expressing feelings). Students may provide one but not both.
- Abstract reasoning: Moving from the "what" (drawing) to the "why" (emotional expression) requires inference.

Step 5: Holistically estimate the proportion of students.
Given the English language barrier and the requirement to synthesize two specific points for a single mark, many students will likely provide a partial or "common sense" answer (e.g., "She liked it") that fails to meet the full rubric criteria.
