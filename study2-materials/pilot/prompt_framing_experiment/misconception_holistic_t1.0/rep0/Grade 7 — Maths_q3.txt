### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills
*   **Formula Recall:** Knowledge of the area of a triangle formula ($A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$).
*   **Substitution:** Placing the correct values into the formula.
*   **Computation:** Multiplication of integers ($8 \times 6$) and division by 2 (or multiplication by $1/2$).
*   **Units:** Understanding that area is measured in square units (though the rubric suggests a score of 1 for the correct numerical value/formula use).

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Confusing Triangle and Rectangle Area:** Many students forget the "$1/2$" and simply multiply $8 \times 6 = 48$. **(Would lead to an incorrect answer)**.
*   **Additive Thinking:** Adding the numbers instead of multiplying ($8 + 6 = 14$). **(Would lead to an incorrect answer)**.
*   **Base/Height Confusion:** In more complex problems, students struggle to identify which side is the base or height. Here, they are explicitly named, minimizing this error.
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds might struggle with the English words "Base" (आधार) and "Height" (ऊंचाई), though these are high-frequency math terms.

### Step 3: Factors Making the Item Easier
*   **Simple Integers:** The numbers 8 and 6 are small and even, making the division by 2 very straightforward.
*   **Direct Prompt:** The question is a "plug-and-chug" style. There is no distracter information or complex word problem context.
*   **Familiarity:** This is a "prototypical" math problem frequently drilled in Indian government school classrooms.

### Step 4: Factors Making the Item Harder
*   **Open-ended Format:** There are no multiple-choice options to trigger memory or allow for "working backward."
*   **English Proficiency:** For EWS students in Hindi-medium transitions, "whose" and "height" might pose a slight decoding hurdle, though the numbers provide a strong clue.
*   **Formula Dependency:** If the student has not memorized the $1/2$ factor, there is no visual aid (like a grid) to help them derive it.
