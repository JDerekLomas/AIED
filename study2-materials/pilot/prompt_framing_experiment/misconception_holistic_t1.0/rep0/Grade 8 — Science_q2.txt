Step 1: Identify the concepts and skills required.
The student must recall a specific biological term (Lactobacillus) and its classification (Bacteria). This requires retrieval from long-term memory and the ability to associate a biological process (fermentation/curd making) with a specific organism.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   "All bacteria are harmful/cause disease": Students might hesitate to name a bacterium as "helpful," potentially leading them to guess "fungi" or "virus" instead.
*   Confusion between names: Students often confuse "Lactobacillus" with "Lactose" or "Lactic acid."
*   Category confusion: Many students treat "microorganism" as a single category and fail to distinguish between bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and algae.
*   Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, transliterating or spelling "Lactobacillus" in English is a significant hurdle.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   High context familiarity: Curd (Dahi) is a staple in Indian households, and the "curd-making" example is the most emphasized application of beneficial microbes in the NCERT curriculum.
*   Rote memorization: This specific fact is frequently highlighted in textbooks and previous years' exams.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Two-part question: The student must provide both the name and the category for a very low point value (0.5 marks), increasing the chance of a partial or zero score.
*   Spelling/Language: "Lactobacillus" is a complex multisyllabic Latin-based word that is difficult for students with limited English proficiency to spell correctly.
*   No scaffolding: As an open-ended recall question, there are no cues or options to trigger recognition.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
While the topic is very familiar, the requirement to produce a specific, difficult-to-spell scientific name and its category without options—combined with the language barrier—presents a significant challenge for the target demographic.
