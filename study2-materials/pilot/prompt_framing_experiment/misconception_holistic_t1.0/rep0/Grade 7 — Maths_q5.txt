Step 1: Concepts and Skills
- Multiplication of integers and decimals/fractions.
- Unit conversion (Paise to Rupees: 100 paise = 1 Rupee).
- Multi-step arithmetic (three separate multiplications followed by addition and then division).
- Concept of "total value" versus "number of coins."

Step 2: Common Misconceptions
- Decimal placement: Students might think 10 paise is 0.10 but miscalculate $10 \times 10$ as 100 Rupees instead of 100 paise.
- Additive thinking: Simply adding the quantities of coins (10+5+16) or the denominations (10+20+50) without multiplying.
- Misunderstanding the target: Thinking the question asks for the total value in Rupees (10) rather than the number of 5-Rupee coins (2). 
- All of these would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making it easier
- Familiar context: Currency is a highly relatable, real-world context for students from economically weaker sections.
- Simple numbers: The denominations (10, 20, 50) and quantities result in clean, round numbers (100, 100, 800).

Step 4: Factors making it harder
- English proficiency: Phrases like "can be made from" might be confusing for Hindi-medium learners.
- Multi-step reasoning: The problem requires four distinct operations before the final answer is reached.
- Unit confusion: The "5" in "Rupee 5 coins" is often mistaken as part of the total rather than the divisor.
- Low rubric weight (0.5) vs. High effort: For a multi-step word problem, students might rush or lose track of the final step.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the math is technically Grade 4-5 level, the linguistic complexity and the multi-step nature—specifically the final step of dividing the total (10) by 5—often catch Grade 7 students off guard. Many will stop at "10 Rupees" and provide that as the answer.
