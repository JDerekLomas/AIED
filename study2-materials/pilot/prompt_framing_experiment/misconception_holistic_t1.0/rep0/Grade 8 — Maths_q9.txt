**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   Understanding the relationship between Marked Price (MP), Discount, and Selling Price (SP).
*   Understanding the relationship between Cost Price (CP), Profit, and Selling Price (SP).
*   Calculating percentages of a given amount ($10\%$ of $1200$).
*   Solving for an unknown base value given the final value and percentage increase (Reverse percentage calculation: $CP \times 1.08 = 1080$).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Additive vs. Multiplicative Profit:** Students might try to subtract the $8\%$ profit from the SP ($1080 - 8\%$ of $1080$) instead of dividing by $1.08$. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Base Confusion:** Students often confuse which value to apply the percentage to (e.g., applying the $8\%$ profit to the MP of $1200$ instead of the CP). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Discount/Profit Mix-up:** Thinking the net "gain" is simply $10\% - 8\% = 2\%$. This leads to an incorrect answer.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Familiar Context:** Shopping, discounts, and profit are very familiar real-world contexts for students.
*   **Simple Numbers:** $1200$ and $10\%$ are "friendly" numbers, making the first step (finding $SP = 1080$) relatively easy even for those with lower numeracy skills.
*   **Hindi-English Cognates:** Terms like "Profit," "Discount," and "Price" are often taught bilingually or are familiar in common parlance.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Multi-step logic:** The student must hold the result of the first calculation (SP) in memory to perform the second calculation.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the phrasing "Even after the discount" involves complex sentence structure in English.
*   **No Multiple Choice:** Since it is open-ended, students cannot "work backward" from given options, which is a common strategy for this specific problem type.
*   **Division Complexity:** Dividing $1080$ by $1.08$ (or solving $108/100 \times CP = 1080$) is a significant hurdle for Grade 8 students in this demographic.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
While the first step is accessible, the second step—finding the CP from the SP and Profit—is a classic "stumbling block" in the Indian Grade 8 curriculum. Students from economically weaker backgrounds often have high mental math skills for simple transactions but struggle with the formal algebraic manipulation required for reverse percentages.
