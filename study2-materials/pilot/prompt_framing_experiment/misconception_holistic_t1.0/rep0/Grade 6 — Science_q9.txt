Step 1: The item requires recall and explanation of biological concepts (nutrition) rather than mathematical skills. Key skills include scientific literacy, understanding cause-and-effect (deficiency diseases), and vocabulary application.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Believing vitamins/minerals provide energy (calories) like carbohydrates; this would lead to an incorrect explanation in part (a).
- Conflating vitamins and minerals (e.g., calling Iron a vitamin); this would lead to an incorrect answer in part (b).
- Thinking "protective" means external protection (skin) rather than immune system function.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The context is highly familiar and a core part of the Grade 6 NCERT/State curriculum.
- The term "protective foods" is a specific keyword heavily emphasized in Indian textbooks through rote memorization.
- The deficiency table (e.g., Vitamin A - Night Blindness, Iodine - Goiter) is a standard memorization task.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- Language barrier: Hindi-medium students may know the concept as "रक्षात्मक आहार" (Rakshatmak Aahar) but struggle to explain "protective foods" in English.
- Open-ended format: Requires writing full sentences, which is difficult for students with limited English proficiency.
- Multi-part question: The rubric only mentions (a), but the question requires (b) as well; if the scoring is all-or-nothing for 1 mark, the difficulty increases.

Step 5: While the content is fundamental, the requirement to "Explain" in English is a significant barrier for students from economically weaker sections with limited English exposure, leading to many partially correct but linguistically incomplete answers.
