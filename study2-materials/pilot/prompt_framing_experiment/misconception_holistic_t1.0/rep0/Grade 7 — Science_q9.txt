Step 1: Identify the concepts and skills required.
Though categorized under Science, the "mathematical" logic involves classification and causal reasoning (if X is green but eats insects, then Y must be the missing variable). Students must identify "insectivorous/heterotrophic" nutrition and explain nitrogen deficiency in soil.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
1. "Plants only eat sunlight/water": Students may struggle to reconcile photosynthesis with eating insects.
2. "Plants 'eat' for energy": Students often think insects provide glucose/calories rather than minerals (nitrogen).
3. Linguistic confusion: In Hindi-medium backgrounds, the term "insectivorous" (कीटभक्षी) is easier to remember than the English spelling, leading to lost marks in English-medium testing.
These would lead to incorrect or incomplete answers for parts (a) and (b).

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
- Context: The Pitcher plant is a standard, highly visual example in Grade 7 NCERT textbooks.
- Visual cues: The prompt mentions a "trap-like structure," which is a strong scaffold for the answer "insectivorous."

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Open-ended format: No options (MCQs) are provided, requiring active recall and correct spelling.
- Multi-part reasoning: Part (b) requires explaining a paradox (green but still trapping), which is high-order thinking for students with limited English proficiency.
- Rubric Rigor: If the rubric strictly requires the technical term "insectivorous" for part (a), many students might lose the point due to spelling or using descriptive language instead of the scientific term.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the language barrier and the shift from rote memorization to explaining "why" in part (b), many students from economically weaker sections may struggle to articulate the nitrogen deficiency concept in English, even if they understand the biological concept in their mother tongue.
