Step 1: Identify the concepts and skills required.
*   Scientific classification of objects into living and non-living categories.
*   Recall of biological processes (growth, respiration, reproduction, nutrition).
*   Linguistic ability to "differentiate" and articulate characteristics in English.

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
*   Movement = Life: Students may think anything that moves (like a car or clouds) is living. This could lead to a partially correct but scientifically weak answer.
*   Rest/Sleep = Non-living: Thinking plants are non-living because they don't move or appear to "breathe" visibly. This would lead to an incorrect characteristic.
*   Anthropomorphism: Assigning living traits to objects like the sun or fire.

Step 3: Factors that make it easier.
*   Familiar context: This is a fundamental topic introduced very early in primary school.
*   Low threshold for success: The rubric only requires *one* valid characteristic for living things to gain the 0.5 points, even though the prompt asks for two for each.
*   Common vocabulary: Words like "eat," "grow," and "baby" (reproduction) are often known even with limited English.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
*   Language barrier: "Differentiate" and "characteristics" are sophisticated academic Tier 2 words that may confuse Hindi-medium students.
*   Open-ended format: Requires generating text rather than selecting a choice.
*   Strictness vs. Rubric: While the prompt asks for four total points (2+2), the rubric is surprisingly lenient (asking for only 1 characteristic).

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the extreme leniency of the rubric (only needing one characteristic of living things to get the full 0.5 marks) and the fact that "growth" and "eating" are universally understood concepts, most students will successfully provide at least one valid point despite English language struggles.
