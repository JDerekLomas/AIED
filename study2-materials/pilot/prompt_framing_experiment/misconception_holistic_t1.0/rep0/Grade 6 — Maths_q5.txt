Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required:
*   Understanding place value up to 5 digits.
*   Understanding the definition of a "palindrome" (symmetry in digits).
*   Identifying the smallest and largest constraints within a specific digit count.
*   Multi-step arithmetic: Addition (sum) and Subtraction (difference).

Step 2: Common misconceptions:
*   **Palindrome definition:** Students might confuse palindromes with "repeating digits" (e.g., 11,111) or fail to realize 10,001 is a palindrome, perhaps choosing 11,111 instead. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Smallest number with 0:** Students often struggle with using 0 in the middle of numbers, potentially picking 11,211 or 12,121. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **"Smallest 5-digit" vs "Smallest 5-digit palindrome":** A student might use 10,000 (not a palindrome) and 99,999. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Place value alignment:** During addition/subtraction of 110,000, students may make carry-over or borrowing errors.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
*   The largest 5-digit number (99,999) is naturally a palindrome, making half the problem intuitive.
*   Addition and subtraction are core competencies for Grade 6.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the word "palindrome" is not a standard Hindi term; they would likely know it as "vilompad" or "ulta-pulta number," but the English term is often unfamiliar.
*   **Two-part question:** The question asks for both sum and difference, but the provided rubric only awards the point for the sum. This inconsistency can confuse students.
*   **No Multiple Choice:** There are no cues to help self-correct.
*   **Socio-economic context:** Limited exposure to mathematical vocabulary in English often results in students skipping "wordy" problems.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate:
Given the specific challenge of the term "palindrome" for English Language Learners and the multi-step nature (finding two specific numbers then performing two operations), many students will stumble on the definition even if their arithmetic is strong.
