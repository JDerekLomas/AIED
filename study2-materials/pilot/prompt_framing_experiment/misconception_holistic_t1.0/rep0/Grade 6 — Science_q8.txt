Step 1: The item requires scientific reasoning rather than direct mathematical calculation. However, the cognitive skills involved include **logical inference** (if X symptom, then Y cause), **identifying variables** (nutrients, sunlight, water), and **causal modeling** (linking biological processes to external inputs).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
*   **Soil as "food":** Students believe plants "eat" soil like animals eat food, rather than absorbing minerals (leads to a correct inference of lack of soil/nutrients).
*   **Water as the only need:** Students often prioritize water over light or nutrients (leads to a correct inference).
*   **Yellowing means "dying" (general):** Students may see yellowing as an irreversible end-state rather than a specific deficiency (leads to a vague or incorrect answer like "The plant is old").
*   **Sunlight as "warmth":** Students may think plants need light for heat rather than photosynthesis (may lead to a correct inference of needing sun).

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
*   **Familiar context:** Most students from economically weaker sections in India have direct experience with plants or agriculture.
*   **Generous Rubric:** The rubric accepts multiple correct pathways (nutrients, light, OR water), making the threshold for success low.
*   **Visual language:** "Yellowing" and "stunted" are observable physical traits.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   **English Language Proficiency:** Words like "stunted," "infer," and "evidence" are high-level academic English. Hindi-medium students may struggle to understand what the question is asking even if they know the science.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options (MCQ), students must construct a sentence in English, which is a significant barrier for this demographic.
*   **Abstract Reasoning:** "Inferring from evidence" is a higher-order thinking skill compared to rote memorization of plant parts.

Step 5: While the science is intuitive, the linguistic barrier of the terms "stunted" and "infer" combined with the requirement to "explain" in English will likely prevent many students from expressing their knowledge accurately.
