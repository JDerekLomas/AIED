Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   **Data Interpretation:** Reading and comparing values in a table.
*   **Ordering Decimals/Integers:** Identifying the maximum value in a set of data.
*   **Logical Reasoning:** Connecting thermal expansion properties to real-world engineering (railway tracks) and material science (electrical conductivity).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Decimal Place Value:** Students might think 0.02 is larger than 0.1 because "2 is larger than 1." (If the table uses decimals, this leads to incorrect identification).
*   **Property Confusion:** Confusing thermal expansion with electrical conductivity (e.g., assuming the metal that expands most is the best conductor). This would lead to an incorrect answer for part (c).
*   **Contextual Misalignment:** Believing gaps in tracks are for "water drainage" rather than expansion.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** Railway tracks are a standard, "textbook" example of thermal expansion in the Indian curriculum.
*   **Direct Retrieval:** Part (a) is a simple data-finding task.
*   **High-Frequency Topic:** Thermal expansion and electrical wires are core Grade 8 Science topics.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the phrasing "recommend" or "expand," especially if they have limited English proficiency.
*   **Multiple Parts vs. Score:** The rubric only awards 1 mark for part (a), but the question has three parts. If a student gets (a) right but fails (b) or (c) due to language/reasoning, they might be penalized depending on the teacher's grading, though the rubric focuses on (a).
*   **Open-ended Reasoning:** Parts (b) and (c) require articulating "Why," which is difficult for students with limited English.

Step 5: Holistically, while part (a) is straightforward data reading, the combination of three sub-questions in a second language and the potential for decimal confusion in the table reduces the likelihood of a "fully correct" response across all three parts. However, since the rubric specifically points to part (a) for the 1-mark credit, the success rate for that specific task is higher.
