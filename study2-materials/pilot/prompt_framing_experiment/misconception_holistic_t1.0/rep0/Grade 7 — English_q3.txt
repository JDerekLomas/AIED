Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a reading comprehension task for an English language assessment based on Leo Tolstoy's "Three Questions." There are no mathematical concepts or skills required for this specific item.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
While not mathematical, common cognitive/linguistic hurdles include:
- Literal vs. Inferential understanding: Students may struggle to infer the "why" (the king's motivation for success/power) and instead just list the three questions.
- Linguistic interference: Hindi-medium students often struggle with the "Why... if..." conditional structure in English.
- Synthesis: Combining the three specific answers into the general concept of "certainty" or "avoidance of failure."

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
- Familiar Context: This story is a staple in Indian Grade 7 English curriculum (NCERT/State Boards).
- Direct Rubric: The rubric allows for "any valid reason," meaning partial or literal recalls from the text are likely to be accepted.
- Simple Vocabulary: "King," "fail," and "answers" are high-frequency words.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Open-ended format: No multiple-choice options to scaffold the answer.
- English Proficiency: Expressing a causal relationship in 2-3 sentences is difficult for students with limited English fluency.
- Grammar/Syntax: The question itself contains a slight grammatical awkwardness ("Why the king felt..." instead of "Why did the king feel..."), which can confuse students with low proficiency.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given that this is a standard textbook story frequently rehearsed in classrooms, many students will rely on rote memorization of the "Three Questions." However, the requirement to explain the "why" (the logic of never failing) in English sentences remains a significant barrier for students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds.
