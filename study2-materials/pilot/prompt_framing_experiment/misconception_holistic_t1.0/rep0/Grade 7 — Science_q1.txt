Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Science item, the underlying mathematical/logical skills include classification (categorizing tools based on function), understanding measurement scales (range and precision), and logical reasoning (cause-and-effect regarding the "kink" or "constriction" in a thermometer).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   "Any thermometer can measure anything": Students may think a laboratory thermometer is "better" because it is larger or has a wider range. (Leads to incorrect answer)
*   "Temperature is just a number": Failing to understand that the physical design of the instrument affects the accuracy of the reading over time (mercury falling back). (Leads to incorrect answer)
*   Scale confusion: Believing that because laboratory thermometers go up to 100°C, they are more accurate for a 37°C body. (Leads to incorrect answer)

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   Familiar Context: Every student has likely seen a doctor use a thermometer.
*   Direct Curriculum Link: This is a standard comparison taught in Class 7 Science.
*   Keywords: "Doctor" and "Body Temperature" are strong cues for "Clinical."

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students, explaining the "why" (the preference) in English is a significant hurdle. They may know the concept but lack the vocabulary to explain the "kink" or the prevention of backflow.
*   Open-ended Format: No options to choose from requires active recall rather than recognition.
*   Two-part Question: Students might identify the thermometer but fail to explain "why," losing the 0.5 marks if the rubric is strictly applied.
*   Low Point Value: 0.5 marks might lead students to give a one-word answer, missing the "why" component.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given the English language requirement for a multi-part explanation and the specific technical reasoning required for the "preferred" part, many students will provide a partially correct answer (naming the thermometer) but fail to articulate the reasoning in English.
