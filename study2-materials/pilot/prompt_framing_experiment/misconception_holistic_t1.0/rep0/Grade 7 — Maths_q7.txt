**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   Understanding the linguistic-mathematical bridge: recognizing that "of" signifies multiplication in the context of fractions.
*   Fraction multiplication: Multiplying numerators and denominators ($a/b \times c/d$).
*   Fraction comparison: Finding a common denominator or converting to decimals to compare $3/8$ and $4/15$.
*   Equivalent fractions: Proficiency in finding the LCM of 8 and 15 (which is 120).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **"Additive" multiplication:** Adding numerators and denominators instead of multiplying (e.g., $1/2$ of $3/4 = 4/6$). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Whole number bias in comparison:** Thinking $4/15$ is larger than $3/8$ because 15 and 4 "feel" like larger numbers, or thinking $3/8$ is larger because 8 is smaller than 15 (correct conclusion, wrong reasoning).
*   **Cross-multiplication confusion:** Attempting to cross-multiply during the multiplication phase rather than the comparison phase.
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with "of" if they haven't internalized it as "ka" (का), the Hindi equivalent for multiplication in fractions.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   The numbers involved are small single digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
*   Fraction multiplication is a standard procedural skill heavily drilled in Grade 7 NCERT curriculum.
*   The phrase "Which is greater" is a common prompt in Indian textbooks.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Multi-step process:** This is not a one-step problem. Students must calculate twice, then perform a comparison.
*   **Complex comparison:** $3/8$ vs $4/15$ is not intuitive. Unlike comparing $1/2$ and $1/4$, these require finding a high common denominator (120) or long division, which are high-error zones.
*   **Linguistic complexity:** For ESL/Hindi-medium students, word problems—even short ones—increase cognitive load.
*   **Strict Rubric:** The rubric requires *both* calculations to be correct for a single mark; there is no partial credit for getting one side right but failing the comparison.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
While the multiplication is straightforward, the comparison of $3/8$ and $4/15$ is a significant hurdle for Grade 7 students in this demographic. Many will likely perform the multiplication but fail to correctly justify which is larger due to the lack of an easy common denominator.
