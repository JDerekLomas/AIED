Step 1: The question is linguistic, not mathematical. The skills required are: identifying the subject, verb, and object; identifying verb tenses (Simple Past and Present Perfect); applying the passive voice formula (Object + appropriate form of 'to be' + V3 + by + Subject); and managing the auxiliary "has been."

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Changing the tense (e.g., using "is prepared" instead of "was prepared"). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Confusion with "has": Students often miss the "been" in Present Perfect passive ("The successor has found..."). This would lead to an incorrect answer for Part B.
- Misidentifying the object: Students may struggle with "a delicious meal" as a single unit.
- Word order: Reversing subject/object without changing the verb form.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The vocabulary ("chef," "meal," "king") is relatively common in Indian textbooks. The structure of Sentence A is the most standard "Subject-Verb-Object" example used in classrooms.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: 
- The rubric requires *both* A and B for 1 mark (implied by "Maximum score: 1" for two items).
- Part B involves the Present Perfect ("has found"), which is significantly harder for Hindi-medium learners than the Simple Past.
- The open-ended format requires correct spelling and syntax without cues.
- "Successor" is a high-level vocabulary word for an EWS/Hindi-medium background student.
- English proficiency acts as a barrier to understanding the grammatical logic.

Step 5: Given the multi-part requirement for a single mark and the complexity of the "has been" construction for second-language learners, the success rate will be low.
