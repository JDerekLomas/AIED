Step 1: The question is labeled as Social Science, but per the prompt instructions to identify "mathematical concepts," the relevant skills involve categorization (sets of resources), logical cause-and-effect reasoning (influence on life), and linguistic processing.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Conflating "natural resources" with "man-made products" (e.g., listing "textiles" instead of "cotton/water"). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Confusion between "natural resources" and "climatic conditions" (e.g., saying "heat"). This might lead to partial credit or incorrect answers depending on the examiner.
- Generalization error: Assuming all of Rajasthan is only desert and missing mineral wealth.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The context is highly local and familiar to students in Indian government schools (Rajasthan’s geography is a core part of the SCERT/NCERT curriculum).
- Students likely have lived experience with resources like sunlight, salt, or stones (marble/sandstone).

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students with limited English, "Mention" and "Influences" are academic Tier 2 vocabulary words that may be difficult to decode.
- Open-ended format: Requires generating text rather than recognizing a choice.
- Multi-step reasoning: Students must not only list but also explain a socioeconomic relationship.
- Scoring Rubric: The maximum score is only 1 point for a multi-part answer, meaning any mistake in the "explanation" phase results in a 0, despite knowing the resources.

Step 5: While the subject matter is familiar, the requirement to explain a relationship in English for ESL learners from economically weaker sections, combined with a strict 1-mark "all or nothing" rubric for a two-part question, significantly lowers the success rate.
