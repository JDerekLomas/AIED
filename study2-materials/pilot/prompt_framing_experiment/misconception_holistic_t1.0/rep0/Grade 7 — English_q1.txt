Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a reading comprehension task for an English language class, not a mathematics item. However, in terms of cognitive skills, it requires identifying a set of three specific elements from a narrative text and list-making.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   Misunderstanding "what" as asking for the *reasons* why he wanted answers rather than the content of the questions (Incorrect).
*   Confusing the answers the king eventually received with the questions he originally asked (Incorrect).
*   Language barrier: Misinterpreting "right time," "right people," and "right thing" due to limited vocabulary (Incorrect).

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
The item is based on "Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy, which is a foundational, standard text in the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum used in Indian government schools. The context is a familiar moral fable. Teachers often emphasize these three specific points during instruction as they are the core of the story.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
The open-ended format requires the student to construct a sentence in English. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, grammar and sentence structure are significant hurdles. Translating the concepts of "right time," "right people," and "important occupation" from Hindi thought patterns into English prose without a multiple-choice prompt is difficult.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically.
While the story is a staple of the curriculum, the requirement to produce a three-part list in written English without options will be challenging for students with low English proficiency. Many will understand the story in Hindi but struggle to replicate the specific phrasing required by the rubric in English.
