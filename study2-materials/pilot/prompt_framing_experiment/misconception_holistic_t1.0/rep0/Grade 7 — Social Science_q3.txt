Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, it requires cognitive skills such as categorization (grouping different treatments under "equality") and logical application (mapping an abstract rule to a concrete scenario). Linguistically, it requires the ability to construct a coherent sentence in a secondary language.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- "Equality means everyone gets the same thing" (ignoring equity/need).
- "Equality is only about voting" (limiting the scope).
- Confusing "Equality" with "Justice" or "Freedom."
Because the rubric is extremely lenient (allowing *either* a basic explanation *or* an example), these misconceptions would likely still result in a correct score of 1, as even a flawed understanding usually includes a "correct enough" daily life example (e.g., standing in a queue).

Step 3: Ease factors: The rubric is highly generous (binary score, "OR" condition). The context of "daily life" is familiar. Concepts like voting (Mid-day meals, queues) are heavily emphasized in NCERT Grade 7 textbooks. The threshold for success is very low.

Step 4: Difficulty factors: The open-ended format is challenging for students with limited English proficiency (ESL/Hindi-medium). Writing an "explanation" requires higher-order syntax than a multiple-choice question. For students from economically weaker sections, the abstract nature of "constitutional guarantees" might feel removed from their lived experience unless tied to specific schemes like Mid-day meals.

Step 5: Given the very lenient rubric (requiring only one of the two parts) and the familiar classroom examples used in Indian schools, the majority of students will be able to provide at least a simple example (like "everyone stands in the same line for water/voting") even if their English is broken.
