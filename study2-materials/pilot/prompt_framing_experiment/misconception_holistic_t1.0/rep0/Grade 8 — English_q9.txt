Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a language arts (English) question, not a mathematics question. It requires vocabulary recall, understanding of semantic relationships (synonyms and antonyms), and the ability to distinguish between "same" and "opposite" meanings.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- Confusion between the terms "synonym" and "antonym": A student might provide the antonym for the synonym and vice-versa. (Leads to incorrect answer).
- Spelling confusion: Confusion between "quiet" (silent) and "quite" (completely/very). (Leads to incorrect answer).
- Hindi-English translation lag: Students may know the Hindi word "Shanti" or "Chup" but struggle to retrieve the precise English academic term.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- The word "quiet" is high-frequency and commonly used in classroom management ("Keep quiet").
- The rubric is generous, accepting several common synonyms.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- Open-ended format: No word bank is provided, requiring active recall rather than recognition.
- Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, the instructions themselves ("Synonym/Antonym") are technical academic English terms that are often harder than the target word "quiet."
- Dual requirement: The student must get both parts right to satisfy most grading interpretations for a single point, though the rubric is slightly ambiguous on partial credit.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically:
While "quiet" is a familiar word, the technical terms "synonym" and "antonym" pose a significant barrier for students with limited English proficiency and EWS backgrounds. Many will confuse the two or fail to recall the spelling of "silent" or "noisy" correctly.
