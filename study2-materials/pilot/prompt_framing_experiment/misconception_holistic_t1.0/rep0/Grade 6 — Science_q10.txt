Step 1: The item requires data interpretation (reading a table), comparing numerical values (growth in cm/mm), and identifying trends. It also requires correlating scientific variables (sunlight vs. darkness) with numerical outcomes.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include the idea that plants "eat" soil or that water is the only requirement for growth. However, most 6th graders understand sunlight is "good" for plants. A specific misconception might be confusing "growth" with "height" (some plants grow tall and spindly in darkness—etiolation), but if the data clearly shows 0 or low growth for darkness, the table will override this. These misconceptions are unlikely to cause an incorrect answer for (a) if the student can read the table.

Step 3: Ease factors: The context of plant growth is a primary school staple. Part (a) is a straightforward data extraction task ("find the biggest number"). The numbers are likely small and easy to compare.

Step 4: Difficulty factors: For Hindi-medium students with limited English, terms like "favourable," "hindered," and "biological process" are high-level academic vocabulary. While (a) is easy, parts (b) and (c) require English sentence construction and specific terminology ("Photosynthesis"). The open-ended format is significantly harder for these students than a multiple-choice question would be.

Step 5: While many students will correctly identify the condition in (a), the requirement for a "fully correct answer" across all three parts (including naming photosynthesis and explaining the "why" in English) will be a significant barrier for this specific demographic.
