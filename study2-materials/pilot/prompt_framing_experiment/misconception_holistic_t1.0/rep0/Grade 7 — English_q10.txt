Step 1: Identify the linguistic concepts and skills required.
Converting direct to indirect speech requires:
*   Understanding of reporting verbs and "that" as a conjunction.
*   Pronoun shift (changing "I" to "she" based on the subject).
*   Tense backshifting (changing Present Continuous "am reading" to Past Continuous "was reading").
*   Syntactic restructuring (removing quotation marks and commas).

Step 2: Common misconceptions/errors.
*   **Tense Consistency:** Students often keep the verb in the present tense ("She said that she is reading"), especially if they translate literally from Hindi (where reporting often stays in the original tense). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Pronoun Confusion:** Students may retain the first-person pronoun ("She said that I was reading"). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Literal Translation:** In Hindi, "said" (kaha) is followed by "ki" (that), but the direct quote is often repeated verbatim. This interference makes the backshift in English non-intuitive.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Familiar Vocabulary:** "She," "reading," and "novel" are basic Level 1 English words.
*   **Standard Example:** This is a "textbook" example of indirect speech, likely practiced frequently in rote grammar drills.
*   **Simple Reporting Verb:** "Said" does not require a change (unlike "said to me" -> "told me").

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no multiple-choice options to trigger recognition; the student must recall all rules simultaneously.
*   **Dual-step transformation:** The student must change both the pronoun and the tense.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the concept of "backshifting" tenses is one of the most difficult hurdles in English grammar because it doesn't align perfectly with their native syntax.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given the reliance on rote memorization in many government school settings, many students will recognize the pattern. However, the combination of the pronoun shift and the tense backshift—compounded by English being a second or third language—usually results in high error rates in open-ended transformations.
