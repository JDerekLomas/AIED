Step 1: The question primarily involves conceptual Science (thermodynamics/heat transfer), but the mathematical/analytical skills required include understanding ratios (surface area to evaporation), identifying causal relationships (absorption vs. reflection), and categorization of variables (light vs. dark; cotton vs. synthetic).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- "White clothes produce coldness" (Incorrect reasoning, but might lead to a correct answer regarding "feeling cool").
- "Cotton is thin, so heat passes through" (Misunderstanding insulation vs. breathability).
- Confusing "heat" with "light" (Likely won't prevent a correct answer on this item).
- "Fabric 'soaks' heat like water" (Might lead to vague explanations).

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The context is highly familiar and culturally relevant to students in India (hot summers). The concept of "light colors reflect heat" is a common "rule of thumb" taught early. The rubric is very generous, accepting non-technical language like "bouncing off heat."

Step 4: Factors making it harder: The question is open-ended and requires "two scientific reasons" in English. For Hindi-medium students with limited English proficiency, articulating "absorption," "reflection," "perspiration," or "evaporation" in a second language is a significant barrier. While they may understand the science, the "explain" and "stating two reasons" format is cognitively and linguistically demanding compared to multiple-choice.

Step 5: While the concept is intuitive, the requirement to provide two distinct reasons (one for color, one for material) combined with the English language barrier for this specific demographic will result in many partial or linguistically stunted answers that may not meet the full criteria for a score of 1.
