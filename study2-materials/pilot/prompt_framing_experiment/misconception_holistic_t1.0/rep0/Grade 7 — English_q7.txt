Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
Though the subject is English, the analytical task requires classifying a word based on its functional relationship within a sentence. In a linguistic sense, this involves identifying the "operator" (verb) and determining how the "modifier" (around) interacts with it.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Word-Category Fixation:** Students often memorize words as a single part of speech. "Around" is frequently taught as a preposition (e.g., "around the tree"). This misconception leads to an incorrect answer here because there is no noun phrase following "around" to make it a preposition.
*   **Adverb-Suffix Dependency:** Many students believe all adverbs must end in "-ly." Since "around" does not, they may default to calling it a preposition or adjective, leading to an incorrect answer.
*   **Position Bias:** Students might assume words following a verb are always objects (nouns), leading them to guess incorrectly.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   The sentence is extremely short (3 words).
*   The vocabulary ("We," "ran," "around") is basic and likely familiar even to students with limited English proficiency.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Syntactic Ambiguity:** "Around" is a "swing word" that functions as both a preposition and an adverb. Distinguishing between them requires an understanding of intransitive verb usage, which is advanced for Grade 7 Hindi-medium learners.
*   **Lack of Choices:** As an open-ended question (implied by the rubric), there are no distractors to eliminate, nor is there a 25% chance of guessing correctly as in a multiple-choice format.
*   **Language Interference:** In Hindi, postpositions function differently, and the distinction between a preposition and an adverb of place is not always a direct 1:1 translation, causing confusion.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
The distinction between "around" as a preposition and an adverb is a classic trap for English Language Learners. Most students at this level will have "preposition" deeply encoded for the word "around." Without the "-ly" marker, few will recognize it as an adverb in this specific intransitive context.
