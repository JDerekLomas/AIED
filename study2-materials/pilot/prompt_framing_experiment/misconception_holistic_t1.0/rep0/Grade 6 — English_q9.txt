Step 1: Identify the linguistic and structural concepts required.
The student must identify and apply three rules of capitalization: starting a sentence with an upper-case letter, capitalizing proper nouns (names like Riya and Meena), and capitalizing days of the week (Sunday). They must also identify the end of a declarative sentence and apply a full stop.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold.
*   **Case Indifference:** Students often view capital and lowercase letters as interchangeable, especially if they are transitioning from Hindi (which does not have letter cases). This leads to incorrect answers.
*   **Middle-of-sentence Capitalization:** Students may believe only the first word of a sentence needs a capital letter, missing "Meena" and "Sunday." This leads to incorrect answers.
*   **Punctuation as Optional:** Many students view the full stop as a decorative or optional mark rather than a grammatical necessity. This leads to incorrect answers.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
The vocabulary is very simple ("market," "friend," "went") and likely familiar to ESL learners. The context of going to a market is culturally relevant and easy to visualize.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
The "all-or-nothing" rubric (Max score: 1) is a significant hurdle; missing even one of the four required capitalizations or the full stop results in a zero. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the concept of "Proper Nouns" requiring capitalization is an abstract rule not present in their native script. The open-ended format requires active production rather than passive recognition.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the strictness of the rubric (four capital letters and one full stop) and the specific challenges faced by students from economically weaker sections with limited English exposure, many students will likely provide a partially correct answer (e.g., capitalizing "Riya" but not "Sunday") which will be marked as incorrect.
