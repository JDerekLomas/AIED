Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Science (Biology) question rather than a Mathematics question. However, the cognitive skills required include recall of definitions, cause-and-effect reasoning (how weeds affect crop growth), and linguistic expression.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- Misconception: All green plants are good/useful. (Would lead to an incorrect answer).
- Misconception: Weeds are "bad" plants by nature (like poison ivy) rather than just being "unwanted" in a specific context. (Might still lead to a partially correct answer).
- Misconception: Weeding is done only for aesthetic reasons. (Would lead to an incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier:
- Context: For students from economically weaker sections in India, many have direct or familial ties to agriculture. The concept of "Khartapatwar" (weeds) is highly familiar in a real-world context.
- Curriculum: This is a core topic in Grade 8 Science (Crop Production and Management), heavily emphasized in NCERT textbooks.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder:
- Language barrier: Since the students are from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, expressing the "why" (competition for nutrients, light, and water) in English is a significant hurdle.
- Open-ended format: There are no cues or options to trigger memory; the student must construct the sentence.
- Double-barreled question: The student must answer both "what" and "why" to satisfy the rubric/question for a single mark.

Step 5: Holistic estimate:
While the concept is culturally and practically familiar to these students, the requirement to produce a two-part explanation in English—given their limited proficiency—will result in many students providing only a partial definition or struggling to articulate the competition for resources.
