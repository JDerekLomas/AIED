Step 1: Identify mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   Knowledge of the Angle Sum Property of a triangle (sum of interior angles is 180°).
*   Understanding of supplementary angles or "angles on a straight line" (sum is 180°), as the figure likely involves an exterior angle or a linear pair to find angle C.
*   Basic arithmetic (addition and subtraction within 180).
*   Interpreting geometric notation and diagrams.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Additive errors: Thinking all triangles sum to 90° or 360°. (Incorrect)
*   Visual estimation: Guessing the angle looks like 90° or 60° rather than calculating. (Incorrect)
*   Confusion between interior and exterior angles: If the "80 degrees" is an exterior angle, students might think $x$ is equal to it or its supplement. (Incorrect)
*   Misinterpreting the "x": If $x$ is part of a linear pair, students often provide the interior angle instead of the exterior one. (Incorrect)

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   The numbers used in Grade 6 geometry are usually "friendly" multiples of 5 or 10.
*   The Angle Sum Property is a core, heavily drilled part of the Class 6 NCERT curriculum.
*   The rubric only requires finding one specific interior angle (80°), which suggests a single-step calculation.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Language barrier: Even a simple prompt like "Find the angle x" can be confusing if the student is used to Hindi terminology (कोण).
*   Diagram dependency: If the figure is not standard or "upside down," students struggle to identify which rule to apply.
*   Open-ended: No options to work backward from.
*   EWS/Hindi-medium context: Limited exposure to diverse problem types beyond textbook examples.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the calculation is simple, the transition from Hindi to English medium in Grade 6 often sees a dip in performance due to vocabulary gaps. Additionally, identifying the correct relationship in a geometric figure (linear pair vs. interior sum) is a significant hurdle for nearly half the cohort.
