Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is an English language item, it requires cognitive skills similar to set theory or mapping: scanning a text (domain) to find a specific element that matches a defined attribute (a light wind). It requires synonym identification and vocabulary retrieval.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
1. Literalism: Students may look for the phrase "light wind" itself rather than a synonym. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
2. Contextual Guessing: Students might select any weather-related word from the passage (e.g., "rain," "storm," "cloud") without verifying the specific definition.
3. Spelling/Transcription: Students may identify the word "breeze" but misspell it, which—depending on the strictness of the rubric—could lead to a zero.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
The word "breeze" is a common "textbook" word often introduced early in environmental studies or basic English poems. If the passage is short, the search space is limited. The definition provided ("a light wind") is very standard and direct.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
The open-ended format (supply-type) is significantly harder for English Language Learners (ELL) than a multiple-choice format. Hindi-medium students often translate "wind" to "hawa" (wind/air), but the nuance of "breeze" (mand sameer/thandi hawa) may not be part of their active English production vocabulary. Limited English proficiency makes scanning for meaning—rather than matching letters—a high-effort task.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically.
For students from economically weaker sections in Hindi-medium backgrounds, vocabulary acquisition is often restricted to high-frequency functional words. "Breeze" is a mid-tier vocabulary word. Without options to choose from, many students will struggle to recall or isolate the specific word even if they understand the passage generally.
