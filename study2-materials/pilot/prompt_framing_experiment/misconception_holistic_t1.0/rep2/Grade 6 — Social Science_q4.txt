Step 1: Identify the concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science (Geography) item requiring factual recall and descriptive writing. Students must identify a regional landform (The Thar Desert/Aravalli Range) and provide a brief description (climate, vegetation, or physical appearance).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Confusing a state with a landform: Students might name "Rajasthan" as the landform itself. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   Overgeneralization: Students might name a landform found in India but not dominant in Rajasthan (e.g., Himalayas). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   Language barrier: Students might know the concept in Hindi (Marusthal) but struggle to translate it to English.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   Familiar Context: For Indian students, the association between Rajasthan and the Desert is culturally pervasive and taught early.
*   Low Threshold for Success: The rubric allows for very brief descriptions, and naming only one landform is required.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   English Proficiency: For students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds, "briefly describe" is a significant hurdle in English, even if they know the facts.
*   Open-ended format: No cues or options are provided to trigger memory.
*   Grammatical ambiguity: The phrase "Name the one major landforms" contains a grammatical error (singular "the one" with plural "landforms"), which may confuse students with limited English.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the factual knowledge is high-frequency, the requirement to "briefly describe" in English for a student body with limited English proficiency significantly lowers the success rate for a fully correct answer according to the rubric.
