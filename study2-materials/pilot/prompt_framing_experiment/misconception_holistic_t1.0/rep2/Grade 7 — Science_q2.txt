Step 1: The concepts required are heat transfer mechanisms (specifically conduction) and the kinetic molecular theory as it applies to solids (vibration of particles transferring energy to neighbors).

Step 2: 
- Misconception: Heat is a fluid-like substance that "flows" through empty spaces. (Would lead to a correct name in (a) but a flawed explanation in (b)).
- Misconception: Only the part touching the hot liquid gets hot; the handle gets hot because of steam. (Leads to incorrect answer).
- Misconception: Particles themselves move from the hot end to the cold end (convection in solids). (Leads to incorrect explanation in (b)).

Step 3: The context (spoon in tea) is highly familiar and culturally relevant to students from all socioeconomic backgrounds. The term "Conduction" (or "Chalan" in Hindi) is a foundational vocabulary word heavily practiced in Grade 7.

Step 4: The open-ended "explain" part is difficult for students with limited English proficiency. While they may know the concept, articulating the molecular process in English is a high barrier. The 0.5 marks rubric for part (a) suggests the scoring is lenient, but a full "brief explanation" requires specific scientific terminology.

Step 5: Most students will correctly identify "Conduction" due to rote memorization and familiar context, but many will struggle to explain the "how" (particle vibration) in English, leading to partial credit or lost points on part (b).
