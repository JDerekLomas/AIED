Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required:
*   Understanding of the equals sign as a balance.
*   Application of inverse operations (subtraction followed by division).
*   Handling two-step linear equations.
*   Basic arithmetic (10 - 2 and 8 ÷ 4).

Step 2: Common misconceptions:
*   **Operator Misconception:** Treating the "+" as a command to add the nearest numbers ($2+10=12$) or adding the coefficient to the constant ($4+2=6$). This would lead to incorrect answers.
*   **Inverse Error:** Using the wrong inverse (e.g., adding 2 instead of subtracting). This would lead to an incorrect answer ($4x = 12$).
*   **Order of Operations:** Dividing by 4 before subtracting 2. While mathematically possible, students often forget to divide the 2, leading to $x + 2 = 2.5$.
*   **Concatenation:** Treating $4x$ as forty-something rather than multiplication. This leads to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier:
*   **Simple Integers:** The numbers are small, positive, and result in a whole number quotient ($8/4=2$).
*   **Standard Form:** The equation is in the most familiar $ax + b = c$ format.
*   **Minimal Language:** The word "Solve" is a high-frequency academic term that even students with limited English proficiency usually recognize.
*   **Curricular Focus:** Grade 7 in the NCERT/Indian curriculum places heavy emphasis on "Simple Equations."

Step 4: Factors that make it harder:
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no options to work backward from or to provide a "safety net" for calculation errors.
*   **Two-step process:** Requires maintaining the balance of the equation over two distinct transformations.
*   **Hindi-to-English transition:** While the math is symbolic, the instruction "Solve" or "Equation" might still cause a momentary barrier for a few.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate:
Despite the challenges faced by students from economically weaker sections, this specific equation is a "textbook" example that is drilled extensively in Indian classrooms. The numbers are exceptionally "friendly" (no fractions or negatives), which eliminates many of the usual computational hurdles.
