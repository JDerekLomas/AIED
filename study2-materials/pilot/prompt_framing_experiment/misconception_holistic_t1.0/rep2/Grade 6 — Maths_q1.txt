### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Definition of Factors:** Understanding that a factor is a number that divides 68 exactly without leaving a remainder.
*   **Multiplication/Division Facts:** Proficiency in basic times tables and mental or long division.
*   **Systematic Listing:** Using a strategy (like factor pairs) to ensure no numbers are missed.
*   **Divisibility Rules:** Recognizing that 68 is even (divisible by 2) and checking for other divisors (4, 17).

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Confusing Factors with Multiples:** Listing 68, 136, etc. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Incomplete Sets:** Finding only the "obvious" pairs (1, 68 and 2, 34) but missing the middle pair (4, 17). This is highly likely for this item.
*   **Prime/Composite Confusion:** Thinking only prime numbers can be factors.
*   **Calculation Errors:** Misidentifying 17 as a non-factor or making a mistake in dividing 68 by 4.

### Step 3: Factors Making the Item Easier
*   **Familiar Terminology:** "Factors" is a standard term in the NCERT/State Board Grade 6 curriculum.
*   **Even Number:** The fact that 68 is even makes it immediately clear that 2 is a factor.
*   **Low Linguistic Load:** The sentence is short and direct, which helps students with limited English proficiency.

### Step 4: Factors Making the Item Harder
*   **The "17" Barrier:** 17 is a prime number and not part of the standard 1-10 multiplication tables. Most students stop at 2 or 4 and fail to find 17 and 34.
*   **Open-ended Format:** No multiple-choice options to prompt the student that they are missing numbers.
*   **Binary Rubric:** The rubric requires *all* factors for 1 mark; missing even one (like 17) results in 0.
*   **Economic/Medium Context:** Students from economically weaker sections may have less access to supplementary practice or "number sense" games, leading to a more rote-memorization approach to math which struggles with non-obvious factors like 17.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While many students will find 1, 2, 34, and 68, a significant majority of Grade 6 students in this demographic will struggle to identify the 4 and 17 pair. Because the rubric is "all or nothing," the success rate will be low.
