Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, it requires cognitive skills related to logical categorization and application. The "mathematical" equivalent involves understanding a universal set (all citizens) and the mapping of equal rights (1:1 correspondence) across that set regardless of variables (caste, religion, gender).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include the "Equality vs. Equity" confusion (thinking everyone must get the same outcome rather than the same opportunity) and the "Authority Bias" (thinking equality only applies if a superior allows it). On this item, these might lead to incorrect examples that describe "kindness" or "charity" rather than "rights," potentially resulting in a 0 based on the rubric's requirement for a "correct explanation" or "relevant principle."

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The rubric is extremely generous (an "OR" condition); students only need a basic definition OR a single example to get full marks. The context of "daily life" is familiar, and the concept of "fairness" is intuitive even for students with limited English.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: The open-ended nature requires expressive language. For Hindi-medium students with limited English, articulating "Constitution" or "guaranteed" in English may be a barrier. However, if the response is allowed in a bilingual format or simple English, this difficulty is mitigated. The abstract nature of "The Constitution" is the primary hurdle.

Step 5: Given the very lenient rubric (requiring only an example OR a definition for a single point), a majority of students will be able to provide a relatable example (like standing in a queue or voting) even if their theoretical explanation is weak.
