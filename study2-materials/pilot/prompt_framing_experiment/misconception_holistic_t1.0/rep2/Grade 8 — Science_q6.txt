Step 1: Identify the concepts and skills required.
Though categorized as Science, the item assesses visual literacy and environmental science concepts. Skills include:
- Visual identification (recognizing a "felled tree" or "deforestation").
- Cause-and-effect reasoning (understanding the long-term impact of habitat loss or climate change).
- Linguistic expression (translating thoughts into English).

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
- Confusing "immediate" vs. "sustained" consequences: Students might list immediate results (e.g., "the wood is sold") rather than long-term environmental consequences (e.g., "global warming" or "soil erosion").
- Misinterpretation of the prompt: Some may describe the axe rather than the process (deforestation).
- Impact on this item: If they focus only on the immediate act, they may fail part (b), which asks for "consequences."

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
- Familiar context: Deforestation is a core topic in Indian Grade 8 textbooks (NCERT).
- Visual aid: The image bypasses some language barriers for identification.
- Flexible rubric: "Any sufficient description" allows for simple English or even transliterated keywords.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Language barrier: Students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds may struggle to recall or spell English terms like "deforestation," "consequences," or "sustained."
- Open-ended format: No options to prompt their memory.
- Two-part requirement: The student must answer both (a) and (b) correctly to receive the 1 mark (as per the maximum score of 1).
- Vocabulary complexity: The word "consequences" and "sustained" are high-level Tier 2 English words that may confuse students with limited English proficiency.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
While the concept is familiar, the requirement to explain "consequences" in English, combined with the linguistic complexity of the question phrasing for a student from a Hindi-medium/EWS background, creates a significant barrier.
