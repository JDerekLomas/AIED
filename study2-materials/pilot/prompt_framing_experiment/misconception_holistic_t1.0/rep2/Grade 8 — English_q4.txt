Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a vocabulary-in-context question rather than a mathematical one. However, the cognitive skills required include scanning a text, mapping definitions to specific lexical units (synonym matching), and reading comprehension.

Step 2: List common misconceptions/errors.
1. **Contextual Misinterpretation:** Students may identify any weather-related word (like "cloud" or "rain") instead of the specific synonym.
2. **Literal vs. Figurative:** Students might struggle if the word "breeze" is used metaphorically in the text.
3. **Spelling errors:** For Hindi-medium students, phonetic spelling (e.g., "brij" or "breze") might occur.
4. **Incorrect Part of Speech:** Selecting a verb instead of the required noun.
*Effect on this item:* High. Limited English proficiency makes identifying precise synonyms difficult.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
1. **Familiarity:** "Breeze" is a relatively common foundational vocabulary word.
2. **Single Step:** The task is a direct one-to-one word search.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
1. **Open-ended format:** Without multiple-choice options, students must retrieve the word independently from the text.
2. **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, "light wind" is a definition they must first translate or visualize before finding the English equivalent.
3. **Text Density:** If the passage is long or contains complex vocabulary, the target word may be overlooked.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given the target demographic (economically weaker sections, Hindi-medium background), "breeze" is an academic word that may not be part of their active daily English vocabulary. While they may understand the concept in Hindi (हल्की हवा), finding the specific English term "breeze" without cues is a significant hurdle.
