Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a language arts (English) question, not a mathematical one. However, the cognitive skills required include logical reasoning, cause-and-effect analysis, and the ability to justify a subjective stance based on a provided text (Three Questions by Leo Tolstoy).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
1. Literal vs. Inferential: Students often think a "reason" must be a direct quote from the text rather than an original thought. This leads to incorrect or nonsensical answers.
2. Binary thinking: Students may believe there is only one "right" answer and struggle to provide a personal justification.
3. Language Barrier: Hindi-medium students often confuse "why" (reason) with "what" (description), leading to answers that describe the questions rather than explaining their importance.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
The context (a King wanting to be successful) is a familiar trope in Indian parables and moral stories. The rubric is very generous ("Any valid reason"), allowing for a wide range of acceptable responses.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
The open-ended format is very difficult for students with limited English proficiency. Constructing a complete sentence in English to "give a reason" requires syntax and vocabulary skills that many students from economically weaker sections in Grade 7 (ESL/FL learners) have not yet mastered. The abstract nature of "importance in real life" is harder than a simple recall question.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically, estimate what proportion of students at this grade level would produce the fully correct answer.
While the logic is simple, the requirement to produce a written reason in English is a significant barrier for this specific demographic.
