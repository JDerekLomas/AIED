Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a language arts (English) item, not a mathematics item. However, the cognitive skills involved include vocabulary recall, understanding the linguistic concept of "antonyms" (binary opposites), and translating conceptual knowledge into written English.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- Confusion between synonyms and antonyms: A student might provide a word with a similar meaning (e.g., "old"). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Vocabulary gap: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may know the concept in Hindi (प्राचीन vs. आधुनिक) but may not have the English word "ancient" or "modern" in their active English vocabulary.
- Phonetic spelling: A student might know the word "modern" but misspell it significantly, potentially losing marks depending on the strictness of the rubric.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
- "Ancient" is a common keyword in Grade 6 and 7 History (Social Studies) textbooks.
- The word "opposite" is provided as a prompt to clarify the term "antonym."
- The rubric allows for multiple correct answers ("modern" or "new").

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
- Open-ended format: There are no options to choose from (unlike a multiple-choice question), requiring active recall rather than recognition.
- Language barrier: For students from economically weaker sections with limited English exposure, "ancient" is an academic word rather than a conversational one.
- Writing requirement: The student must be able to spell the target word correctly.

Step 5: Estimate the proportion of students who would produce the fully correct answer.
While "ancient" is a standard textbook word, the combination of an open-ended format and the limited English proficiency of the specific demographic (Hindi-medium/EWS) suggests that a significant portion of students will either leave it blank, provide a synonym (old), or struggle to retrieve the specific English word "modern."
