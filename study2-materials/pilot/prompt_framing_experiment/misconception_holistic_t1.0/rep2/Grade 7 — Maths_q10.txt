**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   Understanding of the geometric property of perimeter (sum of all sides).
*   Knowledge of the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: $P = 2(l + w)$.
*   Algebraic manipulation to solve for an unknown variable (width).
*   Knowledge of the formula for area: $A = l \times w$.
*   Multi-step execution: Finding the width first is a prerequisite for finding the area.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Confusing Area and Perimeter:** Students might multiply $32 \times 10$ or add all given numbers. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Formula Misapplication:** Adding only two sides ($10 + w = 32$) instead of four. This would result in $w = 22$, which is incorrect.
*   **Linear vs. Square Units:** Using cm instead of $\text{cm}^2$ for area (though often overlooked in a 1-point rubric if the numerical value is correct).
*   **Incomplete process:** Finding the width ($6$ cm) but forgetting to calculate the area. The rubric suggests the final goal is width, but the question asks for both.

**Step 3: Factors making the item easier**
*   **Simple Numbers:** $32$ and $10$ are friendly, even numbers that are easy to divide and subtract.
*   **Standard Context:** Perimeter and area of rectangles are "drill and practice" staples in Indian Grade 6 and 7 curricula.
*   **Hindi-English Cognates:** The terms "Perimeter" (Parimap) and "Area" (Kshetrafal) are heavily emphasized in bilingual classrooms.

**Step 4: Factors making the item harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the English phrasing "its width and the area" requires decoding two separate tasks.
*   **Multi-step solving:** This is not a direct "plug and play" question. It requires backward reasoning (Perimeter $\to$ Width $\to$ Area).
*   **Rubric Rigidity:** The rubric requires the equation $2 \times (10 + w) = 32$. Many students use an informal arithmetic approach $(32 - 20) / 2$, which might be marked wrong if the teacher follows the "setting up equation" rubric strictly.
*   **No Multiple Choice:** There are no cues to help students self-correct if their calculated width seems unrealistic.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
Given the dual requirement (finding width AND area) and the common tendency for students in this demographic to struggle with multi-step word problems in English, many will find the width but stop there, or make an arithmetic error in the algebraic setup.
