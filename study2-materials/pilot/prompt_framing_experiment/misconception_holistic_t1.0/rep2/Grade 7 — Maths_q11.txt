Step 1: Skills include data interpretation, choosing a numerical scale (ratio/proportion), spatial reasoning for bar construction, and identifying extremes (maximum/minimum).
Step 2: Common misconceptions include inconsistent scaling (changing the value of grid units halfway up the axis), starting the axis at a number other than zero without a break, and confusing the X and Y axes. Inconsistent scaling is the most likely error to lead to a loss of points based on the rubric.
Step 3: Ease factors include a highly familiar context (school classes), simple vocabulary, and the fact that "maximum/minimum" are standard terms frequently practiced in Grade 6 and 7 NCERT curricula.
Step 4: Difficulty factors include the English language barrier for Hindi-medium students, the manual precision required to draw bars, and the cognitive load of "choosing an appropriate scale" (which is more difficult than using a provided one). The rubric is also quite strict, awarding 1 mark for the entire construction of part (a).
Step 5: While the concept is foundational, the requirement to construct a graph from scratch with a self-selected scale, combined with the language barrier and the binary rubric (all or nothing for the graph), typically results in a moderate success rate in government school settings.
