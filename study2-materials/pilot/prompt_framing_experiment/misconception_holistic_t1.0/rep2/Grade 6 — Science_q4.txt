Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Science item, the underlying cognitive skills involve identifying a causal relationship (Property → Function) and communicating a scientific explanation. There are no numerical calculations required.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Misconception 1: "Cotton creates coldness."** Students might think the fabric itself has a temperature-lowering property rather than acting as a medium for sweat evaporation. This could lead to a vague, incorrect answer like "Cotton is cold."
*   **Misconception 2: "Thickness is the only factor."** Students might believe cotton is chosen only because it is "thin," missing the specific material property of absorption/breathability.
*   **Misconception 3: Confusion between "absorbing" and "attracting."** Students might use colloquial language that doesn't meet the rubric's requirement for a "property."

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **High Contextual Familiarity:** In India, the heat is intense and wearing cotton is a culturally universal practice. Students have direct lived experience with this.
*   **Single-Point Rubric:** The rubric is generous, requiring only one property to be named.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, expressing "porous" or "absorbent" in English is a significant hurdle. They may know the answer in Hindi but struggle to find the technical English vocabulary.
*   **Open-ended Format:** There are no cues or options to trigger memory; the student must recall and articulate the property independently.
*   **Scientific Literacy vs. Common Sense:** Students might provide a "common sense" answer (e.g., "it feels good") which fails to identify a specific scientific "property" as requested.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the strong cultural relevance of the topic in India, many students will understand the concept, but the transition to English-medium terminology and the requirement to name a specific "property" will create a bottleneck for those from economically weaker sections with limited English support.
