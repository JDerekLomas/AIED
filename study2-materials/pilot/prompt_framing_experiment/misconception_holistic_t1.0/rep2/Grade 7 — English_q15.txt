Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
There are no mathematical concepts involved. This is a literacy task requiring sentence construction, vocabulary retrieval, and functional grammar (present tense) in English.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
*   Misconception: A "paragraph" is just a list of words. (Would lead to an incorrect answer/0 marks).
*   Misconception: Subject-Verb Agreement (e.g., "I likes"). (Minor errors might be ignored, but if it prevents "clear mention," it leads to an incorrect answer).
*   Misconception: Confusing "when" (time) with "where" (place). (Would lead to an incorrect answer based on rubric requirements).

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
*   Familiar Context: "My Favourite Hobby" is a standard, rote-learned essay topic in Indian primary schools.
*   Simple Prompts: The sub-questions (what, when, why) provide a clear scaffold.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
*   Language Barrier: For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English proficiency, translating thoughts into grammatically correct English sentences is a high-order task.
*   Open-ended format: No word bank or sentence starters are provided.
*   Binary Rubric: The rubric requires all three components (what, when, why) for a single point; partial credit is not mentioned, making the "1" harder to achieve than a "0.5".

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically:
While the topic is very common, the combination of low English proficiency in economically weaker sections and the requirement to satisfy three specific criteria in a foreign language without prompts makes this difficult for a Grade 7 student in this specific demographic to get "fully correct" according to a strict rubric.
