Step 1: The item, while labeled "English," requires structural linguistic analysis: identifying a noun modifier and distinguishing between a single adjective and an "adjective phrase."

Step 2:
- **Misconception: A "phrase" must be multiple words.** Students often believe a phrase cannot be a single word. This would lead to an incorrect answer as students might search for a longer string like "in our balcony" (an adverbial phrase) instead of "tiny."
- **Misconception: Over-extension of "adjective."** Students may identify any descriptive word but fail to recognize the "phrase" boundary.
- **Rubric Error:** The rubric asks for an "adjective phrase" but accepts "tiny" (a single adjective). This creates a mismatch between formal grammar instruction and the test's expectations.

Step 3:
- Familiar vocabulary ("bird," "nest," "balcony").
- The word "tiny" is a prototypical adjective often taught early in ESL/Hindi-medium curriculum.
- Sentence structure is a simple Subject-Verb-Object-Adverbial.

Step 4:
- **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the term "Adjective Phrase" (विशेषण वाक्यांश) is much more complex than the word "Adjective" (विशेषण).
- **Format:** Open-ended identification requires productive knowledge rather than recognition.
- **Syntactic confusion:** Students often confuse prepositional phrases ("in our balcony") with adjective phrases because both provide extra detail.

Step 5: Given the discrepancy between the question (asking for a *phrase*) and the rubric (accepting a single *adjective*), and considering the linguistic shift from Hindi to English grammar terminology, many students will likely guess "tiny" but many will also select "in our balcony" due to the word "phrase."
