Step 1: Concepts and skills required include understanding the definition of an angle, aligning the protractor's baseline and center point (vertex) correctly, and reading the correct scale (inner vs. outer) based on the direction of the ray.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- **Using the wrong scale:** Students often read 70° instead of 110° because they use the outer scale instead of the inner (or vice versa). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- **Misalignment:** Not placing the vertex at the center crosshair or the baseline on the zero-line. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- **Angle orientation:** Believing angles must always open to the right. While they might get the measure right, they may struggle if the ray is oriented differently.
- **Size of arms:** Thinking longer arms mean a larger angle. (Unlikely to affect the drawing itself, but affects conceptual understanding).

Step 3: Ease factors:
- The task is a direct procedural application of a tool (protractor) which is a standard part of the Grade 6 geometry toolkit.
- The numbers (40° and 110°) are multiples of 10, making them easy to locate on any standard protractor.
- This is a highly practiced skill in Indian state curricula.

Step 4: Hardness factors:
- **Language barrier:** While "Draw" and "Angle" are common, students with limited English may rely on visual cues; however, these terms are usually taught early in Hindi-medium schools as well.
- **The 110° angle (Obtuse):** This is significantly harder than the 40° angle because it requires passing the 90° mark, where scale confusion (reading 70°) is most common.
- **Tool access:** Students from economically weaker sections may have low-quality geometry boxes where markings are faded or the protractor is chipped, leading to precision errors.

Step 5: Holistically, while the 40° angle is straightforward, the 110° angle is a classic "trap" for students who do not yet understand the difference between acute and obtuse scales. In a government school context with English-language testing, a significant portion will fall into the scale-reading error.
