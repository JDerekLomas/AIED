Step 1: Identify the concepts and skills required.
*   Recall of specific biological terminology (Lactobacillus).
*   Classification of microorganisms into categories (Bacteria, Fungi, Protozoa, Algae, Virus).
*   Connecting a domestic process (curd making) to scientific nomenclature.
*   English language proficiency to write a multi-syllabic scientific name.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   "All bacteria are harmful/cause disease": Students might incorrectly categorize it as a "Virus" or "Fungi" because they view bacteria as "bad." (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   Confusing the name of the process (fermentation) with the name of the organism. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   Misidentifying the organism as "yeast" due to its common use in kitchens. (Leads to incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   Highly familiar context: Curd (dahi) is a staple in Indian households, including economically weaker sections.
*   High emphasis: This specific example is a "textbook classic" heavily emphasized in the NCERT Class 8 curriculum and frequently appears in previous years' papers.
*   Rote memorization: The name "Lactobacillus" is often learned as a single unit through repetition.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Open-ended format: No options provided to trigger memory; requires active recall and correct spelling.
*   English proficiency: For Hindi-medium students, spelling "Lactobacillus" is a significant hurdle; a slight misspelling might be penalized depending on the examiner's strictness.
*   Two-part question: Requires both the name and the category (Bacteria), though the rubric only explicitly mentions the name.
*   Low mark value: 0.5 marks may lead students to provide a brief, potentially incomplete answer.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
The item is a standard "recall" question. While the spelling of "Lactobacillus" is difficult for English Language Learners, the concept is one of the most rehearsed facts in the Grade 8 Science syllabus across Indian government schools. Most students will recognize the name, even if they struggle with the English spelling.
