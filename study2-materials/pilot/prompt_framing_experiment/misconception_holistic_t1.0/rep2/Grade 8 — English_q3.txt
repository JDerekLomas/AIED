Step 1: This is an English Language Arts (Reading Comprehension) item, not a mathematics item. The skills required include literal comprehension of a text, inferring character motivation, and expressive writing in English to convey abstract concepts like "thoughts and feelings."

Step 2: Common misconceptions/errors in this context include:
- Literalism: Thinking "drawing" only means the physical act of using a pencil, rather than a metaphor for expression.
- Linguistic Transfer: Attempting to translate a complex thought from Hindi to English but losing the nuances required by the rubric (e.g., "She like drawing" vs. "It was her way of expressing feelings").
- Hobby vs. Passion: Not recognizing the distinction between a casual activity and a core identity/emotional outlet.
Given the rubric requires two distinct ideas (more than a hobby + expression of feelings), simple literal answers would lead to an incorrect (0-score) result.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The context of "drawing" is universally familiar to students. If the source text used these exact phrases ("more than a hobby," "expressing thoughts"), students with high rote-memorization skills might recall the sentence.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: 
- Open-ended format: No options to choose from; requires sentence construction.
- Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students with limited English, "expressing thoughts and feelings" is linguistically complex to produce accurately.
- Rubric Rigidity: The rubric requires two distinct conceptual layers for a single mark, leaving no room for partial credit for simpler answers.

Step 5: For students from economically weaker sections in Hindi-medium backgrounds, producing a multi-clause English sentence that captures abstract emotional states is a high-level task for Grade 8.
