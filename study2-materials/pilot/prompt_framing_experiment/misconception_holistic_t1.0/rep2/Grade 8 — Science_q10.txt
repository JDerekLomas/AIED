Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a science question, it requires students to understand several mathematical and quantitative concepts:
*   **Sequential Logic:** Understanding a two-step process (heating then cooling).
*   **Measurement and Units:** Understanding temperature (Celsius) and time (seconds).
*   **Rates of Change:** The concept of "quick" cooling versus gradual cooling.
*   **Proportional Reasoning:** The inverse relationship between high heat and short duration (implicit in the process).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Boiling vs. Pasteurization:** Many students believe milk must be boiled (100°C) to be safe. *This could lead to an incorrect description if they emphasize boiling over the specific two-step process.*
*   **Cooling is Passive:** Students often forget the "sudden" or "rapid" cooling aspect, thinking milk can just sit out to cool. *The rubric requires "cooled quickly," so this would lead to a loss of marks.*
*   **Single-Step thinking:** Viewing preservation as just "heating." *This would lead to an incomplete answer.*

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** Milk is a staple in Indian households; students likely see it being boiled daily.
*   **Lenient Rubric:** The rubric does not require specific numbers (70°C or 15-30 seconds), which significantly lowers the barrier for students with weak English or poor memorization of constants.
*   **Keyword Association:** "Pasteurization" is a distinct term (Louis Pasteur) that is usually a high-focus vocabulary word in Chapter 2 (Microorganisms) of the NCERT textbook.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** Describing a process in English is significantly harder for Hindi-medium students than selecting a multiple-choice option. They may know the concept but struggle with "heating," "cooling," and "sudden."
*   **Open-ended Format:** There are no cues or prompts to remind them of the "cooling" step.
*   **Two-part Question:** They must describe the process *and* explain the "why" (killing microbes), though the rubric curiously focuses only on the description.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the leniency of the rubric (no numbers required) and the fact that this is a "rote" definition frequently practiced in Indian classrooms, many students will recall the basic "heat and cool" sequence. However, the requirement to write a descriptive sentence in English will be a significant barrier for this specific demographic.
