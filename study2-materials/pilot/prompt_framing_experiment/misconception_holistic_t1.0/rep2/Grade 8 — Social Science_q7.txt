Step 1: As this is a Social Science (History) question, it requires identifying cause-and-effect relationships, chronological reasoning, and understanding political concepts like "sovereignty" and "puppet ruler." No mathematical concepts are directly required, though temporal sequencing is involved.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Confusing the Battle of Plassey (1757) with the Battle of Buxar (1764). (Could lead to an incorrect answer if they credit the Diwani rights to Plassey).
- Believing the British took direct administrative control immediately rather than through a proxy ruler. (May result in a partially correct but imprecise answer).
- Viewing the battle as a conflict between two nations rather than a private company and a provincial ruler.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The Battle of Plassey is a "landmark" event heavily emphasized in Indian NCERT textbooks. "Mir Jafar" and "1757" are high-frequency keywords that students are trained to memorize.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students with limited English, "contribute to the expansion" is complex academic phrasing. They may understand the history but struggle to articulate the "how" in English.
- Open-ended format: Requires generating a sentence rather than selecting a name or date.
- Concept of "Political Dominance": Economically disadvantaged students with limited exposure to political discourse may find the abstract shift from trade to governance difficult to explain.

Step 5: While the topic is central to the curriculum, the requirement to explain a political process in English—compounded by the linguistic background of the students—creates a significant barrier for a full-mark response.
