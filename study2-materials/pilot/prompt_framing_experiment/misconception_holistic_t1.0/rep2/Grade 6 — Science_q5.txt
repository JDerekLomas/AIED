Step 1: Identify the scientific concepts and skills required.
Students must recall a specific laboratory procedure (iodine test for starch) and identify a change in physical state (color change). They must be able to communicate this procedure and its result in written English.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   Misidentifying the reagent: Students might confuse iodine with other chemicals (like Benedict’s solution or caustic soda). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   Misunderstanding the color change: Students often remember "it changes color" but might forget the specific "blue-black" result, or confuse it with the "red/orange" of a sugar test.
*   Confusing the food source: Students might think the test only works on potatoes, not realizing it's a general test for starch. On this specific item, this doesn't hurt as the item specifies a potato.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   Familiar context: Potatoes are a staple in Indian households, making the specimen relatable.
*   Standard experiment: This is a core "demonstration" experiment in the Class 6 NCERT Science syllabus, often performed or shown in classrooms.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, describing a "procedure" and "observation" in English is significantly more difficult than a multiple-choice question.
*   Open-ended format: No cues or options are provided to trigger memory; it requires pure retrieval.
*   Precise terminology: Writing "iodine" and "blue-black" requires specific vocabulary that students with limited English proficiency may struggle to spell or recall under pressure.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
While the experiment is fundamental, the requirement to *describe* the process in English, combined with the socioeconomic and linguistic barriers, will likely result in many students providing incomplete answers (e.g., omitting the color change or the name of the chemical).
