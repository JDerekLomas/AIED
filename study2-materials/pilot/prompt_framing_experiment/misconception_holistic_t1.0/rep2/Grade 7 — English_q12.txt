Step 1: Identify the linguistic concepts and skills required.
- Understanding of subject-verb-object (SVO) structure.
- Identification of the tense (Simple Past: "blew").
- Knowledge of the past participle form of the irregular verb "blow" (blown).
- Applying the passive voice formula: Object + auxiliary verb (be) + past participle + by + Subject.

Step 2: Common misconceptions/errors.
- Tense mismatch: Using "are blown" or "have been blown" instead of "were blown." (Incorrect)
- Incorrect past participle: Using "blowed" or "blew" instead of "blown." (Incorrect)
- Subject-Verb Agreement: Using "was" instead of "were" with the plural "leaves." (Incorrect)
- Direct translation from Hindi: Hindi passive structures differ significantly, often leading to missing "by" or incorrect auxiliary placement. (Incorrect)

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
- The vocabulary ("wind," "leaves," "blew") is foundational and likely familiar.
- The sentence is short and follows a standard SVO pattern without complex clauses.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Irregular verb: "Blow-blew-blown" is harder than regular "-ed" verbs.
- Plurality: Students often miss the "s" in "leaves" and use the singular "was."
- Open-ended format: No options (MCQs) to trigger recognition; requires pure recall and production.
- Language barrier: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the specific English auxiliary verb "to be" in passive constructions.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given the combination of an irregular verb, plural subject-verb agreement, and the requirement for precise English syntax among students with limited English proficiency, this item will be challenging.
