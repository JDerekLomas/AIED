Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   Understanding multiplicative relationships ("thrice").
*   Basic multiplication (12 × 3).
*   Understanding the property of age differences (the difference between two people's ages remains constant over time).
*   Multi-step problem solving: Finding the father's current age, then either finding the difference now or calculating both future ages and subtracting.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Additive vs. Multiplicative increase:** Students might believe the age difference changes over time (e.g., adding 5 to the current age difference). This would lead to an incorrect answer if they calculate (36+5) - (12+5) incorrectly, but usually, this misconception leads to a correct answer via a longer route.
*   **"Thrice" interpretation:** Some students might add 3 instead of multiplying by 3. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Focusing on the final number:** Students might see "5 years" and "thrice" and try to add 5 to 36, providing "41" as the answer.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Simple Numbers:** 12 and 3 are very easy to work with.
*   **Familiar Context:** Age problems are a staple of Indian mathematics curriculum (NCERT) starting from Grade 6.
*   **The "Constant Difference" shortcut:** High-performing students will know the difference doesn't change, simplifying the calculation to 36 - 12.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the word "thrice" is often less familiar than "3 times" or "three times." 
*   **Multi-step nature:** It requires two distinct logical steps.
*   **Distractor "5 years":** The inclusion of "after 5 years" acts as a cognitive distractor. Many students will feel compelled to use the number 5 in a calculation (e.g., 36 + 5 = 41 or 24 + 5 = 29) even if it's not logically required for the difference.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
While the math is simple, the combination of "thrice" (a vocabulary hurdle) and the "after 5 years" distractor typically trips up about half of the students in this specific demographic, who often struggle with word-problem comprehension in English.
