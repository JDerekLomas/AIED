### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Knowledge of multiples:** Understanding that a multiple is a product of a given number and an integer.
*   **Prime Factorization or Division Method:** Ability to systematically break down numbers into primes or use the ladder (synthetic division) method.
*   **Divisibility Rules:** Recognizing that 12, 15, and 20 have specific divisors (2, 3, 5).
*   **Synthesis:** Combining the factors correctly (e.g., taking the highest power of each prime factor) to find the least common value.

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Confusion with HCF (Highest Common Factor):** Students often confuse the two. If they find the HCF of 12, 15, and 20, they would get 1. **(Leads to incorrect answer)**.
*   **Adding the numbers:** Some students at lower proficiency levels might simply sum the numbers. **(Leads to incorrect answer)**.
*   **Incomplete Prime Factorization:** Forgetting to include a factor or miscalculating the product of the primes. **(Leads to incorrect answer)**.
*   **Multiplying all numbers:** Thinking the LCM is simply $12 \times 15 \times 20 = 3600$. **(Leads to incorrect answer)**.

### Step 3: Factors Making the Item Easier
*   **Simple Numbers:** 12, 15, and 20 are "benchmark" numbers often used in textbook examples.
*   **Familiar Terminology:** "LCM" is a standard term used even in Hindi-medium schools (often referred to as "Lasa" or "Laghuttam Samapavartya," but the acronym LCM is widely taught).
*   **Low Linguistic Load:** The question is direct and contains no "word problem" traps, which favors students with limited English proficiency.

### Step 4: Factors Making the Item Harder
*   **Constructed Response:** Without multiple-choice options, students cannot "work backward" from the answers or guess.
*   **Three Numbers:** Finding the LCM of three numbers is significantly more prone to calculation error than finding the LCM of two numbers.
*   **Procedural Precision:** One error in the division ladder (e.g., $15 \div 2$) can derail the entire calculation.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the numbers are small and the concept is a core part of the Grade 6 curriculum in India (NCERT/State Boards), the lack of multiple-choice options and the potential for HCF/LCM confusion among students from economically weaker sections—who may have had disrupted foundational learning—suggests a moderate success rate. However, the "Division Method" is a heavily drilled procedure in these schools.
