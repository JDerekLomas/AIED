Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science (Geography) item, it requires cognitive categorization and the ability to identify independent variables in a natural process. Linguistically, it requires retrieving specific scientific terminology from memory.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Weathering vs. Formation:** Students often confuse the *process* (weathering) with the *factors* (climate, parent rock). However, mentioning weathering might still be marked correct by some lenient evaluators, though it's technically a process.
*   **Human Action:** Students may believe humans "make" soil (like making cement), leading them to answer "farming" or "digging." This would result in an incorrect answer.
*   **Water as a single factor:** Students often think only of water/rain, which is a component of climate. This would likely lead to a correct answer ("Rainfall").

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Direct Curriculum Link:** This is a fundamental "definition-style" question found in NCERT textbooks (Grade 8, Geography, Chapter 2).
*   **Low Linguistic Barrier:** The question is short. Key terms like "soil" and "factor" are basic vocabulary.
*   **Multiple Correct Pathways:** The rubric accepts five different answers, increasing the probability of recall.
*   **Familiar Context:** Students from rural or economically weaker backgrounds often have high exposure to soil, agriculture, and land, making the topic concrete.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Recall vs. Recognition:** The open-ended format is harder than a multiple-choice question for students with limited English fluency, as they must produce the word rather than just recognize it.
*   **Abstract Terminology:** Terms like "Parent Rock" or "Topography" are difficult for Hindi-medium students to translate or recall in English.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given that this is a core topic taught early in the year and the rubric is quite broad (accepting "Time" or "Climate"), most students will be able to provide at least one word. The primary barrier is English vocabulary, but "Time" or "Rain" are accessible.
