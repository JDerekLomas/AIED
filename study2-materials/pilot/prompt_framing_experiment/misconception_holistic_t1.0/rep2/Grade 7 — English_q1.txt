Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a reading comprehension task for an English language class, not a mathematics item. The cognitive skills required are literal retrieval of information from a text, summarization, and sentence construction.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
In a linguistic context, common misconceptions/errors include:
- Confusion between "what," "who," and "when" (interrogative pronouns).
- Difficulty differentiating between the king's *desire* for answers and the *answers* themselves.
- Inability to synthesize three distinct points into one coherent response.
These would lead to an incorrect answer if the student provides the answers given by the hermit rather than the questions asked by the king.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- The story "Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy is a standard, foundational text in the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum (Chapter 1).
- The context of a king seeking wisdom is a familiar trope in Indian folklore.
- The information is explicitly stated in the opening paragraph of the text.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- English Proficiency: Hindi-medium students may struggle to translate the specific phrasing ("the right people to work with") into English.
- Open-ended format: No options are provided to trigger recognition; it requires pure recall and production.
- Writing Burden: A full-score answer requires writing a complex sentence, which is difficult for students with limited English vocabulary.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically, estimate what proportion of students would produce the fully correct answer.
While the story is very familiar, the language barrier for economically weaker students in Hindi-medium transitions often results in "fragmented" answers. Many will list one or two questions but fail to accurately capture all three with correct grammar as required by the rubric.
