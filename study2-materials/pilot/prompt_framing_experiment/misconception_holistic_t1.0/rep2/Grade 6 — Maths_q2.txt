Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   Understanding of the base-10 positional numeral system.
*   Distinguishing between "face value" (the digit itself) and "place value" (the value it represents based on its position).
*   Knowledge of standard place names (Units/Ones, Tens, Hundreds, Thousands).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold.
*   **Face Value vs. Place Value:** Confusing the two. If a student thinks "5" is the answer, they fail (Specific to this item: Yes).
*   **Column Counting from Left to Right:** Students may count from the left instead of the right (Thousands, Hundreds, Tens, Units). In 7560, the '5' is second from the left and third from the right. Miscounting could lead to "Tens" (Incorrect).
*   **Zero as a placeholder:** Some students struggle with numbers containing zero, though here it is at the end, which is generally easier than an internal zero.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiarity:** Place value is a core topic introduced as early as Grade 2 and 3 in the Indian curriculum.
*   **Simple Numbers:** A 4-digit number is well within the expected range for Grade 6 (who work with lakhs and crores).
*   **Direct Question:** There is no "word problem" or complex English framing to confuse students with limited English proficiency.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without multiple-choice options, students must recall the term or calculate the value without cues.
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may know the concept as "Sthaniya Maan" (स्थानीय मान) but might struggle if they don't recognize the English term "Place Value."

Step 5: Holistically estimate the proportion of correct answers.
While the concept is foundational, the transition from Hindi terminology to English, combined with the common confusion between face value and place value, typically results in a moderate success rate in government school settings.
