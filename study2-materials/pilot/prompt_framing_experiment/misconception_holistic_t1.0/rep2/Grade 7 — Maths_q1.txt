Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
The item requires knowledge of integer multiplication and the specific sign convention for multiplying two negative numbers (negative × negative = positive). It also requires basic multiplication of small single-digit integers.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Addition vs. Multiplication Rules:** Students often confuse the rule for adding integers (where -3 + -4 = -7) with the rule for multiplication. This would lead to an incorrect answer of -7 or -12.
*   **Sign Dominance:** A common misconception is that if there are negative signs in the problem, the answer must remain negative. This would lead to the incorrect answer of -12.
*   **Absolute Value Focus:** Some students ignore signs entirely, focusing only on the numbers. While this leads to the correct magnitude (12), it is often a result of luck rather than understanding if the student doesn't consciously apply the sign rule.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Simple Numbers:** The use of 3 and 4 involves basic multiplication tables that most 7th graders have mastered.
*   **Standard Notation:** The use of parentheses is the standard way students are taught to denote negative numbers in multiplication.
*   **No Language Barrier:** The question is purely numerical ("Find the value of"), minimizing the impact of limited English proficiency for Hindi-medium students.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no multiple-choice options to provide a "hint" or allow for elimination.
*   **Abstract nature:** Integer multiplication is an abstract concept with fewer intuitive real-world analogues than addition, making it a "pure memory" task for many students in under-resourced schools.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the arithmetic is simple, the confusion between addition and multiplication rules for negative signs is one of the most persistent hurdles in Grade 7. In economically weaker sections where remedial support may be limited, "sign errors" are the primary cause of marks lost in algebra and integers. However, because the numbers are very small and the operation is a direct application of a heavily drilled rule, a significant portion of the class will likely get it right.
