Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a vocabulary question assessing semantic knowledge (synonyms and antonyms) rather than mathematical concepts.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- **Concept Confusion:** Students often swap the definitions of "synonym" (same) and "antonym" (opposite). This would lead to an incorrect answer if both are required for a single mark.
- **Contextual Misunderstanding:** Students may provide a word that is related but not a direct synonym (e.g., "shhh" for silent).
- **Spelling Errors:** While the rubric focuses on the synonym, Hindi-medium students often struggle with English spelling (e.g., "quite" vs. "quiet"), which may lead to incorrect word associations.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- **High-frequency word:** "Quiet" is a very common word in classroom settings ("Keep quiet").
- **Simple concept:** The idea of "silent" or "noisy" is basic and introduced early in language learning.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- **Two-part requirement:** The student must provide *both* a synonym and an antonym to receive the point (as implied by the "1" and "2" structure under the question).
- **Linguistic barrier:** For Hindi-medium students from economically weaker sections, active recall (producing a word) is significantly harder than recognition (multiple choice).
- **Homophone confusion:** The words "quiet," "quite," and "quit" are frequently confused by English Language Learners.
- **Hindi-to-English translation:** Students may know the concept in Hindi (शान्त/shant) but struggle to retrieve the specific English terms "silent" or "noisy."

Step 5: Estimate the proportion of students.
While the word "quiet" is familiar, the requirement to correctly identify and spell both a synonym and an antonym in an open-ended format is a significant hurdle for students with limited English proficiency.
