Step 1: Identify the linguistic and grammatical concepts and skills required.
*   Distinguishing between a single verb and a verb phrase.
*   Identifying the auxiliary verb (are) and the main verb (playing).
*   Understanding the present continuous tense structure (Subject + is/am/are + V-ing).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions/errors students at this grade level hold.
*   **Verb = Action only:** Students might only circle "playing" because "are" does not represent a physical action. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Whole Predicate:** Students may identify "are playing football" as the verb phrase, confusing the phrase with the entire predicate. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Subject-Verb Confusion:** Students might include the noun "children" if they perceive the whole "action part" of the sentence as the answer. (Leads to incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier:
*   **Familiar Context:** "Children playing football" is an extremely common, high-frequency sentence used in English as a Second Language (ESL) textbooks in India.
*   **Standard Structure:** The sentence follows a very basic S-V-O pattern.
*   **Transliteration:** Even for Hindi-medium students, "playing" is a widely recognized English loanword.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   **Limited English Proficiency:** For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the term "verb phrase" is technical and often taught as "kriya" (verb), which usually focuses on the root action rather than auxiliary combinations.
*   **No Multiple Choice:** There are no options to prompt the student; they must identify the specific start and end of the phrase.
*   **Auxiliary Recognition:** Many students at this level view "are" as a connector or "help-word" rather than part of the verb itself.

Step 5: Holistic estimate:
Given the specific demographic (economically weaker sections, Hindi-medium background), while the sentence is simple, the technical terminology "verb phrase" is a significant barrier. Most students will likely identify only "playing" or the entire "are playing football."
