Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is an English language item, the underlying logic requires structural sequencing and relational mapping. However, strictly speaking, there are no mathematical concepts (like arithmetic or geometry) required to solve this item.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- Misunderstanding "Message" as a long letter: This might lead to time management issues, but the rubric is lenient (only requires expression of two points).
- Confusion between "Miss" and "Near/Search": In Hindi, the concept of "missing someone" is often expressed as "remembering" (*yaad aana*). A student might translate literally ("I am remembering you"), which technically fulfills the rubric.
- Grammar vs. Communication: Students often believe perfect grammar is required for a point, leading to "blank page syndrome" due to fear of error.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
- Familiar Context: The relationship with a grandmother is culturally central and emotionally resonant for students in this demographic.
- Simple Vocabulary: Words like "Miss," "Come," "Grandmother," and "Visit" are high-frequency sight words in the Grade 7 curriculum.
- Lenient Rubric: The rubric does not penalize for spelling or grammatical errors, only for the presence of the two specific sentiments.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
- Language Barrier: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle to transition from thinking in Hindi to writing in English.
- Open-ended Format: Without a template or "fill-in-the-blanks," students must generate the sentence structure entirely on their own.
- English Proficiency: For economically weaker sections with limited exposure, constructing a coherent sentence in a second language remains a significant hurdle.

Step 5: Estimate the proportion of correct answers.
Given the simple requirements of the rubric (only needing to convey two ideas) and the familiar emotional context, many students will be able to produce broken but "clear" English that satisfies the 1-point criteria.
