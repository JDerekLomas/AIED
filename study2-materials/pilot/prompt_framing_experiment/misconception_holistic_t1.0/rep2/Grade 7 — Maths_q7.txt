**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   Understanding the linguistic-mathematical bridge: knowing that "of" represents multiplication in the context of fractions.
*   Fraction multiplication: Multiplying numerators and denominators $(\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd})$.
*   Fraction comparison: Comparing two fractions with unlike denominators $(\frac{3}{8}$ vs $\frac{4}{15})$ by finding a common denominator or cross-multiplication.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Additive Misconception:** Adding fractions instead of multiplying (e.g., $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{5}{4}$). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Denominator size confusion:** Believing $\frac{3}{8}$ is smaller than $\frac{4}{15}$ because 15 is a larger number than 8. This leads to an incorrect final comparison.
*   **Gap Thinking:** Thinking $\frac{3}{8}$ is "5 away" from a whole and $\frac{4}{15}$ is "11 away," leading to incorrect logic.
*   **Whole Number Bias:** Multiplying the numbers but failing to treat them as parts of a whole.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   The numbers used are single digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 15), which simplifies the arithmetic.
*   The "of" construction is a standard part of the NCERT Class 7 curriculum, frequently practiced in the "Fractions and Decimals" chapter.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, "of" (का) is a specific keyword. If their English instruction is weak, they may struggle to translate the operation.
*   **Multi-step Process:** Students must perform two multiplications and then a comparison. If they stop after the first step, they fail the rubric.
*   **Non-trivial Comparison:** $\frac{3}{8}$ (0.375) and $\frac{4}{15}$ (approx 0.266) are relatively close, requiring a formal method (LCM or cross-multiplication) rather than simple intuition.
*   **Open-ended Format:** No options to guide the student's thinking process.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
While the multiplication is straightforward, the second step (comparison) is where many Grade 7 students in this demographic stumble. Students often calculate the products but fail to use a common denominator to compare them correctly, or they confuse "of" with addition. Given the specific challenges of English proficiency and the multi-step nature of the rubric, the success rate is likely below the halfway mark.
