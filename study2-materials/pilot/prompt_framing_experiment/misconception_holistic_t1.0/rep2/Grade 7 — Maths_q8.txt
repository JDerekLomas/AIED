**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Unitary Method:** Understanding how to find the value of one unit (1 liter) before calculating the value for multiple units (12 liters).
*   **Division and Multiplication:** Performing $55 \div 5$ and then $11 \times 12$ accurately.
*   **Concept of Rate/Mileage:** Understanding "mileage" as distance per unit of fuel (km/L).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Additive vs. Multiplicative Reasoning:** Students might try to find a difference (e.g., $12 - 5 = 7$) and add that to the distance ($55 + 7 = 62$). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Incorrect Operation Placement:** Some may multiply $55 \times 5$ or divide $12 \div 55$. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Terminological Confusion:** In Indian contexts, "average" and "mileage" are used interchangeably for $km/L$. However, a student might confuse "average" with the arithmetic mean if they have recently studied statistics.

**Step 3: Factors making the item easier**
*   **Familiar Context:** The "mileage" of a vehicle is a very common topic of discussion in Indian households, even among economically weaker sections.
*   **Friendly Numbers:** The numbers are divisible ($55/5 = 11$) and the multiplication table of 11 or 12 is generally well-memorized by Grade 7.
*   **Direct Variation:** The relationship is linear and direct, which is a standard pattern for this grade.

**Step 4: Factors making the item harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the phrase "How much mileage (average) the car is giving?" might be confusing in English, even if they understand the math.
*   **Multi-part Question:** The question asks for two things: the distance for 12 liters AND the mileage. However, the rubric only rewards the distance calculation. A student might calculate the mileage (11) and stop there, or provide only one of the two requested values.
*   **Open-ended Format:** There are no options to guide the student or allow for "reverse engineering" the answer.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
While the math is relatively simple (Unitary Method is a Grade 6/7 staple), the bilingual transition and the two-part nature of the question (distance vs. mileage) may trip up students. Many will find the unit rate (11) but may make a calculation error in the second step or fail to address both parts of the prompt.
