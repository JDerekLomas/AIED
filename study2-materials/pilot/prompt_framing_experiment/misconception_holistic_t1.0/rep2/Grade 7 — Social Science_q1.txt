Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science question, the underlying mathematical/logical concepts include:
- Chronological sequencing (ordinality).
- Measurement of time intervals (subtraction/duration).
- Understanding scales (timelines).
- Logical categorization (periodization).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- Misconception: Large numbers always mean "more" or "later." In history (specifically BCE/BC), larger numbers are further in the past. (Impact on this item: Low, as specific dates aren't required, only the concept of importance).
- Misconception: History is a collection of random facts rather than a continuous flow. (Impact: High, as students may struggle to explain *why* order matters).
- Misconception: "Dates" only refer to specific days (DD/MM/YYYY) rather than years or eras. (Impact: Moderate, might limit their explanation).

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
- Familiarity: This is typically the very first chapter in the Grade 7 NCERT/State Board history syllabus ("How, When and Where").
- Rote learning: This specific question is a "back-of-the-chapter" standard question. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often memorize this specific answer in English or Hindi.
- Low threshold: The rubric is generous; only one valid reason is needed for full marks.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
- Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students in an English-medium assessment, "Importance" and "Sequence" are difficult academic vocabulary words to produce.
- Open-ended format: No cues or options are provided, requiring active recall and sentence construction.
- Abstract reasoning: Explaining "why" something is important is cognitively more demanding than stating "what" happened.

Step 5: Estimate of correct responses.
Given that this is a fundamental, heavily emphasized introductory concept that is frequently memorized as a "standard" answer, a significant portion of students will provide the correct gist, even with grammatical errors.
