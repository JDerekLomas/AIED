Step 1: The item is a Science question, not a mathematical one. However, it requires cognitive skills such as recall of terminology (protective foods), understanding cause-and-effect (deficiency and disease), and categorization (vitamins vs. minerals).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Confusing the roles of different food groups (e.g., thinking "protective foods" provide energy like carbohydrates). This would lead to an incorrect answer in part (a).
- Swapping a vitamin-deficiency disease with a mineral-deficiency disease (e.g., listing Scurvy as a mineral deficiency). This would lead to an incorrect answer in part (b).
- A general belief that "health" only means "strength" or "energy," ignoring the role of the immune system.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The topic is a core part of the Grade 6 NCERT Science syllabus. "Protective foods" is a standard term used in textbooks. Diseases like Scurvy (Vitamin C) or Anemia (Iron) are commonly drilled through rote learning.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: 
- Language Barrier: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle to explain "why" in English, even if they understand the concept.
- Writing format: It is an open-ended question requiring sentence construction rather than a multiple-choice selection.
- Multi-part: The student must get both (a) and (b) right to satisfy the "1 point" rubric if it is strictly applied.
- Terminology confusion: Distinguishing between a Vitamin and a Mineral is a frequent point of failure for students in this demographic.

Step 5: While the rote-learned names of diseases are usually well-retained, the linguistic requirement to "explain" in part (a) poses a significant barrier for students with limited English proficiency from economically weaker sections.
