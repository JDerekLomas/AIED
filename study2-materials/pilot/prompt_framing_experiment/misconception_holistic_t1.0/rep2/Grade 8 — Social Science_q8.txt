Step 1: This is a Social Science (Civics) item, not a mathematical one. The cognitive skills required involve recall of factual knowledge, understanding of political terminology, and the ability to transcribe technical terms from memory.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Confusing "Fundamental Rights" with "Fundamental Duties" (Would still result in a correct answer if "Rights" is mentioned).
- Confusing the Constitution with the Preamble or specific Laws/Acts (May lead to an incorrect answer if they cite a specific law like "No child labor" instead of the overarching feature).
- Misunderstanding "Secularism" as "no religion" rather than state neutrality (Might still lead to the correct keyword).

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The rubric is extremely lenient (only one feature required).
- "Fundamental Rights" is a high-frequency term taught repeatedly in Indian schools.
- The context is culturally central; national symbols and the Constitution are emphasized in assemblies and textbooks.
- It is a 1-mark recall question, which is the most practiced format in government schools.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- English language barrier: Students may know the concept in Hindi (e.g., *Dharmnirpekshta*) but struggle to spell or recall "Secularism."
- Open-ended format: No options to trigger recognition memory.
- Abstract nature of terms like "Federalism" or "Parliamentary Democracy."

Step 5: Despite language barriers, the leniency of the rubric (needing only one item) and the high emphasis on "Fundamental Rights" in the Grade 8 curriculum suggest a majority of students will be able to provide at least one rote-memorized term.
