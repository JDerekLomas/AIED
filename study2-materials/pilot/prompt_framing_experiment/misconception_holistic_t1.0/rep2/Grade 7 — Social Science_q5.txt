Step 1: The question is from Social Science (Geography/Geology), not Mathematics. The skills required are understanding causal relationships, sequential processes (cycle), and scientific vocabulary related to the lithosphere.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Rocks are permanent and unchanging (leads to incorrect answer).
- Sedimentary rocks are formed only underwater (might lead to incomplete answer).
- Confusion between "weathering" (breaking) and "erosion" (moving) (might still get a mark if they describe "breaking down").
- Thinking heat and pressure are required for *all* rock transformations (leads to incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The concept of the "Rock Cycle" is a core part of the Class 7 NCERT curriculum.
- The rubric is relatively lenient, only requiring the description of breaking down and moving.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds often struggle to recall specific English terms like "Igneous," "Sedimentary," "Weathering," or "Erosion."
- **Open-ended format:** Without options, students must construct a sentence in English, which is a significant barrier for ESL (English as a Second Language) learners.
- **Process sequence:** They must link two distinct steps (breaking then moving) to get the point.

Step 5: While the concept is foundational, the requirement to explain it in written English for students with limited proficiency and from EWS backgrounds creates a high threshold for a "fully correct" response according to the rubric.
