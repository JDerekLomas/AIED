Step 1: Identify the scientific concepts and skills required.
The item requires students to connect symptoms (stunted growth, yellowing) to soil chemistry, specifically nutrient deficiency (NPK). It requires knowledge of soil management practices (adding fertilizers/manure) and specific vocabulary related to plant nutrition.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   "Plants eat soil": Students may think soil is food rather than a medium for nutrients. (Could lead to vague answers).
*   "Water is the only thing plants need to grow": Students might suggest "watering more" instead of adding nutrients. (Would lead to an incorrect answer).
*   "All fertilizers are the same": Failure to name a specific nutrient like Nitrogen. (Would lead to an incorrect answer based on the rubric).

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
The context of farming is highly familiar to students from economically weaker sections in India, many of whom have rural ties. The "yellowing of leaves" is a common sight.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, expressing "stunted growth" or "nutrient deficiency" in English is a significant hurdle.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options (MCQ), students must recall and spell specific terms like "Phosphorus" or "Potassium," which are linguistically difficult.
*   **Specific Rubric:** The rubric requires both an action (add fertilizer) AND a specific nutrient name. Many students might only provide the action.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
While the context is familiar, the requirement to name a specific chemical nutrient in English, combined with the open-ended nature of the question for students with limited English proficiency, creates a high barrier for a "fully correct" response according to the strict rubric.
