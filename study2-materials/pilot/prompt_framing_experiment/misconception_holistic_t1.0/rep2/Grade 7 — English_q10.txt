Step 1: Identify the linguistic and logical concepts and skills required.
*   Understanding the structural difference between direct and indirect speech.
*   Knowledge of pronoun shifts (First person "I" to third person "she").
*   Application of backshifting tenses (Present Continuous "am reading" to Past Continuous "was reading").
*   Use of the conjunction "that" as a clause linker.
*   Punctuation adjustment (removing quotation marks and commas).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Tense retention:** Students often keep the tense of the original quote (e.g., "She said that she is reading..."). *Result: Incorrect.*
*   **Pronoun confusion:** Retaining the original pronoun (e.g., "She said that I was reading..."). *Result: Incorrect.*
*   **Mechanical conversion:** Forgetting to remove quotation marks or the comma. *Result: Incorrect (depending on strictness).*
*   **L1 Interference (Hindi):** In Hindi, the tense often doesn't backshift in the same way in reported speech, leading students to translate literally. *Result: Incorrect.*

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   The vocabulary ("novel," "reading") is extremely simple and familiar.
*   The sentence structure is a "textbook" example of the rule, lacking any exceptions or complex "reporting verbs" (like "asked" or "ordered").

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no multiple-choice cues to trigger memory; students must generate the grammar from scratch.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, English grammar rules like "backshifting" feel abstract and disconnected from their natural communication.
*   **Multi-step logic:** The student must simultaneously change the pronoun, the tense, and the punctuation.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the specific demographic (economically weaker sections, Hindi-medium background), the "backshifting" of tenses is the most common point of failure in Indian government schools at Grade 7. While many will get the pronoun "she" correct, a significant portion will struggle with the "am" to "was" conversion and the removal of quotes.
