Step 1: This is a Social Science (History) question, not a mathematics question. The cognitive skills required include recall of historical facts, understanding chronological periods (Vedic period), and the ability to describe a characteristic of an economic activity.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Confusing the Vedic period with the Harappan civilization (leading to an answer focused solely on organized trade or urban crafts).
- Anachronistic thinking: Assuming modern occupations (like factory work or technology) existed then.
- Generalizing "farming" as the only ancient occupation: This would actually lead to a correct answer under this specific rubric, even if the student lacks the nuance of early Vedic pastoralism.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The rubric is very generous, accepting either "pastoralism" or "agriculture," covering both the Early and Later Vedic phases.
- "Agriculture" and "Farming" are high-frequency vocabulary words in Indian Social Science textbooks.
- The context is a core part of the Grade 6 curriculum (Our Pasts - I).

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- Language barrier: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may know the concept (*Krishi* or *Pashupalan*) but struggle to retrieve or spell the English terms.
- Two-part requirement: The student must not only name the occupation but also "describe one key aspect." Even if they get the name right, they might lose the mark if their English proficiency prevents a coherent description.
- Open-ended format: No cues or options to trigger memory.

Step 5: While the rubric is flexible, the requirement to write a descriptive sentence in English will be a significant hurdle for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. Many will identify the occupation but fail to provide the "key aspect" in a way that satisfies a grader.
