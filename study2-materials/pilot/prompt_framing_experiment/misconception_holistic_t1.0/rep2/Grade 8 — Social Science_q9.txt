Step 1: Identify the conceptual skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, the "mathematical" logic involved relates to set theory and logical mapping (understanding the Parliament as a representative subset of the population) and functional analysis (linking an institution to its specific purpose). Students must understand the causal relationship between a "Democracy" (input) and "Parliamentary Governance" (output/function).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Conflating "Parliament" with "Government": Students often think the Parliament is just the Prime Minister or the ruling party. This might lead to an answer about "running the country" rather than law-making or representation, which may fail the rubric.
*   Voting as the only democratic act: Students may focus only on elections rather than the ongoing representative function of the institution.
*   Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, the English word "Parliament" is often less familiar than "Sansad." The word "necessary" might be misinterpreted.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   The topic is a core part of the Grade 8 NCERT Civics curriculum (Chapter: "Why do we need a Parliament?").
*   The rubric is relatively generous, accepting either "law-making" or "representation."
*   In Indian government schools, "Democracy" is a heavily emphasized keyword from early grades.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Language Proficiency: Formulating a sentence in English is a major barrier for students from economically weaker sections with Hindi-medium backgrounds. Even if they understand the concept, they may struggle to write it.
*   Open-ended format: No options (MCQs) means students must recall and articulate the functions from scratch.
*   Abstraction: "Democracy" and "will of the people" are abstract concepts that are harder to define than concrete historical facts.

Step 5: Holistically, while the concept is central to the curriculum, the requirement to write a coherent explanation in English combined with the abstract nature of civic functions for 13-14 year olds in this specific demographic suggests a moderate success rate.
