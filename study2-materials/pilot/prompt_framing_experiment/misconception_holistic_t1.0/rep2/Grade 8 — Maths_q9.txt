Step 1: The item requires understanding three distinct financial concepts: Marked Price (MP), Selling Price (SP), and Cost Price (CP). Skills include calculating a percentage discount, subtracting to find SP, and then using the profit percentage formula ($CP = \frac{SP \times 100}{100 + \text{Profit}\%}$) to work backward to find CP.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
*   **The "Profit on MP" Error:** Calculating 8% profit based on the MP (₹1200) or the SP (₹1080) rather than the CP. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Additive/Subtractive Logic:** Thinking that since there is a 10% discount and 8% profit, the CP is simply 18% less than MP. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Confusion of Terms:** Mixing up MP and CP, especially for students with limited English proficiency who may find terms like "marked price" and "cost price" linguistically similar in a second language.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The numbers are relatively "clean" (multiples of 10 and 12). Profit and Loss is a standard part of the Grade 8 curriculum in India, and "discount" is a culturally familiar context.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: This is a multi-step problem. The rubric only rewards the final correct answer (or the first step, depending on strictness, but the question asks for CP). For many students in this demographic, translating the English phrasing into a mathematical model is the biggest hurdle. The step of finding CP from SP and Profit% is historically one of the most difficult "backward" operations for 8th graders to master.

Step 5: Given the English language barrier, the multi-step nature of the calculation, and the common confusion between MP and CP, the majority of students will likely fail to reach the final correct answer of ₹1000.
