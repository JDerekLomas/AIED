Step 1: The concepts required are linguistic/syntactic rather than mathematical. Students must understand the transformation of two simple sentences into a complex sentence using the correlative conjunction "too...to." This involves identifying the adjective ("weak") and the infinitive verb ("to walk") while removing redundant intensifiers ("very") and negatives ("cannot").

Step 2: Common misconceptions/errors include:
- Retention of "very" (e.g., "He is too very weak to walk") — Leads to incorrect answer.
- Retention of the negative (e.g., "He is too weak to cannot walk") — Leads to incorrect answer.
- Misplacement of the second "to" (e.g., "He is too weak walk") — Leads to incorrect answer.
- Confusion with "so...that" structures (e.g., "He is so weak to walk") — Leads to incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The vocabulary is extremely simple (weak, walk, he). The "too...to" structure is a staple of the Grade 8 English grammar curriculum in India and is heavily practiced through rote transformation exercises. The context is a standard textbook example.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: The open-ended format (supply-type) requires perfect syntax and spelling. For Hindi-medium students, the concept of a "double negative" implication (using a positive structure "too...to" to express an inability) is cognitively demanding and differs from Hindi syntax ("vah itna kamzor hai ki chal nahi sakta").

Step 5: While the structure is highly practiced, the transition from Hindi syntax to English grammar rules often results in "very" or "cannot" being left in the sentence by students with lower proficiency.
