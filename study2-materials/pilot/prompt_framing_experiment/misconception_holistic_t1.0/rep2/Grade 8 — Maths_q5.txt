### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Identification of Common Factors:** Recognizing $9/16$ as the repeated term in a sum of products.
*   **Distributive Property (Reverse):** Applying $ab + ac = a(b + c)$.
*   **Rational Number Arithmetic:** Adding fractions with unlike denominators, including handling negative signs.
*   **Simplification:** Reducing fractions (e.g., $4/12$ to $1/3$ and $-3/9$ to $-1/3$) to make computation manageable.

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Additive vs. Multiplicative Distributivity:** Students might try to multiply the two $9/16$ terms together. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Sign Errors:** Misinterpreting $+ (-3/9)$ as a subtraction of the entire expression or failing to handle the negative sign during fraction addition. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Freshman's Dream (Fractions):** Adding numerators and denominators directly ($4/12 + (-3/9) = 1/21$). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **PEMDAS/BODMAS confusion:** Evaluating the multiplications first without using the distributive property. While this yields the correct *value*, it fails the specific rubric requirement to "apply the distributive property."

### Step 3: Factors Making it Easier
*   **Simple Simplification:** The fractions inside the parentheses ($4/12$ and $-3/9$) both simplify to $1/3$ and $-1/3$. This leads to a sum of zero, making the final calculation extremely simple if the student notices the simplification.
*   **Familiar Structure:** This specific type of problem is a staple in NCERT Class 8 textbooks (Chapter 1: Rational Numbers).

### Step 4: Factors Making it Harder
*   **Language Barrier:** The phrase "Using the distributive property" may be a barrier for Hindi-medium students who recognize the operation but not the English terminology (वितरकता गुणधर्म).
*   **Complex Notation:** The use of curly brackets, parentheses, and negative signs in fractions can be visually overwhelming for students with low confidence in math.
*   **Fraction Fluency:** Finding common denominators remains a significant hurdle for students from economically weaker sections who may have gaps in foundational primary-school learning.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the problem simplifies to $0$ (a very "clean" result), the requirement to use a specific property and the presence of fractions with negative signs are significant filters. In a typical government school setting, many students will struggle with the fractional addition or fail to apply the property as requested, even if they attempt the calculation.
