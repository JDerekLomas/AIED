Step 1: The item requires scientific reasoning rather than mathematical skills. However, logical skills required include identifying a cause-effect relationship (inferring needs from symptoms) and interpreting descriptive data ("stunted," "yellowing").

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- "Plants eat soil": Students may think the plant needs more "food" in the form of mud rather than specific minerals. This might lead to a correct-ish answer but could miss the "nutrient" keyword.
- "Sunlight is only for warmth": Students may not connect light to the chemical health of the leaves.
- "Yellowing is just old age": This would lead to an incorrect answer (e.g., "the plant is old") rather than inferring a missing need.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The context (farming/gardening) is very familiar to students from economically weaker sections/rural backgrounds.
- The rubric is generous (accepting any of sunlight, water, or nutrients).
- The visual cues (yellowing/stunted) are common real-world observations.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- **Language Barrier:** Keywords like "stunted," "infer," and "evidence" are high-level academic English. Hindi-medium students may struggle to decode the question even if they understand the biology.
- **Open-ended format:** Without options, students must construct a sentence in English, which is a significant hurdle for this demographic.
- **Abstract reasoning:** Moving from a symptom to a "need" requires a leap from observation to theory.

Step 5: While the biological concept is intuitive to students with agricultural exposure, the English language demands (specifically words like "stunted" and "infer") create a significant barrier for this specific student profile, likely leading to many blank or off-target responses.
