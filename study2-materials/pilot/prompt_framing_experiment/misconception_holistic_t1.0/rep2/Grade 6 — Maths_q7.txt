**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Time Calculation:** Calculating the duration between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM (crossing the 12-noon threshold).
*   **Rate of Change:** Understanding "increase per hour" as a multiplication or repeated addition operation ($2^\circ C \times 6$ hours).
*   **Multi-step problem solving:** Adding the total increase ($12^\circ C$) to the initial value ($30^\circ C$).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Duration calculation error:** Subtracting numbers directly ($10 - 4 = 6$) might accidentally yield the correct duration, but many students struggle with the 12-hour clock. Some might calculate $4 - 10$ and get confused, or count $10 \to 4$ as 4 hours (ignoring the 12-noon transition). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Additive vs. Multiplicative:** Some might simply add $30 + 2 = 32$, ignoring the "per hour" duration. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, "increases by" and "per hour" are critical phrases. If they don't recognize these in English, they may fail to set up the equation.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Context:** Temperature and time are highly familiar, real-world contexts.
*   **Simple Numbers:** The numbers (10, 30, 2, 4) are small and easy to manipulate mentally.
*   **Linearity:** The constant rate of change is the simplest form of growth.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **The 12-hour clock:** Students often struggle with the transition from AM to PM. In Hindi-medium schools, time is often discussed in a 12-hour format, but the English "AM/PM" notation can be a stumbling block.
*   **Multi-step process:** The student must find the time difference first, then the temperature change, then the final sum.
*   **Open-ended:** Without options (MCQs), there is no "hint" to help self-correct if they get a result like $32^\circ C$.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
While the math is basic (6th grade level), the combination of a multi-step word problem, the AM/PM transition, and the English language barrier for this specific demographic presents a significant challenge. Many students will likely perform a single operation (like $30+2$ or $30+4$) rather than the full sequence.
