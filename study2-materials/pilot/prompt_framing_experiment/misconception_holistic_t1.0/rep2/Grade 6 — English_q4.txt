Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a vocabulary and reading comprehension task within an English assessment. The cognitive skill required is "synonym identification" or mapping a definition to a specific word found within a provided text.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- **Contextual Misunderstanding:** Students often pick words that are "thematic" (e.g., "sun" or "light") rather than the specific part of speech or synonym required. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- **Literal Translation:** Hindi-medium students may translate "shining brightly" into a Hindi word (like *chamak*) and then search for a word they know, rather than scanning the text for a match.
- **Scanning Errors:** Students may find the word "shining" or "bright" in the text and assume that is the answer, failing to identify the specific word "glowing."

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- "Shining" and "brightly" are relatively high-frequency adjectives/adverbs.
- If the passage is short, the visual search area is small.
- The word "glowing" has a clear, singular correspondence to the definition.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, "glowing" may not be in their active vocabulary.
- **Open-ended Format:** There are no options to choose from; the student must extract the word themselves.
- **Morphology:** If the passage uses "glowed" or "glows," students may struggle to recognize it as the equivalent of "glowing."
- **Abstract Synthesis:** Identifying a synonym requires a higher level of fluency than simply finding a direct fact in a text.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically.
Given the demographic (economically weaker sections, Hindi-medium background), vocabulary-based "find a word" questions are notoriously difficult. While the concept of "brightness" is familiar, the specific mapping to the English word "glowing" and the requirement to extract it from a text without multiple-choice cues will likely result in a low success rate.
