Step 1: The item, though placed in an English context, requires the mathematical concept of **geometric shape recognition** and **symbolic representation**. Students must map a physical object (a tail) to a abstract symbol (a question mark) based on curvature and form.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
*   **Symbol-Object Confusion:** Difficulty linking a punctuation mark (a grammatical symbol) to a physical shape. In this item, this leads to an incorrect answer if the student looks for literal descriptions (e.g., "hairy") rather than the metaphorical shape.
*   **Orientation Bias:** Students may not recognize the "question mark" if the squirrel is not in the specific pose depicted in the textbook illustration.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
*   **Rote Memorization:** This is a classic poem ("The Squirrel" by Mildred Bowers Armstrong) found in the NCERT Grade 7 curriculum used in Indian government schools. Many students will have memorized the specific line "He wore a question mark for tail."
*   **Visual Aid:** Textbook illustrations almost always emphasize this shape.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the phrase "question mark" is an English-specific term. If they know the symbol but not the English name, they may fail.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options, students must recall the specific English phrase and spell it correctly enough to be identified.

Step 5: While the concept is simple, the reliance on English vocabulary for a specific punctuation mark poses a significant hurdle for students from Hindi-medium, economically weaker backgrounds who may not use that terminology in daily life, despite it being a standard textbook question.
