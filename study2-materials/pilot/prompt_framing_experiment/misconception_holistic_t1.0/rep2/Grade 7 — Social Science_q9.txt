Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science item, not a Mathematics item. However, the cognitive skills required include cause-and-effect reasoning, understanding the concept of "impact" (change over time), and basic economic literacy (resource allocation, wealth, and loss).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   "War only affects soldiers, not the economy": This would lead to an incorrect answer as it ignores the systemic impact on the kingdom.
*   "Winners always gain wealth": Students might assume the victor has no economic loss, failing to account for the cost of military preparation or destruction of infrastructure. This could lead to an incorrect answer if they cannot identify a specific impact beyond "getting rich."
*   Confusing "social" impact with "economic" impact: A student might describe the loss of life without linking it to labor or productivity.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   Low threshold for success: The rubric only requires *one* distinct impact for full marks.
*   Familiarity: History curricula in Grade 7 (Medieval India) focus heavily on battles and the resulting looting or taxation, which are direct economic impacts.
*   Simple logic: The idea that "war costs money" is intuitively understood even by students from economically weaker sections who understand budget constraints.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
*   Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students with limited English, words like "Assess," "Impact," and "Economic life" are high-level academic vocabulary that may be unintelligible.
*   Open-ended format: No cues or options are provided to nudge the student toward the correct terminology.
*   Abstract phrasing: "Economic life of kingdoms" is more abstract than asking "What happens to the money when a King goes to war?"

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
While the concept is accessible, the combination of complex English academic vocabulary ("Assess," "Economic life") and the open-ended requirement to write a sentence in English will be a significant barrier for this specific demographic. Many will understand the concept but fail to express it within the linguistic constraints of the test.
