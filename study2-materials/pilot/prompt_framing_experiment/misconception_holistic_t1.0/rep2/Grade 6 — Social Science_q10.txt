Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science item (History/Culture), not a mathematical one. However, the cognitive skills required include recall of factual knowledge, categorization (identifying items belonging to the state of Rajasthan), and concise descriptive writing.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Geographical Misattribution:** Students might name a festival like Bihu or Pongal, confusing national festivals with state-specific ones. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Difficulty with "Significance":** Students may confuse the *name* of the festival with its *meaning*, leading to a failure in the second part of the prompt.
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may know the festivals (e.g., Pushkar Mela) but struggle to construct a "sentence in English" describing its attraction, leading to an incomplete or incorrect response despite having the knowledge.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** For students in India, Rajasthan’s culture (Pushkar Fair, Camel Fair, Teej, Gangaur) is frequently covered in textbooks and media.
*   **Recall-based:** It does not require complex analysis; it relies on rote memorization which is often emphasized in this demographic's schooling.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
*   **English Proficiency:** The requirement to "Describe in one sentence" in English is a high barrier for students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds.
*   **Two-part Task:** Students must remember two distinct names AND a specific fact, increasing the chance of a partial error.
*   **Open-ended Format:** No options (as in an MCQ) are provided to trigger recognition.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the cultural knowledge is accessible, the combination of a two-part open-ended response and the English language constraint for a descriptive sentence significantly reduces the likely success rate for this specific demographic.
