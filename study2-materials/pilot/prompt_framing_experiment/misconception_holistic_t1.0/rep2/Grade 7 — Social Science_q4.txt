Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science (Civics/Political Science) item, not a mathematical one. However, it requires cognitive skills such as understanding cause-and-effect, categorization of government actions, and logical reasoning.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Misconception 1: Confusing "Transparency" with "Honesty":** Students may think transparency just means being a "good person." This might lead to vague answers like "don't lie," which may not meet the rubric for a "plausible way" in governance.
*   **Misconception 2: Conflating "Transparency" with "Development":** Students might suggest "building roads" or "giving money to the poor." This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Misconception 3: Governance as an abstract entity:** Students may not realize that specific tools (like RTI or websites) are part of governance, leading to a lack of concrete suggestions.

Step 3: Factors that make it easier:
*   **Low threshold for success:** The rubric only requires *one* plausible way to get full marks.
*   **Social context:** In India, terms like "RTI" (Right to Information) or "Lokpal" are occasionally discussed in local news or community settings, even in economically weaker sections.
*   **Open-ended flexibility:** Any relevant answer (e.g., "posting budgets on notice boards," "using the internet") is acceptable.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder:
*   **Language Barrier:** The word "transparency" (paradarshita) and "governance" (shasan) are high-level academic vocabulary. For Hindi-medium students with limited English, understanding the question itself is the primary hurdle.
*   **Abstraction:** For a 7th grader, "governance" is an abstract concept compared to "the King" or "the Police."
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options, students must recall specific terminology rather than just recognizing it.

Step 5: Holistic estimate:
Given the language barrier (English question for Hindi-background students) and the high level of abstraction in the term "transparency," many students will struggle to comprehend what exactly is being asked, even if they understand the spirit of "fair government." However, the lenient rubric (only one way required) allows for simple, common-sense answers.
