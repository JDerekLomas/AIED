### Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required
*   **Knowledge of Formulas:** Recalling the specific formulas for the area of a rectangle ($L \times W$) and the area of a square ($Side \times Side$).
*   **Calculation/Multiplication:** Performing basic single-digit multiplication ($5 \times 4$ and $5 \times 5$).
*   **Comparison and Subtraction:** Comparing two numerical values to determine which is larger and calculating the difference (multi-step reasoning).
*   **Measurement Units:** Understanding and applying "sq.cm" as the unit for area.

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Area vs. Perimeter Confusion:** Many Grade 6 students confuse area with perimeter. If a student calculates perimeter, they would get $18$ for the rectangle and $20$ for the square. While they might still conclude the square is "greater," the "by how much" part would be wrong ($2$ instead of $5$). **Effect: Incorrect.**
*   **Additive Reasoning for Area:** Some students add the dimensions instead of multiplying ($5+4$ and $5+5$). **Effect: Incorrect.**
*   **Misapplying the Square Formula:** Treating the square as a rectangle and looking for a "width" that isn't explicitly named, or simply doubling the side ($5 \times 2$). **Effect: Incorrect.**

### Step 3: Factors making it easier
*   **Familiar Numbers:** The use of $4$ and $5$ is very simple; most students have mastered these multiplication tables.
*   **Explicit Dimensions:** The length, width, and side are explicitly provided; no visualization or complex decoding of a diagram is required.
*   **Direct Comparison:** The question uses "greater," a word usually well-understood even by students with limited English.

### Step 4: Factors making it harder
*   **Multi-step Process:** Students must perform two separate area calculations, a comparison, and a subtraction. In high-pressure testing, students often stop after finding the two areas.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the phrasing "by how much" (कितना अधिक) can sometimes be a hurdle in English, leading to an incomplete answer (naming the square but not the difference).
*   **Open-ended Format:** Without options to choose from, there is no "hint" to guide a student who has made a calculation error.
*   **Rubric Rigidity:** The rubric requires both calculations and the difference for $1$ mark; there is no partial credit for identifying the correct shape without the math.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the multiplication is simple, the transition from Hindi to English at this level, combined with the common confusion between area and perimeter and the multi-step nature of the "by how much" requirement, poses a significant challenge for students from economically weaker sections.
