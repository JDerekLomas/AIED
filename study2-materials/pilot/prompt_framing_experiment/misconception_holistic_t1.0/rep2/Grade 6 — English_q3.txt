Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is an English language item, the underlying cognitive skills involve information retrieval and literal comprehension. In a mathematical sense, this maps to "data extraction" from a provided set (the text). The student must identify the specific variable (Riya), the condition (evening), and the corresponding value/action (reading books).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
1. **Keyword matching error:** Students may find the word "evening" in the text but extract the wrong clause if multiple actions are listed. (Would lead to an incorrect answer).
2. **Personal Experience Bias:** Students from economically weaker sections might substitute their own evening activities (e.g., "playing," "helping mother") if they cannot decode the text. (Would lead to an incorrect answer).
3. **Subject-Verb Agreement/Syntax:** Students might understand the concept but fail to form a sentence. However, the rubric is generous and accepts fragments like "read books." (Would not lead to an incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier:
The context (evening activities) is familiar and concrete. The rubric is highly flexible, allowing for short phrases rather than perfect grammar. The question uses a direct "What did..." structure, which is the most basic form of inquiry taught in English.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
The open-ended format requires production rather than recognition (unlike multiple choice). For Hindi-medium students, "read" vs "reading" vs "reads" can be confusing. The primary barrier is vocabulary: if the student doesn't know the word "love" or "evening" in English, they cannot locate the answer even if they understand the story.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate:
In Indian government school contexts, literal comprehension questions based on a visible text (seen passages) have relatively high success rates compared to inferential questions. However, the English language barrier for EWS students in Grade 6 remains significant.
