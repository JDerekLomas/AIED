Step 1: This is a reading comprehension task based on the story "The Three Questions." While the prompt asks for "mathematical concepts," the item is actually testing linguistic decoding, literal retrieval of information from a text, and the ability to express a "cause and effect" relationship (Why -> Because).

Step 2: Common misconceptions/errors for this specific item:
- **Literal vs. Inferential:** Students may struggle to distinguish between the king's *goal* (getting answers) and the *action* (the reward).
- **Language Interference:** Hindi-medium students often struggle with the "Wh-" question word "Why." They may mistake it for "What" or "Who," leading to an incorrect answer (e.g., naming the king).
- **Syntactic struggle:** Students might know the answer but cannot formulate the English sentence "To get answers to his questions," leading to a blank or fragmented response.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- **Familiar Context:** This is likely from a prescribed textbook (NCERT/Honeycomb), making it a "seen" passage rather than an unseen one.
- **Direct Link:** The word "reward" is a high-frequency keyword in the story, making the information easy to locate.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- **Open-ended format:** There are no options to provide a scaffold.
- **Language Barrier:** For EWS students with limited English, constructing a grammatically correct "reason" is significantly harder than selecting one.
- **Vocabulary:** "Announce" and "Reward" are academic Tier 2 words that may be difficult for students with limited exposure.

Step 5: Given the reliance on memory (if the text is familiar) but the significant barrier of English sentence construction for Hindi-medium EWS students, many will provide partially correct or broken English answers.
