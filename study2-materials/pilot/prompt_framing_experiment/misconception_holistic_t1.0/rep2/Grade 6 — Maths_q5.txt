Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required
- Understanding the definition of a "palindrome" (reading the same forwards and backwards).
- Place value knowledge involving 5-digit numbers.
- Logical reasoning to identify the smallest (10,001) and largest (99,999) values within a specific set.
- Fluency in multi-digit addition and subtraction (carrying and borrowing).
- Understanding vocabulary: "sum" and "difference."

Step 2: Common misconceptions
- Palindrome definition: Students may confuse palindromes with "repeating digits" (e.g., thinking 11111 is the only type) or fail to realize the middle digit can be anything. This leads to an incorrect answer.
- Smallest 5-digit number: Students often think the smallest 5-digit number is 11,111 or 10,001, but some might struggle with the "0" in the middle.
- Zero as a placeholder: Difficulty handling the internal zeros in 10,001 during addition/subtraction.
- Language barrier: Hindi-medium students may not immediately recognize the term "palindrome" if it hasn't been explicitly translated to "विलोमपद" or explained through examples.

Step 3: Factors making it easier
- The largest 5-digit palindrome (99,999) is the same as the largest 5-digit number, which is a well-practiced fact.
- Addition and subtraction of large numbers are core parts of the Grade 6 curriculum.

Step 4: Factors making it harder
- Multi-step nature: The student must identify two numbers, then perform two different operations (sum and difference).
- Vocabulary: "Palindrome" is a sophisticated term not commonly used in everyday conversation or basic arithmetic.
- Double Task: The prompt asks for two results, but the rubric only mentions the sum, which might confuse students if they are used to one-answer questions.
- No scaffolding: Being an open-ended question without options makes it significantly harder for students with low English literacy to guess the intent.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate
Given the linguistic barrier ("palindrome"), the requirement to identify two specific numbers without prompts, and the multi-step calculation, many students will likely stumble at the identification stage.
