Step 1: The question is from Social Science (History), not Mathematics. The skills required include categorization, definitions of evidence types, and recall of specific historical examples.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Viewing "literary" as only modern books (Incorrect answer).
- Confusing inscriptions (archaeological) with literature because they contain writing (Incorrect answer).
- Believing "archaeology" only refers to skeletons/bones (Partial/Incorrect answer).
- Language barrier: Misunderstanding the term "Differentiate" or "Literary" due to limited English proficiency (Incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- These are foundational concepts introduced early in the Grade 6 curriculum.
- Examples like "coins" or "temples" are concrete and often familiar through local context or textbook pictures.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- English proficiency: The terms "archaeological," "literary," and "differentiate" are linguistically complex for Hindi-medium/ESL students.
- Open-ended format: Requires active recall and sentence construction rather than recognition.
- Strict Rubric: The student must define *both* types and provide examples for *both* to get the single point. A mistake in one half results in a zero.

Step 5: Given the high linguistic demand and the strict 1-point rubric for a multi-part open-ended response, many students from economically weaker sections with limited English support will likely struggle to provide a complete, technically accurate definition in English, even if they understand the concept in their mother tongue.
