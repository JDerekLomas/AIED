Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
- Data interpretation: Reading a table with three variables and numerical values.
- Comparison: Identifying the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.
- Measurement: Understanding growth in centimeters over a temporal period (10 days).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
- Misunderstanding "growth": Some students might confuse starting height with total growth, but if the table provides daily increments or final height, this is mitigated.
- Correlation vs. Causation: Students might struggle to link the condition (sunlight) to the outcome (growth) without prior knowledge, even if the data shows it.
- Language Barrier: The term "favourable" is a high-level English word. Students might know the data indicates the best growth but not understand what "favourable" means, leading to an incorrect answer despite correct data analysis.

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
- Familiar context: Plants and sunlight are universal and taught early.
- Simple comparison: Finding the "highest number" in a table is a well-practiced primary skill.
- Rubric for (a) only: The question asks for a single answer from the table, which is a low-level cognitive task.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
- Language proficiency: For Hindi-medium students, words like "favourable," "hindered," and "observed" are significant barriers.
- Open-ended format: No options (A, B, C, D) to guide the student.
- Subject integration: While the data reading is math, the reasoning (b) and (c) requires science vocabulary (Photosynthesis), which is a common pain point for EWS students with limited resources.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
While part (a) is mathematically simple (identifying the largest number), the linguistic complexity of the question and the requirement to synthesize science concepts for parts (b) and (c) will lead to many incomplete or incorrect responses. Even for part (a), the vocabulary "favourable" will act as a gatekeeper.
