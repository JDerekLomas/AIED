Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   Data interpretation: Reading and comparing values in a table.
*   Ordering of rational numbers/decimals: Comparing rates of expansion to find the maximum value.
*   Application of scientific concepts to real-world engineering (thermal expansion and conductivity).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   "Bigger is better": Students might confuse low expansion with high expansion if they don't understand the physical property, though this is less likely to affect part (a).
*   Confusion between thermal and electrical conductivity: Students often think if a metal expands a lot, it must be a "stronger" or "better" conductor.
*   Misreading decimals: Students often struggle with decimal place values (e.g., thinking 0.002 is larger than 0.02). However, if the table uses simple integers or clear differences, this is mitigated.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   The context of railway tracks is a standard textbook example in Indian curricula (NCERT).
*   Part (a) is a straightforward data retrieval task.
*   Aluminium and Copper are familiar everyday materials.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, terms like "expand," "recommend," and "gaps" may be difficult to comprehend in English.
*   Multi-part structure: While the rubric only grades part (a) for 1 mark, the presence of parts (b) and (c) can distract or overwhelm a student with limited English.
*   Open-ended response: No multiple-choice options to guide the student.
*   Economic context: Students from EWS backgrounds may have less exposure to diverse reading materials, relying solely on rote memorization of the textbook.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
The rubric surprisingly only assesses part (a), which is the easiest part of the question (identifying the highest value in a table). However, the English language proficiency requirements for a three-part open-ended question in an EWS context significantly lower the success rate, as many students might leave it blank or misunderstand the prompt entirely.
