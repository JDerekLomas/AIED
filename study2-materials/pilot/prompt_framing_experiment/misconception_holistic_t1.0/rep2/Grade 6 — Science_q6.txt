Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Science question, the underlying cognitive skills involve identifying causal relationships (structure vs. function) and categorizing biological traits. There are no direct numerical calculations, but the logic requires identifying a specific mechanism (e.g., surface area reduction) and its proportional effect on a resource (water).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Misconception 1: Adaptations are "conscious choices."** Students might say "Plants decided to grow long roots to find water." This would likely still earn the mark as it describes the feature correctly.
*   **Misconception 2: All desert plants are Cacti.** Students might focus exclusively on thorns. If they explain thorns save water, they get the mark.
*   **Misconception 3: Confusion between "Adaptation" and "Acclimatization."** A student might think a plant "gets used to" heat like a human does. This might lead to a vague answer like "it gets used to the sun," which would fail.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** Deserts and camels/cacti are staple topics in the Indian NCERT curriculum.
*   **Low Threshold Rubric:** The rubric only requires *one* way and provides a very broad definition of "specially built or behaves."
*   **General Knowledge:** Many students have seen Aloe Vera or similar succulents at home or in their community, providing a concrete reference point.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the word "Adaptation" is a technical term (*Anukulan*). Expressing "specially built" or "storing water" in English is a significant hurdle for students with limited English proficiency.
*   **Open-ended Format:** There are no cues or options (MCQs) to trigger memory.
*   **Lack of Structure:** Without a prompt for a specific part of the plant (roots vs. leaves), students with low literacy may struggle to structure a coherent "explanation" rather than just a one-word answer like "Cactus."

Step 5: Holistically, the familiarity of the topic is very high in Indian schools, and the rubric is extremely generous (only one trait needed). However, the English language requirement for an "explanation" (not just a label) will pose
