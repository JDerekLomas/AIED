**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Properties of Parallelograms:** Understanding that opposite angles are equal ($x = 110^\circ$) and adjacent/consecutive angles are supplementary ($x + y = 180^\circ$ or $110 + y = 180^\circ$).
*   **Algebraic Application:** Setting up a simple equation to solve for $y$ ($180 - 110 = 70$).
*   **Geometric Literacy:** Identifying vertices (B and C) and matching them to the correct variables.
*   **Communication:** Providing a written explanation or naming the property used (as required by the rubric).

**Step 2: Common Misconceptions**
*   **Linear Pair vs. Supplementary:** Students often confuse "angles on a straight line" with "consecutive angles of a parallelogram." While both lead to $180^\circ$, the reasoning differs.
*   **All angles are equal:** Some students generalize the properties of rectangles/squares to all parallelograms, assuming $x = y = 110$. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Z-angles (Alternate Interior):** Students might try to use transversals incorrectly if the diagram is not oriented standardly.
*   **Property Confusion:** Swapping the properties (thinking opposite angles are supplementary). (Leads to incorrect answer).

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Familiarity:** Parallelograms are a core part of the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum (Chapter 3: Understanding Quadrilaterals).
*   **Simple Numbers:** $110$ and $180$ are "friendly" numbers, making the subtraction ($180 - 110$) easy even for students with weak arithmetic skills.
*   **Visual Clarity:** Standard parallelogram diagrams are very common in Indian textbooks.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the phrase "Please find" or "explanation" in English can be a hurdle. If they don't understand "explanation," they may lose the mark despite finding $110$.
*   **Open-ended explanation:** The rubric requires an explanation. Many students in these demographics are trained in rote calculation but struggle to write the formal "why" (e.g., "Opposite angles of a ||gm are equal").
*   **Multi-part requirement:** The question asks for $x$ and $y$, but the rubric only explicitly mentions $x$ and its explanation, which might cause confusion during grading or for the student.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
Given the high emphasis on geometry in Grade 8 and the simplicity of the subtraction, many students will identify $110$. However, the requirement for a written "explanation" in English for a student from a Hindi-medium, EWS background is a significant filter that often drops the "fully correct" rate.
