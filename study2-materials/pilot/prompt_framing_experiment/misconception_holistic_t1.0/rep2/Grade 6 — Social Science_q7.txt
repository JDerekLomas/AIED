Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, it requires specific cognitive skills: categorization (identifying natural resources), recall of regional geography, and establishing a cause-and-effect relationship (linking a resource to human lifestyle).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
1. Confusing "Natural Resources" with "Man-made Structures": Students might list "temples" or "forts" (common in Rajasthan). This leads to an incorrect answer.
2. Narrow definition of "Resource": Students often think only of water or trees, failing to recognize minerals or sunlight as resources. This might limit their ability to complete the second part of the question.
3. Conflating "State" with "Country": Some students might list resources found in India generally but not specific to Rajasthan.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
The context is highly familiar as the students live in or near the region being discussed. Rajasthan’s prominent resources (sand, sunlight, marble) are part of their daily visual environment. The rubric is generous (1 mark for multiple tasks), suggesting lenient grading.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
1. Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students, the phrase "natural resources" and the verb "influences" are linguistically complex.
2. Two-Part Requirement: The student must perform two distinct tasks (list two items AND explain one) to get a single mark.
3. Open-ended format: No cues or options are provided to nudge the student's memory.
4. Writing Proficiency: Explaining "influence" requires sentence construction skills that many students at this level, particularly with limited English proficiency, struggle with.

Step 5: Weighing all factors holistically.
The familiarity of the local geography is a strong positive, but the linguistic demand of "explaining influence" in English is a significant barrier for this specific demographic. Many students will likely list the resources but fail to provide a coherent explanation of the influence, or will struggle to translate their thoughts from Hindi to English.
