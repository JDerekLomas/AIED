Step 1: The question is labeled as "English" subject matter, but in a functional mathematical context for Grade 6, it requires the concept of linguistic inversion/opposites (antonyms) and basic vocabulary retrieval.
Step 2: Misconceptions include confusing "opposite" with "negative" (mathematical) or "similar" (synonym). A student might write "un-slow" or a synonym like "lazy." However, "fast" is a foundational Tier 1 vocabulary word usually mastered early.
Step 3: Ease factors: The word "slow" is high-frequency and familiar. The context is simple. The concept of opposites is introduced in primary grades (Class 2 or 3).
Step 4: Difficulty factors: The item is open-ended (no options). For Hindi-medium students, while they know the concept (dheere/tez), they must recall the specific English orthography for "fast." Limited English proficiency might lead to spelling errors or blank answers if the word "opposite" itself is not understood.
Step 5: Given that this is a Grade 6 level for a very basic primary-level word, the majority of students, even from economically weaker backgrounds, will have encountered "slow/fast" repeatedly in textbooks.
