Step 1: Identify the mathematical/scientific concepts and skills required.
*   Understanding the properties of magnetic poles (specifically the law of magnetic poles: like poles repel, unlike poles attract).
*   Spatial reasoning regarding the interaction between two physical objects.
*   Scientific vocabulary (specifically the terms "North pole," "attract," and "repel").

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Magnetism as Gravity:** Students may think all magnets simply "stick" to things regardless of orientation. (Leads to incorrect answer: "They will stick together").
*   **Size/Strength Bias:** Students might think the larger magnet "pulls" the smaller one regardless of poles. (Neutral/Incorrect).
*   **Confusion of Terminology:** Confusing the words "repel" and "attract" due to language barriers. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Monopole Concept:** Thinking a magnet only has one pole. (Leads to confusion).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** Magnets are a highly tactile and popular topic in primary science; most students have played with them.
*   **Simple Binary Choice:** Even if the student doesn't know the exact word, they understand there are only two primary outcomes (stick or push).
*   **Direct Instruction:** "Like poles repel" is a foundational mnemonic taught early in Grade 6.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the English word "repel" is not used in daily conversation. If they know the concept but not the specific English term, they may fail the rubric.
*   **Open-ended Format:** Without multiple-choice options, students must recall the specific term "repel" or describe "pushing away" in English, which is difficult for ESL learners.
*   **Abstract Labels:** "North" and "South" are arbitrary labels that require rote memorization to associate with specific behaviors.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the concept is foundational and frequently demonstrated, the requirement to produce a written answer in English for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency creates a significant barrier. Many students will understand the physical phenomenon but may struggle to express it using the specific scientific terminology required by the rubric.
