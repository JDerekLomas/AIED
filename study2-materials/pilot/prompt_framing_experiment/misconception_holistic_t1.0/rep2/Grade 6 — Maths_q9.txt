Step 1: Identify mathematical concepts and skills
The item requires knowledge of the Angle Sum Property of a triangle (sum = 180°). Skills include identifying the interior angles of a triangle and performing basic subtraction/addition.

Step 2: List common misconceptions
1. **Misidentifying the total sum:** Students often confuse triangle sums (180°) with quadrilateral sums (360°) or right angles (90°). This leads to an incorrect answer.
2. **Exterior vs. Interior:** If the figure involves an exterior angle, students might confuse the two.
3. **Additive errors:** Simple calculation mistakes in adding the two known angles or subtracting from 180.

Step 3: Factors making it easier
The numbers are likely "friendly" (multiples of 10 or 5). The Angle Sum Property is a core, heavily practiced competency in Grade 6. The visual representation of a triangle is a universal mathematical symbol that transcends language barriers.

Step 4: Factors making it harder
The rubric specifies finding "Angle C," but if the question asks for "Angle x," any mismatch in labeling can confuse students. For Hindi-medium students, the English phrasing "Find the angle x" is simple, but "given figure" might be a slight hurdle. The open-ended nature (no options) removes the possibility of guessing or using the options to work backward.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate
Given that this is a standard, procedural item usually prioritized in government school curricula, most students will recognize the 180° rule. However, calculation errors and language gaps regarding labels (x vs C) often lower the success rate in this specific demographic.
