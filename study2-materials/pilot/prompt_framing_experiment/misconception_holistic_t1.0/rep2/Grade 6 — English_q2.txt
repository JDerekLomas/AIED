Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a reading comprehension item for an English language assessment, not a mathematics item. However, the underlying cognitive skills involve identifying a subject ("Who"), understanding the spatial preposition ("inside"), and retrieving a specific noun from a provided text.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Mixing up characters:** Students might name the protagonist or the owner of the book instead of the inhabitant. (Likely to lead to an incorrect answer).
*   **Literal vs. Figurative:** Students might think "characters" or "stories" live in books generally, rather than the specific "fairy" mentioned in the text. (Likely to lead to an incorrect answer).
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the interrogative "Who" versus "Where" or "What," leading them to provide a location or an action.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
*   **Concrete Noun:** "Fairy" is a high-frequency vocabulary word often introduced early in English language learning.
*   **Simple Sentence Structure:** The question is a direct "Who" question, which is the most basic form of inquiry.
*   **Keywords:** The word "book" in the question acts as a strong anchor to find the corresponding sentence in the passage.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
*   **English Proficiency:** For students from economically weaker sections with limited English exposure, "inside" might be a challenging preposition.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without multiple-choice options, students must recall the spelling or construct a phrase, which is significantly harder for ESL learners than recognition.
*   **Hindi-to-English translation:** Students may think of the answer in Hindi (*pari*) but struggle to retrieve the English word "fairy."

Step 5: Estimate the proportion of students who would produce the fully correct answer.
While the content is simple, the lack of scaffolding (no options) and the language barrier for this specific demographic suggest a significant portion will struggle to output the specific English word required by the rubric.
