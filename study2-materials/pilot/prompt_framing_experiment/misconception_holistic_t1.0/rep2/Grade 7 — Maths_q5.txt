**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Multiplication of integers:** Calculating the value of groups of coins (e.g., $16 \times 50$).
*   **Unit Conversion:** Understanding that 100 paise = 1 Rupee.
*   **Multi-step Arithmetic:** Performing three separate multiplications, summing the results, and then performing a final division or grouping.
*   **Division:** Dividing the total value (1000 paise or ₹10) by the target unit (₹5).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Decimal Placement/Place Value:** Students may struggle with "0.10" or "0.50" and instead treat them as whole numbers, leading to a total of 1000 without knowing if it's Paise or Rupees. *Impact: High risk of error.*
*   **Additive Interference:** Some students may simply add all the numbers mentioned in the text ($5+10+10+5+20+16+50$) because they are overwhelmed by the word problem. *Impact: Leads to incorrect answer.*
*   **Unit Confusion:** Thinking a 50 paise coin is half a rupee is intuitive, but 20 paise (1/5th) is harder. Many students might assume 5 coins of 20 paise equals 5 Rupees because of the digit '5'. *Impact: High.*

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Familiar Context:** Money is a highly concrete and culturally relevant context for students from economically weaker sections.
*   **"Friendly" Numbers:** 10, 5, and 16 (multiplied by 50) result in round numbers (100, 100, 800) that sum perfectly to 1000 paise/₹10.
*   **Low Language Load:** The sentence structure is relatively simple, though "How many... can be made from..." requires parsing.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the English phrasing "can be made from" might be confusing. They may misunderstand whether they are being asked for the total value or the number of coins.
*   **Multi-step Process:** This is not a "one-shot" calculation.
