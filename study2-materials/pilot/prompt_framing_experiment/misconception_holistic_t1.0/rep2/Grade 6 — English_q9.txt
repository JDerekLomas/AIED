Step 1: Identify the linguistic and structural concepts and skills required.
The student must identify and apply three specific capitalization rules: starting a sentence with a capital letter, capitalizing proper nouns (names like Riya and Meena), and capitalizing days of the week (Sunday). Additionally, they must place a terminal punctuation mark (full stop/period) at the end.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions/errors.
1. **Proper Nouns in the middle of a sentence:** Many students believe only the first word of a sentence needs a capital letter. (Leads to incorrect answer).
2. **Days of the week:** Students often treat days of the week as common nouns. (Leads to incorrect answer).
3. **Punctuation neglect:** Students often focus only on letters and forget the terminal full stop. (Leads to incorrect answer).
4. **Hindi-to-English Transfer:** Since Hindi script (Devanagari) does not have upper and lower case distinctions, the very concept of "capitalization" is an additional cognitive layer not present in their native language.

Step 3: Factors that make it easier.
- **Familiar Context:** The vocabulary (friend, market, Sunday) is very basic and likely taught in early primary years.
- **Short Sentence:** The syntax is a simple Subject-Verb-Object structure.
- **Common Names:** "Riya" and "Meena" are culturally familiar names.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
- **Multiple requirements for 1 mark:** The rubric requires *all* corrections (4 capitalizations + 1 full stop). Missing even one results in zero.
- **Open-ended/No cues:** There are no multiple-choice options to trigger recognition.
- **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students from economically weaker sections, the lack of capitalization in their L1 (First Language) makes this a high-error task.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the sentence is simple, the "all-or-nothing" nature of the rubric is punishing. Students often miss "Sunday" or the second name "Meena," even if they get the start of the sentence correct.
