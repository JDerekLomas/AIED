Step 1: As this is a Social Science (History) item rather than a Mathematics item, the core skills required are historical recall, conceptual understanding of "significance," and linguistic synthesis. Mathematical concepts are not directly applicable, though chronological reasoning (BCE/CE) is the underlying temporal framework.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Confusing Ashoka with other rulers like Akbar or Chandragupta Maurya (Would lead to an incorrect answer).
- Viewing "Dhamma" purely as a religion rather than a code of conduct (Might still allow for a correct answer if significance is explained).
- Assuming Ashoka was a pacifist from birth rather than after the Kalinga War (Might lead to an incorrect answer if the transformation is not explained).

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- Ashoka is a central, "heroic" figure in Indian textbooks (National Emblem connection).
- The Kalinga War narrative is highly memorable and often taught through storytelling.
- The rubric is relatively lenient (only requires two aspects for 1 mark).

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- English proficiency: The word "significance" is high-level academic vocabulary that Hindi-medium students often struggle to decode.
- Open-ended format: Requires constructing a sentence rather than identifying a fact.
- Abstract concepts: "Ethical governance" and "transformation of kingship" are difficult to articulate in a second language.

Step 5: While the subject matter is familiar, the language barrier and the requirement to synthesize two distinct aspects in an open-ended English format present a significant hurdle for this specific demographic.
