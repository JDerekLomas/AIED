Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is an English Language Arts (ELA) item, not a mathematics item. However, in the context of standardized testing for this demographic, the cognitive skills required include identifying patterns in text, vocabulary recall (specifically adjectives related to literary tone), and the ability to synthesize a whole text into a single descriptive term.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- **Confusion between "Style" and "Content":** Students often describe what the poem is *about* (e.g., "The poet writes about nature") rather than *how* it is written. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- **Literal Interpretation:** Hindi-medium students may translate the concept of "style" to "manner" or "action," leading them to describe the poet's character rather than the prose.
- **Vocabulary Constraint:** Students might understand the style but lack the specific English adjectives (simple, descriptive, informal) required to express it, leading to an incorrect or blank response.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
The rubric is flexible ("other appropriate word"), meaning any reasonable adjective could potentially earn the point. If the poem used in the test is extremely basic, "simple" is a high-frequency word that many students know.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
- **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students from economically weaker sections, "writing style" is an abstract literary concept. Understanding the prompt itself in English is a significant hurdle.
- **Open-ended Format:** There are no options to choose from (unlike a multiple-choice question), requiring active recall of specific English vocabulary.
- **Subjectivity:** Identifying "style" requires a higher level of Bloom’s Taxonomy (Analysis/Evaluation) than simple retrieval.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically.
Given the demographic (Hindi-medium, limited English proficiency, economically weaker sections), an open-ended question requiring abstract literary analysis in English is exceptionally difficult. Most students will likely provide a summary of the poem's topic or leave the field blank due to a lack of specific vocabulary.
