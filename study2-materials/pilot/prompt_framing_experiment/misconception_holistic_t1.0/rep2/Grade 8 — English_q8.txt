Step 1: The question is a linguistic task involving grammatical transformations (active to passive voice). Required skills include identifying the subject-verb-object (SVO) structure, determining verb tense (Past Simple for A, Present Perfect for B), applying the auxiliary verb "to be" in the correct tense/number, and utilizing the past participle.

Step 2: Common misconceptions/errors include:
- Tense shifting (e.g., changing Past Simple to Past Continuous or Present). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "A delicious meal were..."). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Confusion with "has found" (e.g., omitting "been"). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Misidentifying the object (e.g., keeping "The chef" as the subject). This would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- Sentence A uses a very common SVO structure and familiar vocabulary ("chef", "meal").
- Passive voice is a core part of the Grade 8 curriculum in India.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students, the nuance of English tenses (especially Present Perfect in B) is challenging.
- Rubric Rigidity: The rubric implies a maximum score of 1 for converting sentence A, but the item contains two parts (A and B). This ambiguity might confuse students or markers.
- Open-ended format: No options provided to trigger recognition.
- Sentence B: "The true Successor" is more abstract vocabulary compared to "meal," and the "has found" structure requires the insertion of "been," which is a high-error step for ESL learners.

Step 5: Given the English proficiency gap and the complexity of the "has + been + V3" structure for ESL students from economically weaker backgrounds, while Sentence A is moderately accessible, Sentence B will significantly lower the success rate if both are required for full marks.
