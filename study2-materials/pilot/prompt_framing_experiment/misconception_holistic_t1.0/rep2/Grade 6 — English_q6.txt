Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a language arts (English) item, not a mathematical one. However, the cognitive skills required include identification (selecting a specific string of text), justification (providing a reason), and basic syntax construction in a second language.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
While not mathematical misconceptions, common student errors at this level include:
- Copying the entire poem instead of "a line."
- Providing a reason in Hindi/L1 because they lack the English vocabulary to express "why" (e.g., "I like it because it is good").
- Confusion between "line" and "stanza."
In this specific item, these would lead to partial credit or zero marks based on the rubric.

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
- Subjectivity: There is no single "wrong" line to choose; any line is valid.
- Familiarity: The poem has likely been read in class recently.
- Low threshold for "why": Even a simple "It is beautiful" might satisfy a lenient grader.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
- Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students with limited English, constructing a "why" sentence is significantly harder than identifying a line.
- Open-ended format: No scaffolding or sentence starters are provided.
- Abstract reasoning: Explaining aesthetic preference is a higher-order skill (Evaluation/Analysis) than simple recall.
- Writing mechanics: Spelling and grammar anxiety often prevent students from attempting open-ended English questions.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given the background (economically weaker sections, Hindi-medium transition), many students will be able to copy a line from the text, but a significant portion will struggle to articulate a coherent "why" in English. The 1.5-mark weight suggests a multi-part requirement that many will only half-complete.
