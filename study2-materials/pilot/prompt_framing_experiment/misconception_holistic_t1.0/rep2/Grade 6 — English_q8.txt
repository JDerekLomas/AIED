Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While the item is labeled as "English," in the context of mathematical reasoning for a Grade 6 student, it requires logical sequencing, pattern recognition (Subject-Verb-Object algorithm), and understanding of linear order.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
1. Word-for-word translation: Students often translate from Hindi (Subject-Object-Verb) to English (Subject-Verb-Object). This would lead to "He a book reading is," which is incorrect for this item.
2. Ignoring auxiliary verbs: Students may miss the function of "is," leading to "He reading a book" or "He book reading."
3. Capitalization/Punctuation cues: Students may not realize the first word of a sentence must be capitalized, though here "he" is lowercase in the prompt, removing that hint.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
The vocabulary is extremely basic (Tier 1 words). The sentence structure is the most fundamental form taught in primary school. The context (reading a book) is a universal school experience.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
The "Hindi-to-English" syntax barrier is the primary difficulty. In Hindi, the verb comes at the end (*Vah kitab padh raha hai*), which directly contradicts the required English structure. The lack of multiple-choice options (open-ended format) means students must generate the structure from scratch without recognition cues.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically:
Given the very simple vocabulary, even students with limited English proficiency are likely to have memorized this specific sentence pattern. However, the syntax interference from Hindi is a significant hurdle for students from economically weaker sections who may have less exposure to conversational English.
