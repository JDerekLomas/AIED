Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science item, not a mathematical one. However, it requires linguistic and organizational skills: categorizing data (monuments by state/city) and retrieving specific factual attributes (reasons for fame).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
1. Confusing states with cities (e.g., thinking "Rajasthan" is a city). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
2. Confusing monuments with natural features or modern buildings. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
3. Attributing a monument to the wrong state (e.g., Taj Mahal in Rajasthan). This would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
The context is highly familiar. Rajasthan is a major historical hub in India, and its monuments (Amer Fort, Hawa Mahal, Vijay Stambh) are standard curriculum staples and popular cultural icons. For Hindi-medium students, the names of these monuments are the same in both languages.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
1. Language barrier: Students with limited English proficiency may struggle to frame the "why it is famous" part in English, even if they know the facts.
2. Multi-part instruction: The question asks for two names, one city, AND one reason, but the rubric only rewards the names. This creates a discrepancy between the task complexity and the scoring.
3. Open-ended format: No cues or options are provided.

Step 5: Weighing all factors holistically:
While the language barrier is a hurdle for articulating the "why," most students in Indian government schools are heavily drilled in rote memorization of state-specific historical facts. Rajasthan's monuments are among the most frequently taught topics in Grade 6 Social Science. The discrepancy in the rubric (only requiring two names for the point) makes the "passing" threshold much lower than the prompt implies.
