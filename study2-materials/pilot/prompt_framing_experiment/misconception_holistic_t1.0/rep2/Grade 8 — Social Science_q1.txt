Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, the "mathematical" demand is limited to basic categorization (classification of legal rights) and the cardinality of a set (listing exactly two items).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Confusing Rights with Duties:** Students may list Fundamental Duties (e.g., "Respecting the National Flag"). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Confusing Rights with Directive Principles:** Students may list "Right to Work" or "Right to Health." This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **General Moral Statements:** Students may provide vague statements like "Helping poor people." This would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** Fundamental Rights are a core part of the Civics curriculum and are often displayed on the first pages of textbooks and on school walls.
*   **Flexible Rubric:** The rubric allows for simplified phrasing, which helps students with limited English proficiency (e.g., "Equality" or "Freedom of Religion").
*   **Small Set Requirement:** Students only need to recall two out of six possible rights.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no options to choose from, requiring active recall rather than recognition.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students in an English-medium testing environment, translating "Samanata ka Adhikar" to "Right to Equality" might pose a challenge if they haven't memorized the English terms.
*   **Abstract Concepts:** The legal definitions are abstract and can be easily conflated with general human rights.

Step 5: Holistically weighing factors.
Fundamental Rights are among the most drilled and emphasized topics in the Grade 8 Indian curriculum. Despite language barriers, the "rote-learning" nature of this specific topic in many government schools ensures high recall for at least two terms like "Right to Equality" and "Right to Freedom."
