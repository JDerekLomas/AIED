Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   Knowledge of the formula for the Area of a rectangle ($Length \times Breadth$).
*   Knowledge of the formula for the Perimeter of a rectangle ($2 \times (Length + Breadth)$).
*   Multiplication skills (single-digit by double-digit).
*   Addition skills.
*   Distinction between units of measure (cm vs. sq. cm).

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
*   Confusing Area and Perimeter: Using the perimeter formula for area or vice versa. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   Additive misconception for area: Adding length and breadth instead of multiplying. Incorrect answer.
*   Incomplete perimeter: Only adding $15 + 8$ and forgetting to multiply by 2. Incorrect answer.
*   Unit error: Providing the correct number but incorrect units (e.g., 120 cm). Given the rubric specifically asks for "120 sq. cm," this may result in a zero depending on the strictness of the grader.

Step 3: Factors that make it easier.
*   Familiar context: Rectangles are the most basic geometric figures taught.
*   Simple numbers: 15 and 8 are small and do not require complex long multiplication.
*   Direct language: The prompt explicitly asks for "area and perimeter" without any word-problem "noise."

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
*   Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, the terms "length" and "breadth" (lambai and chaudai) might be more familiar in their native tongue than in English.
*   Double requirement: The student must perform two distinct calculations correctly to earn the point (Area AND Perimeter). If they calculate the area correctly but fail the perimeter, the rubric implies they do not get the point.
*   Open-ended: No multiple-choice options to trigger memory or allow for "plugging in."

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the math is foundational, the combination of two requirements (area and perimeter) in a single-point item is a high bar for this demographic. Language barriers often lead to confusion between the two terms, and unit-labeling is a frequent point of failure in Indian government school assessments.
