Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a language arts (English) question, not a mathematical one. However, the cognitive skills required include recall of a formal definition, categorization of literary genres, and the ability to express complex characteristics (anthropomorphism and didacticism) in English.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
1. Confusing fables with folk tales or fairy tales: Many students might believe any story with magic or old settings is a fable, leading to an incomplete or incorrect definition.
2. Character confusion: Students might think all animal stories are fables, missing the "moral lesson" component.
3. Language-based misconception: Students may understand the concept (story with animals) but lack the specific English vocabulary ("imparts," "moral," "character") to satisfy the rubric.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
The term "fable" is usually introduced alongside famous stories like Aesop’s Fables or the Panchatantra, which are very familiar in the Indian cultural context. The concept of a "story with a moral" is a staple of early primary education.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
1. Open-ended format: There are no cues or options; the student must generate the text from scratch.
2. English proficiency: For Hindi-medium students, translating the concept of "seekh" (moral) or "pashu-pakshi" (animals/birds) into a formal English definition is a significant barrier.
3. Specificity of Rubric: The rubric requires three distinct elements (short story, animal characters, moral lesson). Missing any one element may result in a zero under a strict 1-mark "all or nothing" rubric.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
While the concept is familiar, the requirement to produce a formal definition in English is a high hurdle for Grade 8 students from economically weaker sections with limited English exposure. Many will provide partial answers (e.g., "A story of animals") that may not meet the full rubric criteria.
