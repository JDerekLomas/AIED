Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, the underlying cognitive skills involve spatial reasoning and classification. Students must visualize a physical layout (grid system), understand proportional division (citadel vs. lower town), and recognize geometric regularity in urban design.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Conflating "ancient" with "primitive": Students may assume ancient people lacked sophisticated engineering, leading them to describe the civilization as "simple" rather than identifying a specific feature. (Leads to an incorrect answer).
*   Anachronism: Attributing modern technology (electricity/internet) to the period. (Leads to an incorrect answer).
*   Confusion between civilizations: Mixing Mesopotamian or Egyptian features with Harappan ones. (Leads to an incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   Highly familiar context: Harappan Civilization is a "pillar" topic in the Indian Grade 6 and Grade 8 NCERT curricula.
*   Visual imagery: Textbooks use high-impact diagrams of the drainage systems and Great Bath which are memorable.
*   Flexibility: The rubric accepts several different answers (drainage, bricks, grid, or citadel), increasing the chance of success.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, "Urban planning" and "Citadel" are complex English terms. Expressing a full "description" in English is a high hurdle.
*   Open-ended format: There are no cues or options to trigger memory; it requires pure recall and synthesis.
*   Economic context: Students from EWS backgrounds may have less access to supplementary visual media (documentaries/internet) that reinforces these spatial concepts.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given that this is a core topic frequently emphasized for board exams, but accounting for the significant English language production barrier for this specific demographic, the success rate is likely moderate.
