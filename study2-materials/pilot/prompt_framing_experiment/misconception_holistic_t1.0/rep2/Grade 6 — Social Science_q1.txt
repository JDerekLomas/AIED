Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, the implicit mathematical/cognitive skills include classification (identifying a subset of "mountain ranges" within the set of "geographical features") and cardinality (recalling exactly "two" items).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Confusing a single peak with a range (e.g., naming "Mt. Everest" or "Kanchenjunga" instead of "Himalayas"). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   Confusing rivers or states with mountain ranges due to language barriers or rote memorization errors. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   Misinterpreting "in India" (e.g., naming the Andes or Alps). This would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   Familiar context: The Himalayas are a point of national pride and are taught repeatedly from early primary years.
*   Low cognitive load: It requires simple recall (Level 1 of Bloom’s Taxonomy).
*   High linguistic accessibility: The question is short and uses basic vocabulary that even students with limited English proficiency usually recognize (Name, Mountain, India).

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Open-ended format: No options to trigger recognition; requires pure retrieval from memory.
*   English proficiency: Students might know the names in Hindi (e.g., "Himalaya parvat") but struggle with English spelling or the specific English phrasing of "Mountain Ranges."
*   Strict Rubric: The rubric requires two names for a very small point value (0.5), which might lead to partial credit situations not accounted for in a "fully correct" binary.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the cultural prominence of the Himalayas and the Aravallis/Vindhyas in the Indian curriculum, most students will successfully name at least two, even with limited English, as these names are often transliterated rather than translated.
