Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is an English language item, the underlying logic involves "Quantifiers." In a mathematical sense, it requires the student to understand set existence (non-empty sets) and the logical categorization of affirmative vs. negative statements.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
1. Overgeneralization: Students often learn "any" in the context of questions or "any number," and may apply it to all plural contexts. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
2. Translation interference: In Hindi, the word "कुछ" (kuch) can be used for both "some" and "any" depending on the context. If a student translates "There are some apples" and "Are there any apples?", they may use the same mental token for both, leading to confusion.
3. Sound-pattern matching: Students often pick the word that "sounds" right based on exposure. Given limited English environments, "any" is often heard in negative commands ("don't do any..."), which might actually help them avoid it here.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
1. Familiar context: "Apples" and "basket" are standard vocabulary taught early.
2. Binary choice: Having only two options (some/any) significantly increases the chance of a correct guess (50%).
3. Positive sentence structure: The sentence is a simple Subject-Verb-Object structure, which is the first type of sentence students learn.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
1. Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, the nuanced distinction between "some" (affirmative) and "any" (negative/interrogative) is a grammatical rule rather than an intuitive sense.
2. Lack of immersion: Students from economically weaker sections may not hear these quantifiers used correctly in daily conversation, making them reliant on rote memorization of grammar rules.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
The simplicity of the sentence and the 50/50 nature of the multiple-choice format significantly boost the success rate, even if students are guessing or using basic intuition. However, the specific grammatical distinction between "some" and "any" is a known hurdle for English Language Learners (ELL).
