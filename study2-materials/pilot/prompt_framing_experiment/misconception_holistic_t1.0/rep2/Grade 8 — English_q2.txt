Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a reading comprehension task, not a mathematical one. However, the underlying cognitive skills involve information retrieval from a text, identifying cause-and-effect (sunset leading to birds returning), and translating sensory descriptions into a written response.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   Literalism: Students may look for the word "sound" in the text and fail to find it if the text uses verbs like "chirping" or "fluttering."
*   Contextual Misidentification: Students might list any sound mentioned in the entire passage rather than the specific "scene" requested (e.g., sounds from the beginning of the story instead of the sunset scene). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   Language Interference: Hindi-medium students might understand the concept but lack the English vocabulary (e.g., "returning to nests") to formulate the rubrick-compliant phrase.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
The context of birds returning at sunset is a culturally universal and familiar trope in Indian rural and semi-urban settings. The requirement is a single-step retrieval of information.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
The open-ended format is a significant barrier for students with limited English proficiency. They must construct a sentence rather than select an option. The rubric is specific about "birds returning to their nests," which requires a higher level of synthesis than simply identifying a "bird sound." For ESL/FL learners from economically weaker sections, expressive writing is significantly harder than receptive understanding.

Step 5: Estimate the proportion of students who would produce the fully correct answer.
While many students will understand the scene, the requirement to produce a specific English phrase ("returning to their nests") or a close equivalent in an open-ended format will result in many partial or grammatically incorrect answers that may not meet the strict rubric for a 1-point score.
