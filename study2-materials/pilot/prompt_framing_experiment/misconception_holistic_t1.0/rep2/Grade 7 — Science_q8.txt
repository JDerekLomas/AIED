Step 1: Identify the concepts and skills required.
*   Knowledge of natural indicators (turmeric and hibiscus).
*   Understanding the chemical property of acids and bases in relation to color changes.
*   Procedural knowledge: Knowing how to apply the powder/extract to the unknown liquid.
*   Linguistic skill: Expressing a multi-step experimental process in English (the medium of instruction, though not the students' first language).

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
*   Confusion of colors: Thinking turmeric turns red in acid (Incorrect answer).
*   Neutral vs. Acid: Believing turmeric only identifies bases and being unable to distinguish between acid and neutral (Could lead to an incomplete/incorrect answer).
*   Indicator role: Thinking the indicator "neutralizes" rather than "detects" (Incorrect logic, but might still yield the right color name).

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   Familiar context: Turmeric (Haldi) and Hibiscus (Gudhal) are culturally ubiquitous in Indian households.
*   Direct curriculum link: This is a standard experiment in the Grade 7 NCERT Science textbook.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Open-ended/Subjective format: Unlike a multiple-choice question, students must construct a sentence.
*   Language barrier: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle to translate "extract," "determine," or "neutral" into English, even if they understand the science.
*   Complexity: The question provides three items (liquid, turmeric, hibiscus) but the rubric only rewards the mention of turmeric, which might confuse a student into trying to explain how to use all three at once.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the linguistic challenge of describing a process in a second language and the potential for color-swap confusion, many students will provide partial or garbled answers.
