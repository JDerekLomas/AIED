**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Understanding of Proportions/Ratios:** Recognizing the equation as two equivalent fractions.
*   **Cross-multiplication:** Applying the property $a/b = c/d \implies ad = bc$.
*   **Distributive Property:** Correcting multiplying a constant by a binomial, e.g., $5(x - 5) = 5x - 25$.
*   **Linear Equation Solving:** Transposing terms (variables to one side, constants to the other) and performing inverse operations.

**Step 2: Common Misconceptions**
*   **Incomplete Distribution:** Multiplying the constant only by the $x$ and not the constant (e.g., $5x - 5 = 3x - 3$). *Would lead to an incorrect answer.*
*   **Additive Misconception:** Attempting to "move" the denominators by adding/subtracting them instead of multiplying. *Would lead to an incorrect answer.*
*   **Sign Errors:** Mistakes when transposing terms across the equals sign (e.g., $5x - 3x = -9 - 25$ instead of $+25$). *Would lead to an incorrect answer.*
*   **Reciprocal Confusion:** Multiplying the numerators by their own denominators rather than the opposite ones. *Would lead to an incorrect answer.*

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Simple Numbers:** The integers used (3 and 5) are small and familiar prime numbers.
*   **Standard Format:** This is a "textbook" style problem frequently practiced in Grade 8 NCERT (Indian National Curriculum) exercises.
*   **Minimal Language Barrier:** The mathematical notation is universal; the instruction "Solve" is a high-frequency academic word that Hindi-medium students recognize.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Multi-step Process:** Students must correctly execute cross-multiplication, distribution, transposition, and division. A mistake in any single step results in a 0.
*   **Open-ended:** No options to work backward from or to provide a "safety net."
*   **Abstract Nature:** There is no "real-world" context to help a student check if their answer is "reasonable."

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
In Indian government school contexts, students are often highly drilled on procedural algebra. However, the distributive property ($5 \times 5 = 25$) remains a significant "bottleneck" error. While the numbers are friendly, the requirement for perfect execution across four algebraic steps without a multiple-choice prompt usually lowers the success rate.
