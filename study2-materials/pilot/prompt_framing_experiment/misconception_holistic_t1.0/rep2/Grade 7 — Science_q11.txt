Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   **Data Interpretation:** Reading and extracting values from a table.
*   **Comparing Magnitudes:** Understanding that in the context of "fastest," a *smaller* numerical value (less time) represents a *higher* rate.
*   **Variable Relationship:** Understanding the inverse relationship between time taken and speed/rate of a process.
*   **Logical Reasoning:** Comparing three values (Time for A, B, and C) to identify the minimum.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **"Higher is Better/Faster" Misconception:** Students often associate larger numbers with "more" or "faster." This would lead them to pick Liquid C (the largest number) as the fastest. (High likelihood of error).
*   **Confusing Time and Rate:** Thinking that because Liquid C has the "most" time, it is the "fastest" at the task. (High likelihood of error).
*   **Language Barrier:** Students might struggle with the word "evaporate" or "conditions" in English, though the table format provides a visual scaffold.

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
*   **Simple Numbers:** The table likely contains small, whole numbers or easily comparable decimals.
*   **Familiar Context:** While the science is specific, the concept of "time taken" for a task is a daily life experience.
*   **Scaffolding:** The table format organizes the data clearly, reducing cognitive load compared to a word problem.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
*   **Inverse Logic:** The core difficulty is that the "fastest" liquid corresponds to the "lowest" number. In 7th grade, many students still instinctively look for the maximum value when asked for the "most/best/fastest."
*   **Language Proficiency:** For Hindi-medium students, the phrasing "evaporates the fastest" requires translating a scientific rate into a mathematical comparison of time.
*   **Open-ended:** Part (b) requires a written explanation in English, which is a significant barrier for students with limited English proficiency, even if they understand the science.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While Part (a) is a straightforward table reading task, the inverse relationship between time and speed is a classic pitfall. For this specific demographic, the linguistic transition from Hindi to English scientific terminology, combined with the "higher equals more" intuition, will likely result in a significant portion of incorrect answers.
