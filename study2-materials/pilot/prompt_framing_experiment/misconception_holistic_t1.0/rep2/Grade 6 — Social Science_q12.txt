Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science (History/Civics) question, not a mathematics question. However, the cognitive skills required include recall of factual historical information, connecting a visual symbol (currency) to a national monument (Ashoka’s Pillar), and articulating a causal relationship in a second language (English).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Symbolism vs. Nature:** Students may think lions are shown because they are the "King of the Jungle" or represent bravery/strength in a general sense, rather than citing the specific historical origin. This would lead to an incorrect answer based on the rubric.
*   **National Animal Confusion:** Students often confuse the Lion Capital with the National Animal (Tiger). If they state it is the national animal, it is incorrect.
*   **Currency as Decoration:** Thinking they are there just to make the note look "official" or "beautiful" without historical context.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** Currency notes are high-frequency physical objects that students encounter in daily life.
*   **Visual Recognition:** The "Three Lions" (National Emblem) is taught early in primary school and appears on all textbooks and government documents.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students with limited English, "Explain" is a difficult prompt. Even if they know it's the "Ashoka Stambh," they may struggle to write "Lion Capital of Ashoka" or "National Emblem" in a grammatically correct English sentence.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options, students cannot rely on recognition; they must recall specific proper nouns.
*   **Rubric Rigidity:** The rubric requires two specific points (Ashoka's Lion Capital AND National Emblem). Many students may provide only one.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the symbol is iconic, the requirement to explain the historical origin (Ashoka) in English for a student from an economically weaker, Hindi-medium background makes the 1-point threshold difficult to reach fully.
