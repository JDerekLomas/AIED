Step 1: Identify the linguistic and grammatical concepts and skills required.
The student must identify parts of speech in English. Specifically, they must distinguish between an adverb and a preposition. They need to recognize that "around" modifies the verb "ran" (adverbial use) rather than introducing a noun phrase (prepositional use).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **The "Preposition Bias":** Students often memorize "around" as a preposition (like *in, on, at*). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Word Order Association:** Students may believe any word following a verb is an object or a prepositional phrase. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Hindi Interference:** In Hindi, postpositions are used. The lack of a direct object in the English sentence might confuse a student relying on translation, as "around" functions as a spatial adverb here.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Simple Vocabulary:** "We," "ran," and "around" are high-frequency words taught early.
*   **Short Sentence:** There are no complex clauses or distracting adjectives to navigate.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Ambiguity:** "Around" is most commonly taught as a preposition in lower grades. Distinguishing its adverbial function is a high-level nuance for Grade 7.
*   **Open-ended Format:** Without multiple-choice options, students must recall the term "adverb" from scratch and spell it correctly.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students with limited English proficiency, "parts of speech" is often a rote-memorization task rather than a conceptual one.
*   **Abstract Reasoning:** Identifying the function of a word (what it modifies) is more difficult than identifying a naming word (noun) or action word (verb).

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given that these students are from economically weaker sections with limited English exposure, the distinction between an adverb and a preposition for a "swing" word like "around" is highly challenging. Most students will either misidentify it as a preposition or struggle to recall the grammatical term without prompts.
