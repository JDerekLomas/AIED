Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Science item, the underlying mathematical/logical framework involves:
*   Proportional reasoning (inverse relationship between reflectivity and heat absorption).
*   Categorization based on physical properties.
*   Logical deduction (linking a physical property to a human comfort outcome).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   "Clothes produce heat": Students may believe the fabric itself generates warmth rather than trapping or reflecting it. (Would lead to an incorrect answer if they cannot link it to external heat sources).
*   "Light colors attract light/heat": Confusing visibility with absorption. (Would lead to an incorrect answer).
*   "Thickness vs. Color": Attributing the coolness solely to the weight of the fabric rather than the reflective property of the color. (Might lead to a partially correct answer but miss the "light-coloured" requirement).

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   High contextual familiarity: Students in India experience extreme summers; the practice of wearing cotton and light colors is culturally ingrained.
*   Linguistic simplicity: The core concepts ("hot," "sun," "cotton") are part of basic vocabulary.
*   Low rubric threshold: The rubric allows for informal language ("bounce off," "don't get as hot"), which accommodates students with limited English proficiency.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Open-ended format: Requires active recall and sentence construction rather than recognition (difficult for ESL/Hindi-medium learners).
*   Scientific justification: Students may know *what* to wear but struggle to explain the *why* using "properties of the fabric" as requested.
*   Double requirement: The prompt asks for two reasons but the rubric suggests a single mark, which might confuse students on how much detail to provide.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
The high cultural relevance and the very lenient rubric (accepting "don't get as hot") significantly offset the language barrier. Most students will be able to provide at least one "plausible reason" based on lived experience.
