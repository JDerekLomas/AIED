**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Concept of Rate:** Understanding the relationship between distance and fuel (multiplicative relationship).
*   **Fractional Multiplication:** Multiplying a whole number (10) by a mixed fraction ($5 \frac{3}{4}$).
*   **Conversion:** Converting a mixed number to an improper fraction ($\frac{23}{4}$) or a decimal ($5.75$).
*   **Operation Selection:** Identifying that "distance per unit" requires multiplication when the units increase.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **"Multiplication makes bigger, division makes smaller":** Since the student needs to find a larger distance, this might actually help them choose multiplication correctly.
*   **Additive thinking:** A student might try to add $10 + 5 \frac{3}{4}$, leading to an incorrect answer.
*   **Errors in Mixed Number Multiplication:** Many students multiply the whole numbers and leave the fraction ($10 \times 5 = 50$, answer: $50 \frac{3}{4}$). This is a high-probability error for this specific item.
*   **Denominator neglect:** Multiplying the whole number by both parts incorrectly ($10 \times 5$ and $10 \times 3$).

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Familiar Context:** Buses and diesel are common, concrete concepts for students in this demographic.
*   **Simple Base Number:** Using "10" makes the mental math or the final multiplication step significantly easier than a number like 7 or 13.
*   **Standard Problem Type:** This is a classic "unitary method" problem frequently drilled in textbooks.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the English phrasing "How far can it travel on..." if they are not yet fluent in word-problem vocabulary.
*   **Mixed Fractions:** $5 \frac{3}{4}$ is significantly more intimidating than a whole number or a simple decimal for Grade 7 students.
*   **Open-ended Format:** Without multiple-choice options to provide a "hint," students must rely entirely on their procedural knowledge.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
While the multiplication by 10 is helpful, the combination of the mixed fraction and the English language barrier for this specific demographic presents a significant hurdle. Many students will identify the operation (multiplication) but fail to execute the fraction conversion correctly, or they will resort to addition.
