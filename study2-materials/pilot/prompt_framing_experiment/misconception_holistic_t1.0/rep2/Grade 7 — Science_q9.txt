Step 1: Identify the scientific concepts and skills required.
Students must recall the term "insectivorous" or "heterotrophic/partial heterotrophic nutrition." They must understand the physiological trade-off between photosynthesis (energy) and soil nutrient deficiency (specifically nitrogen). They also need to recall specific examples of carnivorous plants (e.g., Venus flytrap).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Misconception 1: Plants only eat through roots.** Students may believe plants "eat" insects for energy/food because they can't make their own. While this leads to a partially correct idea for (b), it might lead to labeling the mode as "consumer" or "parasitic."
*   **Misconception 2: Photosynthesis is sufficient.** Students often think if a plant is green, it needs nothing else. This makes (b) highly difficult.
*   **Misconception 3: Confusion between mode and name.** Students often confuse the *mode* of nutrition (Insectivorous/Heterotrophic) with the *name* of the plant.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   The "pitcher plant" is a standard example in the NCERT Class 7 Science textbook (Chapter 1).
*   The visual description "trap-like structure" acts as a strong scaffold for the memory.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium/ESL students, spelling "insectivorous" or "photosynthesis" in English is a significant hurdle.
*   **Multi-part Open-ended:** Unlike Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs), this requires active recall and sentence construction.
*   **Conceptual Depth:** Part (b) requires explaining the nitrogen cycle/deficiency, which is a common point of failure in rote-learning environments.
*   **Rubric Rigidity:** If the rubric strictly requires the technical term "insectivorous," students who describe it in simple words ("it eats insects") may lose marks.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
While the topic is a "favorite" in Indian classrooms, the requirement to explain *why* it traps insects despite being green (part b) and the linguistic demand of writing "insectivorous" correctly makes the full 3-part correct response challenging for this specific demographic.
