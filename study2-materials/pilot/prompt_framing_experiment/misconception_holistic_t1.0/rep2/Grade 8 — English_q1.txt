Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is an English Language Arts (ELA) reading comprehension item, not a mathematics item. The required skills are:
1. Decoding the English question (interrogative structure).
2. Scanning a text for keywords ("sky," "sunset").
3. Extracting descriptive adjectives/imagery.
4. Expressing the observation in a written sentence.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
1. Misunderstanding "How" as "When" or "Where": This would lead to an incorrect answer (e.g., "In the evening").
2. Literalism: Students may look for the word "look" in the text and fail to find it if the text uses "appeared" or "was," leading to an inability to locate the answer.
3. Vocabulary gaps: If students do not know the words "shades," "painted," or the specific colors in English, they will fail.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
The context of a sunset is universally familiar. "Orange" and "pink" are high-frequency color words taught early in English acquisition. If the source text is simple and directly adjacent to the keyword "sunset," retrieval is easier.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
1. Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, formulating a grammatically correct sentence in English is a significant hurdle. 
2. Open-ended format: No options to trigger recognition; requires active recall and production.
3. Specific Rubric: The rubric requires *both* colors (orange and pink). Students often stop after identifying one detail, leading to a 0 score despite partial understanding.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically.
In the context of Indian government schools with English as a second or third language, descriptive reading comprehension is a "bottleneck" skill. While the concept is simple, the requirement to produce a written English sentence with specific descriptive accuracy (two colors) will filter out many students who have the general idea but lack precise expressive vocabulary or attention to the rubric's specific detail.
