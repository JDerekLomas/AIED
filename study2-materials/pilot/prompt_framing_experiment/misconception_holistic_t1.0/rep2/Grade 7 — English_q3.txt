Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a reading comprehension item for English, not a mathematics item. However, it requires logical sequencing and cause-and-effect reasoning. The "mathematical" equivalent involves understanding a set of three variables (the three questions) as a necessary and sufficient condition for a specific outcome (never failing).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Conflating correlation with causation:** Students might think the king won't fail because he is "good" or "powerful" rather than because of the specific knowledge acquired. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Misinterpreting "Never Fail":** Students may view success as a binary outcome of luck rather than an algorithmic result of informed decision-making.
*   **Language Barrier Misconception:** In Hindi-medium contexts, "Why the king felt..." is often misinterpreted as "What did the king feel?" leading to a descriptive rather than an explanatory response.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** The story "Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy is a standard text in the NCERT/State curriculum for Grade 7.
*   **Direct Textual Evidence:** The answer is usually stated explicitly in the first paragraph of the story.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Proficiency:** Constructing 2-3 grammatically correct sentences in English is a significant barrier for students from Hindi-medium, economically weaker backgrounds.
*   **Open-ended Format:** No options to prompt recognition; requires pure recall and synthesis.
*   **Syntactical Error in Question:** The question itself contains a grammatical error ("Why the king felt..." instead of "Why did the king feel..."), which can confuse students with limited English fluency.
*   **Rubric Rigidity:** The rubric requires mentioning specific variables (right time, right people, right action). If a student understands the concept but lacks the vocabulary to list these three specifically, they may fail.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the English language barrier and the requirement to write multiple sentences, many students will understand the "why" in their native tongue but fail to translate it into a scoreable English response.
