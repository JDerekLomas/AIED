Step 1: The question is from the Science curriculum, not Mathematics. However, the cognitive skills required include categorical classification, defining biological processes, and identifying examples based on specific criteria.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Thinking that plants "eat" soil or water like animals eat food (Incorrect answer).
- Believing that "cooking" food in a kitchen makes humans autotrophs (Incorrect answer).
- Thinking all plants are autotrophic, ignoring parasitic plants like Cuscuta (Could lead to a correct answer on this item if a standard example like "Mango tree" is used).
- Misunderstanding the Greek roots (auto = self, hetero = other), leading to swapping the definitions (Incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- This is a fundamental, high-frequency topic in the Grade 7 Science NCERT textbook.
- The terms "autotroph" and "heterotroph" are often taught using Hindi cognates/translations (*Swaposhi* and *Visamposhi*), which are very descriptive.
- One-word examples (e.g., "Green plants" and "Human") are easy to recall.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- English language proficiency: Students may know the concept but struggle to construct the sentence "make their own food" vs. "depend on others."
- Spelling: Technical biological terms are difficult for Hindi-medium students to spell correctly.
- Open-ended format: Requires active recall rather than recognition.

Step 5: While the language barrier is a significant hurdle for students from economically weaker sections in English-medium government schools, this specific topic is a "core" concept that is heavily drilled for exams. Most students can provide a basic distinction even with limited English.
