Step 1: The question is labeled as "Science" rather than Mathematics. However, in terms of cognitive skills, it requires classification, comparative analysis, and structured scientific communication. It demands the ability to categorize entities based on shared attributes.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Equating movement with life (e.g., cars move, so they are living; plants don't move, so they are non-living).
- Equating fire with life (it grows, "breathes" oxygen, and moves).
- Believing seeds or eggs are non-living because they are dormant.
Misconceptions regarding movement or dormancy would likely lead to incorrect or incomplete characteristics on this specific item.

Step 3: Ease factors: The topic is a foundational "EVS" (Environmental Studies) concept taught since Grade 3. The characteristics (eating, breathing, growing) are highly intuitive and part of daily observation. The rubric is surprisingly lenient, requiring only *one* characteristic for a partial score despite the prompt asking for two.

Step 4: Difficulty factors:
- Language barrier: Hindi-medium students may know the concepts (Sajeev/Nirjeev) but struggle to recall technical English terms like "reproduce" or "respire."
- Format: "Differentiate" usually implies a table or comparative sentences, which is harder than multiple-choice.
- Scoring: The maximum score is only 0.5, which is unusually low for a two-part descriptive question, potentially de-motivating or indicating a very strict grading scale for "key" characteristics.

Step 5: While the concept is familiar, the English language requirement and the need to recall specific terminology from memory (rather than recognizing it) will pose a significant barrier for this specific demographic.
