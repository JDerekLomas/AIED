Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required:
*   Knowledge of the distributive property (specifically the FOIL method or horizontal/column expansion of binomials).
*   Ability to multiply algebraic terms (coefficients and variables).
*   Competency in combining like terms (addition and subtraction of signed integers).
*   Understanding of the law of exponents ($a \cdot a = a^2$).

Step 2: Common misconceptions:
*   **Exponent errors:** Adding variables instead of multiplying ($a \cdot a = 2a$). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Integer sign errors:** Mismanaging the negative sign when distributing $-2b$ (e.g., getting $+6b^2$ or failing to subtract $4ab$ correctly). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Inability to combine like terms:** Keeping $9ab$ and $-4ab$ separate or combining them incorrectly (e.g., $5a^2b^2$). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Universal Linearity:** Multiplying only the first terms and last terms: $(3a \cdot 2a) + (-2b \cdot 3b)$. This is a very common error and would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
*   The vocabulary "Find the product" is a standard phrase in Indian textbooks (NCERT).
*   The coefficients are small single digits (2 and 3), minimizing calculation errors.
*   The structure is a "textbook" example of a binomial multiplication, a heavily drilled topic in Grade 8.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   **Language Barrier:** While "product" is common, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle if they haven't internalized the English terminology for "binomials."
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no options to provide a hint or allow for "working backward."
*   **The Negative Sign:** The presence of $(3a - 2b)$ introduces a subtraction/negative sign, which significantly increases the likelihood of error compared to all-positive expressions.
*   **Two Variables:** Using both $a$ and $b$ requires more cognitive load than expressions with a single variable (like $x$).

Step 5: Holistic estimate:
In Indian government school contexts, algebra is a high-hurdle topic. While the question is standard, the combination of integer sign rules and the open-ended nature usually results in a significant portion of the cohort making at least one procedural error.
