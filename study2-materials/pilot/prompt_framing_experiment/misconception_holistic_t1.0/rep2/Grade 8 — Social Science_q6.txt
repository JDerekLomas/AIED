Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, it requires cognitive skills such as categorization (identifying "factors"), cause-and-effect reasoning (how events "contributed to" growth), and summarizing historical phenomena.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Conflating "Nationalism" with "Patriotism" (might not lead to an incorrect answer if they link it to common culture).
- Anachronism: Thinking 19th-century nationalism is identical to modern-day Indian independence movements (could lead to incorrect answers if they cite Gandhi or Indian struggle).
- Confusion between the French Revolution (late 18th) and its 19th-century ripple effects (might lead to incorrect chronology, but the rubric allows the spread of French Revolution ideas).

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The rubric is very generous (only 1 point for two factors, allowing "brief explanation").
- These concepts (French Revolution, language, culture) are core pillars of the Grade 8 Social Science curriculum and are frequently repeated in textbooks.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with "contributed," "sentiment," and "19th century" in English.
- **Open-ended format:** There are no options to prompt memory; it requires active recall and sentence construction.
- **Complexity:** The jump from local history to European history is often abstract for students in economically weaker sections who may lack global geographical context.
- **Discrepancy:** The question asks for *two* factors, but the rubric suggests identifying and explaining *one* is sufficient for the point; this mismatch can confuse students.

Step 5: Given the high language barrier and the abstract nature of European history for this demographic, despite the lenient rubric, many students will struggle to articulate two distinct factors in English.
