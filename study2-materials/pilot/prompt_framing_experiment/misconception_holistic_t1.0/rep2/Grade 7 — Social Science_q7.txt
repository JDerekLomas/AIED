Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, the underlying mathematical and logic skills include understanding transactional value, the concept of digital versus physical units, and the abstraction of "value." It requires students to process economic functions (medium of exchange, store of value) which are foundational to financial literacy and quantitative reasoning.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include the belief that "money" is only physical cash (leading to confusion about how digital money "exists"), and the conflation of "money" with "wealth" or "income." On this item, the misconception that digital money is "not real" or is unsafe might lead students to focus on disadvantages rather than its functional role, potentially failing to meet the rubric's requirement for explaining its role in development.

Step 3: Ease factors include the high visibility of digital payment systems (like UPI) in daily life in India, even among lower-income groups. The context of "spending" is universally familiar.

Step 4: Hardness factors are significant: 
- **Language Barrier:** "Analyze," "Economic Development," and "Evaluate" are high-level academic command words that are extremely challenging for Hindi-medium students with limited English.
- **Cognitive Load:** The prompt asks for two distinct high-level tasks (Analyze and Evaluate) for only 1 mark.
- **Open-ended Format:** There are no cues or scaffolding to guide the response structure.
- **Abstraction:** "Economic development" is an abstract macro-concept difficult for a 12-year-old to link to the physical act of using money.

Step 5: Given the high linguistic barrier and the sophisticated reasoning required by the command verbs compared to the age group and background, most students will likely struggle to provide a formal "explanation" that satisfies the rubric, despite having intuitive knowledge of the topic.
