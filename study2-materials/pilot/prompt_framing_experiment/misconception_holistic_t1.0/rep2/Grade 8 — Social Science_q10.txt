Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, it requires chronological sequencing, cause-and-effect reasoning, and understanding the transition from a commercial entity (profit-based) to a political entity (taxation/governance).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Viewing the Company as a unified "British government" from the start (incorrect context, but might still allow the student to mention they were traders).
- Confusion between "traders" and "invaders" (might lead to skipping the trading post mention).
- Over-simplification of the transition as a single event rather than a process.

Step 3: Ease factors:
- The context is a central theme in Grade 8 History (NCERT curriculum).
- The rubric is extremely lenient; the student only needs to mention they arrived as traders or established factories to get the point, rather than explaining the entire complex process.
- "Traders" (Vyapari) is a high-frequency vocabulary word in both English and Hindi.

Step 4: Hardship factors:
- The English phrasing ("process through which," "eventually," "territory") is complex for students with limited proficiency.
- Open-ended format requires sentence construction, which is a barrier for ESL learners.
- The prompt asks to "Describe the process" (complex), but the rubric only asks for a single fact (simple). Students may be intimidated by the prompt and fail to write the simple fact they know.

Step 5: Given the very low threshold for the rubric (just mentioning they were traders) despite the complex phrasing, a significant number of students will hit the requirement, though many will struggle with the English syntax.
