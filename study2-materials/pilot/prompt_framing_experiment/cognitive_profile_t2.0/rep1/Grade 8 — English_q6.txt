**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. In the Indian Grade 8 curriculum (NCERT/State Boards), fables like Aesop’s Fables or the Panchatantra are introduced early. However, students often recognize them by example rather than by formal definition.
*   **Computational complexity:** 0. This is a purely linguistic/conceptual task.
*   **Common error traps:** Major. For Hindi-medium students, the linguistic barrier to articulating a definition in English is high. Many students may know what a fable is in their L1 (e.g., *pashu-pakshiyo ki kahani*) but will struggle to retrieve terms like "imparts," "character," or "moral lesson" in English. They may also confuse it with "folk tale" or "fairy tale."
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This is high demand for this demographic. The rubric requires three specific components (short story, animal characters, moral lesson). Without partial credit (Max score: 1), many students who provide an incomplete or grammatically broken response will fail the rubric's threshold.
*   **Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Estimated proportion of students producing the fully correct answer:**
