- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The concept of 'protective foods' is a core part of the Class 6 NCERT Science syllabus and is frequently taught in foundational nutrition chapters.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No arithmetic steps required.)
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse which nutrient falls under which category, such as mistaking energy-giving foods for protective ones. There is also a risk of naming a vitamin deficiency disease for the mineral section, e.g., listing Scurvy as a mineral deficiency.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended recall. High linguistic demand. In a 1-mark "all or nothing" rubric, the requirement to explain a concept *and* provide two specific examples is taxing. Hindi-medium students may understand the concept ("protection/disease fighting") but struggle to formulate the technical English phrasing.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A)

Holistically, while the concept is basic, the multi-part nature of the question paired with the English language barrier and the rigid 1-point rubric (no partial credit) will likely lower the success rate among students from economically weaker sections.
