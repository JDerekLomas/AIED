### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
Probability is a core component of the NCERT Class 8 curriculum (Chapter: Data Handling). Students in Indian government schools are generally introduced to the "favorable outcomes / total outcomes" formula. While the concept is intuitive, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle if terms like "random" or "drawn" aren't explained in their native language, but the "balls in a bag" scenario is the standard pedagogical template used in textbooks.

**Computational Complexity: 2-3 steps**
1. Summing the total (4 + 6 = 10).
2. Setting up the fraction (4/10).
3. Simplifying the fraction (2/5) – though simplification isn't strictly mentioned in the rubric, it is a common procedural expectation in these schools.

**Common Error Traps: Minor**
The most common "procedural bug" is using the ratio of the two groups (4/6 or 6/4) rather than the ratio of part-to-whole (4/10). However, because the numbers are small and the total is 10, many students catch this error intuitively.

**Format Demand: Exact Answer**
As an open-ended item with a binary rubric (max score 1), there is no safety net for partial credit. A student who correctly identifies the parts but makes a minor calculation error in the total or fails to simplify (if required by the specific teacher's standard) may receive a zero.

**Number Friendliness: Easy**
The numbers 4, 6, and 10 are highly "friendly." Calculating a denominator of 10 makes decimal conversion (0.4) or percentage calculation very simple, reducing cognitive load significantly.

**Linguistic Nuance (Context Specific)**
For EWS/Hindi-medium students, "Probability" is *Prayikta*. If the question is presented solely in English, the difficulty increases. If presented in a bilingual format or if the student has basic English proficiency, the math is straightforward.
