- Concept familiarity: Familiar (Creative writing and animal themes are common, but the first-person perspective "Imagine you are" is a moderate abstract leap.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single output required.)
- Common error traps: Minor (Students may confuse "bird" with a specific name, struggle with first-person "I," or default to third-person "The bird flies.")
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; no partial credit possible based on the 0/1 rubric. Higher linguistic demand due to English proficiency gaps.
- Number friendliness: Easy (Not applicable, non-numeric task.)
