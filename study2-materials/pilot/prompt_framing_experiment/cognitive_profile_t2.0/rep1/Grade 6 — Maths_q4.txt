### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
The concept of LCM is a staple of the Grade 6 curriculum in India (NCERT/State Boards). While foundational, it is often taught through rote procedural methods. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds recognize it as *Laghuttam Samapavartak (La.Sa.)*, though they frequently encounter the English abbreviation (L.C.M.) in exams.

**Computational Complexity: 2-3 Steps**
Using the standard common division (ladder) method, students must perform a series of prime factorizations and a final multiplication. For $\{12, 15, 20\}$, this involves 4-5 division steps and the final product $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5$.

**Common Error Traps: Minor**
The numbers 12, 15, and 20 are "highly composite," which helps, but common traps include:
*   Confusing LCM with HCF (Greatest Common Factor).
*   Arithmetic errors in the final multiplication.
*   Incomplete division (e.g., stopping when one number is still divisible).

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
This requires full recall of the algorithm. Since the rubric is "all or nothing" for 1 mark, students do not benefit from partial credit for correct prime factorization if the final calculation fails.

**Number Friendliness: Easy**
These are "benchmark numbers" frequently used in classroom examples. They are small, well-known in multiplication tables (up to 20), and lead to a clean integer result (60).

**Linguistic/Socio-economic context:**
Since this is purely symbolic math, the "English proficiency" barrier is low. However, students from economically weaker sections often suffer from "procedural fragility"—they may know the steps but lack the regular practice to execute them without a small calculation error.
