### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**1. Concept Familiarity: Less familiar**
In the Grade 6 Indian curriculum (NCERT/State Boards), the "Angle Sum Property of a Triangle" is usually introduced in late Grade 6 or Grade 7. While students might know what a triangle is, the formal geometric deduction required to find a missing angle is a transition from arithmetic to geometry that many students from resource-constrained backgrounds find challenging.

**2. Computational Complexity: 2-3 steps**
The student must:
1. Sum the two given angles ($50^\circ + 50^\circ$ or similar).
2. Subtract that sum from $180^\circ$.
3. Correctly identify which vertex corresponds to the value $x$.

**3. Common Error Traps: Major**
Students in this demographic often struggle with:
*   **Protractor reliance:** Attempting to measure the figure instead of calculating.
*   **Arithmetic bugs:** Errors in subtracting from 180 (carrying over across zeros).
*   **Property confusion:** Confusing the sum ($180^\circ$) with $90^\circ$ or $360^\circ$.

**4. Format Demand: High (Exact Answer)**
As an open-ended question requiring a specific numeric value, there is no "guess factor" associated with multiple-choice questions. If the student lacks the specific theorem, they cannot arrive at the answer.

**5. Number Friendliness: Easy**
Typically, these items use multiples of 5 or 10, making the mental math manageable if the student knows the procedure.

**Estimated Success Rate:**
Given the language barrier (understanding "find," "angle," and "figure") and the typical late-year introduction of this geometric theorem, a significant portion of the cohort—especially those with lower literacy levels or inconsistent schooling—will likely leave this blank or provide an incorrect additive guess.
