- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The area of a triangle is a core component of the Grade 7 Mensuration syllabus in India (NCERT/State boards).
- **Computational complexity:** 2-3 steps. (1. Substitution into formula, 2. Multiplication/Division, 3. Assigning correct units).
- **Common error traps:** Minor. Common errors include forgetting the "1/2" factor (treating it as a rectangle) or failing to include square units (cm²).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. Requires recall of the specific formula as no options are provided. No partial credit is available for this 1-mark item, making it "all or nothing."
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. The product of 8 and 6 is a basic multiplication table fact, and both are even numbers, making the division by 2 straightforward.
