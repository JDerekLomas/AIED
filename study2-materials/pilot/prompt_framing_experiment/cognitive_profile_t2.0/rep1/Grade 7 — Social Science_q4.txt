**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Less familiar.** While Grade 7 Civics curricula (NCERT) introduce concepts like "The Role of the Government in Health" or "State Government," the term "transparency" (*pardarshita*) is an abstract, high-level administrative concept. For students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English vocabulary word "transparency" may pose a significant barrier before the conceptual requirement is even addressed.
*   **Computational Complexity: 1.** This is a non-computational qualitative item.
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.** The most significant trap is the linguistic ambiguity of "transparency." Students may literalize the term (related to light/vision) or confuse it with general "honesty." Furthermore, without specific scaffolding or local-context examples (like RTI - Right to Information), the jump from "problem" to "structural solution" is cognitively demanding for this age group.
*   **Format Demand: Open-ended (Recall).** This requires the generation of a phrase or sentence rather than selection (MCQ). Even though the rubric is lenient (only one way required), the lack of prompts or options increases difficulty for students with limited English proficiency who might know the concept in Hindi but struggle to articulate a "plausible way" in English.
*   **Number Friendliness: N/A.**

**Holistic Estimate**
The combination of abstract academic vocabulary (Transparency/Governance) and the open-ended format is likely to result in a low success rate, as the linguistic threshold acts as a gatekeeper to the social science concept.
