**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Natural indicators (turmeric and hibiscus) are core topics in the Class 7 NCERT Science syllabus (Chapter: Acids, Bases and Salts). Students are typically exposed to this through textbook activities or classroom demonstrations.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **None (0 steps).** This is a qualitative, descriptive item involving chemical properties rather than quantitative measurement.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor to Moderate.** Students often confuse the color changes (e.g., forgetting that turmeric remains yellow in acid but turns reddish-brown in base). Additionally, the mention of "hibiscus flower extract" acts as a potential distractor or a source of confusion if the student knows one indicator well but not the other.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** The question is open-ended and requires constructing a coherent English or bilingual response. For students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds, the barrier is often articulating the *process* (application) rather than identifying the *fact*. Recall is high-demand, and since it is a 1-mark "all-or-nothing" item (binary scoring), there is no safety net for partial knowledge.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.**

**Holistic Estimate:**
While the topic is standard, the requirement to describe a procedure in English for students with limited proficiency, combined with the risk of swapping the color results for the two different indicators, significantly lowers the success rate in a 1-mark descriptive format.
