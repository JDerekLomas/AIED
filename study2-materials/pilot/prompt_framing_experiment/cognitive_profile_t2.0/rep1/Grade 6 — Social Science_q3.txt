- Concept familiarity: very familiar (Local cultural integration in Rajasthan's curriculum makes Gangaur a highly recognized concept).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Simple identification and description).
- Common error traps: minor (Possible confusion with Teej; however, visual cues usually distinguish them).
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; rubric is strict on name identification, but the low point value (0.5) suggests an all-or-nothing binary marking which penalizes partial descriptions.
- Number friendliness: easy (No numerical calculation involved).

Your estimate:
0.72
