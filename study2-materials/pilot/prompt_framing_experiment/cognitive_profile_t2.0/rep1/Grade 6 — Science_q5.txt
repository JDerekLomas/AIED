- **Concept familiarity**: **Familiar**. The "Food and Nutrition" chapter is foundational in Class 6 science. Most government schools conduct this experiment as it is a core "learning by doing" activity.
- **Computational complexity**: **1**. No mathematical calculations are required; it is a qualitative, procedural recall task.
- **Common error traps**: **Major**. Students often confuse reagents (using Benedict’s solution or Caustic Soda instead of Iodine) or mistake the color change (forgetting it is "Blue-Black" and confusing it with the Red-Orange result of the sugar test).
- **Format demand**: **Open-ended**. This requires active recall and sentence construction in English. For Hindi-medium students, the transition to scientific terminology in English poses a high barrier to achieving the full 1-mark criteria without linguistic errors.
- **Number friendliness**: **Easy**. Not applicable.

Holistic Estimation: While the concept is simple and visual, the requirement to describe the procedure in English and recall a specific chemical name (Iodine) and specific color change (Blue-Black) represents a significant hurdle for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. Many may remember "potato + medicine = color change" but struggle to meet the technical precision required by a binary 0/1 rubric.
