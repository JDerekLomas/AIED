- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. 'My Favourite Hobby' is a foundational essay topic frequently taught and practiced from primary grades (Grade 3 onwards) in the Indian curriculum.
- **Computational complexity:** 0. This is a qualitative writing task with no mathematical components.
- **Common error traps:** Major. For students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds, the "why" component (causal reasoning) often requires complex sentence structures or subordinating conjunctions ("because," "so that"), which leads to significant L1-to-L2 interference and syntax errors. Additionally, while the *concept* is familiar, the grammatical accuracy required for a "complete" paragraph at Grade 7 remains a high hurdle.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). No partial credit is available (Maximum score: 1), making this a "mastery" item. A student must satisfy three specific criteria (What, When, Why) to receive the point. Failure to address one prong results in a 0.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Estimate:** In the context of EWS students in Hindi-medium government schools, while most students can name a hobby (cricket, drawing), expressing the *temporal* aspect ("when") and the *justification* ("why") in grammatically correct English without teacher scaffolding is a significant discriminator. The lack of partial credit significantly lowers the success rate.
