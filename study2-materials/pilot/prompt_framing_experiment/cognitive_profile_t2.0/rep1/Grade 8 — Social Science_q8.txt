- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Civics is a core component of the NCERT Class 8 curriculum, specifically the first chapter. Concepts like Fundamental Rights and Secularism are heavily emphasized).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; single retrieval step).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse "Rights" with "Duties," or struggle with the English spelling of complex terms like "Parliamentary" or "Secularism" despite knowing the concept).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires free recall rather than recognition/MCQ. However, the rubric is extremely lenient, allowing for any single valid feature and providing partial credit by design for minimal effort).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A).

**Analysis:** For students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds, the language barrier is the primary hurdle. However, because the topic is "The Indian Constitution" (Bhartiya Samvidhan) and it is frequently taught in both Social Science and through national observances (Republic Day, Constitution Day), the core vocabulary is highly recognizable. The low threshold of the rubric (naming just one feature) significantly increases the probability of success.
