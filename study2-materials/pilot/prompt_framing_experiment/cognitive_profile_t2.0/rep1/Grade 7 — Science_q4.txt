**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (This is a core topic in Grade 7 Science under "Heat" and is also rooted in daily life experiences in the Indian climate.)

**Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical item; requires logical linking of concepts.)

**Common error traps:** Minor (Students might focus on the "comfort" or "sweat absorption" of cotton—which is a property of the fabric—but fail to mention the "light-color" property (reflection of heat) as required by the rubric for the specific mark.)

**Format demand:** High (Open-ended recall. Since the students are from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the requirement to explain "two scientific reasons" in English presents a significant linguistic barrier, even if they understand the science.)

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative question.)

**Holistic Analysis:** While the scientific principle is intuitive and well-taught, the linguistic demand of providing a two-part scientific explanation in English will be the primary filter. Students may struggle to differentiate between the properties of cotton (breathability/absorption) and the properties of light colors (reflection), often conflating the two in limited English prose.
