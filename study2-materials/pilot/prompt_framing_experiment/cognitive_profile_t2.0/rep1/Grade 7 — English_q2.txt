### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The "King and Three Questions" theme is a classic narrative archetype in the Indian Grade 7 English curriculum (notably Chapter 1 of the NCERT textbook). While the story is culturally and academically familiar, the requirement to explain *intent* rather than just *actions* increases the cognitive load for second-language learners.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **N/A.** This is a literacy-based task; no mathematical steps are required.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** The primary trap is "Language Interference." Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often understand the "why" (causality) but struggle to translate the subordinate clause (e.g., "to find answers") into a grammatically correct English sentence. They may confuse the *reward* with the *questions* themselves or provide one-word answers ("questions") that fail to address the verb "announce."
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** This requires **cued recall and production**, which is significantly harder than recognition (MCQ). Because the rubric allows for "any similar reason," there is flexibility, but the student must still construct a syntactically coherent phrase in their non-dominant language.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.**

**Holistic Estimation:**
In schools serving economically weaker sections, students often face a "reading-to-learn" gap. While they likely know the story's plot, their limited English proficiency acts as a bottleneck during the production phase. Many students will provide fragmented answers (e.g., "because three questions") or fail to use the infinitive "to find/to answer," leading to grammatical collapses. However, because it is a foundational story, roughly half of the cohort usually manages a functional, scorable response.
