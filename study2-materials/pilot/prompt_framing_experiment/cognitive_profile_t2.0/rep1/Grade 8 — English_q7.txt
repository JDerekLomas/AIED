- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Rhyming words are introduced early in primary grades, but identifying them within a text requires some phonetic awareness).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Simple matching task).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may incorrectly pair 'borrow' and 'tomorrow' due to visual similarity, though 'tomorrow' does not perfectly rhyme with 'borrow' in standard Indian English pronunciations. There is also a grammatical error in the source text ("He had repay it") which might distract literal readers).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires exact recall/extraction from the text; no partial credit for a 1-mark item).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (The words are short, high-frequency, and phonetically simple).

**Holistic Analysis:**
For Grade 8 students in this demographic, the term "rhyming words" is well-known. However, "rain" and "grain" are accessible mostly to those with a basic grasp of phonics. Many students in these settings rely on "visual matching" rather than phonetic matching. The pairing of 'rain'/'grain' is visually and phonetically strong, while the presence of 'borrow'/'tomorrow' serves as a potential second pair that could boost the success rate.
