### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
Profit, Loss, and Discount is a core component of the Grade 8 NCERT syllabus. While students are introduced to these terms early, the integration of Discount (MP/SP) and Profit (CP/SP) into a single problem moves it from "very familiar" to "familiar."

**Computational Complexity: 2–3 Steps**
The item requires two distinct conceptual movements:
1. Finding the Selling Price: $1200 - (10\% \text{ of } 1200) = 1080$.
2. Finding the Cost Price: $\text{CP} = \frac{\text{SP} \times 100}{100 + \text{Profit\%}} \Rightarrow \frac{1080 \times 100}{108}$.

**Common Error Traps: Major**
Students from limited English backgrounds often struggle with the relational vocabulary (e.g., "marked price" vs. "cost price"). A common procedural bug is applying the 8% profit to the Marked Price (₹1200) rather than the Cost Price, or simply subtracting 8% from the SP (finding 92% of 1080) instead of using the inverse percentage formula.

**Format Demand: High (Open-ended)**
Since the rubric requires a single final answer for a maximum score of 1 without mention of partial credit, any slip in the multi-step chain results in zero marks. This "all-or-nothing" demand significantly lowers the success rate.

**Number Friendliness: Easy**
The numbers (1200, 10%, 8%) are strategically chosen to yield clean integers ($1080$ and $108$). This minimizes calculation errors, allowing the item to test conceptual link-up rather than arithmetic grit.

### Holistic Estimate
While the arithmetic is "friendly," the language barrier and the requirement to chain two different percentage applications (Discount followed by an inverse Profit calculation) without partial credit create significant friction for students in this demographic.
