**Concept familiarity:** Familiar. Geometric construction is introduced in Grade 6 NCERT/State Board curricula, though motor skills with a protractor are still being refined.

**Computational complexity:** 1. The task is purely procedural/measurement-based with no arithmetic steps required.

**Common error traps:** Major. For students from Hindi-medium or EWS backgrounds, two specific traps are prevalent: 
1. **The Inner vs. Outer Scale Error:** Misreading the protractor by using the wrong zero-line (drawing 70° instead of 110° or 140° instead of 40°). 
2. **Alignment/Orientation:** Poor positioning of the protractor vertex and baseline on rough, local-quality paper often used in government schools.

**Format demand:** Open-ended (exact). The rubric allows no partial credit for an 110° angle, requiring high motor precision. If the student fails the orientation, the score is zero.

**Number friendliness:** Easy. These are standard "benchmark" angles that multiples of 10. However, 110° is obtuse, which frequently causes more errors than acute angles.

**Holistic Estimate:** While 40° is straightforward, the rubric specifically evaluates the 110° construction. The confusion between the two scales on a protractor remains a primary barrier for about 40-50% of students at this developmental stage in this demographic.
