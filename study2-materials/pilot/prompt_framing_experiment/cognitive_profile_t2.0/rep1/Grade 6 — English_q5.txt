- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The concept of "friendship" is a common theme in primary English; however, abstracting the "most important thing" from a poem requires inferential skills which are emerging at Grade 6).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (This is a single-step qualitative task: identifying a central theme).
- **Common error traps:** Major (Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with translating abstract thoughts into English. They frequently resort to "lifting"—copying a random line from the poem—rather than synthesizing the overall meaning).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended/Partial credit (Partial credit is possible per the rubric, but the requirement to synthesize a theme in a second language without explicit prompts creates a high cognitive load).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question).

Holistic Analysis: While the rubric is generous (allowing for themes without specific evidence), the language barrier is the primary bottleneck. Most students will understand the poem's sentiment but may lack the functional English vocabulary to construct a coherent sentence that satisfies the rubric. They are likely to provide one-word answers or fragmented phrases copied directly from the text which may or may not capture the central theme.
