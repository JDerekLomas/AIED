Concept familiarity: familiar (Magnets are a high-interest topic in Grade 6 Science, typically introduced through hands-on activities).

Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative observation only; no calculation required).

Common error traps: minor (Possible confusion between the words 'attract' and 'repel', though the conceptual physical behavior is generally understood).

Format demand: Open-ended (Requires active recall of the term 'repel' or the description 'push away'; however, the rubric is generous. Language barrier for Hindi-medium students may lead to using 'push' instead of 'repel').

Number friendliness: easy (No numerical data involved).

Your estimate:
