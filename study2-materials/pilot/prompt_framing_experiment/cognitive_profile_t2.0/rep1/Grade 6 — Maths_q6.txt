**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Familiar.** Mensuration (Perimeter and Area) is a core component of the Grade 6 NCERT syllabus. While students are introduced to these formulas, applying two different formulas simultaneously to make a comparison adds a layer of conceptual synthesis.
*   **Computational Complexity: 2-3 steps.** The student must execute three distinct operations: 1) Calculate the area of the rectangle ($5 \times 4$), 2) Calculate the area of the square ($5 \times 5$), and 3) Calculate the difference between the two results ($25 - 20$).
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.** In the context of Hindi-medium and economically weaker backgrounds, students frequently confuse "Area" ($l \times w$) with "Perimeter" ($2(l+w)$). Additionally, the linguistic complexity of the phrase "by how much" may be misinterpreted by English Language Learners (ELL) as simply identifying the larger shape without performing the final subtraction.
*   **Format Demand: High.** The question is open-ended with no partial credit (per the maximum score of 1). It requires total recall of formulas rather than recognition (as in MCQ), and the student must provide two pieces of information (the 'which' and the 'how much').
*   **Number Friendliness: Easy.** The numbers (4 and 5) are single-digit and fall within the most basic multiplication tables. This minimizes arithmetic load, allowing the focus to remain on the conceptual process.

**Holistic Estimation**
While the math is simple, the transition from Hindi to English medium and the high risk of confusing area with perimeter—combined with the multi-step requirement for a single point—lowers the expected success rate.
