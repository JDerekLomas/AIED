Concept familiarity: familiar (Family relationships and simple message writing are standard in Grade 7 NCERT/SCERT curricula; however, the shift from oral emotion to written English is a hurdle.)

Computational complexity: 1 (Linear task: translate intent into written form.)

Common error traps: major (Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with syntax—specifically verb tenses ("I miss you" vs "I missing you") and the imperative "to visit." Direct translation from L1 often leads to grammatical breakdowns.)

Format demand: Open-ended (Requires active recall and sentence construction. Per the rubric, it is an all-or-nothing score with no partial credit, increasing the difficulty.)

Number friendliness: N/A

Holistic Estimate: While the theme is emotionally relatable, the requirement for an "all or nothing" correct message in a non-native language for EWS/Hindi-medium students—without partial credit—will likely result in high attrition due to grammatical inaccuracies or incomplete expression of both required components (missing her AND asking to visit).
