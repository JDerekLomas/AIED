Concept familiarity: Less familiar (At the Grade 7 level in Indian government schools, grammar terms like "adjective phrase" are introduced, but students often struggle to distinguish between a simple adjective and a phrase. Furthermore, the provided rubric accepts "tiny"—a single word—as an "adjective phrase," which conflates two different linguistic concepts, potentially confusing students who have been taught the difference.)

Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step identification)

Common error traps: Major (The primary trap is the question/rubric mismatch. A "phrase" typically implies a group of words, such as "in our balcony" [prepositional/adjectival function]. If the student follows the rubric's logic, they are looking for a single adjective. If they follow the technical term "phrase," they will likely select the prepositional phrase at the end. Additionally, "tiny" may be unfamiliar vocabulary for students with limited English proficiency.)

Format demand: Open-ended/Exact (The student must recall the definition and identify the specific word/group of words; no partial credit for a 1-mark item.)

Number friendliness: N/A
