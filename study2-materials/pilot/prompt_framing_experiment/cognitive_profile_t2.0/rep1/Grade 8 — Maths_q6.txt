**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity (Familiar):** Ratio/proportion and age-related word problems are core components of the Class 8 NCERT syllabus. However, the logic of "age difference" is often secondary to calculating future ages.
*   **Computational Complexity (2-3 steps):** 
    1. Calculate father's current age ($12 \times 3$).
    2. Subtract Rahul's age from father's age ($36 - 12$).
    *   *Alternative (less efficient):* Calculate $12+5$ and $36+5$, then subtract.
*   **Common Error Traps (Major):** This item contains a significant "distractor" ($5$ years). Students from lower-proficiency backgrounds often default to a "keyword strategy" (see a number, add or subtract it). Common errors include:
    *   Adding 5 to the result of the multiplication ($36 + 5 = 41$).
    *   Adding 5 to both ages and stopping ($17$ and $41$).
    *   Calculating the age difference as changing over time (thinking the difference grows or shrinks).
*   **Format Demand (Open-ended):** No options are provided to guide the student toward a realistic age. They must construct the numerical answer. Partial credit is not possible based on the rubric.
*   **Number Friendliness (Easy):** $12$, $3$, and $5$ are extremely "friendly" numbers that do not require complex division or decimals, lowering the pure arithmetic load.

**Language/Context Analysis:**
For students in Indian government schools with limited English proficiency, "thrice" is a potential vocabulary hurdle. Many are used to "3 times." If the word "thrice" is not decoded, the student cannot initiate the calculation. Additionally, the conceptual trap that "age difference remains constant" is a higher-order logical hurdle that often eludes Grade 8 students under exam pressure.
