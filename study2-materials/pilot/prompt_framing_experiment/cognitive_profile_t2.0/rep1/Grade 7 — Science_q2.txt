- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Heat transfer is a core Grade 7 Science topic, and the "spoon in tea" is a standard textbook example).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No calculations involved).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse the terminology with 'Convection' or 'Radiation', or struggle with the molecular explanation).
- **Format demand:** High (Open-ended recall of technical terms and descriptive explanation). Since the maximum score is only 0.5 and (a) asks for a specific name, there is limited room for error or partial credit based on the provided rubric.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A

**Contextual Analysis for Indian Govt. Schools:** 
While the concept is familiar, the language barrier (Hindi-medium background) presents a significant hurdle for (b). Students often understand the physical phenomenon but struggle to articulate "vibration of particles" or "collision of molecules" in English. Part (a) is highly accessible, but the combined requirement of technical vocabulary (Conduction) and descriptive prose reduces the success rate for the full mark.
