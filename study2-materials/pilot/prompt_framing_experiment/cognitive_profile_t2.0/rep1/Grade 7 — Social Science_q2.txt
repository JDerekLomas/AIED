- Concept familiarity: familiar (Included in standard NCERT curriculum under Geography Chapter 1, though often conflated with "human-made environment".)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative recall and application; no calculation.)
- Common error traps: minor (Students often confuse "human environment"—the interactions and social structures—with "human-made environment"—physical structures like roads and buildings.)
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; dual-part question (definition + example) for a very low weightage (0.5 marks), which increases the cognitive load per mark earned. Language barriers may hinder the ability to articulate "interaction" or "modification" clearly in English.
- Number friendliness: N/A
