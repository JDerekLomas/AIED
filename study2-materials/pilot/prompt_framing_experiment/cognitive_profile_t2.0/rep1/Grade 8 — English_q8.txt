- **Concept familiarity:** familiar (Passive voice is a core component of the Grade 8 NCERT/State Board English curriculum; however, the shift from Simple Past to Present Perfect adds a layer of complexity.)
- **Computational complexity:** 4+ (In a linguistic context, the "steps" include: 1. Subject-Object transposition, 2. Determining the correct 'be' verb tense, 3. Recalling the past participle form, 4. Inserting the agent 'by'.)
- **Common error traps:** major (Common bugs include omitting 'been' in sentence B, confusing 'was' with 'has been', and spelling errors in 'prepared' or 'successor' which may be penalized in a strict 0/1 rubric.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended requires recall; no partial credit is available for this specific item as per the provided rubric. The lack of scaffolding increases difficulty.
- **Number friendliness (Linguistic Accessibility):** hard (While "chef" and "meal" are accessible, "Successor" is a high-level vocabulary word for Hindi-medium learners, which may cause hesitation or decoding errors.)

**Estimated Difficulty Profile:**
The 0/1 marking scheme is particularly punishing here because Sentence B (Present Perfect) is significantly harder than Sentence A (Simple Past). For students with limited English proficiency, managing the auxiliary verb transformation in both sentences without an intermediate "partial credit" option creates a high barrier to success.
