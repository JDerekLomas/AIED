### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Linear equations are introduced in Grade 6 and reinforced in Grade 7. While familiar as a syllabus topic, students in this demographic often struggle with the conceptual leap from arithmetic to "x" as a placeholder.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** The process involves two distinct inverse operations: additive inverse (subtraction) followed by multiplicative inverse (division). For this specific demographic, the transition between these two steps is a frequent point of cognitive load.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor to Moderate.** Common "procedural bugs" include:
    *   Operation reversal: Adding 2 instead of subtracting ($4x = 12$).
    *   Incorrect sequencing: Dividing by 4 before subtracting 2 ($x + 2 = 2.5$).
    *   Transposition errors: Misinterpreting the relationship between the coefficient and the variable.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** As there are no options to provide a "hint" or allow for back-substitution (which occurs in multiple-choice), students must rely entirely on recall of the algebraic algorithm. Per the rubric, exactitude is required for the single mark.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The use of small whole numbers and a result that is an integer ($2$) significantly lowers the "noise" of arithmetic, allowing students to focus on the algebraic process.

### Holistic Estimation
Given the socio-economic context and the language barrier, abstract symbolic manipulation often lags behind arithmetic. However, the high "number friendliness" of this specific item allows many students who might otherwise struggle with fractions or large numbers to successfully apply the basic procedure.
