- **Concept familiarity**: Very familiar. Place value is a foundational concept introduced in primary grades and revisited extensively in Grade 6.
- **Computational complexity**: 1. This is a direct identification task requiring no calculation, only position recognition.
- **Common error traps**: Minor. The most common "procedural bug" is giving the face value (5) or the incorrect column (50). Language interference (Hindi to English) for the term "Place Value" is a minor factor.
- **Format demand**: Open-ended (Recall). While there is no partial credit, the rubric is lenient as it accepts both the numerical value (500) and the word form (Hundreds).
- **Number friendliness**: Easy. The number is a four-digit integer with no decimals, which is well within the mental range of a Grade 6 student.
