- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Based on Leo Tolstoy’s ‘Three Questions,’ a staple in the Class 7 NCERT/State Board curriculum; however, the transition from recall to real-life application is a step up in difficulty for this demographic.)
- **Computational complexity:** Not applicable (1)
- **Common error traps:** Major (The primary trap is "comprehension-expression gap." Students often understand the moral of the story but lack the English vocabulary—e.g., "prioritization," "decision-making," "social responsibility"—to articulate a "reason" beyond restating the story's plot.)
- **Format demand:** High (Open-ended recall plus synthesis. No partial credit in a 1-mark binary rubric; the student must formulate an original sentence in English, which is a high hurdle for Hindi-medium learners.)
- **Number friendliness:** Not applicable
