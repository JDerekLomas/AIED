- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (The topic of "Best Friend" is a foundational essay/paragraph topic in Indian primary schooling.)
- **Computational complexity:** 0
- **Common error traps:** Major (For students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds, the transition from mental thought to English syntax often leads to Mother Tongue Influence (MTI) errors, subject-verb disagreement (e.g., "My friend name are..."), and spelling inconsistencies.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended; high demand as it requires recall and production rather than recognition. The rubric is binary (Score 1), meaning even a single grammatical error in one sentence could technically disqualify the student based on "grammatically correct," though teacher leniency may vary.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A
