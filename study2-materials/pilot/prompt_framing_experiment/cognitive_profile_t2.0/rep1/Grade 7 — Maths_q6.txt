**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** While the conversion of mixed fractions to improper fractions is introduced in earlier grades, Grade 7 students are expected to have mastery. However, for students in Hindi-medium or economically disadvantaged contexts, cumulative learning gaps (the "Matthew Effect") often result in lower-than-expected mastery of fractions.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **4+ steps.** The item requires four distinct cognitive/procedural phases: 1) Convert first mixed fraction to improper; 2) Convert second mixed fraction to improper; 3) Multiply numerators and denominators; 4) Re-convert the final improper fraction back into a mixed fraction. 
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** This item is highly susceptible to procedural "bugs." Common errors include: 
    *   Adding whole numbers and multiplying fractions separately ($1 \times 3$ and $1/2 \times 1/4 = 3\ 1/8$).
    *   Failure to perform the final division needed for the mixed fraction format.
    *   Miscalculating $13 \times 3$ (mental math errors).
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended/Exact.** With a binary rubric (Max score 1, no mention of partial credit), any mistake in the four-step chain results in zero marks. The "mixed fraction" output requirement adds a high formatting constraint.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Moderate.** The numbers (13, 8) are prime or semi-prime relative to each other, requiring division with a remainder (39 ÷ 8), which is more taxing than numbers with factors of 5 or 10.

**Estimated Holistic Success Rate:**
The combination of a multi-step procedure and the requirement to return the result to a specific format (mixed fraction) creates multiple failure points for students who struggle with foundational fluency.
