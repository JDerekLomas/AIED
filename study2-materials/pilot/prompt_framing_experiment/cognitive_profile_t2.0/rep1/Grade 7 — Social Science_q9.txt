- **Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. (While wars are discussed in Grade 7 history, "economic life" and "impact" are abstract historiographical concepts. Students from these backgrounds often focus on names/dates/battles rather than systemic socioeconomic analysis.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (The item requires no math, but one logical step to link military action to resource depletion.)
- **Common error traps:** Major. (Students often confuse "impact" with "outcome"—who won/lost. There is also a significant linguistic hurdle in translating the term "economic life" into conceptual equivalents like *arthvyavastha* or *vittiya prabhav*.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall-based). High demand for this cohort because they must construct a sentence in English articulating an abstract cause-and-effect relationship without the support of options.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. (N/A)

**Holistic Estimate:** The transition from Hindi-medium contexts to writing conceptual history in English for 7th grade is a significant barrier. While many might understand that "wars cost money" intuitively, articulating a "distinct and plausible economic impact" in a test setting poses a high linguistic and cognitive challenge.
