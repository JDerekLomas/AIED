**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Familiar.** At the Grade 8 level in Indian curricula (NCERT/State boards), the properties of parallelograms—specifically that opposite angles are equal and adjacent angles are supplementary—are core components of the "Understanding Quadrilaterals" chapter. However, application often lags behind rote memorization.
*   **Computational Complexity: 2-3 steps.** To solve for both $x$ and $y$, a student must apply two distinct properties: identifying the relationship between the given angle and $x$, and calculating the supplementary relationship (subtracting from 180).
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.** For students from Hindi-medium or economically weaker backgrounds, the transition from geometric intuition to "giving an explanation" in English is a significant barrier. Additionally, students often confuse the properties of parallelograms with those of other quadrilaterals or incorrectly assume all interior angles are equal.
*   **Format Demand: High.** The requirement to provide an "explanation" increases the difficulty significantly. In a 1-point rubric where the explanation is mandatory, students who provide only the numerical answer ($x = 110$) will fail the item despite having the mathematical insight. The lack of partial credit (Maximum score: 1) makes this an "all-or-nothing" hurdle.
*   **Number Friendliness: Easy.** Assuming the given angle allows for simple subtraction (e.g., $180 - 70 = 110$), the mental arithmetic is not the primary barrier.

**Holistic Estimation**
While many students can identify the numerical value of $x$, the requirement to provide a formal written explanation, combined with the language barrier and the strict binary scoring, will exclude a large portion of the cohort.
