- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (The Unitary Method is a core component of the Grade 6 and 7 NCERT curriculum and reflects real-world scenarios common in Indian households).
- Computational complexity: 2-3 (Step 1: Division to find the unit rate; Step 2: Multiplication to find the total distance).
- Common error traps: Major (The second part of the question, "Find how much mileage...", acts as a distractor or a source of confusion. Students may provide the mileage (11) as the final answer or become overwhelmed by the two-part nature of the prompt).
- Format demand: Open-ended (The lack of partial credit under the provided rubric means any error in the two-step process results in a zero).
- Number friendliness: Easy (55, 5, and 12 are highly accessible numbers; 55/5 = 11 is a basic table-fact).
