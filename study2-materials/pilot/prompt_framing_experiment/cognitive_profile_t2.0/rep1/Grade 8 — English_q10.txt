**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Transformation of sentences using 'too...to' is a staple of the Class 8 English grammar syllabus in Indian state boards (NCERT/SCERT). It is a highly rehearsed structural pattern.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **N/A.** This is a linguistic transformation task.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the "double negative" logic (the word 'too' implying a negative result without the word 'not'). Common errors include:
    *   Retaining the negative: *"He is too weak to cannot walk."*
    *   Confusing homophones: *"He is to weak too walk."*
    *   Incorrect infinitive use: *"He is too weak for walking."*
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** Requires total recall of the structure and precise syntax. While the rubric suggests 1 mark, in practice, teachers may give zero for a single spelling error (to/too), making it a high-stakes "exact match" item.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.** The vocabulary ("weak", "walk") is Tier 1, which is helpful for students with limited proficiency.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the socioeconomic context and English proficiency gaps, many students will recognize the pattern but fail to execute the specific syntax rules (specifically removing 'cannot' and using 'too' vs 'to' correctly).
