- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. Subjective preference and simple "why" questions are common in post-reading activities, though identifying a specific "line" may be slightly more advanced for those used to summary.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. (Non-mathematical item; requires single-phase synthesis).
- **Common error traps:** Minor. Students often state what they like but forget the "why" justification; English-medium constraints may lead to "fragmented" or grammatically incorrect justifications that fail the rubric's second requirement.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. Requires recall/recognition of a specific line and the generation of an original sentence. While partial credit is often awarded in classroom settings, the specific rubric requires both components for full marks.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. (Not applicable).
