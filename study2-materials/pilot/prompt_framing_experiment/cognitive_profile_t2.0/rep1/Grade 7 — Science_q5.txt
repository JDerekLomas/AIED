Concept familiarity: Very familiar (This is a core topic in the NCERT Class 7 Science syllabus, specifically Chapter 1).
Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative comparison with no mathematical calculation required).
Common error traps: Minor (Students may confuse the prefixes 'auto' and 'hetero', or misspell the scientific terms, though the underlying biological concept is usually grasped).
Format demand: Open-ended (Requires active recall of terminology and two-part articulation; no partial credit according to the rubric increases the difficulty compared to an MCQ).
Number friendliness: N/A (Not applicable).

Linguistic Context Analysis: For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English terminology ("autotrophic"/"heterotrophic") represents a significant cognitive load. While they may understand the concept of "Swa-poshi" (self-nourishing) and "Visham-poshi" (others-nourishing) in their native tongue, retrieving and spelling the complex Greek-derived English terms in an open-ended format without partial credit will suppress the success rate despite the concept being fundamental.
