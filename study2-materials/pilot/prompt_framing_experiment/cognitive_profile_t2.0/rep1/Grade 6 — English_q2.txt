- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Fictional comprehension is a standard part of Grade 6 pedagogy; however, "magic" and "fairies" are often introduced early in second-language learning).
- **Computational complexity:** 0 (Language comprehension item).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse "who" with "where" or struggle with the orthography of "fairy," but the rubric is inclusive).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended recall; no partial credit for a 1-mark item, but the rubric accepts short phrases, lowering the production barrier.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Analysis:**
For students in Indian government schools with limited English proficiency, "Who" is one of the first question words mastered. The primary challenge lies in decoding the text rather than the complexity of the question. Given the generous rubric ("fairy" is accepted), the cognitive load is reduced to keyword recognition. However, since it is an open-ended recall question (rather than multiple-choice), students who can comprehend but cannot encode the spelling may struggle.
