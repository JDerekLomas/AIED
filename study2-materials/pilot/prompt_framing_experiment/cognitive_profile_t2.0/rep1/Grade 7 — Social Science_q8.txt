- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Regional geography and livelihood are core pillars of the Grade 7 Social Science curriculum in Rajasthan state boards).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No arithmetic steps required).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse "rural" with "urban" or list occupations common to India generally but not specific to Rajasthan's desert/arid landscape, though the rubric is broad).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires retrieval and descriptive writing. While the rubric says "Max score 1," the multi-part nature of the question—listing two and describing one—demands linguistic fluency that may be challenging for students with limited English proficiency).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question).
