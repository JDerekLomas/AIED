**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Familiar/Less Familiar.** While Active/Passive voice is introduced in Grade 7 per the NCERT curriculum, it remains one of the more abstract grammatical transformations for English Language Learners (ELL). In government school contexts, students are often still mastering tense consistency.
*   **Computational Complexity: 2–3.** Transformation requires three distinct linguistic "steps": identifying the object to act as the new subject, selecting the correct auxiliary verb based on the past tense ("were"), and retrieving the past participle form of an irregular verb ("blown").
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.**
    *   *Irregular Verb Morphology:* Students frequently struggle with the V3 form of "blow." Common errors include "blew," "blowed," or "blown away" without the auxiliary.
    *   *Subject-Verb Agreement:* Choosing "was" instead of "were" for the plural "leaves."
    *   *Linguistic Transfer:* Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often find the passive construction counter-intuitive as it is used less frequently in common parlance.
*   **Format Demand: High (Open-ended).** This requires full recall and exact syntax. There is no recognition scaffold (like a multiple-choice option). Under a binary (1/0) rubric, small spelling or auxiliary errors result in zero marks.
*   **Number Friendliness: N/A (Linguistic Load).** The sentence is short, but "blew" (past simple) is more difficult than "is blowing" or "was blowing" because it requires a change in the internal vowel for the participle.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the transition from "blew" to "were blown," many students will likely provide "The leaves was blowed" or "The leaves were blew," which would be marked incorrect under the strict rubric.
