- **Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. (Grade 7 students in Indian government schools, particularly from Hindi-medium backgrounds, are often taught to focus on literal comprehension and rote memorization of poems. The concept of analyzing "writing style" or "tone" is an abstract literary device usually introduced later or treated as a peripheral competency.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical task).
- **Common error traps:** Major. (Students frequently confuse "writing style" with the "subject matter" or the "moral of the story." Due to limited English vocabulary, they often lack the precise adjectives—like *descriptive* or *informal*—required by the rubric and may provide plot summaries instead.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended recall. No partial credit is available for a 1-mark item. This requires high-level production of specific academic vocabulary rather than simple recognition (like a multiple-choice question).
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Language-based task).

**Holistic Estimate:** In this demographic, English language proficiency is often a barrier to expressing abstract thoughts. While many might understand the poem's "feeling" in their mother tongue, articulating a specific "style" in English is a high-order task that most will struggle with unless specifically drilled on these terms.
