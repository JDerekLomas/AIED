- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Perimeter and Area are core components of the Grade 6 and 7 NCERT curriculum).
- **Computational complexity:** 4+ steps (Step 1: Formula recall; Step 2: Substituting values/Transposition to find width; Step 3: Calculation of width; Step 4: Formula recall for area; Step 5: Multiplication for final area).
- **Common error traps:** Major (Confusion between Perimeter and Area formulas; forgetting the '2' in $2(l+b)$; computational errors in division; failure to provide the second half of the multi-part question).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (High demand; Requires recall of two different formulas and a multi-step algebraic process with no partial credit as per the 1-mark rubric).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Integers resulting in clean, non-decimal answers facilitate mental calculation if the logic is sound).
