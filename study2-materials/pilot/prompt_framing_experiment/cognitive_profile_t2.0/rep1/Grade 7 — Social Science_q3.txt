- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Equality is a core pillar of the Class 7 Civics/Political Science NCERT curriculum, though abstracting it remains a challenge.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (The cognitive load is qualitative; no arithmetic steps involved.)
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often conflate "equality" with "similarity" or "sameness." They may struggle to bridge the gap between a constitutional book-definition and a tangible daily-life scenario.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended/Recall (While it requires construction, the rubric is extremely generous. Providing *either* a basic definition *or* a relevant example lowers the barrier for students with limited English expression.)
- **Number friendliness:** Not applicable (The item is text-based.)

**Holistic Estimate:** 
The high success rate for this item is driven by the lenient rubric. Even students who cannot articulate a complex constitutional definition in English can likely describe a relevant scenario (like voting lines or shared public taps) from their lived experience. For Hindi-medium students, the concept of "Samanta" (equality) is culturally ingrained through midday meal experiences and school assembly themes.
