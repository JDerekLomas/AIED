- Concept familiarity: familiar (Colonialism and tribal movements are core parts of the Grade 8 NCERT history syllabus; however, linking structural policy to specific lived experiences remains a challenge for students from this background.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative reasoning; no numerical calculation.)
- Common error traps: minor (Students often provide vague answers like "Britishers were bad" without specifying "forest laws" or "loss of shifting cultivation." There is also a tendency to conflate "tribal communities" with the general peasant population.)
- Format demand: High (Open-ended recall. Since the rubric allows only 1 or 0 and requires two distinct examples, there is no cushion for partial credit, making it harder for students with low English writing proficiency to articulate complex historical processes.)
- Number friendliness: easy (No numerical data required.)

Holistic estimate: While the topic is taught, the linguistic barrier in explaining "distinct examples" in English, combined with a 0/1 binary scoring rule for a multi-part qualitative question, creates a significant hurdle for students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds.
