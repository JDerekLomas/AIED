**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Finding factors is a core component of the Grade 6 NCERT curriculum. However, while the concept is introduced early, students from these backgrounds often struggle with the transition from basic multiplication tables to the systematic extraction of all factors for numbers above 50.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **4+ steps.** To solve this correctly, a student must perform multiple mental or written divisions (68/2, 68/4, 68/17, etc.) and check for divisibility by 3, 5, 6, and 7 to ensure no factors are missed.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** The "factor pair" 4 and 17 is a significant hurdle. Many students stop at (1, 2, 34, 68) because 17 is a prime number not commonly memorized in multiplication tables (which often end at 10x10 in Hindi-medium primary settings). Missing 4 and 17 is the most frequent "procedural bug."
*   **Format Demand:** **High (Open-ended).** This is a "recall and list" item. Since the rubric is binary (Score: 1 or 0) and require *all* factors, there is no reward for partial knowledge. If a student forgets a single factor (like 17), the entire response is marked incorrect.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Hard.** Unlike "60" or "72," "68" is not a "highly composite" number with intuitive symmetry. The inclusion of the prime factor 17 makes it significantly more difficult for students who rely on rote memorization rather than divisibility rules.

**Estimated Success Rate:**
The combination of a strict binary rubric and the presence of the non-intuitive 4/17 factor pair will lead to a high omission rate among students from economically weaker sections with limited resources for repetitive drill and practice.
