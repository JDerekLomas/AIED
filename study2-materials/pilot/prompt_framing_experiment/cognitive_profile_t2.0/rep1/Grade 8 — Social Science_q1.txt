**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. The Indian Constitution and Fundamental Rights are cornerstone topics introduced in Grade 6 and revisited with increasing depth in Grade 7 and 8. It is a highly "drilled" topic in Indian Civics/Political Science.
*   **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a non-mathematical task involving simple retrieval.
*   **Common error traps:** Minor. The most common error for this specific demographic is "linguistic interference" (knowing the concept but struggling to recall the exact English term). However, the rubric explicitly allows for simplified phrasing (e.g., "Right to Freedom" or "All are equal"), which mitigates this trap. Confusion with "Fundamental Duties" is a secondary minor risk.
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended (recall). Requires retrieving specific terminology from memory rather than recognizing it from a list. However, requiring only two out of six rights provides a high margin for success. 
*   **Number friendliness:** Easy. No calculation involved.

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given that the topic is culturally significant, frequently assessed, and the rubric allows for linguistic flexibility—a crucial factor for Hindi-medium students in an English-context exam—the majority of students will be able to provide at least two basic rights (typically Right to Equality and Right to Education/Freedom).
