Concept familiarity: **Very familiar** (The role of *Lactobacillus* in curd formation is a foundational concept in the Grade 8 "Microorganisms: Friend and Foe" chapter and is reinforced through real-life daily observation in Indian households).

Computational complexity: **1** (Zero arithmetic steps; pure recall).

Common error traps: **Minor** (Students may confuse the category—bacteria—with other types like fungi or viruses, or struggle with the specific spelling of "Lactobacillus" despite knowing the concept).

Format demand: **Open-ended recall**. While the rubric specifies 0.5 marks, the two-part requirement (name and category) increases the likelihood of partial success but reduces the probability of full credit if the student forgets to mention "bacteria."

Number friendliness: **Easy** (N/A).

Language context: Since many students are from Hindi-medium backgrounds, they may know the process ("kinvan" or fermentation) but struggle to produce the specific English terminology. However, "Lactobacillus" is a technical term used across both mediums.
