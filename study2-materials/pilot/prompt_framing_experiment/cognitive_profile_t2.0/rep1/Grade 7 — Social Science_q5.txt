- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The rock cycle is a core component of the Grade 7 Geography curriculum, "Inside Our Earth").
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No mathematical operations required).
- **Common error traps:** Major (Students frequently confuse "igneous" with "metamorphic" and struggle with the specific terminology of "weathering" and "erosion" in a second language).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended requires high recall; while the rubric is specific, the need to express the transformation process in English poses a significant hurdle for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. Partial credit is not mentioned in the rubric (binary score of 1).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Not applicable).

**Estimated Holistic Difficulty:**
While the topic is standard, the requirement to explain a multi-step geological process in English—specifically linking disintegration to transport—is linguistically demanding for this demographic. Most students can identify rock types, but fewer can accurately articulate the process-oriented relationship between them in a foreign language.
