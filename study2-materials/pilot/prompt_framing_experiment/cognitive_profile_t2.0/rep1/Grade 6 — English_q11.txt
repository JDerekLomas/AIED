- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The present continuous tense is introduced early (Grade 4/5), but the specific terminology "verb phrase" is often less familiar than simply identifying an "action word."
- **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a single-step identification task.
- **Common error traps:** Major. For students with limited English proficiency, the most common trap is identifying only the main verb (*playing*) and omitting the auxiliary verb (*are*). In many Indian regional languages, the structure differs, leading students to ignore the "helper."
- **Format demand:** High. This is an open-ended identification task requiring exact recall of two words. If the rubric is strict and does not allow partial credit for just "playing," the difficulty increases significantly.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Not a math item).
