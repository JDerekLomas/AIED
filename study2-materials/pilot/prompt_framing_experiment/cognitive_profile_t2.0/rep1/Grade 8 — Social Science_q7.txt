**Concept familiarity: Familiar**
The Battle of Plassey is a cornerstone of the Grade 8 NCERT history curriculum. It is a recurring theme in classroom discussions and textbooks as the starting point of British rule. However, while students recognize the name and date, explaining the *mechanism* of expansion (political dominance) is more difficult than simple identification.

**Computational complexity: 1**
This is a qualitative social science question requiring no mathematical operations.

**Common error traps: Major**
Students in this demographic often struggle with the distinction between a "military victory" and "political expansion." Many will describe *how* the battle was won (e.g., Mir Jafar’s betrayal) rather than its *consequences* for British power. Additionally, limited English proficiency makes it difficult for Hindi-medium students to articulate abstract concepts like "puppet nawab" or "political dominance" accurately in English.

**Format demand: Open-ended**
This requires high-level recall and synthesis. Unlike a multiple-choice question, there are no cues. Given the binary rubric (max score 1), students who provide a vague or purely descriptive historical narrative without touching on political control will receive zero credit.

**Number friendliness: Easy**
The date (1757) is provided in the prompt, removing the need for chronological recall.

**Holistic Estimate:**
While the topic is heavily taught, the requirement to explain "expansion of power" (an abstract causal relationship) in an open-ended format is a significant hurdle for students with limited English fluency. Many will provide "the British won" or "Siraj-ud-Daulah was defeated," which may not meet the specific rubric requirement for explaining the establishment of political dominance.
