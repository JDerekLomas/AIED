**Concept familiarity: Familiar**
The area and perimeter of a rectangle are core concepts introduced in late Grade 5 and reinforced in Grade 6. Students from government schools usually practice these specific formulas frequently, though they may occasionally conflate the two.

**Computational complexity: 2-3 steps**
The student must identify the correct formula for area ($L \times B$), perform the multiplication ($15 \times 8$), and—per the rubric—express the result. Although the question asks for both area and perimeter, the rubric only rewards the calculation of the area, making the procedural path shorter.

**Common error traps: Major**
For this demographic, the language barrier is a significant trap. Words like "breadth," "area," and "perimeter" are technical terms that Hindi-medium students often confuse if not presented alongside Hindi translations (e.g., *Shetrafal*, *Parimap*). Furthermore, the rubric demands the area only, but the prompt asks for both; students may calculate the perimeter (46) and stop, or mix up the formulas ($15 + 8$ or $2 \times (15+8)$).

**Format demand: Open-ended**
As a "supply-type" item without options, there is no opportunity for recognition or guessing. The rubric is binary (max score 1), meaning even if a student correctly calculates the perimeter but misses the area, they receive zero.

**Number friendliness: Moderate**
While 15 and 8 are whole numbers, $15 \times 8$ sits at the edge of the standard 1-10 multiplication tables. Students who have not mastered the "15 times table" must perform a carry-over multiplication ($15 \times 8 = 40 + 80$), which increases the risk of calculation errors.
