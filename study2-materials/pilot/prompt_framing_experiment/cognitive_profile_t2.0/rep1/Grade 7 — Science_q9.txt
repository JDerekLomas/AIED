Concept familiarity: familiar (Pitcher plants are a core example in the NCERT Chapter "Nutrition in Plants")
Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative conceptual task, no calculation required)
Common error traps: major (Many students may describe the process rather than using the formal scientific term "insectivorous"; misconceptions include the idea that plants eat insects for "food" rather than specifically for nitrogen)
Format demand: Open-ended recall; highly language-dependent. The rubric is binary (all-or-nothing), which penalizes students with limited vocabulary even if they understand the biological concept.
Number friendliness: N/A
