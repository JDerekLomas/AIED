### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

**Concept Familiarity: Less familiar**
While direct/indirect speech is introduced in Grade 7 (NCERT curriculum), it remains an abstract linguistic transition for Hindi-medium learners. The "backshift" in tense (*am reading* to *was reading*) and the pronominal change (*I* to *she*) are complex grammatical transformations that are often not fully internalized by students from economically weaker sections with limited exposure to conversational English.

**Computational Complexity: N/A**
This dimension does not apply to this linguistic item. However, in terms of cognitive transformations, the student must perform four discrete steps: (1) insert the linker "that," (2) shift the first-person pronoun, (3) backshift the verb tense, and (4) remove quotation marks.

**Common Error Traps: Major**
There are significant traps for this demographic:
1.  **Pronominal Confusion:** Leaving "I" instead of changing it to "she" (Mother-tongue interference where students focus on the literal message).
2.  **Tense Retention:** Keeping "is reading" instead of "was reading."
3.  **Syntactic Mapping:** Difficulty understanding that "said" triggers a past tense environment in English, which differs from colloquial Hindi structures (where "usne kaha ki main novel padh raha hoon" retains the present tense).

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
This requires full recall and sentence construction. There is no scaffolding or multiple-choice options. Since the maximum score is 1, a binary grading system in typical school settings often penalizes students for single-step errors (like forgetting the "that" or misspelling "novel").

**Number Friendliness: N/A**
The vocabulary is relatively "friendly" (high-frequency words like *she, read, novel*), which helps comprehension, but does not lower the structural complexity of the task.

**Estimated Success Proportion**
Given the socioeconomic and linguistic context, most students will struggle with the simultaneous shifting of person and tense required for a "fully correct" response.
