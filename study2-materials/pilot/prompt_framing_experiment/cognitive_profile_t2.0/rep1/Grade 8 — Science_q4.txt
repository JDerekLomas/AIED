### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

*   **Concept Familiarity: Familiar.** 
    The "Combustion and Flame" chapter is a standard part of the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum. While students are likely to have seen the diagram of a flame, the specific application regarding a goldsmith is a high-recall fact often highlighted in textbooks.
*   **Computational Complexity: 1 (Minimal).** 
    There is no arithmetic or algebraic requirement. This is purely a qualitative, conceptual question.
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.** 
    The "Hindi-medium" background presents a significant hurdle here. Many students instinctively associate the brightest/most visible part of the flame (the yellow, luminous zone) with being the hottest. Additionally, translating the terms "outermost" or "non-luminous" from their native vocabulary to English requires a high degree of linguistic mapping. Confusion between "innermost" and "outermost" is a high-frequency error.
*   **Format Demand: Open-ended (Recall).** 
    The question requires a two-part response (Identification + Reasoning). Unlike Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs), students must produce the vocabulary themselves. For a student with limited English proficiency, articulating the reason ("it is the hottest part due to complete combustion") is significantly more difficult than simply naming the zone.
*   **Number Friendliness: Easy.** 
    Not applicable as this is a non-numerical science item.

**Holistic Estimation:** 
While the concept is taught, the requirement to provide a *reason* in English acts as a gatekeeper. Students may know the "Blue" part in their heads but struggle to write a grammatically or scientifically coherent reason in English to earn the full 1 mark. The abstraction of "non-luminous" vs. "luminous" is often a source of confusion in second-language learners.
