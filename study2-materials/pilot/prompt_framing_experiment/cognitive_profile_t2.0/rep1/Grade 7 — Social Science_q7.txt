- **Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. (While 'money' is a known daily entity, 'economic development' is an abstract macroeconomic concept for Grade 7. Most curricula at this level focus on trade, barter, or markets rather than the analytical link to systemic development.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1. (This is a conceptual/qualitative task, not quantitative.)
- **Common error traps:** Major. (Students often confuse 'economic development' with 'becoming rich' or 'personal wealth.' Additionally, in low-resource settings, 'digital money' may be misunderstood or limited to 'Google Pay' without understanding its broader economic role.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). No partial credit is possible as it is a binary 1-point rubric. The student must bridge two distinct parts: development roles and contemporary digital evaluation. 
- **Language/Socio-economic barrier:** The phrasing "Analyze role" and "Evaluate use" is cognitively demanding for ESL learners from Hindi-medium backgrounds, requiring higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) beyond rote memorization.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A.
