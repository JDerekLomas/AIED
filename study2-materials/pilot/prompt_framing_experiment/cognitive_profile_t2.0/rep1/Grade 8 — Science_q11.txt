- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The thermal expansion of solids is a standard Grade 8 topic in the NCERT/State Board syllabus, often illustrated with the railway track example.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. No calculation is required; the task involves data extraction from a provided table and qualitative reasoning.
- **Common error traps:** Minor. Some students might confuse "thermal expansion" with "conductivity" or fail to read the specific values in the table accurately if units are unfamiliar.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended/Multiple parts. While the rubric asks specifically for part (a) for the maximum score, the presence of parts (b) and (c) creates a cognitive load issue. Students from limited English backgrounds may struggle to articulate "Why" in English even if they understand the concept.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. Comparing values in a table to find the "highest" is a foundational data-handling skill.

**Analysis:**
The primary barrier for this specific demographic is linguistic. While the science concept is standard, translating the "why" in parts (b) and (c) into English poses a significant challenge. However, as the rubric specifically focuses on the data-retrieval task in part (a)—which is cognitively simpler and less dependent on complex sentence construction—a majority of students should identify the correct material.
