- Concept familiarity: very familiar (S-V-O structure is a foundation of Grade 6 English, and these specific vocabulary words are high-frequency)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Linear sequencing task)
- Common error traps: minor (Capitalization of "He" and terminal punctuation are common omissions, though the rubric focuses on word order; potential confusion between "a" and "is" placement)
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; binary scoring (1/0) increases difficulty as no partial credit is awarded for "Is he reading a book" or "He reading a book"
- Number friendliness: N/A (non-mathematical)

Holistic Analysis: While the vocabulary is accessible, Hindi-medium students often struggle with the specific placement of the auxiliary verb "is" (as Hindi is an SOV language: *Vah pustak padh raha hai*). However, "He is reading a book" is a prototypical example used in almost all foundational English modules in Indian government schools.
