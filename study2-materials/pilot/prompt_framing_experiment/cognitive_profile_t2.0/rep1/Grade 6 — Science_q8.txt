**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The role of water, sunlight, and soil in plant growth is a core topic in Grade 6 Science, though the term "stunted" may be unfamiliar to ESL learners).

**Computational complexity:** 1 (No calculation required).

**Common error traps:** Major (The term "infer" and "evidence" are high-level academic English vocabulary that may confuse students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. Students might also misinterpret "yellowing" as a sign of autumn/aging rather than a nutrient/light deficiency).

**Format demand:** Open-ended requires recall; The rubric allows for a variety of correct factors, but the student must formulate an original sentence in English, which is a significant hurdle.

**Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question).

**Holistic Estimate:** While the science concept is foundational, the linguistic barrier posed by the words "stunted," "infer," and "evidence" is high for this specific demographic. Students may understand the concept but struggle to express it under an open-ended format without translation support.
