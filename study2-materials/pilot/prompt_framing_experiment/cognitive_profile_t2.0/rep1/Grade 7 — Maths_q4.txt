**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Less familiar**. While Grade 7 students are taught decimal division, dividing a whole number by a decimal (where the divisor is larger than the dividend) is less common in standard drills compared to dividing decimals by integers.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps**. The student must: 1) Convert the divisor to a whole number (multiplying both by 10 to get $80 \div 72$), 2) Simplify the fraction or perform long division, and 3) Handle a recurring decimal outcome ($1.11...$), which adds a layer of conceptual difficulty for this age group.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major**. Students from this demographic often struggle with "decimal placement" and the "larger divisor" trap. Many may incorrectly calculate $7.2 \div 8$ (yielding 0.9) because they are more comfortable dividing by the larger looking integer, or fail to add the trailing zero to the 8 before dividing.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended**. The rubric requires the setup of the division. For students with limited English proficiency, the symbolic math is fine, but the lack of multiple-choice options prevents them from "back-calculating" from an answer. 
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Hard**. The result is a non-terminating, recurring decimal ($1.\overline{1}$). In Indian government school contexts, students are often conditioned to expect "clean" whole numbers or simple decimals. The $80/72$ ratio reduces to $10/9$, which is cognitively taxing to convert correctly under exam pressure.

**Estimation**
Given the linguistic and socio-economic context, many students will likely confuse the order of division or fail to correctly handle the decimal shift required to manage $7.2$ as a divisor.
