Concept familiarity: familiar (Plant growth is a core topic, though experimental data analysis is an emerging skill at Grade 6).
Computational complexity: 1 (Simple comparison of values in a table).
Common error traps: minor (Students might confuse "Partial Shade" with the ideal condition or struggle with the "Explain why" part).
Format demand: Open-ended (The three-part structure—identification, explanation, and terminology—requires both decoding and specific vocabulary: "Photosynthesis").
Number friendliness: easy (Assuming simple height measurements in the data table).

Holistic Analysis: While identifying the condition from the table is high-probability, parts (b) and (c) introduce significant linguistic and academic barriers for EWS students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. Translating the reasoning and recalling the technical term "Photosynthesis" in English increases the difficulty considerably.
