Concept familiarity: familiar (WH-questions are common, but the context depends on a specific reading comprehension passage).
Computational complexity: 1 (single-step retrieval of information).
Common error traps: minor (potential confusion between 'where' and 'when'; linguistic interference where students might identify the object 'old book' instead of the location).
Format demand: Open-ended; requires recall and production. Rubric is generous (allowing one-word answers), but students with low English proficiency often struggle to transcribe specific vocabulary like 'attic' correctly if they cannot find the spelling in the text.
Number friendliness: N/A (this is a linguistic task).

Your estimate:
0.65
