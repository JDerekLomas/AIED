Concept familiarity: **Familiar** (HCF is a core topic in Grade 6 NCERT/State Board curricula, though application-based word problems are slightly less practiced than direct calculation).
Computational complexity: **2-3** (Identifying the method, prime factorization or division of both numbers, and multiplying factors).
Common error traps: **Major** (Many students struggle to map the word "maximum" to HCF vs. LCM; others may stop at finding any common factor rather than the highest).
Format demand: **Recall** (Open-ended requires students to realize HCF is the required tool without prompts; however, the low score weight [0.5] implies a binary "right/wrong" outcome without much room for partial credit).
Number friendliness: **Moderate** (75 is easy, but 69 is frequently misidentified as a prime number by students at this level, potentially leading to errors in factorization).
Language Demand (Contextual Factor): **High** (The phrase "measure... an exact number of times" is linguistically complex for English Second Language learners in government schools).
