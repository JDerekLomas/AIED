**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Opposites/Antonyms are foundational components of the primary English curriculum in Indian schools. "Up/Down" is typically introduced in Grade 1 or 2.)

**Computational complexity:** 1 (Single-step retrieval)

**Common error traps:** None (The words are phonetically simple and high-frequency. There is little room for semantic confusion.)

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires recall and correct spelling of "down"). While it is open-ended, the word "down" is a high-frequency sight word. No partial credit is possible.

**Number friendliness:** Not applicable / Easy (The brevity of the words minimizes cognitive load for students with low English proficiency.)

**Psychometric Profile Analysis:** 
In the context of Indian government schools, even for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, "Up" and "Down" are among the first English lexical pairs acquired. They are often reinforced through classroom actions (TPR - Total Physical Response) and basic rhymes. The only barrier for a Grade 6 student in this demographic would be spelling (e.g., writing 'don' or 'dowan'), but the majority will have mastered this basic vocabulary over five years of primary schooling.
