- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. Unitary method (direct variation) is a core component of the Grade 6 and 7 NCERT curriculum.
- **Computational complexity:** 2-3 steps. 
    1. Converting the mixed fraction ($5 \frac{3}{4}$) to an improper fraction ($\frac{23}{4}$) or decimal ($5.75$).
    2. Multiplying by the whole number ($10$).
    3. Simplifying/Final calculation.
- **Common error traps:** Major. For students in this demographic, common bugs include:
    - Ignoring the fractional part and answering $50$ km.
    - Adding instead of multiplying ($10 + 5 \frac{3}{4}$).
    - Procedural errors in mixed fraction conversion (e.g., $(5 \times 3) + 4$).
    - Misplacement of the decimal point if converting to $5.75$.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). While the rubric identifies the operation, the max score of 1 implies a "correct answer only" binary. This lowers the success rate compared to multiple-choice where students could eliminate unlikely answers.
- **Number friendliness:** Moderate. While $10$ is easy to multiply, the denominator of $4$ into $10$ does not result in a whole number, requiring knowledge of fractions or decimals for the final result ($57.5$ or $57 \frac{1}{2}$).
