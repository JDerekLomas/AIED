- **Concept familiarity**: Very familiar. (Regional geography, especially landforms like the Thar Desert, is a foundational part of the NCERT Class 6 curriculum).
- **Computational complexity**: 1 (Identification task).
- **Common error traps**: Minor. (Students might confuse a 'landform' with a 'state' or 'city' if the term is not understood, or may struggle to differentiate between the Aravalli hills and the desert).
- **Format demand**: Open-ended/Descriptive. While identifying "Thar Desert" is simple recall, "briefly describe it" in English presents a significant hurdle for students with limited English proficiency. Partial credit is technically impossible given the 0.5 max score rubric, making it an "all or nothing" recall and expression task.
- **Number friendliness**: N/A.

**Holistic Estimate**:
While the content is highly familiar, the requirement to "briefly describe" in English for students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds creates a linguistic barrier. Many will identify the desert but struggle to formulate the description sentence required for the full 0.5 marks.
