- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Local landmarks and nature are standard topics in SCERT/NCERT curricula)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Linear structural demand of building sentences)
- Common error traps: Major (Tense inconsistency—switching between past for history and present for appearance—and Mother Tongue Influence (MTI) on syntax)
- Format demand: Open-ended; high demand. Since the Max Score is 1, it implies a "pass/fail" or "binary" marking where the student must meet all rubric criteria (appearance, history, importance) to get the point. Partial credit is not available.
- Number friendliness: N/A
