**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Rate of change and temperature are standard Grade 6 concepts in the Indian curriculum (NCERT), though connecting them to a temporal "rate" (increase per hour) is the primary cognitive bridge required.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** Students must (1) calculate the time elapsed, (2) multiply the rate by the time (6 x 2), and (3) add the result to the initial value (30 + 12).
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** In the context of Indian government schools, two significant hurdles exist: 
    1.  **Temporal Logic:** The shift from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM requires transitioning through the 12-hour cycle (midday), which frequently leads to calculation errors (e.g., subtracting 4 from 10 to get 6, or mistakenly identifying 14 hours).
    2.  **Linguistic Load:** Words like "increases" and "per hour" in English may pose barriers to students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, leading to a "no-attempt" or an incorrect operation (like adding 2 once).
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** The question requires the retrieval of steps and the final value. With no partial credit offered (binary 0/1), any minor arithmetic slip in the three steps results in zero points.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The digits (10, 30, 2, 4, 6) are small, low-magnitude integers that are easily manageable mentally.

**Holistic Estimation:**
The transition across the 12:00 PM threshold is the most significant psychometric "distractor" for 6th-grade students in this demographic. While the arithmetic is simple, the combined load of English proficiency and temporal reasoning will reduce the success rate.
