**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The concept of balanced diets and food groups is central to the Grade 6 Science curriculum in India, though the application to a specific scenario adds a layer of analysis).

**Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational qualitative analysis).

**Common error traps:** Minor (Students might incorrectly identify a specific vitamin (e.g., Vitamin C) instead of the food category (milk/dairy) or struggle with the language "missing in his diet," confusing it with what is present).

**Format demand:** High (Open-ended recall requires the student to construct an English sentence; however, the rubric allows for a single word, which lowers the barrier. The second part of the prompt—"Prepare a diet chart"—is cognitively demanding but technically ignored by the 1-point binary rubric).

**Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A).

**Psychometric Analysis:** 
For this demographic, the primary hurdle is linguistic. While the science (identifying milk/calcium) is intuitive, the phrasing "he has ate" (grammatically poor) and the multi-part nature of the question (asking for a missing item AND a diet chart) can confuse students with low English proficiency. Many may focus on drawing a chart and forget to explicitly name "milk," failing the rubric despite understanding the concept.
