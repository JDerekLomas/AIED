- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. Pasteurization is a core topic in the "Microorganisms: Friend and Foe" chapter of the NCERT Class 8 curriculum. While the concept is taught, the application in daily life (packet milk) is relatable to many urban and semi-urban students.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. The item is qualitative/descriptive and does not require active calculations, though it requires recalling specific numerical parameters.
- **Common error traps:** Minor to Major. Students frequently confuse pasteurization with simple boiling or sterilization. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle to express the "quick cooling" step accurately in English, even if they understand the concept.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This is high demand for the target demographic. Without a word bank or multiple-choice options, students must retrieve three distinct steps (heat, time, quick-cool) from memory and synthesize them into a coherent sentence. Since the rubric is 0/1 (no partial credit), any missing step results in a total loss of marks.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. The numbers (70 and 15–30) are easy to remember, though the rubric's lenient stance on these figures helps lower the threshold.

**Estimated Success Rate:**
The shift from understanding to written production in a non-native language, combined with the binary scoring (1 or 0), creates a significant barrier. While many students will know it involves heating milk, fewer will accurately specify the "quick cooling" and "preservation" link in written English.
