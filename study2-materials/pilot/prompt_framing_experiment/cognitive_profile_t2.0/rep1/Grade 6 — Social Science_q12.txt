### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

**Concept familiarity: Familiar**
The National Emblem (Lion Capital) is introduced as early as Grade 3 in EVS (Environmental Studies) and revisited in Grade 6 History within the chapter on Emperor Ashoka. While the visual of the currency note is ubiquitous, the formal association with "Ashoka" and the term "National Emblem" is a core curriculum requirement.

**Computational complexity: 1**
This is a non-computational, qualitative question.

**Common error traps: Minor**
Students may recognize the lions but lack the specific terminology ("Lion Capital" or "Ashoka"). A common "bug" for this demographic is providing a functional answer (e.g., "to show it is Indian money") rather than the historical/symbolic origin required by the rubric.

**Format demand: Open-ended**
This requires high-level recall and the ability to construct a sentence in English. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the transition to Grade 6 often involves a significant leap in expressive English requirements. The rubric is binary (0 or 1), making it difficult for students who have the conceptual knowledge but lack the precise vocabulary to score.

**Number friendliness: Easy**
Not applicable, as no numerical processing is required.

**Psychometric Holistic Estimation**
The discrepancy between the students' visual familiarity with currency and their ability to articulate the specific historical origin in English (as per the rubric) creates a "linguistic-conceptual gap." While many would recognize the symbol, fewer will correctly link it to both Ashoka and the National Emblem in a written format without the scaffolding of a multiple-choice structure.
