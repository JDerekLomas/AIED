Concept familiarity: **Familiar** (Fractions and the operator "of" are central to the Class 7 NCERT curriculum).

Computational complexity: **4+ steps** (Multiplying first set, multiplying second set, finding a common denominator for comparison, and final inequality comparison).

Common error traps: **Major** (Forgetting to compare after multiplying; difficulty in finding common denominators like 120 or cross-multiplying; potential confusion between "of" and division).

Format demand: **High** (Open-ended "show your calculations" prevents guessing; the rubric is binary/dichotomous (Score 1), making it harder to earn credit than if partial points were allowed).

Number friendliness: **Moderate** (The multiplication is simple, but the comparison results in fractions `3/8` and `4/15` which require comparing denominators that are not multiples of each other).
