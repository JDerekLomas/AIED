**Cognitive Difficulty Profile:**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** Less familiar. While the poem is part of the standard curriculum, the abstract philosophical concepts (freedom vs. materialism) and the "paradox" of the last bargain require higher-order thinking skills that are often challenging for students transitioning from rote memorization to literary analysis.
*   **Computational Complexity:** N/A (1 for baseline qualitative processing).
*   **Common Error Traps:** Major. Students from this background often struggle with the word "Bargain," interpreting it strictly in a commercial or market context. They frequently mistake the plot (narrative summary) for the theme (underlying message), or confuse "power/wealth" as the desired outcome rather than the rejected elements.
*   **Format Demand:** High. Open-ended questions in English require active recall and sentence construction. For Hindi-medium students, the linguistic "encoding" of a complex philosophical idea into grammatically correct English poses a significant barrier even if the concept is understood. No partial credit is available (1/0 scoring).
*   **Number Friendliness:** N/A (1 for baseline).

**Holistic Estimation:**
The abstraction of the theme combined with the English language proficiency gap in economically weaker sections creates a significant hurdle. Many students may describe *what happens* in the poem but will struggle to articulate *why* it happens (the theme) in a way that meets the rubric.
