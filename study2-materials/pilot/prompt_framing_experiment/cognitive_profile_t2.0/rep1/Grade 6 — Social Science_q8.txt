- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (While the concept of "rights" is introduced in Grade 6 Social Science/Civics, it often remains abstract compared to physical geography or history).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical item).
- **Common error traps:** Major (The "Importance" component requires subjective synthesis; students often confuse specific constitutional "rights" with general "needs" or moral behaviors).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires high recall and the linguistic ability to explain a justification; according to the rubric, no partial credit is available for a score of 1).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A).

**Holistic Estimation:** For students in government schools with English as a second language, the "explain" requirement creates a significant barrier. While many may identify two rights (e.g., Education, Protection), articulating the "importance" of one in English—especially when no partial credit is awarded—will likely lead to a low full-mastery rate.
