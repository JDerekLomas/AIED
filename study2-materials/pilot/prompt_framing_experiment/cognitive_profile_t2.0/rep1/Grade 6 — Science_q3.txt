- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (This is a foundational concept introduced in primary classes and repeated in Grade 6 Science Chapter 9/Unit 1 of the NCERT curriculum).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical task; requires basic categorization).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse "movement" as an exclusive trait of living things, failing to account for plants, or might list "needs water" and "needs food" as two separate points when they are functionally similar in a rubric).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended recall. This poses a significant barrier for students with limited English proficiency. While the concept is simple, articulating "reproduction" or "response to stimuli" in a second language is a high cognitive load task compared to a multiple-choice format. 
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Non-numerical).

**Analysis for EWS/Hindi-medium context:** 
The concept is universally understood by this age group. However, the requirement to provide "two key characteristics" in English for a written response often leads to incomplete answers or grammatical struggles. Since the rubric allows for simple terms like "grow" or "breathe," many students will capture the first point (0.25), but fewer will successfully articulate four distinct points (two for each category) to gain full marks if the grading is strict.
