**Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. While basic division is taught, "round-up" logic for minimum requirements in word problems is less frequently practiced than simple remainder-finding.
**Computational complexity:** 2-3 steps. 1) Identifying the division requirement, 2) Calculating the multiple needed (320), and 3) Secondary calculation for distribution per class.
**Common error traps:** Major. Most students will simply calculate 300 ÷ 80 and provide the quotient (3) or the remainder (60). The phrasing "minimum number of chocolates required" is a common semantic trap in Indian assessments where students look for a numerical result within the text.
**Format demand:** High. No partial credit is allowed (Maximum score 1), requiring both the logic leap to 320 and the final class distribution to be exact.
**Number friendliness:** Moderate. While multiples of 10 are generally "easy," the secondary division of 320 by 8 classes (if reached) is manageable, but the initial logical hurdle is high.

**Holistic Estimate:** In government school contexts, the linguistic barrier of "minimum required" versus "how many were distributed" often leads students to simply divide 300 by 80. Furthermore, the two-part nature of the question (Total needed + distribution per class) with an all-or-nothing score significantly lowers the probability of full correctness.
