- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The imagery of sunset and birds returning is common in curriculum and folk literature; however, extracting specific sensory details from a text is a standard mid-level reading comprehension skill.)
- **Computational complexity:** 0 (Non-mathematical item)
- **Common error traps:** Major (Students often struggle with "What" questions by providing a general summary of the scene rather than isolating specific auditory cues. The linguistic transition from identifying a "sound" to phrasing "birds chirping" or "birds returning" in English is a common bottleneck for ESL learners.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended/Recall; Must be exact (The rubric is binary [0/1], requiring a specific conceptual link. For students with limited proficiency, formulating a coherent English sentence or phrase without a multiple-choice prompt increases the cognitive load significantly.)
- **Number friendliness:** N/A
