Concept familiarity: familiar (Neutralization is a core topic in Grade 7 Science, often taught with these specific real-world examples).
Computational complexity: 1 (No calculations involved).
Common error traps: major (Students often swap the pH properties of the stings, e.g., mistakenly believing a bee sting is alkaline).
Format demand: Open-ended recall; requires the ability to explain the relationship in English, which poses a linguistic barrier for this specific demographic even if they understand the science.
Number friendliness: N/A (Qualitative question).
