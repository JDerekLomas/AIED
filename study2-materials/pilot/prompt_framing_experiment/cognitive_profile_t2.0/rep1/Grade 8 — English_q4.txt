Concept familiarity: Less familiar (While 'wind' is a basic vocabulary word, 'breeze' is often introduced as Tier 2 vocabulary. Students in Hindi-medium environments typically rely on 'wind' or 'air' and may lack the nuanced synonym association required here).

Computational complexity: 1 (This is a single-step retrieval task).

Common error traps: Major (Students frequently confuse "breeze" with other weather-related terms in a passage like "storm," "cool," or "cloud." In English Language Learner contexts, the phonetic similarity to "freeze" or the lack of specific contextual clues can lead to misidentification).

Format demand: Open-ended/Recall (This is high demand. There are no options to provide a scaffold. The student must accurately scan the text, understand the definition provided in the stem, and match it precisely. No partial credit).

Number friendliness: Easy (Not applicable as a mathematical dimension, but the word length is short).
