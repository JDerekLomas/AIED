### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
Algebraic expressions and identities are a core part of the Grade 8 NCERT syllabus. In Indian government schools, the distributive law (FOIL method) is extensively practiced; however, the transition from monomial multiplication to binomial multiplication is where many students first struggle.

**Computational Complexity: 4+**
The task requires several discrete operations:
1. Expanding the terms: $3a(2a) + 3a(3b) - 2b(2a) - 2b(3b)$.
2. Multiplying coefficients ($3\times2$, $3\times3$, $2\times2$, $2\times3$).
3. Managing variable powers ($a \times a = a^2$).
4. Combining like terms ($9ab - 4ab$).

**Common Error Traps: Major**
For this specific demographic, three primary traps exist:
*   **Integer Signs:** Handling the $-2b$ during distribution (specifically the $-2b \times +3b = -6b^2$) is a frequent point of failure.
*   **Variable Consistency:** Mixing up $ab$ and $ba$ or failing to recognize them as like terms.
*   **Index Laws:** Forgetting the squared term ($a^2$, $b^2$) and writing $6a$ instead of $6a^2$.

**Format Demand: Recall/Procedural (Strict)**
Since the rubric requires a correct expansion/final result for a single point, there is no buffer for minor arithmetic slips. For students with limited English proficiency, the word "Product" (often taught in Hindi as *Gunanfal*) is a keyword they must recognize to initiate the procedure.

**Number Friendliness: Easy**
The coefficients (2 and 3) are small, single-digit integers. There are no fractions or decimals, which reduces the pure arithmetic load, though the algebraic manipulation remains the primary hurdle.

**Estimated Success Rate:**
While the numbers are "friendly," the combination of sign rules and the "all-or-nothing" scoring rubric significantly lowers the expected success rate in a government school context where procedural fluency in algebra is often inconsistent.
