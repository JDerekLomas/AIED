- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Civics curriculum in Grade 8 covers the role of Parliament extensively, but the abstract link between 'representation' and 'necessity' can be challenging).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical/Conceptual).
- **Common error traps:** Major (Students often confuse Parliament with the Government/Executive or provide tautological answers like "to run the country" without identifying representation or law-making functions).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires productive language skills; students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle to articulate the concepts of "representation" or "legislation" in English even if they understand the concept).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A).

**Holistic Estimation:** While the topic is central to the syllabus, the linguistic barrier for students from economically weaker sections in English-medium assessments, combined with the need to explain an abstract democratic function (rather than just naming a part of Parliament), typically results in moderate success rates. Many will provide vague or structurally incomplete answers that do not hit the specific rubric markers.
