**Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The Vedic period is a core component of the Grade 6 History curriculum (NCERT). Students are introduced to the shift from pastoralism to agriculture, though they often conflate the Early and Later Vedic periods.

**Computational complexity:** 1. There are no mathematical operations involved.

**Common error traps:** Minor. A primary trap for this cohort is the transition between the Early Vedic (Pastoralism) and Later Vedic (Agriculture) periods. Students may confuse these or struggle to differentiate them from the Harappan urban economy (Trade/Crafts). 

**Format demand:** High. This is a two-part open-ended question requiring recall and descriptive writing in English. For Hindi-medium students with limited English proficiency, "describing a key aspect" presents a significant linguistic barrier, even if they possess the conceptual knowledge. The rubric's "Maximum score: 1" implies no partial credit, making it an "all or nothing" demand.

**Number friendliness:** Easy. No numbers are used in the prompt or required in the response.

**Holistic Estimate:** While the concept is foundational, the requirement to produce a written description in English is a major hurdle for students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds. The inability to get partial credit (0.5) under a 1-point rubric further suppresses the success rate.
