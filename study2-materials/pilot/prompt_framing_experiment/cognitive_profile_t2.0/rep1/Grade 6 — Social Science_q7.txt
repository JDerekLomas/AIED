- Concept familiarity: **Familiar** (State-specific resources are central to the Class 6 Geography/EVS curriculum, though distinguishing "natural" from "man-made" can sometimes confuse students).
- Computational complexity: **1** (No arithmetic involved; requires categorization and causal reasoning).
- Common error traps: **Minor** (Students may list cultural artifacts or landmarks instead of "natural" resources, or fail to provide the "influence" explanation required for the full point).
- Format demand: **High** (Open-ended recall in English. For Hindi-medium students, articulating the "influence" of a resource on human life involves complex sentence construction beyond simple vocabulary).
- Number friendliness: **Easy** (Non-numeric).

**Analysis:** While the content is relatable, the linguistic barrier is the primary bottleneck. The requirement to explain "influence" (cause and effect) in a second language poses a significant challenge for Grade 6 students from this demographic, even if they possess the conceptual knowledge.
