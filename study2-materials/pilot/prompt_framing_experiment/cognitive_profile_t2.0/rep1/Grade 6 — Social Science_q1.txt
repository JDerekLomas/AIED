**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar.** Geography curricula in Indian government schools introduce the "Physical Features of India" early. The Himalayas are an iconic cultural and geographic symbol frequently discussed in both Social Science and Hindi textbooks, making the concept highly accessible even to students with lower academic engagement.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1 (Not applicable).** This is a purely retrieval-based task with no mathematical processing required.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** The primary "trap" for this specific demographic is language-based rather than conceptual. Students may struggle to spell names like "Aravalli" or "Western Ghats" in English. However, because the rubric only asks to "Name" them and typically rewards phonetically recognizable attempts in this context, the conceptual barrier remains low.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended recall.** Unlike multiple-choice, this requires active retrieval. However, since the student only needs to name *one* range (despite the question asking for two) to satisfy the 0.5-point rubric provided in your prompt, the burden of recall is significantly reduced.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy (Not applicable).**

**Analysis:**
The item tests basic geographical literacy. While the students are from Hindi-medium backgrounds, mountain ranges like the "Himalayas" or "Vindhyachal" are part of the common vernacular. The biggest hurdle—writing in English—is offset by the high familiarity of the Himalayas. Most students in Grade 6 will be able to provide at least one correct name.
