- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Ashoka is a central pillar of the Grade 6/7 History syllabus in India, often revisited through school assemblies and symbols like the Lion Capital).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No arithmetic required).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse Ashoka with other Mauryan or Gupta rulers; some may focus only on the Kalinga war without explaining the subsequent "significance" or governance).
- **Format demand:** High (Open-ended, descriptive, and requires English proficiency to synthesize concepts into a coherent explanation; though partial credit isn't allowed by the 0/1 rubric, the conceptual bar for "significance" is high).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Dates/years are secondary to the narrative significance).
