- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. Bar graphs are introduced in Grade 6 in NCERT curricula, so Grade 7 students have seen the concept, but mastery of "scale" remains a developmental hurdle.
- **Computational complexity:** 2-3 steps. Students must find the range, determine a scale (division), and map specific values to physical heights on the paper.
- **Common error traps:** Major. For this specific demographic, the most common errors are inconsistent scaling (e.g., using 10, 20, 50 on the same axis), failure to label axes, and misinterpreting the "minimum/maximum" values if the visual representation is drawn incorrectly.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. This is a high-demand task as it requires synthesis (construction) rather than just recognition. Since the prompt specifies the rubric for the maximum score (1 mark), the lack of partial credit for a messy or unscaled graph significantly lowers the success rate.
- **Number friendliness:** Moderate. Depending on the data values (not provided but implied by typical NCERT patterns), choosing a scale that isn't 1:1 requires division and spatial reasoning.

**Holistic Analysis:** While part (b) is high-success, the requirement for a fully correct, labeled, and consistently scaled bar graph for the 1-mark maximum is a significant barrier for students with limited resources (who may lack graph paper or steady geometric practice) and Hindi-medium backgrounds where the technical English vocabulary of "scale" and "axes" can be a point of confusion.
