Concept familiarity: familiar (Vocabulary extraction is a standard task, but "glowing" may be a secondary synonym for students whose primary vocabulary link for "shining" is "bright" or "star".)

Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step identification/retrieval.)

Common error traps: minor (Students often struggle with "synonymy" and may pick words that look similar to "shining" rather than meanings. They might also pick a phrase rather than a single word.)

Format demand: Open-ended (Exact recall/copying required; no partial credit allowed. For ELL students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the jump from a conceptual understanding to an exact lexical match in a second language is a significant barrier.)

Number friendliness: N/A
