**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. In the Indian Grade 6 Science curriculum (NCERT), the chapter "Fibre to Fabric" specifically covers the utility of cotton in Indian climatic conditions. Students living in economically weaker sections also have high daily-life exposure to cotton as a functional fabric rather than synthetic alternatives.

**Computational complexity:** 1. This is a qualitative explanation task with no mathematical requirements.

**Common error traps:** Minor. While the concept is intuitive, the linguistic bridge—translating the functional observation ("it's comfortable") into a scientific property ("absorbs sweat" or "breathable")—is where Hindi-medium students may stumble. There is a risk of tautological reasoning (e.g., "we wear it because it is cool").

**Format demand:** Open-ended. This requires active recall and sentence construction. While the rubric is flexible, students with limited English proficiency may struggle to express "porous" or "absorption" accurately in English, even if they understand the science.

**Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Holistic Estimate:** Given that this is a foundational concept with high practical relevance, the primary barrier is not the science but the English-language expression of the "property." Most students will identify "sweat" as the key factor, which fits the rubric.
