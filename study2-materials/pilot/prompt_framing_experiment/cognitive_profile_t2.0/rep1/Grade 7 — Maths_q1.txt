Concept familiarity: familiar (Integers are introduced in Grade 6 and reinforced in Grade 7)
Computational complexity: 1 (Single multiplication step)
Common error traps: major (Students often struggle with sign rules or confuse them with addition rules, e.g., thinking -3 + -4 = -7 means -3 × -4 = -12)
Format demand: exact (Open-ended requires recall of rules; no partial credit for a 1-mark item)
Number friendliness: easy (Single-digit multiplication 3 × 4 is well within the mental math range for this cohort)
