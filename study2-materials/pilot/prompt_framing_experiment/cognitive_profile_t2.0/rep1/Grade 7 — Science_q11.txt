- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Evaporation is a core 7th-grade topic, though the "impurity/solute" effect on rate is more commonly emphasized in later grades, the data interpretation makes it accessible).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Simple comparison of values in a table; no calculations required for part a).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Some students may confuse "largest number" with "fastest," associating magnitude with speed rather than time).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended; partial credit likely if rubric splits (a) and (b). Part (b) requires explaining the effect of a non-volatile solute, which is a significant hurdle for students with limited English proficiency.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Comparing whole numbers representing time).

**Holistic Estimation:** While most students will correctly identify "Liquid A" (Petrol) by comparing numbers in the table, a significant portion of Hindi-medium students from economically weaker sections will struggle to articulate the scientific reasoning required for part (b) in English. The abstraction of "salt particles hindering evaporation" is a higher-order concept compared to the data extraction in part (a).
