### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

*   **Concept Familiarity: Very Familiar**
    Linear equations in one variable are a core component of the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum (Chapter 2). By this stage, students have encountered basic additive transformations since Grade 6.
*   **Computational Complexity: 1 Step**
    The problem requires a single inverse operation (subtraction) to isolate the variable.
*   **Common Error Traps: Major**
    The result is a negative integer ($y = -5$). In Indian government schools, many students from Hindi-medium or disadvantaged backgrounds struggle with the conceptual transition from whole numbers to directed numbers (integers). A common "procedural bug" is subtracting the smaller number from the larger ($9 - 4 = 5$), or assuming the operation is $4 + 9$ because of the plus sign in the equation.
*   **Format Demand: Open-ended**
    As a constructed-response item, there are no distractors to guide the student. While the rubric specifies $1$ mark for the correct answer, in classroom settings, partial credit might be given for transposition ($y = 4 - 9$), but the final output remains binary here.
*   **Number Friendliness: Easy**
    The digits (4, 9) are single-digit integers within the standard 1-10 range, requiring no complex long-form calculation.

### Holistic Assessment
While the algebra is "Level 1," the requirement to produce a negative result acts as a significant "difficulty attractor" for Grade 8 students in this demographic. Proficiency in integer arithmetic (especially where the subtrahend is larger than the minuend) often lags behind procedural knowledge of equation balancing.
