- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Deforestation is a recurring theme in Environmental Science across Grades 6-8, making it a recognizable topic).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical item; qualitative reasoning only).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students might focus on the tool [the axe] rather than the broader ecological process [deforestation]. In part (b), students might list irrelevant environmental issues like pollution instead of climate change or soil erosion).
- **Format demand:** High (Open-ended recall. Despite the simple rubric, students with limited English proficiency often struggle to articulate long-term "consequences" in written English, even if they understand the concept).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question).

**Holistic Analysis:**
The core concept (trees being cut) is highly accessible. However, the requirement to explain "consequences sustained for a long time" in English presents a significant linguistic hurdle for this specific demographic. While many will answer part (a) correctly, a substantial number of Grade 8 students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds may struggle to produce a scientifically coherent sentence for part (b) in English without resorting to mother-tongue transliteration or very simple, one-word answers.
