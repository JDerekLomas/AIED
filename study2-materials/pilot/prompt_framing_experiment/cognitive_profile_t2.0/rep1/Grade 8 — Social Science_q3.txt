- **Concept familiarity**: Familiar. Soil formation is a core geography topic in the NCERT Grade 8 curriculum (Chapter: "Resources and Development"). It is frequently tested in mid-term and annual exams.
- **Computational complexity**: 1. This is a pure retrieval task with no arithmetic involved.
- **Common error traps**: Minor. Students might confuse "factors" with "types" of soil (e.g., answering "Alluvial") or list "water" and "air" (components rather than formation factors). For Hindi-medium students, the technical terminology in English (e.g., "Parent rock" or "Topography") may pose a slight recall hurdle.
- **Format demand**: Open-ended. This requires active recall rather than recognition. However, since the rubric accepts any one of five possible factors, the "surface area" for a correct response is high. Partial credit is not possible for a 1-mark question.
- **Number friendliness**: Easy/Not applicable.

**Holistic Estimate**: Given that this is a fundamental definition-based question and the rubric allows for multiple correct interpretations, even students with limited English proficiency are likely to have memorized at least one single-word or short-phrase answer (like "Climate" or "Time").
