### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
Linear equations in one variable are a core part of the Class 8 NCERT syllabus. While "cross-multiplication" is a standard technique taught for this specific structure, students often struggle when terms are presented as fractions rather than integers.

**Computational Complexity: 4+ steps**
The item requires several sequential shifts: 
1. Cross-multiplication: $5(x-5) = 3(x-3)$
2. Distribution of constants: $5x - 25 = 3x - 9$
3. Transposition of variables: $5x - 3x = -9 + 25$
4. Final calculation: $2x = 16 \rightarrow x = 8$.

**Common Error Traps: Major**
Students from these backgrounds frequently encounter two major "bugs": 
1. **The Partial Distribution Error:** Multiplying only the $x$ and forgetting to multiply the constants (e.g., $5x - 5 = 3x - 3$).
2. **Sign Management:** Errors in transposing negative numbers across the equal sign (e.g., writing $-9 - 25$ instead of $-9 + 25$).

**Format Demand: High**
The question is open-ended, requiring a procedural recall rather than recognition (as in MCQs). Per the provided rubric, a score of 1 requires reaching the linear equation correctly, but for many low-resource schools, the lack of partial credit means any early arithmetic slip results in a zero.

**Number Friendliness: Moderate**
While 3 and 5 are small primes, the final result $x=8$ is a clean integer. However, the initial multiplication ($5 \times 5 = 25$, $3 \times 3 = 9$) and the subtraction ($25 - 9$) can be stumbling blocks for students with low numeracy fluency.
