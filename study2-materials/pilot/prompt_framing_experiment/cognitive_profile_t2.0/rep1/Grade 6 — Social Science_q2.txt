- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. (History of Rajasthan, particularly figures like Maharana Pratap and Prithviraj Chauhan, is deeply embedded in the local culture, folklore, and state-level textbooks in Rajasthan.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1. (Simple factual recall/listing; no arithmetic involved.)
- **Common error traps:** Minor. (Students might confuse the specific "medieval" timeframe with the ancient or modern eras, though most local heroes taught are medieval. Spelling errors in English for Hindi-medium students are common, but rubrics usually allow phonetic proximity.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). While recall is harder than recognition, these specific names are "household words" in the region. Partial credit is mentioned in the rubric (naming "any" two, implying a threshold for the 0.5 score).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. (Low cognitive load regarding numbers.)

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given the strong cultural resonance and the central role these figures play in the Grade 6 Social Science curriculum (especially within the Rajasthan Board or NCERT frameworks used in the state), students from EWS and Hindi-medium backgrounds are likely to find this question highly accessible. The primary barrier is writing the names in English, but the high level of familiarity compensates for the linguistic shift.
