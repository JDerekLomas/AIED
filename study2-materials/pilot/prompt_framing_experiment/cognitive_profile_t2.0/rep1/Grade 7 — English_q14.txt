- **Concept familiarity**: Less familiar (While "ancient" and "modern" are in the Grade 7 curriculum, English-medium vocabulary recall is challenging for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds who may know the concepts in Hindi—*pracheen* and *aadhunik*—but struggle to map them to the English terms).
- **Computational complexity**: 1 (Single-step retrieval).
- **Common error traps**: Minor (Confusion with synonyms, or phonological interference/spelling errors such as "new" vs. "now").
- **Format demand**: Open-ended; requires active recall of specific vocabulary without a word bank; no partial credit.
- **Number friendliness**: N/A.
