**Concept familiarity: Very familiar**
Articles are a core component of the English curriculum starting from primary grades. By Grade 7, students have encountered these rules (vowel vs. consonant sounds and definite articles for specific places like a zoo) multiple times.

**Computational complexity: 1**
In a linguistic context, this requires a single-layer retrieval of grammatical rules. However, it requires applying three distinct rules within one sentence.

**Common error traps: Major**
For this specific demographic, the "H-vowel" and "Vowel-sound" distinction is a frequent hurdle, though "elephant" is a standard textbook example. The primary trap is the definite article "the" for "zoo," as many Hindi-medium students may over-rely on indefinite articles or omit the article entirely (as articles do not exist in the same way in Hindi syntax).

**Format demand: High**
The rubric requires rewriting the *entire* sentence. For students with limited English proficiency and lower writing fluency, the risk of a "mechanical error" (spelling, capitalization, or forgetting a word) is high. Since the rubric allows no partial credit (0 or 1), a student who gets the articles right but misses a word in the rewrite will fail.

**Number friendliness: Easy (Linguistic equivalent)**
The vocabulary used ("saw," "elephant," "tiger," "zoo") consists of high-frequency "sight words" that are typically among the first words taught in Indian English-medium or government school bridge courses.

**Holistic Estimate:**
While the grammar is foundational, the combination of three blanks and the strict requirement to rewrite the entire sentence correctly creates a high threshold for "economically weaker section" students who may struggle with orthography and meticulous transcription.
