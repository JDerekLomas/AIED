- Concept familiarity: very familiar (Seasonal changes are part of daily life and early primary curriculum in EVS and languages.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (The cognitive task involves direct identification and retrieval of a specific vocabulary word.)
- Common error traps: minor (Phonetic spelling errors such as 'saummar' for summer or 'winner' for winter may occur, though the concept is clear.)
- Format demand: Open-ended (Though the prompt asks for a paragraph, the rubric explicitly awards the 1 mark solely for naming the season. This makes the functional requirement "identification" rather than "composition.")
- Number friendliness: easy
