**Concept familiarity: Very familiar**
Antonyms are a core component of the Grade 6 English curriculum. "Slow" and "fast" are high-frequency, basic vocabulary words introduced as early as Grade 2 or 3 in the Indian school system.

**Computational complexity: 1**
This is a single-step retrieval task. It requires zero arithmetic or multi-stage processing.

**Common error traps: Minor**
Students might confuse "opposite" with "synonym" if the term is unfamiliar in English, potentially leading to words like "gradual." Others might make spelling errors (e.g., "fasht") due to phonetic interference from Hindi/regional dialects.

**Format demand: Open-ended**
This requires recall rather than recognition (it is not a multiple-choice question). While there is no partial credit, "fast" is a simple, four-letter word that is phonetically consistent, making the demand for the exact answer relatively low for this grade level.

**Number friendliness: N/A**
This is a linguistic task with no numerical components.

**Estimated Holistic Difficulty:**
Despite the students' Hindi-medium backgrounds, "fast" is a common "loan-word" or globally recognized term used in everyday Indian vernacular. It is one of the most basic linguistic associations taught in remedial and standard English programs.
