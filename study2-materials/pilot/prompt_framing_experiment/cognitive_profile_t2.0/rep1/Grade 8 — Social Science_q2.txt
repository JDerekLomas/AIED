**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (The Harappan Civilization is a core, recurring topic in the NCERT Class 6 and 8 curricula, often emphasized in Indian government school classrooms.)

**Computational complexity:** 1 (No arithmetic steps; purely conceptual retrieval.)

**Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse "Citadel" with general forts or provide overly brief answers like "bricks" without describing the *use* or *planning* aspect as required by the "Describe" command.)

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires recall and sentence construction. While the rubric is flexible, the limited English proficiency of students from Hindi-medium backgrounds makes "describing" in English significantly harder than identifying a feature in a multiple-choice format.)

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Non-numerical item.)

**Holistic Analysis:** While the topic is a staple of the social science syllabus and students are likely to know the facts in their native language, the demand to "describe" in English acts as a significant barrier. Students may recall keywords like "drainage" or "grid" but struggle to form a coherent descriptive sentence. However, because it is a high-frequency exam topic with multiple acceptable answers, the success rate remains relatively high.
