### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
The distributive property is introduced in Grade 6 and reinforced in Grade 7 and 8 within the "Rational Numbers" chapter of the NCERT curriculum. While students are taught to expand brackets, using the property for "common factor extraction" is a standard practice problem.

**Computational Complexity: 4+ steps**
The item requires several sequential operations: 
1. Identifying the common factor ($9/16$).
2. Setting up the bracket $(4/12 - 3/9)$.
3. Finding a common denominator for the fractions inside (LCM of 12 and 9).
4. Performing subtraction with signed numbers.
5. Final multiplication and simplification.

**Common Error Traps: Major**
Students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds often struggle with:
*   **Signage:** The transition from adding a negative to simple subtraction $(+(-3/9) \to -1/3)$.
*   **Fraction Fluency:** Managing the denominators 12 and 9 requires a firm grasp of LCM/equivalent fractions. 
*   **Property Misapplication:** Some may solve both products first then add, ignoring the instruction to use the "distributive property," which leads to higher arithmetic errors.

**Format Demand: High (Open-ended)**
Since the rubric requires a specific application of the distributive property for 1 mark (likely all-or-nothing), there is no safety net for a student who knows the property but makes a minor calculation error.

**Number Friendliness: Moderate**
While $9/16$ and $4/12$ are familiar, they do not result in "neat" integers immediately. However, the fractions $4/12$ ($1/3$) and $3/9$ ($1/3$) simplify significantly if the student has the intuition to reduce before computing—a skill often lacking in rote-learned environments.
