### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept familiarity: Less familiar**
While money is a daily-life concept, the use of low-denomination "paise" coins (10p, 20p) is virtually extinct in modern Indian circulation. Students from economically weaker sections deal with physical currency frequently, but likely have zero physical interaction with 10p or 20p coins, making this a "textbook-only" abstract exercise rather than a contextual one.

**Computational complexity: 4+**
The item requires several distinct stages:
1. Multi-step multiplication (10 × 10, 5 × 20, 16 × 50).
2. Addition of products (100 + 100 + 800).
3. Unit conversion (Paise to Rupee division by 100).
4. Final division by the target denomination (Total ÷ 5).

**Common error traps: Major**
There are two significant hurdles: 
- **Decimal/Unit Placement:** The transition from 1000 paise to 10 Rupees is a frequent point of failure. 
- **Final Denomiation:** Students often stop after finding the total value (₹10) and fail to perform the final step of "How many ₹5 coins," leading to an answer of 10 or 1000 instead of 2.

**Format demand: Open-ended**
As a constructed-response item with a low maximum score (0.5), it demands high precision. In government school settings, multi-step word problems without options (MCQs) see a significant drop in success due to "blank page syndrome" among students with low English proficiency.

**Number friendliness: Moderate**
While the multipliers (10, 5, 16) and bases (10, 20, 50) result in round numbers, the cumulative nature of the task increases the probability of a calculation slip.

**Holistic Estimate:**
The language barrier ("How many... can be made from...") combined with the obsolescence of the coins mentioned will cause significant confusion. Many students will struggle to translate the English phrasing into the required mathematical operations.
