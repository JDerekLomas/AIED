**Concept familiarity: Less familiar.** While Grade 7 curricula include parts of speech, identifying "around" as an adverb is conceptually challenging. Most students are taught to associate "around" as a preposition. Distinguishing between a preposition (requiring an object) and an adverb of place/direction requires a level of linguistic nuance often missing in rote-learning environments.

**Computational complexity: 1.** This is a single-step classification task.

**Common error traps: Major.** The primary trap is the "prepositional bias." In standard Indian ESL textbooks, words like "around," "in," and "on" are introduced almost exclusively as prepositions. Without an object following the word (e.g., "around the tree"), students lack the structural cue they rely on and are highly likely to misclassify it based on prior memorization rather than functional analysis.

**Format demand: Open-ended.** The question requires pure recall. In Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English nomenclature for parts of speech is often secondary to translation, making the exact terminology harder to retrieve without multiple-choice prompts. No partial credit is possible.

**Number friendliness: N/A.**
