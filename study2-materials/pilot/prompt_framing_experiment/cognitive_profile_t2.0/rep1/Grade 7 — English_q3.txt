- Concept familiarity: familiar (The story "Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy is a staple in the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum and is frequently discussed.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Linear processing: Identifying the king's motivation from a single context.)
- Common error traps: major (Students often struggle with the grammatical transformation required to answer a "Why" question beginning with "the king felt..."—often reverting to "The king felt because..." and mixing tenses. Translation interference from Hindi to English often results in fragmented syntax.)
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; no partial credit allowed based on the 1-point rubric, increasing difficulty as exact thematic retrieval is needed.
- Number friendliness: easy (Non-mathematical item.)

Holistic Analysis: While the story is iconic, the demand to produce 2-3 sentences of original English prose is a significant barrier for students with limited English proficiency. Many students will understand the concept in Hindi but fail to bridge the vocabulary gap to explain the "right time, people, and action" accurately enough to satisfy a 1-point rubric.
