Concept familiarity: familiar (Interior and exterior angles of triangles/quadrilaterals are standard in Grade 8, but performance varies based on diagram orientation).
Computational complexity: 2-3 (Requires summing known angles and subtracting from 180° or 360°, or using exterior angle theorems).
Common error traps: major (Students often struggle with "reasons"/geometric properties, misidentifying alternate interior vs. corresponding angles, or arithmetic errors in subtraction).
Format demand: Open-ended/No partial credit (The 0/1 rubric makes this high-stakes; any error in 'x' or the explanation results in a zero).
Number friendliness: easy (Geometry problems at this level typically use multiples of 5 or 10).
