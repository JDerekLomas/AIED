- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (This item is based on "Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy, a staple in the NCERT Class 7 English textbook 'Honeycomb', which is standard across Indian government schools).
- **Computational complexity:** 0 (Not applicable to English literature).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse "the right people to listen to/work with" or struggle with the specific wording of "right time" vs. "good time").
- **Format demand:** High (Open-ended recall). While the rubric implies a 1/0 score, for this demographic, the lack of partial credit and the requirement to synthesize three distinct points in English prose is a significant barrier for ESL learners.
- **Number friendliness:** Not applicable.

**Holistic Estimate:** 
The text is culturally entrenched in the curriculum, and many students will recognize the "Three Questions" story. However, for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, articulating three specific abstract concepts in a single English sentence without grammatical or semantic breakdown is a significant challenge. Most students will identify "right time" but may struggle to recall or translate the other two precisely.
