**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
    This is a foundational topic usually taught in the first chapter of History in Class 6 (What, Where, How, and When). While the definitions are standardized, students from these backgrounds often struggle to internalize the abstract distinction between "physical remains" and "written records" during the initial transition from EVS (Class 5) to History.
*   **Computational Complexity: 1**
    There are no arithmetic steps; it is purely a verbal/conceptual task.
*   **Common Error Traps: Major**
    For English Language Learners (ELL) in government schools, the terms "archaeological" and "literary" are phonetically and orthographically difficult. Common traps include:
    1.  Confusing inscriptions (written) with purely literary sources (books) because both involve text.
    2.  Providing an example for only one category.
    3.  Linguistic interference: knowing the difference in Hindi (*Puratattvik* vs *Sahityik*) but being unable to retrieve the technical English terms required by the question.
*   **Format Demand: Open-ended**
    This requires high-level recall and categorization. The 1-mark limit with an "AND" rubric is punishing; it denies partial credit. If a student explains the concept but forgets the example, or vice-versa, they receive a zero.
*   **Number Friendliness: N/A**
    Not applicable to this qualitative item.

**Holistic Estimation**
Given the linguistic barrier of the technical terms and the strict "all-or-nothing" nature of the rubric, many students will provide partial answers or mix up the categories. While they may understand the concept, the demand to define AND provide examples in English significantly lowers the expected facility index.
