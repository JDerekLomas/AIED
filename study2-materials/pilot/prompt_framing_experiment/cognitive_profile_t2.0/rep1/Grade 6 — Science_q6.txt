**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Adaptations in plants are part of the NCERT Class 6 Science curriculum under "The Living Organisms and Their Surroundings.")

**Computational complexity:** 1 (No calculations required; purely conceptual/descriptive.)

**Common error traps:** Minor (Common issues include confusing adaptations of desert animals with plants, or difficulty articulating the biological "purpose" of a physical trait. Some students might use the word "leaf" instead of "spine" for cacti.)

**Format demand:** High (Open-ended/Subjective). Requires active recall and construction of a sentence. Since it is a 1-mark item, the rubric is relatively binary. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English vocabulary—"adaptations," "environment," or specific terms like "stems" and "roots"—poses a significant linguistic hurdle despite understanding the science.

**Number friendliness:** N/A

**Estimated Holistic Success Rate:**
The topic is tangible and well-covered, but the transition from conceptual understanding to written English production for Grade 6 EWS/Hindi-medium students is a steep bottleneck. Many students will know *what* happens (e.g., "thorny" plants) but may struggle to formulate the causal relationship required by "Explain."
