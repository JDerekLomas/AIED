**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Very familiar.** Ordering numbers is a foundational skill introduced in primary grades. By Grade 6, students have encountered four-digit numbers extensively in the state curriculum (NCERT/SCERT).
*   **Computational Complexity: 1.** This is a non-computational task requiring logical comparison rather than arithmetic operations. The cognitive load is low, centered on place-value recognition.
*   **Common Error Traps: Minor.** The primary trap is the inclusion of one three-digit number (`736`) among three four-digit numbers. Students with weak place-value grasp might look only at the leading digit (comparing 7 to 3, 5, and 4) and incorrectly place 736 last.
*   **Format Demand:** Open-ended (Recall). While partial credit is possible according to the prompt (0.5 for the first step), the question asks for full arrangement. However, the linguistic barrier is minimal as "ascending order" is a standard mathematical term frequently translated/drilled (Aarohi Kram).
*   **Number Friendliness: Moderate.** The numbers do not have confusingly similar digits (e.g., 3367 vs 3376), making visual discrimination easier for students with lower literacy levels.

**Analysis of Target Demographic**
Given the "economically weaker section" context, students often rely on rote drilling. Ascending order is one of the most heavily drilled patterns in Indian government schools. The inclusion of a 3-digit number serves as a "filter" for place-value understanding, but the lack of linguistic complexity ensures the question tests math skill rather than English proficiency.
