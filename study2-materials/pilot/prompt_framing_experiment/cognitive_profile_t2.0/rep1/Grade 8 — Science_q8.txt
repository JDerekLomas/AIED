- **Concept familiarity:** **Very familiar.** Agriculture is a core unit in the Grade 8 NCERT syllabus (Chapter 1). Since many students in Indian government schools come from rural or semi-urban backgrounds, the physical concept of "unwanted plants" (Kharpatwar) is experiential, not just theoretical.
- **Computational complexity:** **0.** This is a qualitative, descriptive item.
- **Common error traps:** **Minor.** The main trap is linguistic rather than conceptual; students may struggle to articulate the *reason* (competition for nutrients/light) in English, even if they understand the necessity of the practice.
- **Format demand:** **High.** Open-ended recall in English is a significant barrier for Hindi-medium students. Since the rubric requires a specific definition for a binary score (Max: 1), no partial credit is available for just saying "weeding is good."
- **Number friendliness:** **N/A.**

**Holistic Estimate:** While the concept is culturally and academically familiar, the requirement to produce a formal definition in English for a 1-mark "all-or-nothing" score will result in many students losing marks due to vocabulary constraints, even if they possess the underlying conceptual knowledge.
