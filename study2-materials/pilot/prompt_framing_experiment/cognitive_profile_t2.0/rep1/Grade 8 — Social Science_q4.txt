- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Panchayati Raj is a core pillar of the Grade 6-8 Civics curriculum and is often relatable to students' lived experiences in rural or semi-urban Indian contexts).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No calculations required; single conceptual link).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse specific functions—like waste management or water—with the "primary role" of self-governance; some may confuse the role of the Sarpanch with the system as a whole).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended requires recall; for Hindi-medium students, articulating "local self-governance" or "grassroots administration" in English poses a significant linguistic hurdle despite conceptual understanding. Partial credit is not mentioned in the rubric, increasing the demand for specific keywords.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A).

**Analysis:** While the concept is culturally and academically relevant, the requirement to explain a nuanced political concept in English—given the specified background of the students—acts as a significant barrier. Students likely understand the "what," but may struggle to express the "why" or the "how" in a formal 1-mark definition format.
