**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Basic reading comprehension focusing on personal hobbies/daily routines is a staple of Grade 6 curriculum).

**Computational complexity:** 1 (Single-step information retrieval).

**Common error traps:** Minor (Potential confusion with verb tense—e.g., using "reads" vs "loved"—or misidentifying the time of day if the passage mentions other activities).

**Format demand:** Open-ended. While it requires recall, the rubric is flexible and accepts sentence fragments ("read books"), which lowers the barrier for students with limited English syntax proficiency.

**Number friendliness:** Not applicable (Qualitative item).

**Psychometric Profile Analysis:**
For students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, the primary hurdle is decoding the question (the interrogative "What" and the past tense auxiliary "did... love"). However, because the rubric permits short, content-heavy responses rather than perfect grammatical constructions, students with functional vocabulary can succeed even with limited fluency. The high level of familiarity with this question format in state-level examinations suggests a high success rate.
