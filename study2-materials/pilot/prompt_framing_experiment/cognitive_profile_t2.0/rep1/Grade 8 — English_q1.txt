- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Describing nature and sunsets is a common theme in Grade 8 English textbooks, though vocabulary richness varies).
- **Computational complexity:** 0 (This is a language/comprehension task).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often identify one color but miss the plural requirement/combination specified in the rubric; language interference may lead to grammatical errors in sentence construction).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended; no partial credit allowed based on the 1-point rubric; requires recall of specific adjectives and precise synthesis of two distinct colors to meet the rubric's standard.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Psychometric Analysis:**
While the concept of a sunset is familiar, the rubric's requirement for a specific dual-color description ("orange AND pink") serves as a high-stringency filter. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the transition from mental visualization to precise English descriptive vocabulary can be a barrier. They are more likely to provide a single-word answer ("red" or "yellow") which, based on the strict rubric, would be marked incorrect.
