- Concept familiarity: very familiar (This topic—compost and decomposition—is covered in early middle school chapters like 'Crop Production and Management' and is common in rural/semi-urban households.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Zero mathematical steps; purely conceptual.)
- Common error traps: minor (Students might describe 'rotting' or 'smell' without using technical terms like 'decomposition' or 'organic manure,' potentially losing precision.)
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; requires three distinct parts (Observation, Reasons, Evaluation). High linguistic demand for English as a Second Language (ESL) learners.
- Number friendliness: N/A
