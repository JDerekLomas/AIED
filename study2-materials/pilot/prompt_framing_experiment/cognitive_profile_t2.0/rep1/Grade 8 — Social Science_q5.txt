- Concept familiarity: less familiar (While 'pollution' or 'environment' are common, the abstract connection between 'biodiversity' and 'sustainable development' is conceptually dense for Grade 8, especially with limited academic vocabulary.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Non-mathematical item)
- Common error traps: major (Students often conflate 'biodiversity' simply with 'planting trees' or 'wildlife' without understanding 'ecosystem services' or the 'sustainability' link.)
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; strictly 1 mark suggests an all-or-nothing approach without partial credit for vague answers.
- Number friendliness: N/A
