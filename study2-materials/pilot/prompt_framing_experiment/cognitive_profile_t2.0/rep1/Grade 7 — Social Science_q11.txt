- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. Healthcare (Public/Private) is a core component of the NCERT Grade 7 Civics curriculum ("Role of the Government in Health"). Students often have lived experience with both types of facilities (government clinics/UPHCs vs. private doctors), making the topic relatable.
- **Computational complexity:** 0. (Non-mathematical item).
- **Common error traps:** Minor. Students may confuse "affordable" with "free" or fail to distinguish between "urban" and "rural" availability. For EWS students, the distinction is usually sharp due to household budget considerations, though they may struggle to articulate structural differences formally.
- **Format demand:** High. An "Evaluate" task requires synthesis and written recall in English. For Hindi-medium/limited-proficiency students, translating thoughts into a structured "argument" or "example" poses a significant linguistic hurdle, even if they grasp the concept. No partial credit is possible as per the 1-point rubric limit.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Holistic Estimation:** While the concept is culturally and academically familiar, the requirement to produce a written evaluative argument in English for a binary (0 or 1) score makes this difficult for the target demographic. Proficiency gaps in writing will likely hinder many who understand the basic difference.
