- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The topic of heat and measurement is a standard unit in the NCERT Grade 7 Science curriculum, specifically Chapter 4. However, distinguishing between clinical and laboratory thermometers requires specific recall of the "kink" function).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical; requires qualitative explanation).
- **Common error traps:** Major (The primary trap is the English language barrier. While many students will intuitively know what a thermometer is, they often struggle to produce the technical term 'clinical' or articulate the functional difference—the presence of the kink preventing backflow—in written English).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires both identification and a 'why' justification. With a max score of only 0.5, the rubric is punishingly strict for an open-ended response).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A).
