- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Agriculture is a core theme in Grade 7 Science, specifically in "Nutrition in Plants" and soil management chapters. Most students in these settings have personal or familial exposure to farming.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; single-step conceptual application.)
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse "nutrient" with "water" or general "medicine/pesticides." There is also a risk of naming a specific nutrient like "Calcium" instead of the core NPK group.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall of terminology in English. Writing the names of nutrients—nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium—is a significant linguistic barrier for Hindi-medium students, even if they understand the concept.)
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question.)

**Holistic Assessment:** While the biological concept is highly relevant and familiar to rural/EWS students, the linguistic demand of recalling and spelling complex chemical terms (like "Phosphorus") in English poses a substantial barrier. However, the rubric allows for "Manures/Fertilizers," which are common vocabulary words in these schools.
