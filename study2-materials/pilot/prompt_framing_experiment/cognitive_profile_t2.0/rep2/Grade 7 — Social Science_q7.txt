- **Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. (While 'money' is a known concept, 'economic development' is an abstract macroeconomic term typically introduced in rudimentary forms in Grade 7 but rarely mastered at an analytical level by students from disadvantaged backgrounds.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1. (Primarily qualitative analysis.)
- **Common error traps:** Major. (Students often confuse 'money' with 'wealth' or 'income'. The shift from historical/physical money to 'digital money' is often perceived as a consumer convenience rather than an economic mechanism.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires high linguistic proficiency to explain relationships/cause-effect; since no partial credit is available for a 1-point item, the lack of an exact rubric-defined 'explanation' will lead to failures even if the 'identification' is correct.)
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. (N/A)

**Holistic Estimation:**
The linguistic barrier is the primary constraint here. In Hindi-medium or low-resource settings, students struggle to transition from rote memorization of definitions to the "analyze" and "evaluate" cognitive levels demanded by the question. Explaining the systemic role of money (medium of exchange/capital formation) in English requires a level of academic fluency many do not possess at Grade 7.
