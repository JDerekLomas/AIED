- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Gangaur is a major cultural touchstone in the Rajasthan state board curriculum, though specific variants like Dhinga Gavar are less so.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; single-step identification.)
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Visual ambiguity in the picture provided could lead students to guess more generic festivals like Teej.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall and English descriptive writing, which is a significant barrier for Hindi-medium students despite knowing the cultural context.)
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative item.)

**Holistic Estimate:** 
The high cultural relevance (Gangaur) boosts the likelihood of identification, but the requirement to "describe" the celebration in English for a student body with limited proficiency creates a high barrier. Additionally, a 0.5 maximum score suggests a binary "correct/incorrect" threshold that may not allow for the linguistic struggle of the demographic.
