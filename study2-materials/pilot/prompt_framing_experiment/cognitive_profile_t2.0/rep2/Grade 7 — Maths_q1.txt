- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Multiplication of integers is a core component of the Grade 7 curriculum, but the transition from natural numbers to sign rules remains a critical learning hurdle).
- **Computational complexity:** 2 steps (Step 1: Perform absolute multiplication $3 \times 4 = 12$; Step 2: Apply the negative-negative sign rule).
- **Common error traps:** Major (The most common error is the "addition-subtraction carryover" logic, where students perceive two negatives as resulting in a negative, e.g., producing $-12$, or confusing rules with $-3 - 4 = -7$).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall based; since the score is 0/1, no credit is given for the magnitude if the sign is incorrect).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (The 3 and 4 tables are foundational; the cognitive load is almost entirely focused on the sign rule rather than the multiplication).
