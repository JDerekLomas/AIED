- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. In the Indian Grade 6 curriculum (NCERT/State Boards), the "Present Continuous" tense is a core pillar of early grammar instruction. However, while students recognize "playing" as an action, the technical term "verb phrase" is less commonly used in vernacular-medium classrooms compared to simply identifying the "verb."
- **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a single-step identification task involving pattern matching (Auxiliary + Main Verb).
- **Common error traps:** Major. For Hindi-medium students, the concept of a "phrase" is often confused with a single "word." A significant portion of students will likely underline only the main verb ("playing") or include the object ("playing football") because their cognitive map of an action includes the object being acted upon.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. This requires recall and exact boundary identification. Without multiple-choice options to scaffold the answer, students must independently decide whether to include the auxiliary "are." No partial credit is awarded.
- **Number friendliness:** Not applicable (linguistic task). The vocabulary is high-frequency ("children," "football"), minimizing lexical interference.

**Holistic Estimate:** While the sentence is simple, the specific demand to identify a *phrase* (two words) rather than a *verb* (one word) typically results in a high error rate among students who are still mastering English syntax and technical grammatical metalanguage.
