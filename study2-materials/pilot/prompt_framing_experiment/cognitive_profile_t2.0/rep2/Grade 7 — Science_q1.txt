- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The distinction between clinical and laboratory thermometers is a core part of the NCERT Class 7 Science curriculum, though rural students may have more experience with digital thermometers than glass ones).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; involves direct recall and reasoning).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse the terms "clinical" and "medical" or fail to articulate the function of the "kink"/constriction in the clinical thermometer).
- **Format demand:** High (Open-ended recall). While the rubric asks for identification, the prompt asks "why," requiring English sentence construction which is a significant barrier for Hindi-medium students. Since the max score is only 0.5, partial credit is unlikely.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative item).
