- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Deforestation is a core topic in Grade 8 Science/Geography and Environmental Education; students are generally aware of tree-cutting issues).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; qualitative identification and reasoning only).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may identify the action as "woodcutting" but fail to connect it to the broader ecological term "deforestation" or fail to articulate long-term "consequences" beyond simple ideas like "no wood").
- **Format demand:** Open-ended; requires English sentence construction. While the rubric suggests flexibility, the demand for sustained consequences requires synthesizing scientific effects (climate change, soil erosion) in a second language, which is difficult for Hindi-medium students.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A; qualitative question).
