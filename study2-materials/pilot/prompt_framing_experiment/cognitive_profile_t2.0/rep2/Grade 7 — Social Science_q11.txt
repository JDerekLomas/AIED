- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. Public vs. Private health services is a core chapter in the Class 7 NCERT Social Science curriculum ("Role of the Government in Health"). Students often have personal anecdotal experience with government dispensaries vs. private clinics.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. (Non-mathematical task).
- **Common error traps:** Minor. Students often conflate "difference" with a "definition." They may describe one and forget the other, or struggle to move beyond binary "rich vs. poor" distinctions to more structural arguments required for an "evaluate" prompt.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This is high for this demographic. Writing a structured comparative argument in English is a significant barrier for Hindi-medium/limited-English students. While the rubric says "Mentions two features," the command verb "Evaluate" is cognitively higher than "List," potentially intimidating students.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. (N/A)

Holistic Assessment: While the topic is relatable and "socially lived," the requirement to construct an English-language argument with specific examples (validity check) makes this a high-difficulty task for the specific student profile. Many will understand the concept but fail to articulate a two-part response in the target language to meet the rubric's specific criteria.
