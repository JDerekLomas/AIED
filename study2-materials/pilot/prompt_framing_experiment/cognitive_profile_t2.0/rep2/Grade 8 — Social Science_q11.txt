- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (This is a core topic in Grade 8 History/Civics across NCERT and State boards, focusing on 'Tribals, Dikus and the Golden Age').
- **Computational complexity:** 0 (Qualitative historical analysis).
- **Common error traps:** Major (Students often conflate generic "British rule" with specific tribal impacts. The transition from Hindi-medium thought to English-medium output leads to linguistic 'bottlenecks' where a student knows the concept but cannot articulate 'disruption of traditional patterns').
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires free recall and synthesis of two distinct examples. While the rubric suggests a maximum score of 1, the requirement for "two distinct examples" in an open-ended English response increases the threshold for a 'fully correct' mark significantly for students with limited English proficiency).
- **Number friendliness:** N/A
