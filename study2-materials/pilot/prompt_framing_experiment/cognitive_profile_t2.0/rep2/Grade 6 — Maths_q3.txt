**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar.** Comparing and ordering multi-digit numbers is a core competency introduced in primary grades (Classes 3-5). By Grade 6, students have significant practice with the "place value" method for ordering.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1 (Minimal).** This is a purely logical comparison task rather than a multi-step calculation. The only "step" is digit counting and left-to-right place value comparison.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** The main trap for this cohort is the presence of one 3-digit number (736) among 4-digit numbers. Students with low English literacy sometimes struggle with the term "ascending," but in Hindi-medium schools, the equivalent term *“badhte kram”* is heavily drilled. Some students might reverse the order (descending) or ignore the number of digits.
*   **Format Demand:** **Binary/Low Partial Credit.** Since the rubric specifically awards marks for identifying the smallest number and placing it first, it focuses on the first procedural step. However, the lack of language-heavy context makes the format less demanding for students with limited English proficiency.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Moderate.** The numbers are "noisy" (random digits rather than multiples of 10 or 100), but the clear distinction between a 3-digit number and 4-digit numbers provides a high-visibility entry point for the "smallest" value.

**Holistic Estimation:**
The question relies on a fundamental skill that is prioritized in Indian government school curricula to meet basic "Nipun Bharat" or FLN (Foundational Literacy and Numeracy) targets. The language barrier is minimized by the numeric nature of the task. However, precision issues and "ascending vs. descending" confusion typically prevent a universal success rate.
