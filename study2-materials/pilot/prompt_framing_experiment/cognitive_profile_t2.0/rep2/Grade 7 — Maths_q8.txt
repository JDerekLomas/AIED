- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. Unitary method is a core component of the Grade 6 and 7 SCERT/NCERT curriculum.
- **Computational complexity:** 2-3 steps. (Division to find the unit rate, followed by multiplication to find the total distance).
- **Common error traps:** Minor. Students may confuse the operations (multiplication instead of division) or struggle with the term "mileage" if they are more accustomed to "average" or "unit rate." However, the dual-part nature of the question (distance + mileage) increases the chance of a partial omission.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended/Recall. According to the rubric provided, there is no partial credit (Maximum score: 1), which penalizes students who make a single calculation error despite understanding the process.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. 55 and 5 are highly compatible (11), making the mental calculation of the unit rate straightforward. Multiplying 11 by 12 is also a standard multiplication table exercise.
