- **Concept familiarity**: Less familiar. While capitalization rules are taught early, consistent application in a second language remains a significant hurdle for Grade 6 students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, where scripts (Devanagari) do not use case distinctions.
- **Computational complexity**: 1 (Procedural application of rules).
- **Common error traps**: Major. The sentence contains four distinct capitalization requirements: the start of a sentence ("Riya"), two proper nouns ("Meena"), and a day of the week ("Sunday"). In this demographic, "Sunday" is frequently missed, and middle-word proper nouns are often overlooked. 
- **Format demand**: Open-ended/Exact match. No partial credit is awarded per the rubric; the student must manage all four capitalization points and the terminal punctuation simultaneously. 
- **Number friendliness**: N/A (Verbal item).

Holistic Analysis: For students in economically weaker sections transitioning from Hindi-medium contexts, the "transfer of learning" regarding case sensitivity is one of the most persistent errors. While "Riya" at the start of the sentence has a high success rate, the specific inclusion of "Meena" (mid-sentence) and "Sunday" (frequently treated as a common noun by L2 learners) acts as a high-difficulty filter.
