**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar.** The properties of natural fibers are introduced in Grade 6 (NCERT Chapter 3: Fiber to Fabric). Additionally, this is a "lived experience" topic; even students with limited formal schooling in EWS contexts are culturally aware that cotton is used for "Garmi" (heat).
*   **Computational Complexity:** **None (0 steps).** This is a purely qualitative conceptual question.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** The primary trap is not a misconception, but a "linguistic hurdle." Students might understand the concept (sweat) but lack the specific English vocabulary (*absorb*, *porous*, *evaporation*) to express it. Some may provide a tautology (e.g., "It keeps us cool") without explaining the *property* as requested.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended (High).** Requires active recall and sentence construction rather than recognition (MCQ). No partial credit is available for this 1-mark item, making the demand higher for students with limited English proficiency.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.**

**Holistic Estimation:**
While the concept is highly familiar and culturally relevant, the requirement to explain a "property" in English poses a significant barrier for Hindi-medium EWS students. Many will likely answer "It is cool," which may fail the rubric's requirement for a specific property like "absorption" or "porosity."
