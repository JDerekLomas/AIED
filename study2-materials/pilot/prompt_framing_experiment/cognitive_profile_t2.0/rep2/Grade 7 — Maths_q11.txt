- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. Bar graphs are introduced in Grade 6 in NCERT and SCERT curricula, making this a repeated concept. However, the requirement to "Choose an appropriate scale" shifts it from a purely procedural task to a conceptual one.
- **Computational complexity:** 2-3. Students must analyze the range of data, determine a common factor for the scale (division), and then accurately measure lengths for six different bars.
- **Common error traps:** Major. For students from these backgrounds, the most common hurdles are: (1) Inconsistent spacing on the Y-axis (e.g., writing 100, 200, 250 without proportional scaling), (2) Misaligning the bars with the labels on the X-axis, and (3) Linguistic confusion regarding "maximum/minimum" if the question paper is only in English.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended/Construction. This is a high-demand format because there is no recognition cue (as in Multiple Choice). The rubric is binary (Maximum score: 1), meaning there is no safety net for students who draw the bars correctly but fail to label axes or provide a scale.
- **Number friendliness:** Moderate. Depending on the actual values provided (not specified but implied as 3-digit numbers typical of NCERT Grade 7), students often struggle to map numbers like 135 on a scale of 1 unit = 20 or 10.

**Holistic Estimate:** While students often understand the visual "look" of a bar graph, the strict rubric requiring labels, a scale, and consistent Y-axis increments is a significant barrier for students who lack quality geometric instruments (rulers/pencils) or who have had limited individualized feedback on graph-drawing conventions.
