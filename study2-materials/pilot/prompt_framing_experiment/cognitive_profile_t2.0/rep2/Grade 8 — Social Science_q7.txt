**Concept familiarity: Familiar**
The Battle of Plassey is a foundational topic in the Grade 8 NCERT History curriculum ("From Trade to Territory"). It is frequently emphasized in classrooms and previous year's papers as a turning point in Indian history.

**Computational complexity: 1**
There are no mathematical computations required for this item.

**Common error traps: Major**
For this specific demographic, the primary "trap" is linguistic rather than conceptual. Students may remember the names (Siraj-ud-Daulah, Robert Clive) but struggle to articulate the abstract concept of "political expansion" or the nuance of a "puppet ruler" in English. There is also a tendency to describe the *events* of the battle rather than its *consequences* for British power, as required by the prompt.

**Format demand: Open-ended**
This requires high-level recall and synthesis. Since the rubric demands an explanation of political dominance rather than just naming the winner, the demand is high. The "binary" scoring (0 or 1) in the rubric makes it harder for students with limited English to earn marks for partial conceptual understanding.

**Number friendliness: Easy**
The date (1757) is provided in the prompt, reducing the cognitive load of historical dating.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the transition from Hindi to English medium and the requirement to explain a causal relationship (cause and effect) in a second language without the safety net of partial credit, many students will provide correct keywords but fail to form a coherent explanation that meets the full rubric requirement.
