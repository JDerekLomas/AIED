- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The area of a triangle is a core component of the Grade 7 Mensuration syllabus in India (NCERT/State Boards), typically introduced after squares and rectangles.
- **Computational complexity:** 2-3 steps. (1. Recall/write formula; 2. Substitute values; 3. Perform multiplication/division).
- **Common error traps:** Minor. The most common procedural "bug" is forgetting to divide by 2 (calculating area as base × height, like a parallelogram). 
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. Requires recall of the formula from memory as no scaffold is provided. No partial credit allowed per the rubric.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. The numbers 8 and 6 are small, even integers. Multiplying them (48) and halving them (24) are standard mental math tasks for this grade level.

**Language/Contextual Note:** For students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds, the terms "base" (आधार) and "height" (ऊंचाई) are among the first technical English terms learned in geometry. The simplicity of the English phrasing here minimizes the linguistic barrier compared to a word problem.
