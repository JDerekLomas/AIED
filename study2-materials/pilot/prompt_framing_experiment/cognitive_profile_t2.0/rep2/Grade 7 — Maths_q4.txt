**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Less familiar**. While Grade 7 students are taught decimal division, dividing a whole number by a decimal (divisor > dividend) is significantly more challenging for students in this demographic than dividing a decimal by a whole number.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps**. The student must: 1) Convert the decimal divisor to a whole number (adjusting the dividend to 80), 2) Simplify the fraction or perform long division, and 3) Handle a recurring decimal outcome (1.11...), which adds a layer of conceptual difficulty not explicitly mentioned in the rubric.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major**. Students often struggle with decimal placement, frequently yielding "0.9" or "1.9" by confusing the order of division or ignoring the decimal point entirely. Many will stop at "1 remainder 8" without understanding how to proceed into decimal places.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended**. Since the rubric focuses on the "setup" (80 ÷ 72) for a low point value (0.5), it suggests a procedural requirement rather than just a final value. However, the lack of multiple-choice cues increases the chance of blank answers.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Hard**. 72 does not divide 80 evenly. The result is a non-terminating, recurring decimal ($1.1\overline{1}$). For students from economically weaker sections with limited resources, mastery over recurring decimals and the necessary precision is often low.

**Holistic Estimation**
Given the linguistic barrier (word problems are harder, but even symbolic math requires clear instructional understanding) and the high cognitive load of non-terminating division, many students will likely stall after the first subtraction or misplace the decimal point.
