### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar**. One-step linear equations are introduced in Grade 6 and Grade 7 (NCERT syllabus). By Grade 8, students are expected to handle multi-step equations and rational coefficients.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1 step**. The student only needs to perform a single inverse operation (subtraction) to isolate the variable.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major**. 
    *   **The Negative Result Trap:** Many students in these demographics struggle with the conceptual leap that $y$ can be a negative integer. A common error is $9 - 4 = 5$, ignoring the sign.
    *   **Inversion Error:** Some may add 9 to both sides ($4 + 9 = 13$) due to a lack of conceptual understanding of "balancing" the equation.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended**. Since this requires the student to produce the value without a list of options (MCQ), they cannot use "back-solving" (plugging in choices). There is no partial credit for a 1-mark item; an error in the sign results in 0 marks.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy**. The numbers 9 and 4 are single digits and easy to manipulate mentally. The only friction is the resulting negative sign.

### Holistic Estimation
While the procedural step is the simplest possible in algebra, the "negative result" ($4 - 9$) acts as a significant barrier for students who lack strong foundations in integer arithmetic. In Hindi-medium, government-school contexts where remedial gaps often persist, the transition from arithmetic thinking to algebraic thinking frequently falters when negative integers are involved.
