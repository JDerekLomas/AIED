### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

**Concept familiarity: Familiar**
Indirect speech is a core component of the Grade 7 English grammar curriculum in India (NCERT/State Boards). While students are taught the "reporting verb + that + tense shift" rule, the application remains challenging for students with limited English exposure, as they often rely on rote memorization of rules rather than linguistic intuition.

**Computational complexity: N/A**
This dimension applies to mathematics; however, linguistically, the task requires 3 distinct transformations:
1. Addition of the conjunction "that."
2. Pronoun shift ("I" to "she").
3. Tense shift (Present Continuous to Past Continuous).

**Common error traps: Major**
For Hindi-medium students, two major traps exist:
1. **The Tense Trap:** Students often fail to shift "am" to "was," reflecting the sentence exactly as spoken but without quotes.
2. **The Pronoun Trap:** Difficulty in mapping the first-person "I" to the third-person "She," leading to errors like "She said that I was reading..."

**Format demand: Open-ended**
This requires active recall and sentence construction. There is no recognition cue (as in multiple-choice). While the rubric allows for minor variations, the requirement for a correct tense shift makes it an "all-or-nothing" barrier for many learners at this level.

**Number friendliness: N/A**
(Not applicable to this subject).

**Analysis of Target Demographic**
Students from economically weaker sections (EWS) in Hindi-medium schools often treat English as a set of disconnected rules. While they may recognize the structure, the simultaneous management of pronoun and tense changes—while translating mentally—leads to a high attrition rate in accuracy.
