**Concept familiarity: Very familiar**
Antonyms (opposites) are introduced early in the primary English curriculum (Grade 2-3). Even for students with limited proficiency, "slow" and "fast" are high-frequency, tier-1 vocabulary words often taught through movement-based activities or simple rhymes.

**Computational complexity: N/A**
This is a purely linguistic recall task.

**Common error traps: Minor**
Students might understand the concept but face orthographic interference. For example, writing "pest" instead of "fast" due to phonological confusion, or confusing it with "quick" (which is correct but occasionally excluded by rigid keys). Some might provide a Hindi translation ("tez") if their English vocabulary is extremely limited.

**Format demand: Open-ended**
This requires productive recall rather than recognition (multiple choice). However, since it is a one-word answer, the demand is low. The rubric is binary (0 or 1), so no partial credit for near-misses in spelling is allowed.

**Number friendliness: N/A**

**Estimated holistic success rate:**
In the context of Indian government schools (Grade 6), this is a foundational "low-floor" item. While spelling "fast" may be a slight barrier for some, the high frequency of the word in standard SCERT/NCERT textbooks ensures a high success rate.
