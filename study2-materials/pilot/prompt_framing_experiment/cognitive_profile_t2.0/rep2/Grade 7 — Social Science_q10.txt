- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The Mauryan Empire and Ashoka are staple topics in the NCERT Grade 7 curriculum; however, the shift from factual recall to "significance" is cognitively more demanding).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical item).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse chronological facts with "significance" or may struggle to differentiate Ashoka’s personal conversion from his administrative policies).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires high-level retrieval and synthesis. For Hindi-medium students, translating complex historical concepts like "ethical governance" or "dhamma" into English represents a significant linguistic barrier).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question).

**Holistic Analysis:** 
While Ashoka is a high-salience topic, the requirement to explain "significance" (rather than naming facts) in English presents a major challenge for this specific cohort. The binary scoring (0 or 1) with no partial credit significantly lowers the probability of a "fully correct" response according to the rubric's standard for explaining transformation and governance.
