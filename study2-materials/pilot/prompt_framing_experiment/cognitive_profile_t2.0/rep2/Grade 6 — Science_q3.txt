- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (This is a foundational concept introduced in primary classes and revisited in Grade 6.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No mathematical calculations required.)
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse "movement" with "locomotion" or incorrectly identify natural non-living things like sun or fire as living because they move or grow.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended/Recall (Requires expressive language; the Hindi-to-English translation may be a hurdle, though the rubric is generous/broad.)
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Not applicable for this qualitative question.)

**Analysis:** While the concept is simple, the requirement to provide two characteristics for *each* (four total points of data) within a single open-ended response creates a significant linguistic and structural demand for students with limited English proficiency. However, the rubric provided indicates a low bar for "Maximum score" (asking for only one valid characteristic), which significantly boosts the success rate if the rubric is applied as stated.
