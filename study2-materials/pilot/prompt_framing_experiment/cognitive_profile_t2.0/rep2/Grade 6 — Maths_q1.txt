**Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Prime factorization and finding factor pairs are standard components of the Grade 6 curriculum (NCERT Chapter 3: Playing with Numbers). However, students often stop at "2" and "4" without realizing factors can exist beyond the multiplication tables of 1–10.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps per factor pair.** The student must perform multiple division trials. Testing 68 requires checking divisibility for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 to ensure all pairs (up to the square root) are found.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** The number 68 contains the "prime-looking" factor 17. Many students from economically weaker backgrounds rely on rote memorization of tables up to 10 or 12. If they have not mastered the 17-times table, they often miss the pair (4, 17) and the subsequent (2, 34). Missing just one factor results in zero credit under this rubric.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** This is an open-ended recall task with a binary scoring system (all or nothing). The lack of partial credit for listing four out of six factors significantly increases the item's statistical difficulty.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Hard.** While 68 is even, it is not a "benchmark" number like 24, 36, or 100. Identifying 34 and 17 as factors requires either strong mental division skills or the habit of systematic factor pairing, which is often a developmental hurdle for ESL learners who may struggle with the "how many times goes into" linguistic logic of division.

**Holistic Estimate:** 
Considering the strict rubric and the difficulty of identifying 17 as a factor without calculator aid or advanced table fluency, more than half of the cohort is likely to provide an incomplete list.
