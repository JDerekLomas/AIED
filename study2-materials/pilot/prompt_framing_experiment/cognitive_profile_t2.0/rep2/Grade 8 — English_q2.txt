- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Students are accustomed to descriptive imagery in nature-themed poems/prose common in Grade 8 curricula).
- **Computational complexity:** 0 (Language-based retrieval task).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse visual elements with auditory ones—e.g., describing the sun setting rather than the sound of birds—or provide a generic answer like "noises" without the specific noun).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires productive recall and specific vocabulary; no partial credit allowed as per the rubric).
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative response).

**Linguistic/Socio-economic context:** While the imagery is intuitive, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the syntax of the question ("could be heard") and the specific English vocabulary ("chirping," "twittering," "rustling") required to bridge the gap between their conceptual understanding and the rubric's specific phrasing.
