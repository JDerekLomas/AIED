### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**1. Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
The concepts of area for rectangles ($L \times B$) and squares ($S \times S$) are introduced in Grade 5 and reinforced in Grade 6. While students in government schools often struggle with abstract geometry, "Area" is a core, high-frequency topic. However, the application-based comparison adds a slight layer of novelty.

**2. Computational Complexity: 2–3 Steps**
The student must perform three distinct operations: 
- Step 1: Calculate Area A ($5 \times 4$).
- Step 2: Calculate Area B ($5 \times 5$).
- Step 3: Perform subtraction/comparison ($25 - 20$) to find the difference.

**3. Common Error Traps: Major**
There are significant linguistic and conceptual hurdles for this specific demographic:
- **Linguistic Barrier:** Terms like "greater" and "by how much" may be misunderstood by Hindi-medium students if the question is in English. 
- **The "Perimeter" Trap:** Many students at this level confuse Area and Perimeter ($5+5+4+4$ vs. $5\times 4$). 
- **Side Overlap:** Since both shapes use the number '5', some students might erroneously assume they are the same or miss the "Square" side property ($5^2$).

**4. Format Demand: High (Exact Answer)**
The item is open-ended. Since the rubric specifies a Maximum Score of 1 with no partial credit, any procedural slip or computational error results in a score of zero.

**5. Number Friendliness: Easy**
The numbers (4 and 5) are very "friendly." They reside within basic multiplication tables and do not involve decimals or fractions, minimizing purely arithmetic errors.

### Holistic Estimate
While the math is simple, the requirement to perform a three-step procedure without partial credit, combined with potential confusion between Area and Perimeter and the English-language phrasing, poses a challenge for students from economically weaker backgrounds with limited English exposure.
