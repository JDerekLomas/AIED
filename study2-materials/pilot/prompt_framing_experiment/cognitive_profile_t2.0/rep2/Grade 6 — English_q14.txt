- Concept familiarity: Familiar (Creative writing and animal themes are common, but persona-adoption/perspective-taking can be cognitively demanding for some.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single task step: generating one sentence.)
- Common error traps: Minor (Students may confuse "Imagine you are" with "Write about a bird," resulting in third-person descriptions rather than first-person "I" statements. Grammatical tense consistency is also a frequent trap.)
- Format demand: Open-ended/Recall (Requires production rather than recognition. Rubric is strict: must be clear, creative, AND grammatically correct for 1 mark, with no partial credit mentioned.)
- Number friendliness: Easy (Not applicable for this item.)
