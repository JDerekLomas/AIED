**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Reading comprehension and identifying basic actions/hobbies are foundational Grade 6 English skills).

**Computational complexity:** 0 (This is a non-mathematical, retrieval-based language task).

**Common error traps:** Minor (Common errors include tense inconsistency, such as "Riya love reading," or spelling "reading" incorrectly. Students might also confuse the time of day if the text mentions other activities in the morning).

**Format demand:** Open-ended recall; while the rubric allows for short phrases, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the syntax of constructing an English sentence from scratch compared to multiple-choice formats. No partial credit is available.

**Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Holistic Estimate:** 
The question asks for literal information retrieval, which is the simplest cognitive task in a reading passage. However, for students with limited English proficiency in economically weaker sections, the barrier is often vocabulary (recognizing "evening" and "love") and the confidence to write a constructed response in English. Given that the rubric allows for fragment answers like "read books," the difficulty decreases, but it remains higher than a multiple-choice item.
