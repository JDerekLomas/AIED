### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

*   **Concept familiarity:** **Familiar.** The LCM is a core topic introduced in the Grade 5 NCERT curriculum and reinforced in Grade 6. However, students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds often struggle with the conceptual transition from multiplication to the abstract procedural algorithm if instruction was rote.
*   **Computational complexity:** **4+ steps.** To solve for three numbers, a student must: (1) Setup the division/factorization frame, (2) Identify the lowest prime divisor (2), (3) Perform repeated division across three variables, (4) Manage placeholders/carry-downs for non-divisible numbers, and (5) Multiply the resulting prime factors (2 × 2 × 3 × 5). 
*   **Common error traps:** **Major.** Typical "procedural bugs" for this demographic include: confusing LCM with HCF (producing '1'), stopping division prematurely when one number becomes prime, or errors in the final multiplication string. Language interference (LCM vs. *Laghu-uttam Samapavartak*) can occasionally cause minor confusion in terminology.
*   **Format demand:** **Recall-intensive.** This is an open-ended item requiring a multi-step construction. Since the maximum score is 1 with no mention of partial credit, any single arithmetic slip results in a 0.
*   **Number friendliness:** **Moderate.** The numbers (12, 15, 20) are within standard 1–20 multiplication tables, but they are not "easy" because they involve different prime bases (2, 3, and 5), ensuring the student cannot find the answer by simply doubling the largest number.

### Holistic Performance Estimate
While the procedure is a staple of the Indian curriculum, the lack of partial credit and the requirement for a multi-step execution in an open-ended format typically leads to significant attrition in accuracy among students with inconsistent foundational numeracy.
