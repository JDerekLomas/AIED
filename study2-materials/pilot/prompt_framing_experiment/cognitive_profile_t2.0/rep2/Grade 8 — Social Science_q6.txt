Concept familiarity: less familiar (In the Indian Grade 8 curriculum, Social Science focuses heavily on Indian history and the national movement. European history, specifically the complex growth of nationalism, is usually introduced more robustly in Grade 10.)

Computational complexity: 1 (This is a purely qualitative task requiring historical synthesis rather than calculation.)

Common error traps: major (Students from English-as-a-second-language backgrounds frequently struggle with abstract political concepts like "nationalist sentiment." There is a high risk of "conceptual slippage" where students confuse European history with the Indian freedom struggle, which is more extensively taught.)

Format demand: Open-ended recall. While the rubric suggests 1 mark for identifying and explaining, the "two factors" requirement increases the retrieval load. Partial credit is often given in school settings, but full correctness requires specific historical vocabulary.

Number friendliness: easy (Not applicable.)

Holistic estimation: Given the linguistic barriers and the fact that Grade 8 learners are more accustomed to factual recall than analyzing abstract sociopolitical shifts in a foreign context, the success rate will be low.
