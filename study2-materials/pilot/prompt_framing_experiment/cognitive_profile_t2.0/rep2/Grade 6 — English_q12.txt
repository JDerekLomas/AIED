**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar.** At the Grade 6 level in Indian government schools, "up/down" are among the most foundational spatial antonyms introduced in primary grades (typically Grade 1 or 2). Even students with limited English proficiency are exposed to these through basic rhymes, physical activities, and classroom commands (e.g., "Stand up," "Sit down").
*   **Computational Complexity:** **N/A (1 step).** This is a single-step retrieval task.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** The most likely errors are orthographic (spelling "down" as "don" or "dowen") or accidental translation (providing the Hindi equivalent "नीचे"). However, the semantic connection is strong enough to minimize conceptual confusion.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** This requires retrieval (recall) rather than recognition (multiple choice). While no partial credit is available, the word "down" is a high-frequency CVC/CVCC word within the basic functional vocabulary.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A (Easy).** Vocabulary is basic.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the extreme familiarity of these terms even in Hindi-medium environments and the simplicity of the four-letter response, the vast majority of Grade 6 students—including those from economically weaker sections—will have mastered this basic antonym pair.
