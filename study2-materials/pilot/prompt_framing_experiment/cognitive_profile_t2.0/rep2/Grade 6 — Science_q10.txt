Concept familiarity: familiar (Basic needs of plants and photosynthesis are core topics, but analyzing experimental tables may be less practiced).
Computational complexity: 1 (Comparing simple integers in a table).
Common error traps: minor (Possible confusion between 'Full Sunlight' and 'Partial Sunlight' if data reading is hasty; misconception that plants grow faster in the dark to "find" light).
Format demand: Open-ended (Requires both data interpretation and retrieval of scientific terminology).
Number friendliness: easy (Growth measurements are likely small integers).

Estimated proportion of students (considering the linguistic barrier of explaining "why" in English for Hindi-medium students):
