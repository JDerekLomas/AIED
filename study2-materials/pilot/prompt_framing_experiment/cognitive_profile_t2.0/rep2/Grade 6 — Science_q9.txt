- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (This is a core topic in Grade 6 NCERT Science, extensively taught in the chapter "Components of Food.")
- Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative reasoning; no mathematical calculation involved.)
- Common error traps: Minor (Students may confuse vitamins with proteins (body-building) or carbohydrates (energy-giving), or mix up deficiency diseases.)
- Format demand: High (The rubric is binary/maximum 1, yet the item asks for two distinct parts: an explanation and two examples. The lack of partial credit increases difficulty for EWS/Hindi-medium students who might struggle with the English syntax required for part a.)
- Number friendliness: Easy (N/A - purely conceptual.)
