- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Geometric properties like sum of angles or parallel lines are core to Grade 8, though the application varies by figure complexity).
- **Computational complexity:** 2-3 steps (Typically involves a subtraction from 180 or equating an expression).
- **Common error traps:** Major (Common confusion between interior/exterior angles, misidentifying transversal relationships, or computational slips under time pressure).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires both the final value and the geometric reasoning; with a 1-point max, there is zero tolerance for partial credit errors).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Most textbook geometry problems in this context use multiples of 5 or 10).
