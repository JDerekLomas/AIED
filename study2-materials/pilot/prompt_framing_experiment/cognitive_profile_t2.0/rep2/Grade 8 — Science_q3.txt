- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Physical properties of metals is a foundational, frequently repeated topic in Grade 8 Science).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Simple recall of a single term).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students frequently confuse "malleability" with "ductility," the property of being drawn into wires).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires exact recall of a specific technical term; however, the spelling of "malleability" is challenging for Hindi-medium students, which may lead to marks being lost in strict grading).
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative question).

**Holistic Estimation:**
While the concept is taught extensively, the English technical term "Malleability" is phonetically and orthographically difficult for students with limited English proficiency. The tendency to swap it with "Ductility" or use a descriptive Hindi-influenced explanation rather than the specific English term will lower the success rate in an English-medium assessment.
