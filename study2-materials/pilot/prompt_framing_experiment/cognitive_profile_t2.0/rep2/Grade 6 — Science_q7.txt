**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The concept of balanced diets and food groups is central to the Grade 6 Science curriculum, specifically under the "Components of Food" chapter. Most students from EWS backgrounds are sensitized to "Doodh" (milk) as a foundational health food.)

**Computational complexity:** 1 (Zero mathematical operations required; purely qualitative deduction.)

**Common error traps:** Minor (Students may list specific vitamins like "Vitamin D" or "Calcium" instead of the food group "Milk" requested by the prompt, or they may focus on the second sentence of the prompt—"Prepare a diet chart"—which is a much more complex task not captured by the 1-point rubric.)

**Format demand:** Open-ended. While identifying "Milk" is a simple recall/deduction task, the presence of the second sentence ("Prepare diet chart") creates a significant cognitive load and potential confusion. A student might fail the item because they focus on the harder, secondary task while the rubric only awards the point for the simple identification.

**Number friendliness:** Easy (Not applicable; non-numerical.)

**Holistic Analysis:** While the concept of "Milk" being healthy is well-understood, the linguistic phrasing ("he has ate") is grammatically poor, and the instruction to "Prepare diet chart" is a high-level constructive task that exceeds the 1-point rubric scope. For students with limited English proficiency, this "instructional noise" will distract from the simple answer required for the mark.
