- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. Heat transfer (Conduction, Convection, Radiation) is a core topic in Grade 7 Science (NCERT). The "spoon in tea" is the standard textbook example used to introduce conduction.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. There is no mathematical calculation involved; it is a purely qualitative conceptual question.
- **Common error traps:** Minor. The most common error is confusing the terms (Convection vs. Conduction). Since the tea is a liquid, students might incorrectly attribute the heat transfer within the *solid* spoon to convection.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. Part (a) requires specific recall of the term "Conduction." For a student from a Hindi-medium background, the barrier is twofold: identifying the phenomenon and recalling the specific English terminology. Part (b) requires constructing a sentence, which increases difficulty for those with limited English proficiency, although the prompt asks only for the "Fully Correct Answer" for part (a) based on the provided 0.5-point rubric snippet.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. Not applicable as there are no numbers.

**Holistic Estimation:** While the concept is foundational, the requirement to produce the exact technical term in English ("Conduction") rather than a descriptive answer or a vernacular term (like *चालन* - Chalan) acts as a bottleneck for this specific demographic. However, due to high repetition of this specific example in classroom drills and rote learning common in the schooling system, a majority of students will recognize the term.
