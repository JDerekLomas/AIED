**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar.** The physical features of India are core components of the Grade 6 geography syllabus (NCERT). "The Himalayas" is one of the most culturally and academically reinforced geographic terms in Indian schools.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** There are no mathematical steps involved; it is a simple retrieval task.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** Some students might confuse "mountain peaks" (like Mt. Everest or K2) with "mountain ranges." Additionally, while the rubric accepts transliterated phonetic spellings, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the English spelling of "Vindhya" or "Aravalli."
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended recall.** The question requires generative recall rather than recognition (Multiple Choice). However, the rubric is generous, allowing for a wide variety of correct answers.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.**

**Holistic Estimation**
Given that "Himalayas" is a near-universal response and the second range (often Aravallis or Ghats) is frequently drilled in the curriculum, the primary barrier for this specific demographic is English spelling and the distinction between a peak and a range. However, the high familiarity of the content offsets the format demand.
