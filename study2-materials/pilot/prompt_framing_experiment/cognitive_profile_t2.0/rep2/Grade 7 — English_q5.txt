- Concept familiarity: Very familiar. This question is based on "The Squirrel," a core poem in the Grade 7 NCERT textbook (Honeycomb), which is the standard curriculum in Indian government schools. The "question mark" imagery is a central teaching point.
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step retrieval from memory or text).
- Common error traps: Minor. Students may confuse the physical description of the squirrel with the tail specifically, or they may struggle to articulate the metaphor in English despite understanding the concept.
- Format demand: Open-ended (Recall). While the rubric allows for "other similar acceptable answers," the lack of partial credit (1 or 0) makes it more difficult for students with limited vocabulary who might try to describe the shape without knowing the specific phrase.
- Number friendliness: N/A (Verbal task).

Holistic Estimate: While the content is familiar, the requirement to produce an English phrase from memory—rather than recognizing it in a multiple-choice format—poses a significant challenge for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds and economically weaker sections who may lack a strong foundational English vocabulary.
