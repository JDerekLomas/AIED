**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Rate of change and temperature are standard Grade 6 topics (Integers/Data Handling). However, for students from EWS backgrounds, while daily life involves temperature, the academic abstraction of "per hour" increases requires specific classroom exposure.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** 
    1. Determine elapsed time (16:00 minus 10:00).
    2. Multiply rate by time ($2 \times 6$).
    3. Add increase to initial value ($30 + 12$).
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** The primary trap is calculating the duration between "10:00 am" and "4:00 pm." Many students in this demographic struggle with the 12-hour clock transition (some may calculate $10 - 4 = 6$ by fluke, while others may calculate $4 + 10 = 14$ or lose track of the meridian transition). Linguistic nuances ("4:00 in the evening") can be confusing for ESL/Hindi-medium learners used to "16:00" or specific Hindi time markers.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** Since it is a 1-point item with an exact answer requirement and no partial credit, there is no "guess factor" benefit as in MCQ. One small arithmetic error results in zero marks.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The numbers ($30, 2, 4, 10, 6$) are all low integers and "friendly" for mental calculation. The complexity lies in the procedure, not the arithmetic itself.

**Analysis of Demographic Constraints:**
The transition from morning to evening across the 12:00 PM threshold is the significant "bottleneck" step for Grade 6 students. For students with limited English proficiency, decoding "increases by... per hour" into a multiplication operation is the second hurdle.
