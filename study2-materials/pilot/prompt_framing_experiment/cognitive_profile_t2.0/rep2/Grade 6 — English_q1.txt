- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. Locating information in a short story or textbook chapter (like "The Fun They Had") is a standard learning outcome for Grade 6, though performance depends heavily on having read the specific text.
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical item).
- **Common error traps:** Minor. Students often confuse "attic" with "cellar" or "library" if they have not grasped the vocabulary. For Hindi-medium students, the word "attic" itself is often an unfamiliar cultural concept/vocabulary word (a "lofti" or "tand"), which may lead to spelling errors or blank responses.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. Requires recall and the ability to construct a phrase. While the rubric is lenient, the student must still bridge the gap between their primary language and English to formulate the response.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A).
