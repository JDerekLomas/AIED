- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Identifying the central theme of a poem is a standard requirement for Grade 6 English, though students may struggle to articulate "importance" vs. simple description.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical task; single-layer inference.)
- **Common error traps:** Major (Students often select a specific literal detail from the poem rather than identifying the overarching "most important" theme; language barriers may lead to verbatim copying of irrelevant lines.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (High demand; requires syntactical construction in English. Partial credit is available, but a fully correct answer requires identifying the theme clearly.)
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Not applicable.)
