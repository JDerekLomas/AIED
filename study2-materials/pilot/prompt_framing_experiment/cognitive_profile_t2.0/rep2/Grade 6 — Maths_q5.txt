**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Less familiar.** While "5-digit numbers" are standard for Grade 6, the concept of a "palindrome" is often treated as a competitive math topic or a pattern-recognition exercise rather than a core NCERT textbook staple. For students in Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English term "palindrome" (if not translated to *vilompad* or explained as *ulta-pulta*) acts as a significant linguistic barrier.
*   **Computational Complexity: 2-3 steps.** Students must (1) identify/construct the smallest 5-digit palindrome, (2) identify/construct the largest 5-digit palindrome, and (3) perform addition. Note: The question also asks for the "difference," but the provided rubric only awards the mark for the "sum," creating a potential instructional/evaluative misalignment.
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.** 
    *   **Boundary errors:** Students often mistake 11,111 for the smallest or 90,009 for the largest. 
    *   **Carry-over errors:** Adding 10,001 + 99,999 requires multiple carries, which is a frequent site of procedural bugs for students in under-resourced schools.
    *   **Vocabulary:** Confusing "palindrome" with "prime" or "composite" due to similar linguistic positioning in word problems.
*   **Format Demand: Open-ended.** Requires pure recall and construction. With no options to choose from and a binary rubric (Max score 1, no partial credit mentioned), the demand for accuracy is high. 
*   **Number Friendliness: Moderate.** 99,999 and 10,001 are aesthetically pleasing, but the resulting sum (110,000) crosses into the 6-digit territory (Lakhs), which can trigger "sanity check" hesitation in students used to staying within the 10,000s.

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given the English-language barrier for the term "palindrome" and the requirement to perform multi-step construction and arithmetic without partial credit, the success rate will be low.
