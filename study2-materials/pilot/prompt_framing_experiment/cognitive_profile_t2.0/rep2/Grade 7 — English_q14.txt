- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. Antonyms are a core part of the Grade 7 vocabulary syllabus. However, the word "ancient" is often introduced through History textbooks rather than daily conversational English for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a single-step retrieval task.
- **Common error traps:** Minor. Students might confuse "antonym" with "synonym" (providing "old"). There is also a spelling risk; students may phonetically spell "modern" as "modren" or "new" as "nyu" based on regional accents.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. This requires active recall and correct spelling rather than recognition (multiple choice). No partial credit is available under the 1-mark rubric.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Language task).

**Analysis for target demographic:**
While the concept is simple, English proficiency is a barrier. Students in government schools often use the term "purana" (old), but "ancient" is a tier-2 vocabulary word. While they may understand the concept of "old/new," the specific academic vocabulary ("ancient/modern") presents a higher retrieval threshold for learners with limited exposure to English literature or media.
