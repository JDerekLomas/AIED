### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
This question is based on "The Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy, a core text in the NCERT Grade 7 curriculum (Honeycomb). Most students will have encountered this story in class. However, for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, while the *story* may be familiar, articulating the *reason* in English adds a layer of difficulty.

**Computational Complexity: 1**
As a reading comprehension task, it requires a single-step retrieval of information from memory or the text.

**Common Error Traps: Minor**
The main trap is a language barrier rather than a conceptual misunderstanding. Students might understand the reason but struggle with "Wh-" question syntax. They may provide a circular answer (e.g., "Because he wanted answers") without specifying the "three questions," or confuse "reward" with "punishment."

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
This is a high-demand format for English Language Learners (ELLs). Unlike multiple-choice questions, this requires active recall and sentence construction. Since the rubric allows for "any similar reason," it provides some leniency, but the lack of partial credit (binary 0/1) makes it stricter for students with grammatical issues.

**Number Friendliness: Easy**
Not applicable, though the "three" in the answer is a simple, concrete concept to grasp.

### Holistic Estimate
While the story is a staple of the curriculum, the requirement to construct an original sentence in English is a significant hurdle for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. Many students will understand the "why" in their home language but may fail to produce a coherent English response that satisfies the 1-point rubric requirement.
