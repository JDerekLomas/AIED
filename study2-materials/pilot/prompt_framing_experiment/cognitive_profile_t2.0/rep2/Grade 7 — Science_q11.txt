- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Evaporation is a core 6th and 7th-grade topic, but the distinction between pure substances and solutions introduces more complexity.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Simple comparison of values in a table.)
- **Common error traps:** Major (The "inverse relationship" trap: students often associate "fastest" with the "highest number," whereas "fastest" here means the "shortest time." Furthermore, the linguistic barrier for "salt solution" vs. "solute" interference adds difficulty.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires a written explanation for part B, which is highly challenging for Hindi-medium students with limited English vocabulary.)
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Comparing whole numbers or simple decimals is typically manageable.)

**Holistic Estimate:** Part (a) will have a high success rate, but Part (b) acts as a significant barrier. Students may understand the concept intuitively in Hindi but struggle to articulate the role of "impurities" or "solute particles" in English.
