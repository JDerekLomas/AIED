- Concept familiarity: less familiar (While 'wind' is common, the specific synonym 'breeze' is often tier-2 vocabulary for Hindi-medium learners who may rely on "hawa" for both terms; the distinction is nuanced in a second language context.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step identification/matching.)
- Common error traps: minor (Students may select a more common but inaccurate word from the passage, like 'air' or 'storm', or misspell 'breeze' as 'breze' or 'braze'.)
- Format demand: Open-ended (Requires pure recall/extraction; no options provided to trigger recognition. The rubric demands an exact word, though it is a low-stakes retrieval task.)
- Number friendliness: N/A (Verbal task.)
