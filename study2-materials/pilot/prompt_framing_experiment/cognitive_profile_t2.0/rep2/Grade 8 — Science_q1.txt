- **Concept familiarity**: Familiar (Microorganisms is a core chapter in Class 8 NCERT Science; the "bread mould" experiment is a standard activity).
- **Computational complexity**: 1 (Purely conceptual/qualitative; no calculations required).
- **Common error traps**: Minor (Students might confuse the cause with "humidity," "heat," or "old age" of the bread rather than naming the biological agent, or may struggle to recall the specific term "Fungi").
- **Format demand**: Open-ended/Recall (Requires production of terminology; however, the rubric allows for synonyms like "spoilage," which lowers the demand).
- **Number friendliness**: N/A (No numbers involved).

**Estimated Pass Rate**:
While the concept is central to the curriculum, the linguistic barrier for students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds often makes specific English terminology (like "Fungi" or "Mould") a bottleneck for an open-ended English-language response. Students may understand the phenomenon but struggle with the precise label.
