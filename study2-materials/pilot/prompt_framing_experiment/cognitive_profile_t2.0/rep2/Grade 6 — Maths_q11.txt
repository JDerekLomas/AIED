Concept familiarity: familiar (HCF is a core topic in Grade 6 NCERT)
Computational complexity: 2-3 (identification of operation followed by prime factorization or long division)
Common error traps: major (confusion between HCF and LCM is extremely common; students often perform LCM because "maximum" is misinterpreted or simply because it is a more recent procedural memory)
Format demand: Open-ended; though the rubric suggests a focus on the conceptual identification, the low maximum score (0.5) implies a binary "right/wrong" outcome without room for partial credit.
Number friendliness: moderate (69 is a "tricky" prime-looking number for students who struggle with divisibility rules for 3; 23 is a difficult prime factor to reach intuitively)
