### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
The distributive property is introduced in Class 6 and revisited extensively in Class 7 and 8 (Rational Numbers). However, while the property itself is known, students in this demographic often treat terms independently rather than identifying common factors unless explicitly prompted.

**Computational Complexity: 4+ steps**
1. Factor identification: Recognizing `9/16` as common.
2. Factoring/Rewriting: Setting up the bracket.
3. Rational number operations: Finding a common denominator for `4/12` and `-3/9` (Simplification within the bracket is a sub-step).
4. Addition/Subtraction of fractions.
5. Final Multiplication: Multiplying the factor by the sum.

**Common Error Traps: Major**
*   **Sign errors:** Handling the `-3/9` within the bracket is a frequent point of failure.
*   **Property bypass:** Students may attempt to solve by calculating products first (`9/16 * 4/12` and `9/16 * -3/9`), leading to large denominators and calculation errors, thereby failing the "use distributive property" requirement.
*   **Fraction addition:** Errors in LCM or cross-multiplication.

**Format Demand: High (Open-ended)**
The rubric requires a specific application of a property. Without partial credit (Max score 1), any error in sign or arithmetic results in zero points. For ESL/Hindi-medium students, the phrase "distributive property" must be correctly associated with the "Vitrak Guna" concept taught in Hindi textbooks.

**Number Friendliness: Moderate**
While `4/12` simplifies to `1/3` and `3/9` simplifies to `1/3`, students often miss these internal simplifications and work with the larger denominators (12 and 9), increasing the likelihood of arithmetic slips.
