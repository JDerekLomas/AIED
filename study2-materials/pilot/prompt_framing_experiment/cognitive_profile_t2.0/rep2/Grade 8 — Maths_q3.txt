### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Basic probability (favorable outcomes over total outcomes) is introduced in Grade 7 and reinforced in Grade 8 NCERT curricula. Students usually find this concept more intuitive than geometry or algebra, though the English terminology (e.g., "drawn at random") can occasionally cause hesitation for ESL learners.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2–3 steps.** 
    1. Addition (4 + 6 = 10).
    2. Setting up the fraction (4/10).
    3. Simplifying the fraction (2/5), though many may stop at 4/10 or 0.4.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** The most common "procedural bug" is using the number of white balls as the denominator (4/6) instead of the total (4/10), reflecting a misunderstanding of "part-to-whole" versus "part-to-part" relationships.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** Requires recall of the formula. In many Indian government school contexts, students are trained on rote-pattern recognition for these types of "ball" questions. While no partial credit is offered in a 1-mark schema, the steps are minimal.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The numbers 4 and 6 sum to 10, making division and decimal conversion extremely simple.

### Holistic Estimation
While the math is simple, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the English phrasing if the paper is not bilingual. Furthermore, the leap from counting to proportional reasoning (probability) often presents a hurdle for students with inconsistent foundational math support.
