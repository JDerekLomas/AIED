**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** While the "Needs of Plants" is a foundational topic introduced early in primary school, the application of "stunted growth" and "yellowing" as diagnostic symptoms is specifically introduced in the Grade 6 Science curriculum (under "Getting to Know Plants" or "Components of Food"). 
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** There are no arithmetic calculations required. The logic is a direct cause-effect inference.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** For students with limited English proficiency, "stunted" is a high-level academic term not commonly used in everyday conversation. Furthermore, students often equate "yellowing" solely with "dead" or "old" rather than a specific deficiency. Many may provide a generic response ("it is sick") rather than the inferred *need* required by the prompt.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** This requires active recall and sentence construction in English. Since partial marks are not explicitly allowed in a 1-mark "correct/incorrect" rubric, the demand for linguistic accuracy and logical linkage is high.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** N/A.

**Analysis of Target Cohort:**
Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds and economically weaker sections may have high practical knowledge of agriculture but will struggle with the English terminology ("stunted," "infer," "evidence"). The leap from observing a symptom to identifying a "nutrient deficiency" in a second language significantly depresses the success rate despite the biological simplicity of the task.
