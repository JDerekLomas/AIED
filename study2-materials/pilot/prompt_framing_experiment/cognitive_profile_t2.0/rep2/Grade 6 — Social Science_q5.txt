**Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The Vedic period is a core component of the Grade 6 History curriculum (NCERT/State Boards), typically taught in the first half of the academic year.
**Computational complexity:** 1. This is a purely qualitative recall task requiring no mathematical operations.
**Common error traps:** Minor. A frequent confusion exists between the Early Vedic (pastoral) and Later Vedic (agricultural) periods. Additionally, students might confuse the nomadic nature of Vedic tribes with the urban trade-based economy of the Harappan civilization.
**Format demand:** Open-ended. This requires active recall and sentence construction rather than simple recognition. While the rubric is binary (1 or 0), the two-part nature of the question (identify + describe) increases the linguistic demand for ESL/Hindi-medium learners.
**Number friendliness:** Not applicable (easy).

**Holistic Estimate:** 
The transition from identifying a fact ("agriculture" or "cattle rearing") to describing a "key aspect" in English poses a significant hurdle for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. While they likely know the content in their native tongue, translating that understanding into a descriptive English sentence often leads to partial or grammatical failure.
