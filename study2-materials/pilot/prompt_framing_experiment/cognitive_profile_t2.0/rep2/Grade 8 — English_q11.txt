- Concept familiarity: very familiar (trees and local surroundings are staple topics in rural/semi-urban Indian curricula)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative task, single block of production)
- Common error traps: major (Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with English syntax, subject-verb agreement, and the transition from local dialect thoughts to formal English expression)
- Format demand: Open-ended (Requires high recall and synthesis; since the maximum score is 1, it is a binary 'pass/fail' format with no partial credit, which increases difficulty significantly)
- Number friendliness: easy (No numerical calculation required)
