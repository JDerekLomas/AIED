- Concept familiarity: less familiar (While basic human rights are introduced, specific children's rights under frameworks like the RTE or UNCRC are often abstract and less ingrained than general civic duties in Grade 6.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Logical retrieval and explanation steps.)
- Common error traps: major (Students frequently confuse "rights" with "duties" or general "needs" like food and toys; also, explaining "importance" often results in circular reasoning or tautology which fails the rubric.)
- Format demand: Open-ended/Recall; rubrics for English Language Learners in EWS categories often struggle with the "explain" component even if they can list the nouns; No partial credit according to the Max Score 1.
- Number friendliness: easy (Non-mathematical item.)
