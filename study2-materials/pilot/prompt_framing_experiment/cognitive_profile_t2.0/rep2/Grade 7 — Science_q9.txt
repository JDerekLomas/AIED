Concept familiarity: familiar (Pitcher plants are a core component of Chapter 1 in the Grade 7 Science NCERT textbook.)
Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative identification only.)
Common error traps: major (Students often struggle to explain *why* photosynthesis is insufficient; they often mistakenly believe the plant eats insects for "food/energy" rather than specifically for nitrogen/minerals.)
Format demand: Open-ended recall; linguistic barrier is significant as students must explain reasoning in English. While the rubric only mentions (a), the full item requires three distinct responses for a "fully correct" outcome.
Number friendliness: N/A
