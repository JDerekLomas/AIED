- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. Rajasthan’s rural economy (primary sector) is a staple topic in State and NCERT textbooks, and many students from economically weaker sections have lived experience or proximity to these livelihoods.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a purely qualitative recall and descriptive task.
- **Common error traps:** Minor. Students might struggle with specific English terminology for occupations (e.g., using "animals" instead of "Animal Husbandry") or confuse regional handicrafts with large-scale industrial manufacturing.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). While the rubric asks for two names and a brief description for a single mark, the demand for linguistic expression in English may pose a barrier to providing a "complete" description, though the factual recall is straightforward.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. No numerical calculation is required.
