- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Students in Grade 7 are taught Parts of Speech, though the distinction between an "adjective" and an "adjective phrase" is often blurred in State Board curricula).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Single identification step).
- **Common error traps:** Major (The question asks for an "adjective phrase," but the rubric only requires identifying "tiny," which is a single adjective. Students might get confused by the word "phrase" or incorrectly identify "in our balcony" as it describes the location/noun).
- **Format demand:** Exact (Open-ended identification; however, the rubric's mismatch with the question terminology adds a layer of cognitive dissonance).
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Language-based item).

**Holistic Estimation:**
In the context of Hindi-medium students from economically weaker sections, "tiny" is a less common vocabulary word compared to "small." Furthermore, students often struggle to distinguish between adjectives (tiny) and prepositional phrases acting as adjectives (in our balcony). However, since the rubric only asks for a single word, many students will default to the most familiar word describing the noun.
