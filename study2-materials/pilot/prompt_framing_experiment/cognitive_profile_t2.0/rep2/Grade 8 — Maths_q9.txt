**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Discount, Marked Price, and Profit/Loss are core Grade 8 topics in the NCERT/State Board curricula. however, the multi-step "bridging" between MP, SP, and CP is often considered a higher-order application within this unit.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** Students must first calculate the Discounted Selling Price (1200 - 120) and then apply the Profit formula to find the Cost Price ($1080 \div 1.08$). 
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students in this demographic often confuse the base (denominator) for percentages. Common "procedural bugs" include calculating 8% of the Selling Price instead of the Cost Price, or simply adding/subtracting percentages (e.g., assuming Profit % - Discount % = Net gain).
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** As a 1-mark question with no partial credit, any computational slip in the two-stage process results in a zero. The requirement to recall two distinct formulae (SP = MP - Discount and CP = SP / (1 + P%)) without prompts is challenging.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The numbers (1200, 10%, 8%) are mathematically "clean." $1080$ is exactly divisible by $108$, which rewards students who reach the final step correctly.

**Contextual Factors:**
For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, terms like "Marked Price" (अंकित मूल्य) and "Cost Price" (क्रय मूल्य) are standard, but the word "allows" or the structure of the word problem in English may pose a linguistic barrier. In EWS contexts, students often show strong "street math" logic for discounts but struggle with the formal algebraic inversion required to find CP from SP.
