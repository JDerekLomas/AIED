- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Photosynthesis is introduced in Grade 4/5 in EVS; however, formal terminology often remains abstract for students with limited English exposure).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical task).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Common spelling errors in "Photosynthesis" for Hindi-medium students; potential confusion between "Leaf" and "Stem" depending on the plant types discussed in class).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended recall; demanding due to the spelling of a long, multisyllabic scientific term. Note: The rubric/score constraint (0.5 max) implies no partial credit for identifying the 'kitchen' if the process name is incorrect/misspelled.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative).
