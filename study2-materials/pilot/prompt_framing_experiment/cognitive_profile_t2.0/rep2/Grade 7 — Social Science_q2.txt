- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (This is a core topic in NCERT Geography, but students often struggle to distinguish between 'human-made' and 'human' environment).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No arithmetic involved; purely verbal).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students frequently confuse "human environment" with "human-made environment" like buildings; they also struggle with the abstract concept of "human interaction/culture" as an environment).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended; requires recall and articulation in English. With a maximum score of only 0.5, partial credit is unlikely or penalizes small errors heavily. Language barrier is a significant hurdle for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds to express "modify" or "interact" precisely.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Not applicable).
