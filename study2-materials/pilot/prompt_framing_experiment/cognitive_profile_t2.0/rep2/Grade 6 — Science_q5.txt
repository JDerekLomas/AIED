- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The iodine test is a standard demonstration in NCERT Chapter 2 "Components of Food," but physical laboratory exposure may be limited in these schools.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical procedural recall.)
- **Common error traps:** Major (Confusion between different indicators, e.g., using copper sulphate/caustic soda instead of iodine; naming the wrong final color—confusing blue-black with the violet color for proteins.)
- **Format demand:** High (Open-ended recall requires constructing sentences in English. Many students may know "iodine" and "blue" but struggle to structure the "describe the procedure" part effectively to earn the point, especially given the low-proficiency English context.)
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative/categorical data.)
