**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Less familiar**. While the Angle Sum Property of a triangle (sum = 180°) is a core Grade 6 topic in the NCERT/State curriculum, the students' background suggests a language barrier in translating geometric definitions. In many government schools, Grade 6 is the introductory year for formal Euclidean geometry concepts like internal angles.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps**. The student must (1) sum the two known angles (A+B) and (2) subtract that sum from 180.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major**. Students from this demographic often confuse "internal angles" with "supplementary angles" on a straight line. Additionally, the lack of a visual diagram in this prompt suggests a potential cognitive load issue where students may struggle to visualize the triangle if the text is English-heavy.
*   **Format Demand:** **Partial credit possible (in theory)**. The rubric specifies 0.5 marks for finding the final value (80°). This implies a "Correct/Incorrect" binary at the final step, providing no buffer for calculation slips.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Moderate**. While subtracting from 180 is generally easier than complex decimals, the calculation `180 - (Angle A + Angle B)` requires borrowing/regrouping across zeros, a common source of error for students with weak foundational arithmetic.
