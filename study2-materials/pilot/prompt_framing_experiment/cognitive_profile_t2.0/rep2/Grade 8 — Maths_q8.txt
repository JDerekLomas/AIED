**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Properties of parallelograms (opposite angles are equal, adjacent angles are supplementary) are core Grade 8 topics in the NCERT/State Board curricula. However, while students often recognize the "opposite angles" rule quickly, the supplementary relationship for adjacent angles is often less reinforced.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** Finding $x$ requires a single subtraction (180 - 70 = 110). Finding $y$ requires no computation, only identification ($y$ = 70). 
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** In the Indian context, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the geometry vocabulary in English. A common procedural bug is the "linear pair" vs. "adjacent angle" distinction. Students may also misidentify which angles are equal, erroneously labeling all interior angles as 70 or assuming $x$ and $y$ are the same.
*   **Format Demand:** **High (Relative to Rubric).** The rubric requires both the correct value (110) AND an explanation. For students with limited English proficiency, "giving an explanation" (e.g., writing "Adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary") is a significant linguistic barrier, even if they understand the mathematical logic.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The use of 70 and 110 involves multiples of 10, which are simple for mental subtraction.

**Estimation Analysis:**
While the math is straightforward, the "explanation" requirement in the rubric is a major hurdle for this specific demographic. Students may arrive at 110 but fail to express the geometric reasoning in written English, leading to a loss of the single mark under a strict rubric.
