Concept familiarity: familiar (Fractions and the 'of' operator are introduced in Grade 6 and reinforced in Grade 7 NCERT curriculum)
Computational complexity: 2-3 (Requires two separate multiplications followed by a fraction comparison)
Common error traps: major (Students often struggle with comparing fractions with unlike denominators, e.g., $3/8$ vs $4/15$, and may incorrectly conclude $4/15$ is larger because the digits are larger, or fail to find a common denominator)
Format demand: Open-ended (Requires showing calculations; however, the rubric is binary [1 or 0], which penalizes students who perform the multiplication correctly but fail the final comparison)
Number friendliness: moderate (The resulting denominators [8 and 15] lead to a relatively high common denominator [120] for manual comparison, increasing the chance of arithmetic errors for students with low fluency)
