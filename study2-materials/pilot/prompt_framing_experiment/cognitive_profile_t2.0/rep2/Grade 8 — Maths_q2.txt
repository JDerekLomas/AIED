### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
Algebraic identities and the multiplication of binomials are core components of the Class 8 NCERT curriculum. By the time students reach assessments, they have typically encountered "Horizontal" or "Column" methods of expansion. However, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle if the term "product" is not immediately translated to "गुणनफल" (Gunaphal).

**Computational Complexity: 4+ Steps**
1. Distributive property setup: $3a(2a + 3b) - 2b(2a + 3b)$.
2. Four individual monomial multiplications (multiplying coefficients).
3. Applying the Law of Exponents for $a \cdot a$ and $b \cdot b$.
4. Combining like terms ($9ab$ and $-4ab$).

**Common Error Traps: Major**
*   **Signage Errors:** The $-2b$ is a significant trap. Many students fail to distribute the negative sign to the second term of the second binomial, resulting in $+6b^2$ instead of $-6b^2$.
*   **Like Terms Confusion:** Students may attempt to add $6a^2$ and $5ab$.
*   **Variable Handling:** Forgetting to square the variables (writing $6a$ instead of $6a^2$).

**Format Demand: High (Open-ended)**
The rubric requires a full expansion. Since it is an all-or-nothing (Max score 1) rubric with no partial credit, any single error in signage or coefficient calculation results in a score of 0. For students with limited English, an open-ended "Find the product" is more intimidating than a multiple-choice format.

**Number Friendliness: Easy**
The coefficients (2 and 3) are small integers, minimizing pure arithmetic failure. The challenge is purely structural and algebraic.

**Contextual Consideration (EWS/Hindi-medium):**
Algebraic abstraction is a common hurdle for students with limited academic support at home. While the procedure is "familiar," the "major" error traps regarding negative signs and the lack of partial credit significantly depress the expected success rate in this specific demographic.
