**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Less familiar.** While Grade 7 Civics curricula (NCERT) introduce concepts of democracy and the role of the government, "transparency" is an abstract, multi-syllabic academic term. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle to map this specific English term to the concept of *soochana* (information) or *parda-darshita* (transparency) without linguistic scaffolding.
*   **Computational Complexity: 1.** This is a qualitative task involving no mathematical calculation.
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.** The primary trap is "semantic blurring." Students often confuse "governance" with "policing" or general "good behavior." Additionally, students may suggest ways to improve *society* generally (e.g., "don't throw trash") rather than structural ways to improve *transparency* (e.g., RTI, public records, or open meetings).
*   **Format Demand:** Open-ended. This requires active recall and sentence construction in a second language. While the rubric is generous (accepting any one way), the student must bridge the gap between an abstract noun and a concrete action, which is a high-level cognitive shift (Bloom's: Synthesis/Creation).
*   **Number Friendliness: N/A.** No numbers involved.

**Holistic Estimation**
The combination of limited English proficiency and the abstract nature of the term "transparency" poses a significant barrier. Even if students understand the mechanics of democracy, the vocabulary barrier in an open-ended English-language response format will likely suppress performance.
