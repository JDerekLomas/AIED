**Concept familiarity:** Less familiar
While division and unitary methods are standard for Grade 8, the specific logic of "minimum additional quantity required" to reach the next multiple is an optimization/rounding concept that is often less practiced than straightforward division.

**Computational complexity:** 2-3
The student must first perform long division (300 ÷ 80), interpret the remainder (60), determine the shortfall (80 - 60 = 20), and calculate the new total (320). Finally, they must divide this total by the number of classes (320 ÷ 8).

**Common error traps:** Major
Students in this demographic frequently struggle with "word-to-math" translation. Many will likely answer "3.75" or "3 remainder 60" for the first part. The biggest trap is the phrase "minimum number of chocolates required"; students often interpret this as "the total you already have" (300) rather than finding the next multiple of 80 (320).

**Format demand:** Exact Answer
With a maximum score of 1 and no partial credit mentioned in the rubric for the intermediate division, the student must successfully navigate both logical leaps (rounding up and secondary division) to get the mark.

**Number friendliness:** Moderate
The numbers are multiples of 10, which helps, but the mismatch between 300 and 80 introduces remainders, which increases the cognitive load for students used to "clean" divisions.

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given the English language barrier (understanding "minimum number required") and the two-step logic required to reach 320 chocolates before dividing by 8 classes, many students will falter at the interpretive stage.
