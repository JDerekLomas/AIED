**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar**. The concept of "Heat" and "Fibers/Fabrics" are core components of the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum (Chapters 3 and 4). The daily life application makes it relatable.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **None (1)**. There are no mathematical calculations required for this item.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor**. The main trap is linguistic rather than conceptual. Students may intuitively know the answer (absorption/reflection) but struggle to express "properties of fabric" or "reflection" in formal English. They might focus only on sweat (comfort) and omit the heat-radiation aspect required by the prompt.
*   **Format Demand:** **High**. Open-ended recall is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice for students with limited English proficiency. While the rubric is lenient ("bounce off" vs. "reflect"), the requirement to state *two* scientific reasons increases the cognitive load, as students must retrieve and articulate two distinct mechanisms. 
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A**. This is a conceptual/qualitative item.

**Linguistic/Contextual Note:** For Indian students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, words like "radiation," "absorption," and "reflection" are hurdles. If the student cannot recall the technical term, they must possess enough vocabulary to describe the process ("stops the heat"). The holistic success rate is suppressed primarily by the "two reasons" requirement and the open-ended format.
