**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (This is the opening chapter of the NCERT Class 7 English textbook, "Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy, a foundational text in the curriculum).

**Computational complexity:** 0 (This is a qualitative recall task).

**Common error traps:** Minor. Students often struggle with the grammatical transition from "who/what/when" to "the right people/the right thing/the right time." Students might also confuse the hermit's later philosophical answers with the king's original questions.

**Format demand:** High. This is an open-ended recall item requiring a multi-part answer. For a score of 1, the student must successfully recall three distinct variables. Given the English proficiency levels described, the linguistic burden of constructing three grammatically coherent points in English is significant, even if the conceptual recall is present.

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Non-mathematical).

**Holistic Estimate:** While the story is iconic and widely taught, the requirement for a complete three-part recall in the L2 (English) without prompts or partial credit creates a significant barrier for students from Hindi-medium, EWS backgrounds. Many will remember the "essence" but fail to articulate all three specific components required by the rubric in English.
