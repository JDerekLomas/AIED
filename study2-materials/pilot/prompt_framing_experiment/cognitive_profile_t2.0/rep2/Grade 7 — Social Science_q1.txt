- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (This is usually the introductory chapter of the Grade 7 History curriculum in India).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical conceptual recall).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse "importance of dates" with "memorizing specific dates"; they may argue dates are *unimportant* or "boring" based on personal sentiment rather than historiographical utility).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires productive language skills. While partial credit is possible in practice, the 1-mark maximum makes it an all-or-nothing binary in many standardized scoring systems. The primary barrier is translating the concept into a coherent English sentence).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (The logic of chronology is intuitive, even if expressed simply).

**Holistic Estimate:** 
Despite the conceptual simplicity, students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds often struggle to articulate abstract "importance" in English. They likely understand the concept but may produce grammatically broken or overly brief responses ("Dates tell us time") that barely meet the rubric's requirement.
