- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Ruminant digestion is a core chapter in Grade 7 Science NCERT/State Boards, but specific terminology like "rumen" may be harder to recall than the general concept).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No calculations required; single-step conceptual association).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse "rumination" with "vomiting" or may fail to link the biological structure specifically to the diet of cellulose/grass as requested).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (High demand for students with limited English proficiency; expressing complex biological processes in a second language often leads to "know but cannot show").
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Not applicable).

**Psychometric Analysis:**
While the topic is standard, the open-ended nature of the question presents a linguistic barrier for students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds. They may understand that a cow has "four stomachs" or "eats grass," but articulating the "why" (evolutionary adaptation for cellulose) in English is challenging. The 1-mark rubric is strict, though it allows for "special/multiple stomachs," which lowers the threshold slightly.
