**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. In the Indian Grade 8 curriculum (NCERT/State Boards), fables (like Panchatantra or Aesop's Fables) are frequently used. However, while students recognize a fable, the technical act of "defining" it in English is a higher-order task than identifying one.
*   **Computational complexity:** N/A (Language task).
*   **Common error traps:** Major. For Hindi-medium students, the linguistic barrier is high. Common traps include confusing "fable" with "fairytale" or "story," or being able to name a fable but unable to articulate the specific criteria (animals + moral) in grammatically correct English.
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This is high difficulty. Unlike a multiple-choice question where the definition is provided for recognition, this requires retrieval and sentence construction. There is no partial credit mentioned in the rubric.
*   **Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Estimation Analysis:**
While the concept of a moral-bearing animal story is well-understood conceptually, the requirement to "Define" in English poses a significant hurdle. Students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency often struggle with active vocabulary recall (words like "typically," "imparts," "moral lesson"). Many will provide a vague answer ("A story about animals") which fails the rubric’s requirement for the "moral lesson" component.
