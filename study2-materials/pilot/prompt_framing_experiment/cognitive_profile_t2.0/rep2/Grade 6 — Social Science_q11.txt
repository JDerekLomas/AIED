- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Road safety is a standard EVS/Social Science topic frequently discussed in Indian primary and middle school curricula and local awareness campaigns).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical item; requires direct identification of reasons).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may conflate personal safety with "community function" or struggle to articulate the "how" part of the question due to language constraints, even if they grasp the concept).
- **Format demand:** High (Open-ended recall. Despite the simple rubric, the multi-part structure—2 reasons + community impact explanation—is demanding for a single-point item. Since the rubric mentions "any two reasons" but the prompt asks for three distinct outputs, there is a mismatch that may penalize students who provide only the reasons).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Not applicable).
