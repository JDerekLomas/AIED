### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
Linear equations in one variable are a core part of the Grade 8 NCERT syllabus. However, while students are generally familiar with solving $x + a = b$, the structural setup of "variable expressions on both sides" with fractional denominators is often introduced later in the academic year and requires higher abstraction.

**Computational Complexity: 4+ Steps**
Despite being a single-point item, the procedural depth is significant:
1. Identify the need for cross-multiplication.
2. Apply the Distributive Property: $5(x-5)$ and $3(x-3)$.
3. Execute integer multiplication ($5 \times -5$ and $3 \times -3$).
4. Group like terms (transposition).
5. Final division to isolate $x$.

**Common Error Traps: Major**
For this demographic, several high-probability "procedural bugs" exist:
*   **Partial Distribution:** Writing $5x - 5 = 3x - 3$ (forgetting to multiply the constant).
*   **Sign Errors:** Mistakes during transposition (e.g., $5x - 3x = -9 - 25$ instead of $+25$).
*   **Inverse Operations:** Confusion regarding the "cross" movement, sometimes trying to find a common denominator instead.

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
As a "solve and find" question without multiple-choice options, students lack the "recognition" cue. There is no scaffolding or back-substitution possibility for those struggling with the initial step. With no partial credit (binary 0/1 scoring), a single arithmetic slip results in zero marks.

**Number Friendliness: Moderate**
The numbers 3 and 5 are small and prime, which simplifies the initial cross-multiplication. However, the result ($2x = 16 \rightarrow x = 8$) requires clear step-through logic to reach.

**Language/Context Barrier**
While the math is symbolic, "Solve the equation" may be a barrier for Hindi-medium learners if they haven't been consistently exposed to the English command terms, though the algebraic notation itself is universal.

**Holistic Estimation**
Given the binary rubric (all or nothing) and the high likelihood of sign errors or distribution mistakes among students from under-resourced backgrounds with high pupil-teacher ratios, the success rate is likely to be below the midpoint.
