**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. The transition of the East India Company from "Trade to Territory" is a cornerstone of the Grade 8 NCERT History curriculum and is heavily emphasized in classroom instruction.
*   **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a purely qualitative historical description requiring no mathematical operations.
*   **Common error traps:** Minor. While students may struggle to explain the "process" in detail (wars, treaties, etc.), the rubric only requires identifying their initial status as "traders." The primary trap is a lack of vocabulary to bridge the transition.
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). While open-ended questions are generally harder for students with limited English proficiency, the rubric is exceptionally lenient, requiring only a single identification (mentioning they arrived as traders) to gain the full 1 point. This negates the "Describe" command's typical complexity.
*   **Number friendliness:** Easy. No numerical manipulation is required.

**Analysis of Target Demographics:**
Given that the rubric is "low-stakes" (mentioning they were traders is enough for the point), the difficulty shifts from high-level synthesis to simple recognition of a foundational fact. Even students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often retain the phrase "vyaapaari" (traders) or the English equivalent due to the repetitive nature of the narrative in textbooks. The barrier is low despite the broad "Describe" prompt.
