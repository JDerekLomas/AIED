**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Familiar.** Unitary method problems (multiplication for "many") are standard in Grade 7. However, applying it to non-integer values is where proficiency often drops for students in this demographic.
*   **Computational Complexity: 2-3 steps.** Students must (1) convert the mixed fraction ($5 \frac{3}{4}$) into an improper fraction ($\frac{23}{4}$), (2) multiply by the whole number ($10$), and (3) simplify or convert the resulting fraction ($\frac{230}{4}$) into a decimal or mixed number ($57.5$ or $57 \frac{1}{2}$).
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.** For Hindi-medium students with limited English proficiency, "liter," "diesel," and "travel" are familiar enough, but the fraction $5 \frac{3}{4}$ acts as a significant barrier. Common errors include adding $10 + 5 \frac{3}{4}$, ignoring the fraction and calculating $10 \times 5$, or incorrect conversion of the mixed fraction (e.g., $5 \times 3 + 4 = 19$).
*   **Format Demand:** Open-ended. Without options to guide them (Multiple Choice), students must successfully navigate the algorithm from start to finish. Per the rubric, though the score is for identifying the operation, typically in these assessments, the "correct operation" is verified by the result.
*   **Number Friendliness: Moderate.** $10$ is a "friendly" multiplier, but the denominator $4$ and the mixed fraction structure increase the cognitive load significantly for students struggling with basic numeracy.

**Analysis**
While the mathematical operation is simple (Multiplication), the presence of a mixed fraction is a known high-difficulty hurdle for students in economically weaker sections (EWS) schools, where fractional fluency often lags behind grade-level expectations. The translation of word problems into operations is the primary bottleneck.
