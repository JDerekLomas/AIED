Concept familiarity: familiar (Magnets are a high-interest topic in Grade 6 Science, typically introduced through hands-on activities).
Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative observation, no calculations).
Common error traps: minor (Possible confusion between North-North and North-South behavior; linguistic confusion between "attract" and "repel").
Format demand: Open-ended (Requires active recall of the term "repel" or "push away" rather than recognition from a list; no partial credit for a binary outcome).
Number friendliness: easy (Not applicable/No numerical processing).

Your estimate:
0.65
