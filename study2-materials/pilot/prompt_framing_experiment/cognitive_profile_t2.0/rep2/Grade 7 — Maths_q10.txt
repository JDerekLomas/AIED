- Concept familiarity: familiar
- Computational complexity: 4+ (Algebraic setup, subtraction, division, and area multiplication)
- Common error traps: major (confusion between perimeter/area formulas, units, and algebraic isolation)
- Format demand: Open-ended (Recall based; rubric is binary 0/1 meaning no partial credit for getting the width correct but the area wrong)
- Number friendliness: easy
