**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. The Indian Constitution and Fundamental Rights are staple topics in the Class 6-8 Social Science (Civics) curriculum. These rights are often displayed on school walls and in the front pages of textbooks.
*   **Computational complexity:** 1. There is no arithmetic or logic-based processing involved.
*   **Common error traps:** Minor. Some students might confuse Fundamental Rights with Fundamental Duties or Directive Principles. Additionally, students might list a single right multiple times or name a right that is no longer fundamental (e.g., Right to Property).
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended/Recall. While multiple-choice would be easier, the rubric's allowance for "common or simplified phrasing" (e.g., "Right to equality" or "Azadi") significantly lowers the barrier for students with limited English proficiency.
*   **Number friendliness:** Easy. Recalling "two" items is a low memory-load task.
