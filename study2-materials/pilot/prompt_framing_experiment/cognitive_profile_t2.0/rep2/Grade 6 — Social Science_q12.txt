### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
At the Grade 6 level in India (NCERT/State Boards), the "Lion Capital of Ashoka" is introduced early in History and Civics. While students see currency daily, the transition from recognizing the image to identifying it as the "National Emblem" or linking it specifically to Ashoka is a standard curriculum milestone. However, for students from economically weaker sections, while the currency is familiar, the academic terminology (e.g., "Emblem," "Capital") is often a secondary linguistic layer.

**Computational Complexity: 1**
This is a non-computational, qualitative question. It requires a 1-step retrieval of factual information.

**Common Error Traps: Minor**
Students often confuse the reason for its presence (symbolic/legal status) with physical descriptions (e.g., "because lions are brave" or "to make the note look good"). There is also a risk of students knowing the image but lacking the specific English vocabulary to name the "Sarnath Lion Capital" or "National Emblem" accurately.

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
This requires high-level recall rather than recognition (as in multiple choice). Given the rubric requires two specific points (Lion Capital of Ashoka + National Emblem) for a 1-mark maximum, there is no room for partial credit. For English Language Learners (ELL), expressing this complex historical link in a second language significantly raises the barrier.

**Number Friendliness: Easy**
Not applicable as there are no numerical operations, but the "quantity" of facts to recall is manageable (2 key facts).

**Holistic Estimate**
While the visual stimulus is ubiquitous, the requirement to produce specific technical terms ("Ashoka" and "National Emblem") in English is challenging for Grade 6 students from Hindi-medium or disadvantaged backgrounds. Many will provide "vague" but conceptually "half-correct" answers (e.g., "it is our national animal") which would fail this specific rubric.
