**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (This is a core topic in the Grade 6 NCERT Science syllabus under the chapter "The Living Organisms — Characteristics and Habitats.")

**Computational complexity:** 1 (None; purely qualitative/conceptual.)

**Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse "adaptations" with simple "actions." A common misconception is confusing desert plant traits with those of aquatic plants, or providing a general statement like "they live in sand" without explaining a specific structural/behavioral trait.)

**Format demand:** Open-ended; high demand for Hindi-medium/EWS students due to the requirement to explain in English. While the rubric is lenient (only one trait required), the lack of partial credit (1 or 0) and the need for descriptive recall makes it harder than a multiple-choice item.

**Number friendliness:** Easy (Not applicable as it is a non-numerical question.)

**Analysis:** While the content is a curriculum staple, the transition from Hindi to English at Grade 6 poses a significant linguistic barrier for EWS students. They likely understand the concept (e.g., "thorns" or "long roots") but may struggle to articulate the functional "why" or "how" in English to satisfy a formal explanation rubric. However, the rubric's low threshold (describing only one way) increases the likelihood of success.
