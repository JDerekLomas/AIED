- Concept familiarity: **less familiar** (At the Grade 7 level, NCERT history curricula often focus on dynastic chronologies or architectural achievements; shifting the lens to systemic economic analysis requires a higher level of abstract thinking.)
- Computational complexity: **1** (No math required.)
- Common error traps: **major** (Students often conflate "economic impact" with "general impact," such as losing soldiers or land. Additionally, English-language learners may struggle with the abstract term "economic life.")
- Format demand: **Open-ended/High recall** (The rubric requires a "distinct and plausible" link. Without options, students must self-generate complex cause-and-effect relationships.)
- Number friendliness: **N/A** (Purely qualitative.)

Holistic estimate: Given the linguistic barrier for Hindi-medium learners and the shift from rote memorization to "assessment," most students are likely to provide vague or descriptive answers rather than identifying a specific economic mechanism (like treasury depletion, trade route disruption, or taxation increases).
