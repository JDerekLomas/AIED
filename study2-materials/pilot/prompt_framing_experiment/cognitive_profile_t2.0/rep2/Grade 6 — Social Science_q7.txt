- Concept familiarity: **Familiar**. Geography of India is a core component of Grade 6; however, students may struggle to differentiate "natural resources" from "occupations" or "landforms."
- Computational complexity: **1** (Non-computational; requires linking a resource to a social outcome).
- Common error traps: **Major**. Students often confuse "natural resources" with human-made objects or generic items (like "food"). Furthermore, there is a "Double-Barreled" risk: many students will name the resources but fail to provide the qualitative explanation required for the full point.
- Format demand: **High**. Open-ended recall in English is a significant barrier for students from Hindi-medium/low-resource backgrounds. Translating the *impact* of a resource (e.g., "Mica is used for...") requires higher-order syntax than simple vocabulary. No partial credit is allowed according to the rubric (Max score 1), making it an "all or nothing" task.
- Number friendliness: **Easy** (N/A).
