**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The use of a protractor is introduced in Grade 5/6 and is a staple of practical geometry, though precision remains a challenge.)

**Computational complexity:** 1 (No calculations are required; this is a direct procedural application task.)

**Common error traps:** Major (The "Inner vs. Outer Scale" confusion is highly prevalent. Many students will likely draw a 70° angle when aiming for 110°, or a 140° angle when aiming for 40°, due to incorrect baseline alignment or scale reading.)

**Format demand:** Open-ended/Construction. No partial credit is allowed per the rubric. Physical motor skills and tool availability are additional constraints.

**Number friendliness:** Easy (Multiples of 10 are standard and align clearly with major markings on most protractors.)

**Holistic Estimate:** While students are familiar with the tool, the language barrier in instructions and the high frequency of reading the supplementary angle (the reverse scale) significantly reduce success rates in these demographics.
