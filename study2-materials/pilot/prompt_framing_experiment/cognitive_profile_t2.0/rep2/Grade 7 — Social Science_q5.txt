- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The rock cycle is a core component of the Grade 7 Geography curriculum, specifically under 'Inside Our Earth'.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical task; requires sequencing qualitative stages.)
- **Common error traps:** Major (Students often confuse "weathering/erosion" with "heat/pressure" or fail to identify the transitional state of 'sediments' between the two rock types. Linguistic confusion between 'igneous' and 'sedimentary' terminology is common in non-native speakers.)
- **Format demand:** High (Open-ended recall in a second language is significantly harder than recognition-based tasks for this demographic; no partial credit is offered per the rubric.)
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Non-numerical item.)
