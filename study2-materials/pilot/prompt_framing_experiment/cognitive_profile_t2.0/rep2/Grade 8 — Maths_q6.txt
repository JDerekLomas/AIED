**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** "Age word problems" are a staple of the Grade 8 curriculum in India (Linear Equations in One Variable). However, for this specific cohort, the distinction between "ratio/multiple" and "linear difference" can sometimes be a point of confusion.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** 
    1. Calculate father’s current age (12 × 3 = 36).
    2. Optional: Calculate both ages after 5 years (17 and 41).
    3. Calculate the difference (36 - 12 = 24 or 41 - 17 = 24).
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** The primary trap is the "Linear Aging Paradox." Students often erroneously believe that if the ages change, the difference changes (e.g., adding 5 to the difference or mistakenly recalculating a new ratio). For Hindi-medium students, the phrase "thrice his age" (तीन गुना) is well understood, but "age difference" (आयु का अंतर) after a time lapse is a classic conceptual hurdle.
*   **Format Demand:** **Exact answer required.** Since it is a 1-point rubric, no partial credit is awarded for finding the father's current age (36) if the final difference (24) is not reached. 
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The numbers 12, 3, and 5 are small and result in products/sums that do not require complex regrouping or long division.

**Holistic Estimation:**
While the arithmetic is simple, the conceptual "trick" regarding age differences remaining constant—combined with the English language barrier for word problems—leads many students in this demographic to overcomplicate the logic or provide the father's future age (41) instead of the difference.
