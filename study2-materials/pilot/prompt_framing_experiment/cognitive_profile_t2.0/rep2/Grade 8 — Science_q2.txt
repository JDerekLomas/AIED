Concept familiarity: familiar (The transformation of milk to curd is a daily household occurrence in Indian homes, and this specific example is a cornerstone of the Grade 8 "Microorganisms" chapter.)

Computational complexity: 1 (None; purely a recall-based identification task.)

Common error traps: minor (Students often confuse "bacteria" with "fungi" or "virus," and phonetic spelling errors in "Lactobacillus" are common among Hindi-medium learners, though the concept is usually grasped.)

Format demand: Open-ended (Requires active recall and retrieval of a complex scientific term; however, the rubric implies a simple two-part identification without the need for descriptive prose.)

Number friendliness: easy (No numerical data processing required.)
