- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Weather and seasons are foundational topics in the SCERT/NCERT curriculum and relevant to daily life.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (The cognitive task is identifying and naming a single concept.)
- Common error traps: Minor (Students may face spelling hurdles—e.g., 'monsoon' or 'autumn'—or might write the entire paragraph in Hindi/Hinglish due to language barriers, failing the "English" subject requirement despite knowing the concept.)
- Format demand: Open-ended (The prompt asks for a paragraph, but the specific rubric only awards the mark for *naming* the season. This discrepancy can confuse students who might struggle with the paragraph construction and fail to attempt the prompt at all, even if they know the vocabulary word.)
- Number friendliness: Easy (Not applicable to this task.)

Holistic estimate: Given that the rubric only requires naming the season (a high-frequency vocabulary word) rather than assessing the grammar or quality of the 6-8 lines, the success rate for getting that 1 mark is high, despite the daunting format of the prompt for Hindi-medium learners.
