- **Concept familiarity**: Very familiar. Soil formation factors are a core topic in Grade 8 NCERT geography, usually taught early in the term with significant repetition.
- **Computational complexity**: 1. This is a non-mathematical retrieval task.
- **Common error traps**: Minor. Students might confuse "factors" with "types" of soil (e.g., responding "Alluvial" instead of "Climate"), but the distinction is generally clear in standard instruction.
- **Format demand**: Open-ended/Recall. While recall is harder than recognition (MCQ), the rubric allows for any one of five distinct variables, and single-word answers are sufficient. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, terms like "Time" or "Climate" are high-frequency English words, reducing the vocabulary barrier.
- **Number friendliness**: N/A.

**Holistic Estimate**: This is a fundamental recall question. Despite potential language barriers, the concept of *Mridha* (Soil) is culturally relevant and extensively drilled in state-level curricula. The high degree of redundancy in the rubric (multiple acceptable answers) offsets the open-ended format.
