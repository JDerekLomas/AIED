### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Geometry (area and perimeter) is a core component of the Grade 6 curriculum in India (NCERT/State Boards). Students are introduced to these formulas in Grade 5, though differentiation between the two remains a challenge.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** The student must: 1. Identify and apply the Area formula ($L \times B$), 2. Identify and apply the Perimeter formula ($2(L + B)$), and 3. Perform the arithmetic. Since the rubric only scores the Area correctly, the complexity for the score is technically 1-step, but the presence of the "Perimeter" instruction adds a significant cognitive load and distracter effect.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students in this demographic often experience "Formula Confusion," where they add dimensions to find area or multiply them for perimeter. For English Second Language (ESL) learners, the terms "length" and "breadth" are occasionally confused with "sides," and the units ($cm^2$ vs $cm$) are frequently neglected or used interchangeably.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** The rubric requires a correct calculation for a score of 1. If a student calculates the perimeter correctly but makes an arithmetic error in the area, they receive a 0. Open-ended recall of formulas is more difficult than multiple-choice recognition.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Moderate.** $15 \times 8$ is at the upper end of the standard multiplication tables (up to 10 or 12) typically mastered in these schools. Many students may need to perform long multiplication rather than mental math.

**Estimated Proportion of Correct Answers:**
While the math is foundational, the dual-task requirement (Area AND Perimeter) often leads to students providing only one or confusing the two, particularly under exam stress in resource-constrained environments.
