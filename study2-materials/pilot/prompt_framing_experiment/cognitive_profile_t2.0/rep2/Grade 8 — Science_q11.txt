- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Expansion of solids and conductivity are standard NCERT Grade 8 topics, but application-based reasoning is often less practiced than rote recall).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (The item requires data interpretation from a table/observation rather than mathematical calculation).
- **Common error traps:** Major (The question contains three sub-parts (a, b, and c) but the rubric only awards the mark for part (a). For students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds, the English phrasing "recommend" and the requirement to synthesize multiple concepts—thermal expansion, railway safety, and electrical conductivity—under a single-point rubric creates a high risk of "incomplete response" error).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires specific English terminology and synthesis. While the rubric suggests 1 point for (a), the student is tasked with answering all three, increasing cognitive load).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative interpretation).
