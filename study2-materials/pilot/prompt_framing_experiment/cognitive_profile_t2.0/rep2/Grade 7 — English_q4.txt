Concept familiarity: familiar (The story "Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy is a staple of the Class 7 NCERT curriculum, which is standard in Indian government schools.)

Computational complexity: 1 (This is a qualitative language task; no mathematical steps are involved.)

Common error traps: major (Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the transition from literal comprehension to evaluative/extrapolative reasoning. Many will fail to bridge the gap between "what happened in the story" and "importance in real life" due to linguistic barriers in articulating original reasoning.)

Format demand: Open-ended (The item requires the student to construct a sentence. Since the rubric asks for "Any valid reason," it allows flexibility, but the lack of an MCQ scaffold increases the cognitive load significantly for students with limited English proficiency. Partial credit is not available for a 1-point item.)

Number friendliness: easy (Not applicable.)

Holistic estimate: Students will likely identify the three questions (rote recall), but the requirement to justify their relevance in "real life" in English presents a significant hurdle for this specific demographic. While the theme is familiar, the expressive requirement will lead to high omission or grammatically incoherent rates.
