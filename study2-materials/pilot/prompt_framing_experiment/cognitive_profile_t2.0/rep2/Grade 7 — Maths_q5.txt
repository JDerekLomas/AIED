### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
At the Grade 7 level in the Indian curriculum, students have been introduced to decimal notation and basic currency conversion (paise to rupees) since Grade 4 and 5. However, while the concept of "money" is culturally grounded, the abstraction of converting multiple denominations simultaneously is more commonly found in competitive "Scholarship" exams rather than standard textbook drills.

**Computational Complexity: 4+ steps**
This item is cognitively "heavy" despite its simple appearance. A student must perform:
1. Three sets of independent multiplications ($10 \times 10, 5 \times 20, 16 \times 50$).
2. Conversion of the sum (1000 paise) into Rupees.
3. A final division or partitioning step (finding how many ₹5 coins fit into ₹10).

**Common Error Traps: Major**
For students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds, the "language of currency" often uses "Paise" in oral transactions but "Rupees" in written calculations. 
- **Decimal Placement:** Many students may write 10 paise as ₹0.1 or mistakenly as ₹10, leading to magnitude errors.
- **Goal Neglect:** A common trap is calculating the total value (₹10) and stopping there, forgetting the final question asks for the "number of ₹5 coins."

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
This requires recall and synthesis of a multi-step procedure. Given the rubric maxes at 0.5 (likely part of a larger 1-mark question), there is little room for partial credit, meaning a mistake in any one of the five arithmetic steps results in a zero.

**Number Friendliness: Moderate**
The multiples (10, 5, 16) are relatively friendly, and the resulting products sum to a clean round number (1000), which aids those with strong mental math skills.

**Holistic Estimation:**
While the arithmetic is within reach, the linguistic load (switching between denominations) and the final "division by 5" step will filter out students who struggle with reading comprehension and decimal logic. For this demographic, the jump from "1000 paise" to "2 coins" involves too many potential points of failure.
