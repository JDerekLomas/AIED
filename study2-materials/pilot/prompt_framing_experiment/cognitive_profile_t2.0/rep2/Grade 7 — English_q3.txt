- Concept familiarity: familiar (The story "Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy is a standard text in the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum used across Indian government schools.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step logical reasoning: connecting knowledge of the "three things" to the outcome of "success.")
- Common error traps: minor (Students often confuse the king’s three specific questions with the hermit’s answers. Many students may struggle with the "Why" aspect and simply list the three questions instead of explaining the rationale.)
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall and sentence construction; though the rubric is flexible, the requirement for English-medium output is a significant barrier for Hindi-medium background students. No partial credit (Binary scoring: 0 or 1).
- Number friendliness: easy (Qualitative task, no numerical manipulation required.)
