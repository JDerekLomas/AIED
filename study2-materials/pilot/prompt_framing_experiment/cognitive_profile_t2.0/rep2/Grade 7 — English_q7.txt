**Concept familiarity: Less familiar**
Parts of speech like adverbs are taught in Grade 7, but distinguishing between a preposition and an adverb for words like "around" requires a nuanced understanding of syntactic function (whether the word governs a noun phrase). For Hindi-medium students, the distinction is often blurred as "around" is typically translated as a postposition in Hindi.

**Computational complexity: 1**
This is a single-step classification task involving identifying the word class.

**Common error traps: Major**
The primary trap is the "preposition" label. Most students learn "around," "on," "in," and "under" exclusively as prepositions early in their English language acquisition. Without a following noun phrase (e.g., "around the field"), they lack the structural cues to correctly identify its adverbial function.

**Format demand: Open-ended**
As a recall-based task (identifying the specific term "adverb"), the student must accurately recall the technical term without the aid of multiple-choice options. No partial credit is available for a binary correct/incorrect rubric.

**Number friendliness: N/A**
Not applicable for this language-based item.

**Estimated Holistic Difficulty:**
In the context of Indian government schools and students with limited English proficiency, most will default to the most familiar category for the word "around," which is a preposition. Identifying it as an adverb requires an advanced understanding of sentence structure rarely mastered by this cohort at Grade 7.
