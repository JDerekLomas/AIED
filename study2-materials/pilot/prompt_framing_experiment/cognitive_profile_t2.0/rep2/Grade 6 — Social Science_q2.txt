- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. (History of Rajasthan, particularly figures like Maharana Pratap and Prithviraj Chauhan, is deeply embedded in the local culture, folklore, and state-specific SCERT textbooks for Grade 6.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Simple recall and listing task; no manipulation required.)
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Potential confusion between "Ancient" and "Medieval" periods; however, most famous Rajasthan kings belong to the medieval era, reducing the impact of this trap.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall and retrieval of specific proper nouns; however, spelling errors in English are likely given the students' Hindi-medium background, which may affect scoring depending on teacher strictness.)
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (The request is for only two names.)

**Estimated Difficulty Analysis:** 
In the context of Rajasthan government schools, these figures are "local heroes" often discussed outside the classroom. While the language barrier (English proficiency) may lead to transliteration struggles, the core cognitive demand of identifying these names is low for this specific geographic and cultural cohort.
