- **Concept familiarity:** **Less familiar**. In the Indian government school curriculum for Grade 7 (NCERT-based), students are typically taught to identify themes or answer direct comprehension questions. Analyzing a "writing style" requires a high level of meta-linguistic awareness and abstract literary terminology that is often not the focus of rote learning or basic fluency.

- **Computational complexity:** **0**. (Not applicable).

- **Common error traps:** **Major**. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the distinction between "what the poem is about" (content) and "how it is written" (style). Most students are likely to provide a summary of the plot or name a character/theme instead of identifying a stylistic descriptor. Furthermore, they may lack the specific English vocabulary (adjectives) needed to fulfill the rubric.

- **Format demand:** **Open-ended**. This requires pure recall and vocabulary generation. There is no scaffolding (no options provided), and while the rubric is broad, the cognitive load of selecting a "suitable and relevant" abstract adjective in a second language is high. No partial credit is possible.

- **Number friendliness:** **N/A**.

**Holistic Estimate:** The transition from functional literacy to literary analysis is a significant hurdle for ESL learners in EWS contexts. Identifying "style" is often considered an "Above Average" competency in State Achievement Surveys (SAS) for this demographic.
