- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Subject-Verb-Object is the primary syntax taught in early ELT; present continuous is a foundational tense).
- **Computational complexity:** 0 (This is a linguistic, not mathematical, task).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Common errors include placing the article "a" incorrectly or mixing the auxiliary "is" with the subject "he," especially for students transitioning from Hindi where the verb typically comes at the end).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended recall; No partial credit allowed per the rubric. Requires exact syntax.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A

**Holistic Estimation:**
In the context of Indian government schools, Grade 6 students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with English syntax. While the vocabulary ("book", "reading", "he") is highly accessible, the task requires transforming a "Thought" into a structured "Target Language" sentence. Students frequently rely on transliteration (Subject-Object-Verb), which may lead to errors. However, since this specific sentence is a "classic" textbook example practiced repeatedly, a significant majority should get it right.
