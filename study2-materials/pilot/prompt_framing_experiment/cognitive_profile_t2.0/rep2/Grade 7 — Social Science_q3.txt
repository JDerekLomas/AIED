- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Equality is a core pillar of the Grade 7 Civics curriculum, often starting with 'On Equality').
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical task).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse "equality" with "identical treatment" or struggle to bridge abstract legal concepts with tangible daily actions).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall and linguistic construction. While the rubric is generous—allowing *either* a definition or an example for full marks—the requirement to express this in English poses a significant hurdle for ESL learners).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Not applicable).

**Holistic Estimation:**
The generous rubric (OR logic) significantly lowers the difficulty floor, as students who cannot articulate a formal definition can still earn full marks by describing a familiar scenario like "standing in a queue for voting" or "drinking from the same water tank." However, for students from economically weaker sections in Hindi-medium backgrounds, translating these thoughts into coherent English for a subjective "Explain" prompt remains a high-stakes barrier, even with a lenient marking scheme.
