- Concept familiarity: familiar (The Thar Desert/Aravalli Range is a core component of the Grade 6 geography curriculum and regional identity in India.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Identifying a single categorical fact.)
- Common error traps: minor (Students may confuse "landform" with "state" or "climate," or struggle with the specific English terminology despite knowing the physical concept.)
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; however, the rubric allows for multiple correct identifications. The "brief description" adds a layer of literacy demand that may challenge students with limited English proficiency.
- Number friendliness: N/A

Holistic Estimate: While the conceptual knowledge is high due to the regional context, the open-ended nature and the requirement to describe the landform in English present a significant linguistic barrier for students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds.
