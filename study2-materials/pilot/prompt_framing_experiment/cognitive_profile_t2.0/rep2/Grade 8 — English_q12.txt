- **Concept familiarity**: Very familiar (The "Fox and the Goat" or "Fox in the Well" is a staple of Panchatantra/Aesop’s fables, extensively taught in primary years in India).
- **Computational complexity**: 0 (Not applicable).
- **Common error traps**: Major (While the story is known, translating thoughts from Hindi to English leads to severe L1 interference, incorrect verb tense—mixing present and past—and subject-verb agreement errors).
- **Format demand**: High (Open-ended/Constructed Response. Requires active recall of vocabulary and sentence construction rather than simple recognition. Since Max Score is 1, it is a binary 'Correct/Incorrect' evaluation, which is harder for students with low proficiency than a 1–5 rubric).
- **Number friendliness**: Not applicable.

**Holistic Estimation**:
The average Grade 8 student in a low-resource Hindi-medium government school often functions at a Grade 3 or 4 level in English literacy (ASER reports). While they will recognize the images, constructing a grammatically coherent paragraph in English that meets a 1-point accuracy threshold is a significant barrier. Most will provide broken sentences or "Hinglish" transliterations.
