- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. This is a foundational topic usually taught in the first chapter of the Grade 6 History syllabus (*What, Where, How and When*).
- **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a purely qualitative task requiring classification and recall rather than calculation.
- **Common error traps:** Major. For Hindi-medium students, the linguistic density of the terms "archaeological" and "literary" is a significant hurdle. Students often swap the definitions or confuse "inscriptions" (archaeological) with "manuscripts" (literary) because both involve writing.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (recall). This requires productive vocabulary rather than mere recognition. Since the rubric demands both a definition AND an example for both categories for a single mark, any minor omission leads to zero credit. 
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. No numerical operations are involved.
