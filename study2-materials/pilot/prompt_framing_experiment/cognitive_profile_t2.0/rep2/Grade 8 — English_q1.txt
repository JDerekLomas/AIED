- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Sunset descriptions are common in standard Grade 8 textbooks, but the specific imagery required—shades of orange and pink—requires descriptive vocabulary.)
- **Computational complexity:** Not applicable (1)
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students might give a one-word answer like "good" or "beautiful" instead of describing the colors as per the rubric. Language interference: using Hindi words for colors or simple "yellow/red" instead of "shades/pink".)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). Must capture both colors for the full mark. No partial credit according to the rubric, which increases difficulty for students with limited expressive English.
- **Number friendliness:** Not applicable (Easy)
