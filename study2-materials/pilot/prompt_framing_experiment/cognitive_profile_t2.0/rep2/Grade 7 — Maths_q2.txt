### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
Linear equations in one variable are a core part of the Class 7 NCERT curriculum (Chapter 4). By mid-year, students are generally acquainted with the concept of "solving for x," though the abstraction of transposing numbers remains a significant cognitive leap for students with weaker foundational literacy.

**Computational Complexity: 2-3 steps**
The item requires two distinct inverse operations:
1. Subtraction ($10 - 2$)
2. Division ($8 \div 4$)

**Common Error Traps: Major**
For this specific demographic, two major "procedural bugs" are prevalent:
*   **Sign/Operation Confusion:** Adding 2 to 10 instead of subtracting, or subtracting 4 instead of dividing.
*   **Concatenation Misconception:** Treating $4x + 2$ as $6x$ (failing to distinguish between like and unlike terms), a very common error among students struggling with mathematical syntax.

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
As a "solve" prompt without options, this requires **recall and production** rather than recognition. Given the binary rubric (Max score: 1), no credit is given for the first step (finding $4x = 8$), which would typically capture more students in a partial-credit scenario.

**Number Friendliness: Easy**
The integers are low, the subtraction involves no borrowing, and the division yields a whole number result ($x = 2$). The lack of fractions or negative numbers significantly lowers the computational "floor."

### Holistic Estimate
While the arithmetic is simple, the transition from Hindi-medium arithmetic to English-coded algebraic logic creates a barrier. Many students in this demographic struggle with the syntax of formal equality.
