- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. Place value is a foundational topic introduced in earlier primary grades and revisited in Grade 6.
- **Computational complexity:** 1 step (identification/retrieval). No multi-step arithmetic is required.
- **Common error traps:** Major. For this demographic, "Face Value" (5) vs "Place Value" (500) is a frequent confusion. Additionally, linguistic interference occurs if students mix up the positions (tens vs. hundreds).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. Requires recall without the aid of options. While the rubric allows for both numeric and word forms, the lack of partial credit means a minor labeling error results in zero points.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. 7560 is a standard four-digit integer with no zeros in the target position.
