**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Indicators are a core topic in Grade 7 NCERT Science, typically reinforced through demonstrations or diagrams).

**Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; requires logical sequencing of observations).

**Common error traps:** Major (Confusion between the specific color changes—specifically forgetting that turmeric remains yellow in acid and only changes in base. Students may also conflate the reaction of hibiscus extract with turmeric, leading to a "crossed" explanation).

**Format demand:** Open-ended recall. Since the maximum score is 1, the demand is high as the student must provide a specific causal link (Material + Action = Color Observation) without the prompt of a multiple-choice structure.

**Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A – Qualitative).

**Contextual Analysis (Socio-economic/Language):** 
Students from Hindi-medium or economically weaker backgrounds often excel in observational "kitchen chemistry," but struggle with articulating the logic in English. While "Haldi" (Turmeric) and "Gudhal" (Hibiscus) are culturally familiar, translating the specific chemical response into a written sentence under exam pressure presents a linguistic barrier that often leads to incomplete or jumbled responses.
