- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The distinction between 'some' and 'any' is typically introduced in primary school (Grades 4-5) under the topic of determiners or quantifiers. However, usage in context often remains shaky for first-generation learners.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a binary choice task requiring a single linguistic decision.
- **Common error traps:** Major. For Hindi-medium students, the distinction between 'some' and 'any' is difficult because Hindi often uses the same word (कुछ - *kuch*) for both affirmative and negative/interrogative contexts. Without a clear negative marker (not/n't) or a question mark, students often guess or over-apply the use of 'any' if they have recently encountered it in exercises focusing on questions.
- **Format demand:** Exact answer required (Multiple choice/Cloze). While it involves recognition rather than recall, no partial credit is possible.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. Not applicable as a numerical concept, but the vocabulary ("apples", "basket") is high-frequency and accessible.
