- **Concept familiarity**: Less familiar (While voice change is introduced in Grade 7/8 in the NCERT/SCERT curricula, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the transition from Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) to the auxiliary "be + past participle" structure in English.)
- **Computational complexity**: 4+ (In a linguistic context, the "steps" include: 1. Identify object, 2. Determine tense/aspect, 3. Select correct form of 'be', 4. Convert verb to past participle, 5. Realign subject with 'by'. Item B adds the complexity of the present perfect 'has been found'.)
- **Common error traps**: Major (Students frequently confuse tense changes between active/passive and direct/indirect speech; 'prepared' often becomes 'is prepared' or 'has prepared'. The present perfect in Item B is a high-frequency fail point.)
- **Format demand**: Open-ended/Recall (Requires production of full sentences. With a max score of 1 for both parts, the binary grading—all or nothing—is punishing for students with limited vocabulary or spelling accuracy.)
- **Number friendliness**: N/A (Linguistic equivalence: The vocabulary—'Successor' and 'Delicious'—is high-level for EWS students with limited proficiency.)
