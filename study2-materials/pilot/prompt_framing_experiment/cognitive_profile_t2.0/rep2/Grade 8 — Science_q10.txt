Concept familiarity: familiar (Pasteurization is a standard topic in the Class 8 NCERT curriculum, specifically under 'Microorganisms: Friend and Foe'.)
Computational complexity: 1 (The task involves describing a qualitative process rather than mathematical calculation.)
Common error traps: minor (Students often confuse boiling with pasteurization or fail to mention the crucial 'sudden cooling' step; linguistic barriers may lead to fragmented descriptions in English.)
Format demand: Open-ended recall; despite the 1-point cap, it requires a two-part synthesis (the 'how' and the 'why'). 
Number friendliness: easy (Though not required, the standard 70°C and 15–30 seconds are the only metrics involved.)
