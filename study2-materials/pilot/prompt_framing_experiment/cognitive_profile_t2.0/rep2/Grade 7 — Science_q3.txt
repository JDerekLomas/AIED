**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. Photosynthesis and chlorophyll are central pillars of the Grade 6 and 7 science curricula in Indian schools (NCERT-based).
*   **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a pure factual retrieval task with no calculation required.
*   **Common error traps:** Minor. The primary trap is spelling. In a bilingual/Hindi-medium context, students often recognize the term but may phoneticize it incorrectly (e.g., "Clorofill"). However, the conceptual identification is generally robust.
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This is more difficult than multiple-choice as it requires active retrieval and production of a specific, multi-syllabic scientific term without cues. No partial credit is available for a 1-point item.
*   **Number friendliness:** Not applicable (N/A).

**Analysis for Target Demographic:**
In Indian government schools, "Chlorophyll" is treated as a high-frequency vocabulary word. Even for students with limited English proficiency, scientific terms are often taught as loanwords. While the open-ended nature slightly lowers the success rate compared to a multiple-choice format, the repetitive emphasis on this specific fact in both Hindi and English instruction ensures high recognition.
