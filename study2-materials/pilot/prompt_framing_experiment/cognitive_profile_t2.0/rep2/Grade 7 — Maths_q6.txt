**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar**. While the operation is standard for Grade 7, the integration of conversion and multiplication is a transition point from foundational to intermediate arithmetic.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **4+**. The item requires four distinct procedural clusters: 
    1. Converting $1 \frac{1}{2}$ to $\frac{3}{2}$.
    2. Converting $3 \frac{1}{4}$ to $\frac{13}{4}$.
    3. Multiplying numerators and denominators ($\frac{39}{8}$).
    4. Re-converting the improper fraction back into a mixed fraction ($4 \frac{7}{8}$).
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major**. For students in this demographic, the "add the wholes, multiply the parts" error (e.g., $1 \times 3$ and $1/2 \times 1/4 = 3 \frac{1}{8}$) is a frequent conceptual bug. Additionally, errors in basic multiplication (3 x 13) or long division during the final conversion are common.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended**. Since the rubric specifies a single score of 1 and requires a specific final form (mixed fraction), there is no safety net for a student who performs the multiplication correctly but fails to re-convert the answer.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Moderate**. While the numbers are small, 13 is prime and the denominator 8 is not a power of 10, preventing easy mental checks or conversion to decimals.

**Holistic Estimation:**
The linguistic barrier is low here as it is a pure numerical problem, which benefits Hindi-medium students. However, the multi-step nature of the procedure significantly increases the "leaky pipeline" effect; a mistake in any one of the four steps results in a zero. In economically weaker section (EWS) contexts where mastery of long-form division and fractions is often uneven by Grade 7, the procedural rigors of this item will challenge a majority of students.
