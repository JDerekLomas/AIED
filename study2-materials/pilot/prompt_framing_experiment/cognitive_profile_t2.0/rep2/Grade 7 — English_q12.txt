**Concept familiarity: Less familiar**
In the Indian state school context, Grade 7 English learners are often still mastering basic Tense structures. While Active/Passive voice is introduced in the curriculum, it is frequently taught through rote rules rather than functional usage. Hindi-medium students often struggle with the auxiliary "to be" + Past Participle structure, as it does not align directly with Hindi grammatical structures for transitive verbs.

**Computational complexity: 2-3 steps**
Syntactically, the student must perform three distinct transformations:
1. Object-Subject swap (Identifying "The leaves" as the new subject).
2. Tense identification and Auxiliary selection ("blew" is past tense $\rightarrow$ requires "were" because "leaves" is plural).
3. Verb transformation (Changing "blew" to the irregular past participle "blown").

**Common error traps: Major**
There are two significant hurdles here: 
1. The irregular verb: Many students will produce "blewed" or keep "blew." 
2. Number agreement: Students often default to the singular "was" even if the subject is "leaves." 
3. Lexical confusion: The phrasal element "away" often gets misplaced or dropped.

**Format demand: Open-ended**
This requires full recall and exact production of the verb phrase. There is no recognition scaffold (like a multiple-choice list), increasing the difficulty for English Language Learners (ELL).

**Number friendliness: N/A**
(Not applicable to this English item).

**Proportion of students likely to produce the fully correct answer:**
Given the reliance on irregular verb forms ("blown") and plural subject-verb agreement, which are high-error areas for Hindi-medium students, the success rate is likely low.
