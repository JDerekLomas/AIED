- **Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. While "biodiversity" and "sustainable development" are in the NCERT curriculum, they are abstract terms that are often difficult for students from limited English backgrounds to internalize beyond rote definitions. Linking the two concepts requires high-level synthesis.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a purely qualitative task.
- **Common error traps:** Major. Students often confuse "biodiversity" with general "nature" or "environment." They may provide vague answers about "saving trees" without addressing the systemic link to "sustainable development" or "ecosystem services."
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This is high-demand for this cohort. Expressing complex ecological relationships in English is a significant barrier for Hindi-medium students, leading to grammatical struggle or incomplete articulation of the "services" mentioned in the rubric.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. Not applicable.

Holistic Estimation: In Indian government school settings, while students may recognize the terms, the requirement to explain the functional relationship between biodiversity and sustainability results in a high attrition rate for the full mark. Most will provide superficial or tautological answers.
