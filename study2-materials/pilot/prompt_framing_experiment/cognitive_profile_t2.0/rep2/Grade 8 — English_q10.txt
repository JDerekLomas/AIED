**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The 'too...to' structure is a staple of the Class 8 English grammar syllabus in Indian state boards, typically introduced under "Synthesis of Sentences.")

**Computational complexity:** 2-3 (Syntactic transformation requires: 1. Identifying the adjective, 2. Substituting 'very' with 'too', and 3. Infinitival transformation of the second clause while removing the redundant subject and auxiliary.)

**Common error traps:** Major (Students frequently retain the negative 'not', resulting in "He is too weak to not walk," or fail to remove the subject, resulting in "He is too weak he to walk.")

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires total recall of the structure; the rubric is binary, meaning no partial credit is awarded for minor spelling or structural errors.)

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Verbal task.)

**Linguistic/Socio-economic context:** For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the transition from two simple sentences to a complex structure involving an infinitive is a high cognitive load. The conceptual leap from a negative result ("cannot") to a positive structure that implies negativity ("too...to") often causes confusion.
