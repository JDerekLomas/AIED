### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
This question is based on the popular story "The Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy, which is a standard text in the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum. While the theme is common, students from economically weaker sections may struggle with the leap from understanding the plot in their native language to articulating it in English.

**Computational Complexity: N/A**
Not applicable for this English language item.

**Common Error Traps: Minor**
The primary trap is a "Language-Knowledge Gap." Students often understand the *reason* (the King wanted answers) but struggle with the "Why did... [verb]" structure. They may answer using the wrong tense (e.g., "The king announce a reward") or provide a circular response (e.g., "Because he want a reward"). 

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
This requires high cognitive recall and sentence construction. Unlike a Multiple Choice Question (MCQ), the student must generate the vocabulary (*questions*, *answers*, *wise men*, *reward*). Since the rubric is somewhat flexible ("or any similar reason"), it allows for some leniency, but the barrier remains the transition from Hindi thought to English text.

**Number Friendliness: N/A**
Not applicable.

**Linguistic Nuance:**
For Hindi-medium students, the word "Reward" is often familiar, but "Announce" might be a Tier-2 vocabulary word they struggle to decode. The transition from the auxiliary "did" in the question to the past tense verb "announced" in the answer is a significant hurdle for ESL (English as a Second Language) learners at this level.

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given the shift from objective comprehension to subjective production in a second language, many students will provide partial or grammatically broken fragments. However, because it is a core textbook story, the general success rate for a 1-mark "Recall" question is moderate.
