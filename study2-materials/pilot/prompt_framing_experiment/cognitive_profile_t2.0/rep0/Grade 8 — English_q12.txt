- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The "Fox and the Goat" or "Fox in the Well" is a staple fable in Indian school curricula, often taught in lower grades).
- **Computational complexity:** Not applicable (1 step: Narrative construction).
- **Common error traps:** Major (The jump from recognizing the story in Hindi/MT to producing it in English is high; common errors include Tense-shifting (mixing past/present), subject-verb agreement, and literal translation from mother tongue).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (High demand; requires recall and synthesis of vocabulary. Since max score is 1, no partial credit is allowed for broken English that lacks descriptive clarity).
- **Number friendliness:** Not applicable.

**Holistic Estimation:** While the story is culturally ingrained, the linguistic barrier for students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds remains high. Most students will identify the visual cues but struggle to construct grammatically coherent English sentences to satisfy a "all or nothing" 1-point rubric.
