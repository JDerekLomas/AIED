- Concept familiarity: very familiar (Local festivals like Gangaur are central to the Rajasthan SCERT curriculum and daily life for students in this region).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single step: identification from a visual cue).
- Common error traps: minor (Students might confuse Gangaur with Teej due to similar iconography, or use local dialects for names).
- Format demand: Open-ended (Requires active recall and basic descriptive English/Hindi writing; however, the rubric focuses strictly on the identification of the name).
- Number friendliness: N/A

Holistic Estimate: While the subject matter is highly familiar, the low weightage (0.5 marks) suggests a high-stakes/short-answer context. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the challenge lies in the descriptive part of the question rather than identification, though the rubric focuses on the name.
