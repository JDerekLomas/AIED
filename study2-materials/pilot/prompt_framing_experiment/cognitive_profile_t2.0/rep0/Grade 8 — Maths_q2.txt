### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
Algebraic expressions and identities are a core component of the Grade 8 NCERT syllabus. While students have been introduced to variables, binomial expansion represents a shift from basic substitution to structural manipulation, which is a significant jump in abstraction for students with lower baseline proficiency.

**Computational Complexity: 4+ Steps**
The item requires four distinct multiplication operations followed by term categorization and subtraction.
1. Distributing $(3a)$ over $(2a + 3b)$.
2. Distributing $(-2b)$ over $(2a + 3b)$.
3. Executing four integer/coefficient multiplications.
4. Identifying and combining "like terms" ($+9ab$ and $-4ab$).

**Common Error Traps: Major**
There are three high-probability "procedural bugs":
- **Sign Error:** Handling the negative sign when multiplying $(-2b \times 3b)$.
- **Like Term Confusion:** Students often fail to simplify the middle terms or mistakenly try to combine terms with different powers (e.g., adding $a^2$ to $ab$).
- **The "Hindi-English" Switch:** Language-impoverished environments often struggle with algebraic syntax, viewing the letters as labels rather than variables.

**Format Demand: High (Open-ended)**
The item is binary (Score 0 or 1) with no partial credit for a correct method if the final expression is incorrect. This significantly lowers the success rate compared to a Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) where the structure of the answer is visible.

**Number Friendliness: Easy**
The coefficients (2 and 3) are low integers, minimizing the cognitive load on arithmetic and allowing the student to focus entirely on algebraic rules.

**Estimated Success Rate:**
Given the transition from Hindi to English algebraic notation and the lack of partial credit, many students will fail at the final simplification step despite understanding the initial distributive property.
