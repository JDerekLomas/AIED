**Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. While the concept of "governance" is introduced in Class 7 Civics, the specific abstract concept of "transparency" (as opposed to tangible concepts like "voting" or "laws") is often difficult for students from Hindi-medium or low-resource backgrounds to conceptualize in English.

**Computational complexity:** 1. No arithmetic involved.

**Common error traps:** Major. Students often confuse "transparency" with general "honesty" or "efficiency." Due to the language barrier, students might describe a general good deed by the government rather than a specific mechanism for information disclosure (like the RTI Act or public audits).

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This is high difficulty for this demographic. Constructing a coherent sentence in English to suggest a mechanism (e.g., "posting budgets on notice boards") requires higher-order thinking and language production skills compared to recognition (Multiple Choice). No partial credit is available.

**Number friendliness:** Easy/Not Applicable.
