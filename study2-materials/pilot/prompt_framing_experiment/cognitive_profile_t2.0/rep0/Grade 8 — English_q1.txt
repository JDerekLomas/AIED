- Computational complexity: 1 (Single cognitive task: identifying and retrieving descriptive adjectives from memory or a text.)
- Common error traps: minor (The primary trap is the "bilingual interference" where students may know the colors in Hindi/regional languages but struggle to retrieve or spell "orange" or "pink" correctly in English.)
- Format demand: Open-ended (Requires recall and sentence construction; the rubric is specific about needing both colors for the full mark, which increases the demand for precision over general gist.)
- Number friendliness: N/A
