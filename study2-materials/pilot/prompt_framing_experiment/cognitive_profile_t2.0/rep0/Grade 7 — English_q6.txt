- **Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. (At Grade 7 in Indian government schools, the curriculum focuses heavily on reading comprehension/surface-level plot rather than literary analysis or abstract categorization of a poet’s "style.")
- **Computational complexity:** N/A (Language task).
- **Common error traps:** Major. (Students often confuse "style" with "tone" or simply summarize what the poem is about. Vocabulary constraints also mean they may know the poem is simple but lack the English descriptor "direct" or "informal.")
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (recall). This is a high-demand task for EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds as it requires retrieving specific English adjectives rather than selecting from a list. No partial credit is available.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Language task).
