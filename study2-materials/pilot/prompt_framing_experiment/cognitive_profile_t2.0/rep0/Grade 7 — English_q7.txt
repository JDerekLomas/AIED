**Concept familiarity: Less familiar**
In the Indian government school context (Grade 7), grammar is often taught through rote rules. While "parts of speech" are familiar, "around" is a high-frequency preposition. Distinguishing it as an adverb (describing the manner/direction of movement without an object) requires a nuance of functional grammar that many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds struggle with, as they often rely on one-to-one word translations.

**Computational complexity: N/A**
This is a linguistic/categorical task, not a mathematical one.

**Common error traps: Major**
The word "around" is most commonly introduced and memorized as a **preposition** (e.g., "around the tree"). Without an object in this sentence, its function changes to an adverb. Most students will choose "preposition" because they identify the word by its most common label rather than its contextual function.

**Format demand: Open-ended**
The question requires recall/identification. If it is not multiple-choice, students must produce the technical term "adverb" with correct spelling. Partial credit is usually not applicable in a binary (1/0) grammar item.

**Number friendliness: N/A**
Not applicable.

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given the strong tendency for students in this demographic to classify "around" exclusively as a preposition and the linguistic complexity of differentiating adverbs from prepositions without an object, the success rate is expected to be low.
