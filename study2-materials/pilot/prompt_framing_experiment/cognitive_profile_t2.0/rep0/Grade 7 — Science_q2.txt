Concept familiarity: familiar (Heat is a core chapter in Grade 7 NCERT Science)
Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative recall, no calculation)
Common error traps: minor (Possible confusion between conduction and convection; also linguistic confusion between "heat" and "temperature")
Format demand: Open-ended (Requires specific terminology 'Conduction' and a mechanism explanation involving particle vibration/collision; no partial credit for (a) as per rubric)
Number friendliness: N/A (Non-numerical item)

The item tests a fundamental concept, but for this specific demographic, the shift from naming a term (Conduction/चालन) to "briefly explaining" in English presents a significant hurdle. While most students will likely correctly identify the process in (a), describing the molecular mechanism (b) requires a level of English expressive ability that many Hindi-medium learners in EWS settings struggle with.
