**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The concept of balanced diets and food groups is central to the Grade 6 Science curriculum in India, though application-based analysis may be less practiced than rote recall).

**Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical task; requires qualitative logic/identification).

**Common error traps:** Minor (Students might over-complicate the second part of the prompt—"Prepare diet chart"—and fail to focus on the primary scored requirement of identifying the missing component. Some may also name specific nutrients like "calcium" or "vitamins" instead of the food group).

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires recall and sentence construction. For Hindi-medium students, the grammatical error in the prompt ["he has ate"] is less problematic than the general linguistic demand of translating their internal thought into an English response).

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Non-numerical).

**Analysis:** While the core concept is familiar, the item is poorly constructed. It contains two distinct tasks: an identification task and a creative task (preparing a diet chart), yet the rubric only awards points for the first. This "double-barreled" nature often confuses students from lower socio-economic backgrounds who may over-index on the secondary, non-scored task. Language barriers also significantly impede the ability to extract the "fruits/vegetables vs. milk" logic from the text.
