**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (This is a core pillar of the Grade 8 History syllabus, "From Trade to Territory," extensively covered in NCERT textbooks).

**Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical task).

**Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse specific battle dates or names, but the rubric only requires identifying the transition from trading posts to political control, which is the foundational narrative of the unit).

**Format demand:** Open-ended recall; however, the rubric is extremely lenient. While the prompt asks to "describe the process," the rubric only requires a single mention of their arrival as traders or the establishment of factories to earn the full point. This disconnect between the prompt's "high" demand and the rubric's "low" requirement significantly lowers the difficulty.

**Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Language/Context analysis:** For Hindi-medium students, the term "East India Company" and "Traders/Vyapari" are highly recognizable cognates. Even with limited English proficiency, the rote memorization of the Company’s origin is a high-frequency learning objective in Indian government schools.
