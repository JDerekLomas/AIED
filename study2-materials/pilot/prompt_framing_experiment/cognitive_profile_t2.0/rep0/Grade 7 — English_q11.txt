- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Students in Grade 7 are taught Parts of Speech, though the distinction between an adjective and an adjective phrase is often blurred in local curricula).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Single identification step).
- **Common error traps:** Major (The rubric defines "tiny"—a single word—as the "adjective phrase." Technically, an adjective phrase can be a single headword, but students are often taught that a "phrase" must be a group of words. Many may look for "in our balcony" as a phrase and misidentify it).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended/Exact (Recall required; no partial credit for identifying other words).
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Verbal task).
