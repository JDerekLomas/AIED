- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The area of a triangle is a core component of the Grade 7 Mensuration syllabus in India (NCERT/State Boards), typically introduced after squares and rectangles.
- **Computational complexity:** 2-3 steps. (1. Identify/Recall formula, 2. Substitute values, 3. Multiply/Divide).
- **Common error traps:** Minor. The most common "procedural bug" is forgetting the `1/2` and calculating it as a rectangle (`8 x 6 = 48`). For Hindi-medium students, terms like "base" (आधार) and "height" (ऊंचाई) are usually well-integrated into bilingual classroom instruction.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (1 mark). Per the rubric, it requires formula application. While partial credit isn't applicable in a binary 1-point rubric, the calculation is straightforward enough that students who recall the formula rarely fail the arithmetic.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. `8` and `6` are small, even whole numbers that allow for easy mental halving (e.g., `4 x 6` or `48 / 2`).

**Holistic Estimate:** This is a "low-difficulty" or "recall/application" item. In government school settings, while English proficiency is a barrier for word problems, direct computational items with clearly defined dimensions (base/height) act as "score-boosters." The primary detractor will be students who confuse the formula with that of a rectangle or fail to divide by 2.
