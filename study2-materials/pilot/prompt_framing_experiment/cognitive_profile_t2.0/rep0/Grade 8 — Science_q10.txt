Concept familiarity: **Familiar** (Pasteurization is a standard part of the Grade 8 Science syllabus, specifically within the "Microorganisms" chapter. It is frequently discussed in relation to food preservation.)

Computational complexity: **1** (No active calculation is required, though memorizing two quantitative values is beneficial.)

Common error traps: **Minor** (Students often confuse pasteurization with simple "boiling." They may fail to mention the "sudden cooling" aspect, which is critical for the scientific definition.)

Format demand: **High** (This is an open-ended "describe and explain" task requiring the construction of multiple sentences in English. Since the maximum score is 1 with no partial credit mentioned, students who understand the concept but lack the linguistic precision to explain both "process" and "utility" in English may lose the mark.)

Number friendliness: **Moderate** (While the numbers are easy, the dual-parameter nature—70°C for 15-30 seconds—adds a layer of memory load.)

**Holistic Estimate:** While the concept is familiar and commonly seen on milk packets, the demand to produce an English-language description (Process + Utility) under a binary (1/0) scoring rubric presents a significant hurdle for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds and economically weaker sections. Many will grasp the concept but fail to articulate both components of the rubric accurately in their second language.
