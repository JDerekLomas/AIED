**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Familiar.** This is a fundamental introductory topic in the Class 6 NCERT History syllabus ("What, Where, How and When"). While the concepts are standard, the distinction between "archaeological" and "literary" can be abstract for students just transitioning from general Environment Studies (EVS) to specialized History.
*   **Computational Complexity: 1.** This is a qualitative task involving categorical differentiation; no mathematical operations are required.
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.** For Hindi-medium students, the terminology is a significant barrier. The words "Archaeological" and "Literary" are multisyllabic, academic English terms. Students often conflate "Inscriptions" (Archaeological) with "Manuscripts" (Literary). Additionally, the rubric requires two distinct components (definition + example) for a single mark; students often provide the definition but forget the example, or vice-versa.
*   **Format Demand: Open-ended.** This requires high-level retrieval (recall) rather than recognition (MCQ). The absence of partial credit (Maximum score: 1) makes the item "all-or-nothing," which significantly increases the difficulty for students with limited expressive English.
*   **Number Friendliness: Easy.** No numerical data is present in the stimulus.

**Holistic Analysis**
The primary hurdle for this specific demographic (EWS, Hindi-background) is **Vocabulary and Encoding.** While a student may understand that "old pots" and "old books" are different, the linguistic demand to define "Archaeological" and "Literary" in English is high. Without partial credit to reward "half-knowledge," the success rate will be suppressed.
