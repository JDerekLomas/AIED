- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The topic is a standard part of the Civics/Social and Political Life curriculum, often discussed in classrooms).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Simple recall and one-step explanation).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may conflate "rights" with "duties" or general moral advice, or provide very vague descriptions like "study" without articulating it as a right to education).
- **Format demand:** High (Open-ended recall in English. Even if students understand the concept in Hindi, articulating an "explanation of importance" in English is a significant barrier for this demographic. The 1-mark maximum score is punishing, as it implies an "all-or-nothing" result despite requiring multiple components: identification 1, identification 2, and explanation).
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Non-mathematical).

**Analysis:** While the concepts of Child Rights (Right to Education, Right against Child Labor) are emphasized in Indian textbooks, the language barrier and the high structural demand of the question (requiring three distinct pieces of information for a single mark) will significantly lower the success rate among English-Second-Language learners from economically weaker sections.
