- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The Panchayati Raj system is a core pillar of the Grade 6-8 Civics curriculum in India and is socially relevant in rural contexts.
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No mathematical operations required).
- **Common error traps:** Minor. Students may confuse specific tiers (Gram Sabha vs. Zila Parishad) or mistake a specific function (like "building roads") for the overarching "primary role" (self-governance).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. Requires retrieval and synthesis of concepts in English. For students with limited English proficiency, articulating "self-governance" or "grassroots administration" presents a significant linguistic barrier even if the concept is understood. No partial credit allowed.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Not applicable).

**Holistic Estimation:** While the topic is a staple of the Indian social science curriculum, the requirement for an open-ended English response from students in Hindi-medium, economically disadvantaged backgrounds creates a high cognitive load regarding linguistic expression. Many will provide functional but incomplete examples rather than the abstract "primary role."
