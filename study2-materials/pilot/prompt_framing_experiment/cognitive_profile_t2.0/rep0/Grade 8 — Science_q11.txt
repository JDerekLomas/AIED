- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Thermal expansion and electrical conductivity are core Grade 7 and 8 topics, but linking expansion to railway gaps requires application).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Scanning a table for the largest value).
- **Common error traps:** Major (The question contains three parts (a, b, and c) but the rubric only allocates marks for part (a). Students may waste time on b and c, or provide the wrong reasoning for c. Additionally, there is a risk of confusing "highest expansion" with "highest conductivity").
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires extracting specific data from a table and providing written explanations for parts b and c).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Comparing decimal or whole numbers in a list).

**Analysis for target demographic:**
While part (a) is a simple data interpretation task, the linguistic load of three sub-questions combined with a rubric that only validates part (a) is problematic. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the "Why" and "Recommend" prompts in parts (b) and (c), potentially leading to an incomplete or abandoned response, even if they can identify the material in part (a). However, purely identifying the largest value in a table is a low-order cognitive task.
