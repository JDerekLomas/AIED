- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (This is a core topic in NCERT Geography Class 7, Chapter 1).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical conceptual application).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse "human environment" with "human-made environment"—buildings vs. social/cultural interactions).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended; high recall demand. Language proficiency (English) acts as a significant barrier for expressing abstract definitions even if the concept is understood in Hindi.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A

**Holistic Estimate:** While the concept is taught early in the curriculum, the two-part nature of the question (Definition + Application) and the 0.5 maximum score offer little room for error. The primary challenge for Hindi-medium students in an English-medium assessment is the expressive vocabulary required for "human environment" (social interactions) compared to the easier "human-made environment."
