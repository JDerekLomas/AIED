### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Less Familiar**
While "Profit and Loss" is a standard Grade 8 topic, this specific problem type involves the interaction between three distinct price points: Marked Price (MP), Selling Price (SP), and Cost Price (CP). Students from these backgrounds often struggle with the transition from simple profit calculations to those involving discounts, as the concept of "Marked Price" is less intuitive than a direct trade.

**Computational Complexity: 4+ Steps**
The problem requires a multi-stage procedural workflow:
1. Calculate the discount amount ($1200 \times 0.10$).
2. Calculate the SP ($1200 - 120$).
3. Identify the relationship between SP and CP given an 8% profit ($SP = 1.08 \times CP$).
4. Solve for CP through division ($1080 / 1.08$).

**Common Error Traps: Major**
Students often conflate the 10% discount and the 8% profit, sometimes incorrectly subtracting 8% from the SP to find CP, or mistakenly applying the 8% profit margin to the MP ($₹1200$) instead of the CP. Language barriers further exacerbate these conceptual "bugs."

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
This item requires recall and precise execution of the formulaic sequence. Given that the rubric only allows for a binary score (Maximum 1, no partial credit), any minor calculation error in the division phase results in zero marks.

**Number Friendliness: Moderate**
The numbers are relatively clean ($10\%$ of $1200$ and $1080$ divided by $1.08$); however, dividing $1080$ by a decimal ($1.08$) or handling the fraction $108/100$ remains a significant hurdle for students with weak foundational arithmetic skills common in low-resource environments.

### Holistic Estimation
Based on the complexity of the three-tier pricing model and the "all-or-nothing" scoring rubric, many students will fail at either the conceptual setup (mapping MP to CP) or the final division.
