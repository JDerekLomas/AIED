**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** "Age word problems" are a staple of the Grade 8 curriculum in India, typically introduced through the lens of linear equations. However, students in government schools often struggle with translating English phrases into mathematical operations.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.**
    1.  Calculate father’s current age ($12 \times 3 = 36$).
    2.  Apply the temporal change ($12+5$ and $36+5$) OR recognize the constant nature of age differences ($36 - 12$).
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.**
    1.  *The Additive Trap:* Many students will calculate the father's current age (36) and add 5, resulting in `41`.
    2.  *The Growth Trap:* Some students believe that because ages change, the difference changes (expecting the ratio to remain "thrice").
    3.  *Translation Error:* In Hindi-medium contexts, the phrasing "thrice his age" (उसकी आयु का तीन गुना) is clear, but "age difference" (आयु का अंतर) is sometimes confused with just finding the final age.
*   **Format Demand:** **High.** Open-ended questions with a binary rubric (correct/incorrect) provide no "safety net" for students who understand the concept but make a minor arithmetic slip.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The numbers 12, 3, and 5 are low-integer and easy to compute mentally.

**Analysis:**
While the math is simple, this is a "trick" question regarding the invariance of age differences. Most students from this demographic will focus on calculating the father’s age after 5 years (41) and may stop there or provide the father's age instead of the difference. The language barrier (English proficiency) significantly increases the risk of misinterpreting the final prompt "What will be the age difference."
