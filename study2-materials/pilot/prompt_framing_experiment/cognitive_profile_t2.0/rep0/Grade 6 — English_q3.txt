**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** Very familiar. Identifying a character's preference/action from a text is a foundational reading comprehension skill practiced extensively in Grade 6.
*   **Computational Complexity:** N/A (Language task).
*   **Common Error Traps:** Minor. For this demographic, primary traps include "Tense shifting" (e.g., using 'love' instead of 'loved') and "Subject-Verb Agreement." However, the rubric's flexibility ('read books') mitigates these risks.
*   **Format Demand:** Open-ended (Recall). While recall is harder than recognition (multiple choice), the rubric allows for short phrases, which lowers the barrier for students with limited syntax skills. The lack of partial credit (1 or 0) increases difficulty slightly compared to scaled scoring.
*   **Number Friendliness:** N/A (Language task).

**Contextual Analysis (ESL/Hindi-medium context):** 
While the task is simple, students from economically weaker sections in Hindi-medium schools often struggle with decoding English text and mapping specific vocabulary (verbs/objects) to written output. However, since "evening," "love," and "read" are high-frequency sight words, most students at this level can locate the information even if they cannot construct a perfect sentence.
