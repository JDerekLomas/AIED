- Concept familiarity: very familiar (This is a cornerstone topic of the Grade 8 NCERT Civics curriculum and is frequently reinforced in classrooms).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Minimal steps; straightforward identification).
- Common error traps: minor (Students might confuse "Fundamental Rights" with "Fundamental Duties" or struggle to recall the exact term "Secularism" in English, but given the 1-mark requirement, most related conceptual hits would qualify).
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; no partial credit for a 1-mark item, but the rubric is highly inclusive, accepting any one of multiple features.
- Number friendliness: easy (Qualitative item).

Analysis: While the students face language barriers, "Indian Constitution" is a high-frequency topic. The lenient rubric (only needing one feature) significantly lowers the difficulty threshold. Students who might struggle to explain "Federalism" can often successfully recall "Fundamental Rights" or simply the fact that it is a "Written" constitution.
