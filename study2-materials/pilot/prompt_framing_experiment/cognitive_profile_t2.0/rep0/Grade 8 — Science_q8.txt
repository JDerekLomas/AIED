- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. Crop production is a standard introductory chapter in Grade 8 Science. Most students from rural or peri-urban backgrounds have direct or observational exposure to farming.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. There is no mathematical computation required for this item.
- **Common error traps:** Minor. Students often conflate "weeds" with "wild grass" or "poisonous plants" rather than the functional definition of "unwanted competition for nutrients."
- **Format demand:** Open-ended/Recall. This is a high-demand format for this cohort. While the concept is simple, articulating the answer in English (especially the second part regarding "why" they are removed) poses a significant linguistic hurdle. Many students will struggle to express concepts like "competition for nutrients/light/water" in correct English syntax.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. No numerical data involved.

**Holistic Estimate:** While the concept is simple and familiar to the context of Indian rural life, the requirement to produce an open-ended explanation in English creates a significant barrier. Students may know the answer in Hindi (*Khartapatwar*) but fail to meet the specific rubric requirements for a 1-mark English response.
