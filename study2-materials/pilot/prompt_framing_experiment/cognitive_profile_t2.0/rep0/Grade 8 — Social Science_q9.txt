- Concept familiarity: familiar (Civics/Political Science in Grade 8 extensively covers the role of the Union Legislature.)
- Computational complexity: 0 (This is a theoretical question.)
- Common error traps: minor (Students often confuse 'Parliament' with 'Government/Executive' or fail to connect it to the concept of 'citizens' voice', focusing only on 'running the country'.)
- Format demand: High. Being open-ended in English poses a significant linguistic barrier for Hindi-medium students who may understand the concept but struggle to articulate the keywords (e.g., "representative," "legislature," "sovereign will") in the target language.
- Number friendliness: N/A

Holistic Estimate:
The difficulty lies not in the concept, but in the transition from conceptual understanding in a native language to formal expression in English for economically disadvantaged students. While the rubric is somewhat flexible, the need for spontaneous generation of specific political functions (law-making/representation) usually results in lower success rates compared to multiple-choice formats.
