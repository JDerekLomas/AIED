- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Place value is introduced in early primary years and reinforced annually).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step identification).
- Common error traps: Minor (Students may confuse "place value" with "face value," resulting in an answer of 5, or struggle with the English terminology despite knowing the concept in Hindi as 'Sthaniya Maan').
- Format demand: Exact answer required; open-ended (No options provided, increasing difficulty slightly for low-confidence students).
- Number friendliness: Easy (Whole number, single-digit focus).
