- Concept familiarity: **Very familiar**. Rhyming words are introduced as early as Grade 3 in NCERT/State Board curricula. By Grade 8, identifying pairs within a short stanza is a routine task.
- Computational complexity: **1** (single-step pattern matching).
- Common error traps: **Minor**. Students may struggle with the second pair ("borrow"/"tomorrow") due to length or slight phonemic variation in Indian English accents, but the prompt asks for "rhyming words," and identifying just "rain" and "grain" (the most obvious pair) fulfills the rubric.
- Format demand: **Recall/Constructed Response**. While students must write the words (requiring spelling accuracy), "rain" and "grain" are provided in the text, making it a "copy and pair" task. No partial credit is available according to the rubric, but the cue is strong.
- Number friendliness: **Easy** (not applicable to language, but the linguistic "tokens" are short and simple).

Analysis: For Hindi-medium students, phonetic matching in English can be tricky, but the "-ain" sound is phonologically similar to vowel patterns in Hindi (जैसे 'रेन' - 'ग्रेन'). Given that these are common sight words, most students will find this accessible.
