**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity (Familiar):** The "too...to" structure is a staple of the Class 8 English grammar curriculum (Transformation of Sentences). However, for students in Hindi-medium schools, the semantic leap from "very/cannot" to the negative implication of "too" often remains a rote-learning exercise rather than intuitive usage.
*   **Computational Complexity (N/A):** This dimension is not applicable to a linguistic task; however, linguistically, it requires a 2-step syntactical transformation (replacing "very" with "too" and collapsing the second clause into an infinitive phrase).
*   **Common Error Traps (Major):** There are several high-frequency errors for this demographic:
    1.  **Redundancy:** Writing "He is too weak to *he cannot* walk."
    2.  **Missing "to":** Writing "He is too weak walk."
    3.  **L1 Interference:** Translating directly from Hindi (*voh itna kamzor hai ki chal nahi sakta*), leading to "He is so weak that he cannot walk," which, while grammatically correct, fails to use the required "too...to" prompt.
*   **Format Demand (Open-ended):** This requires active recall and structural manipulation. Since the rubric specifies a score of 1 or 0 (no partial credit), students who get the "too" correct but fail the "to" phrase receive zero marks.
*   **Language Load (Moderate):** While the vocabulary (*weak, walk*) is basic and "number friendly" in a linguistic sense, the grammatical abstraction of using a positive structure to imply a negative outcome is a significant hurdle for English Language Learners (ELLs).

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the socioeconomic and linguistic background, while students are trained in these "mechanical" grammar transformations, the transition from two simple sentences to a complex infinitive structure results in high error rates in accuracy and spelling.
