**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (This is a core topic in Grade 7 NCERT Science under the 'Heat' chapter and aligns with lived experience in the Indian climate).

**Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; requires qualitative explanation).

**Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse "reflection" with "convection" or struggle to articulate "poor absorber" vs "good reflector," but the underlying concept is intuitive).

**Format demand:** High (Open-ended recall). While the conceptual understanding is high, the requirement to provide "two scientific reasons" in English is a significant barrier for students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds. The rubric only requires one reason for the maximum score, but the prompt asks for two, which may cause cognitive load or confusion. Writing a coherent sentence in English is the primary hurdle.

**Number friendliness:** N/A

**Holistic Estimation:**
The topic is highly relatable to the students' daily lives. However, for a student in an EWS, Hindi-medium context, the jump from "understanding that white clothes are cool" to "stating scientific properties (absorption/reflection) in English" creates a performance gap. Because the rubric is generous (accepting "bounce off heat" and requiring only one plausible reason for the mark), many will bridge this gap, but limited English proficiency will still prevent a universal success rate.
