### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept familiarity: Familiar**
The "Combustion and Flame" chapter is a core component of the Class 8 NCERT Science curriculum. The application of flame zones to real-world professions (like goldsmiths) is a standard textbook example frequently emphasized in classroom teaching and previous years' question papers.

**Computational complexity: 1**
This is a purely qualitative conceptual question involving no mathematical calculations.

**Common error traps: Major**
There is a high probability of confusion between the "outermost" and "innermost" zones. Many students intuitively associate the bright yellow "middle zone" (luminous) with being the hottest or most significant because it is the most visible. Distinguishing between luminosity (brightness) and temperature (caloric value) is a major conceptual hurdle for this demographic.

**Format demand: Open-ended**
This item requires recall and linguistic construction ("Give reason"). While the rubric implies a binary 0 or 1, open-ended English questions pose a significant barrier for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. They may know the answer is "outermost/blue" but struggle to articulate the reasoning (complete combustion/hottest part) in English, often leading to incomplete or linguistically garbled responses that might not meet the "Give reason" requirement.

**Number friendliness: Easy**
N/A (Qualitative).

**Holistic Estimation**
While the concept is taught, the transition from Hindi to English medium, combined with the need to provide a multi-part qualitative reason rather than a simple identification, lowers the success rate for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency.
