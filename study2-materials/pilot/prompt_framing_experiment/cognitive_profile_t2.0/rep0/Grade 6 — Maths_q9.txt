### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**1. Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
The "Angle Sum Property of a Triangle" is a core concept introduced in Grade 6. While students are familiar with the rule (sum = 180°), they often struggle with the transition from visual identification of angles to the geometric deduction required in "find the value of x" problems.

**2. Computational Complexity: 2-3 Steps**
The process requires two distinct cognitive steps:
*   **Summation:** $50^\circ + 50^\circ = 100^\circ$ (assuming typical isosceles or given base angles).
*   **Subtraction:** $180^\circ - 100^\circ = 80^\circ$.
For students from economically weaker sections, horizontal equation solving is less practiced than vertical arithmetic.

**3. Common Error Traps: Major**
Students at this level, particularly those with English as a second language, often struggle with:
*   **Visual Distractors:** If the triangle "looks" equilateral, they may guess $60^\circ$.
*   **Complementary vs. Supplementary:** Confusing 180° with 90°.
*   **Linguistic Barrier:** Difficulty interpreting "Find the angle x" if they rely on Hindi-medium terminology (like *tribhuj* for triangle or *kon* for angle) and haven't bridged the vocabulary gap.

**4. Format Demand: Open-ended**
This is a "constructed response" item. There are no options to narrow down the range. Because the rubric only awards points for the final correct value (80), any minor computational slip results in 0 marks. The lack of scaffolding (intermediate steps) increases difficulty.

**5. Number Friendliness: Easy**
The target answer (80) and the inputs (usually multiples of 10) are mentally manageable. The difficulty is not in the math itself, but in the application of the geometric theorem.

### Holistic Estimation
While the math is simple, the transition to geometric reasoning in a second language, combined with a strict "all-or-nothing" rubric (0.5 or 0), creates a significant barrier for students in this demographic.
