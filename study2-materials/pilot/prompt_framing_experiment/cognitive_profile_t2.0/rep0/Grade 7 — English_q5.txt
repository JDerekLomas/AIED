- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The poem "The Squirrel" is a standard part of the NCERT Class 7 curriculum (Honeycomb textbook). However, while the image of a squirrel is universal, the specific metaphorical description ("question mark") is a literary convention that requires textual recall.
- **Computational complexity:** Not applicable (0 steps).
- **Common error traps:** Minor. Students might describe the tail's physical behavior (bushy, wagging, twitching) based on real-life observation rather than using the specific figurative language from the poem. Language interference (translating from Hindi) may lead to imprecise vocabulary.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This increases difficulty for students with low English proficiency compared to a multiple-choice format. While the rubric allows for "similar acceptable answers," the student still must construct a sentence or phrase in English.
- **Number friendliness:** Not applicable.

**Analysis:**
Given the demographic (economically weaker sections, Hindi-medium background), the primary barrier is the "Production" stage. While students likely understand the poem's meaning through classroom explanation, articulating "an interrogation mark" or "a question mark for a tail" in English presents a linguistic challenge. The high degree of familiarity with the textbook compensates for this somewhat, as this is a "stock" question usually practiced in drills.
