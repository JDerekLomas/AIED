**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Familiar.** At the Grade 6 level in India (NCERT/State Boards), "Playing with Numbers" is a primary chapter. Students are frequently drilled on factors and multiples. however, the concept of a "complete set" is often where proficiency varies.
*   **Computational Complexity: 2-3 steps.** Students must perform division or recall multiplication tables. They need to test divisibility for 2, 4, and potentially higher primes, then identify the corresponding quotient pairs.
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.** For students in this demographic, the primary traps are:
    1.  **Missing the 4/17 pair:** 17 is a prime number not typically covered in basic multiplication drills (which often stop at 10x10 or 12x12).
    2.  **Incomplete listing:** Students often stop after finding 1, 2, 34, and 68, failing to systematically check for 4.
    3.  **Language interference:** While the math is symbolic, the prompt "all the factors" requires a systematic exhaustive search that is often not mastery-level for ESL learners.
*   **Format Demand: High.** The rubric is binary (Maximum score: 1). Because it is open-ended and requires a *complete* set for the point, any single omission (like 17 or 34) results in a zero. No partial credit makes this significantly harder than a multiple-choice item.
*   **Number Friendliness: Moderate.** 68 is not a "friendly" number like 24, 36, or 60. Its dependency on 17—a prime number that many students from economically weaker sections may not have memorized in tables—adds a significant hurdle.

**Estimated Success Rate:**
The binary scoring system (all or nothing) significantly lowers the expected success rate. While many students will identify 1, 2, and 68, the exclusion of the 4/17 pair is a highly probable outcome in this specific demographic.
