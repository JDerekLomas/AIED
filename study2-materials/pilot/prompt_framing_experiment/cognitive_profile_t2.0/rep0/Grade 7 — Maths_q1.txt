Concept familiarity: familiar (Integers are introduced in Grade 6, and operations are a core focus of Grade 7 early in the term)
Computational complexity: 1 (Single operation)
Common error traps: major (Sign rules for multiplication are frequently confused with addition rules—e.g., expecting a negative sum—or the concept that "two negatives make a positive" is memorized but applied inconsistently)
Format demand: Exact (Open-ended recall of the product and sign, no partial credit for a 1-point item)
Number friendliness: easy (Basic multiplication table within 10)
