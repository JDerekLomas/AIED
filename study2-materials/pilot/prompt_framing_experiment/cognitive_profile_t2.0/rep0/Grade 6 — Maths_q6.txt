### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**1. Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
The area of basic polygons (squares and rectangles) is introduced in Grade 5 and reinforced in Grade 6 in the NCERT/State curriculum. However, because students often focus on perimeter vs. area formulas in silos, the cognitive leap to "comparison" adds a layer of complexity beyond simple formula recall.

**2. Computational Complexity: 2-3 Steps**
The student must execute three distinct operations:
*   Calculate area of the rectangle ($5 \times 4$).
*   Calculate area of the square ($5 \times 5$).
*   Calculate the difference ($25 - 20$).

**3. Common Error Traps: Major**
For Hindi-medium students/EWS backgrounds, the primary traps are:
*   **Dimensional Confusion:** Calculating perimeter ($P=2(L+B)$) instead of area ($A=L \times B$) because they confuse the terms "area" and "parimap" (perimeter).
*   **Square Property Recall:** Forgetting that a square's area is side squared ($s^2$), sometimes defaulting to $s \times 2$.
*   **Comparative Error:** Providing only the first part of the answer ("the square") and forgetting the second part ("by how much?").

**4. Format Demand: High (Open-ended)**
The maximum score is 1 with no partial credit mentioned in the prompt. This requires exactness. Unlike Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs), the student cannot rely on elimination or the presence of units (sq.cm) in options to guide their memory.

**5. Number Friendliness: Easy**
The digits 4 and 5 are highly "friendly" and part of basic multiplication tables taught early on. This minimizes cognitive load on arithmetic, though it doesn't solve conceptual gaps.

**6. Linguistic Factor (Special Consideration)**
For EWS students with limited English proficiency, words like "greater" and "by how much" (how many units more) are common tripping points if the question is provided only in English.
