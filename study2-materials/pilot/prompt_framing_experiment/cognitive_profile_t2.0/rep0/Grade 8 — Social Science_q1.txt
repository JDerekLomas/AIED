**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. The Indian Constitution and Fundamental Rights are staple topics introduced in Grade 6 and reinforced heavily in Grades 7 and 8 Civics (Social and Political Life).
*   **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a non-mathematical task involving a simple retrieval of information.
*   **Common error traps:** Minor. The most common trap for this demographic is linguistic interference (expressing the right in English when the concept was learned in Hindi) or confusing "Fundamental Rights" with "Fundamental Duties" or "Directive Principles."
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). While recall is generally harder than recognition (multiple choice), the rubric is highly lenient, allowing for "simplified phrasing" and "common names." This offsets the language barrier for ESL/Hindi-medium learners. Partial credit is not available based on the "Maximum score: 1" constraint, requiring two rights for a single point.
*   **Number friendliness:** Easy. The task requires only a count of "two," which is a low cognitive load for retrieval.

**Holistic Analysis**
Despite the socio-economic and linguistic challenges, "Fundamental Rights" is one of the most emphasized and "high-stakes" topics in the Indian Social Science curriculum. Even students with low English proficiency are usually coached to memorize terms like "Right to Equality" or "Right to Freedom" as keywords. The lenient rubric further ensures that phonetic or slightly ungrammatical English attempts will be marked correct.
