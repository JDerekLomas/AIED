Concept familiarity: familiar
Computational complexity: 1
Common error traps: minor (Students may name national festivals like Diwali or Holi instead of regional-specific ones like Pushkar Mela or Gangaur; the sentence-writing requirement poses a linguistic hurdle.)
Format demand: Open-ended (Recall-based); the 1-mark limit implies an "all or nothing" grading style unless split, making the second descriptive requirement a significant filter for low-English proficiency students.
Number friendliness: easy
