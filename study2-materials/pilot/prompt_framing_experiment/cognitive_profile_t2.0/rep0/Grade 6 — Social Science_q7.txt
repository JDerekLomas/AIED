- Concept familiarity: familiar (Natural resources and the geography of Rajasthan are core parts of the SCERT/NCERT Class 6 curriculum, though distinguishing "natural resources" from general "crops" or "places" may pose a slight challenge.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Qualitative reasoning; no arithmetic steps.)
- Common error traps: minor (Students often confuse "natural resources" with "man-made structures" or "crops." There is also a risk of naming two resources but failing to provide the "influence" explanation.)
- Format demand: High. This is an open-ended question requiring high-order synthesis (explanation) in a second language (English), which is difficult for Hindi-medium backgrounds. However, the rubric is binary (all or nothing) for a maximum score of 1, meaning any missing part results in zero.
- Number friendliness: easy (No numerical manipulation required.)

Holistic Assessment: While the content is familiar, the linguistic demand of "explaining influence" in English is a significant barrier for Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections. Most will likely name the resources but struggle to construct a coherent explanation of their impact on human life in English.
