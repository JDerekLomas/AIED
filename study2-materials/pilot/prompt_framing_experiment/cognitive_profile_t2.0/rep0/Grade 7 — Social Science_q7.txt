- **Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. (While 'money' is a common concept, 'economic development' is an abstract macroeconomic principle usually introduced in later grades or treated superficially in Grade 7. 'Digital money' is contemporary but might be a peripheral concept for students with limited access to private banking or digital devices).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (The item is conceptual/qualitative, not mathematical).
- **Common error traps:** Major. (Students often confuse 'money' with 'wealth' or 'income'. The second part of the prompt—digital money—is not reflected in the provided 1-point rubric, creating an alignment gap that may confuse students or scorers).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended/Higher-order. (Requires 'Analysis' and 'Evaluation' rather than simple identification. In a second-language context, articulating abstract economic roles is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice recognition).
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative item).

Holistic Estimate: The cognitive load of "Analyze" and "Evaluate" is high for 12-13-year-olds, especially when compounded by language barriers (Hindi-medium background) and the abstract nature of economic development.
