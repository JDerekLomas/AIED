### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
At the Grade 6 level in Indian government schools, "Area and Perimeter" are staple topics introduced in Class 4 and 5 and reinforced in Class 6. However, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the transition to English terminology (Length vs. *Lambai*, Breadth vs. *Chaurai*, Area vs. *Kshetrafal*).

**Computational Complexity: 2-3 steps**
The student must recall two distinct formulas ($A = L \times B$ and $P = 2(L + B)$). Even though the prompt focuses on Area for the rubric, the question asks for both, requiring multi-step processing.

**Common Error Traps: Major**
There are two primary traps for this cohort:
1.  **Formula Confusion:** Swapping formulas (e.g., adding for area or multiplying for perimeter).
2.  **Unit Consistency:** Students often fail to provide the square units ($cm^2$) or mistakenly apply square units to perimeter. Since the rubric demands "120 sq. cm," a numeric answer of "120" without units or with wrong units ($cm$) would result in a zero.

**Format Demand: High (Open-ended)**
The item is open-ended with a strict binary rubric (Correct or Incorrect). There is no partial credit for calculating one metric but failing the other, or for showing correct steps with a minor arithmetic error. This significantly lowers the success rate compared to multiple-choice.

**Number Friendliness: Moderate**
While $15 \times 8 = 120$ is relatively simple, many students in this demographic have not mastered multiplication tables up to 15. The addition $(15 + 8) = 23 \times 2$ for perimeter is accessible, but the rubric focuses on the product.

**Estimated Success Rate:**
The demand to get *both* right for a single mark, combined with the language barrier of English descriptors and the strict unit requirement in the rubric, creates a significant barrier.
