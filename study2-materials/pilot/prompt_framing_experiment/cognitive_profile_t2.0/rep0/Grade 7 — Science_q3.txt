**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. Photosynthesis and chlorophyll are introduced in primary grades and revisited in detail in Grade 7. In Hindi-medium schools, "harit lavak" or "chlorophyll" are key vocabulary terms frequently repeated in textbook exercises.
*   **Computational complexity:** 0. This is a purely qualitative recall item.
*   **Common error traps:** Minor. The main trap is linguistic rather than conceptual—students may know the concept but struggle with the spelling of "Chlorophyll" (a complex English word) or confuse it with "Chloroplast."
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). No partial credit is possible. While recall is harder than recognition (MCQ), this is a foundational term typically rote-learned.
*   **Number friendliness:** N/A (Non-numerical).

**Holistic Estimation**
Despite the socio-economic and linguistic barriers, this specific term is a high-frequency keyword in the Science curriculum. Indian government school pedagogy often emphasizes the rote memorization of such "one-word" labels. While some students will struggle with the English spelling, the majority of Grade 7 students are trained to identify this specific pigment as the core requirement of the chapter.
