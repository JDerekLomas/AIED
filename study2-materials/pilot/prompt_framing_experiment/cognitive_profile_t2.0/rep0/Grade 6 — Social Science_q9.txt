- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Historical sites in Rajasthan are standard parts of the Grade 6 curriculum in India, often covered under early regional history or cultural heritage sections).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical; requires simple retrieval of three distinct data points).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse the state—e.g., naming the Taj Mahal; or struggle with specific city-monument pairings like attributing Hawa Mahal to Udaipur).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended/Recall. The rubric is a "bottleneck" because it requires multiple components (two names, one city, one reason) to achieve a single binary point (1/0). The lack of partial credit for such a multi-step linguistic task is a high hurdle for students with low English proficiency.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A (Qualitative).
