- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (This is a foundational concept introduced in primary classes and repeated in Grade 6 Science Chapter 9).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No arithmetic involved; requires binary categorization).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often struggle with "dormant" things like seeds or eggs, or mechanical movement in non-living things like cars/fans).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended; requires active recall of scientific terminology. Partial credit is mentioned, but the item requires providing two characteristics for "each" group, implying a multi-part retrieval.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question).

**Psychometric Analysis:**
While the content is highly familiar, the "double-barreled" nature of the prompt (two characteristics for living AND two for non-living) creates a high retrieval load for Grade 6 students. For students in Hindi-medium or low-resource backgrounds, the difficulty lies in expressive English vocabulary (e.g., "respiration," "reproduction") rather than conceptual understanding. The mismatch between the "Maximum score 0.5" and the requirement of providing four total facts suggests a high density of information required for a small reward, which may lead to incomplete responses.
