- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The distinction between 'some' and 'any' is typically introduced early, but for students in Hindi-medium backgrounds, the distinction isn't always intuitive as both can translate to "कुछ" (kuch).
- **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a single-step linguistic choice.
- **Common error traps:** Minor. A common misconception for L2 learners is the "over-application" of 'any' in affirmative sentences because it is often taught alongside 'some'. Students may also guess randomly if they do not recognize the sentence as affirmative vs. interrogative/negative.
- **Format demand:** Selected response (Multiple Choice/Binary Choice). Exact answer required; no partial credit. Lower demand than open-ended recall.
- **Number friendliness:** Not applicable (easy/basic vocabulary).

Holistic estimate: Given the profile of economically weaker students with limited English proficiency, the primary barrier is not the grammatical rule itself but the fluency in identifying the sentence as an affirmative statement versus a question.
