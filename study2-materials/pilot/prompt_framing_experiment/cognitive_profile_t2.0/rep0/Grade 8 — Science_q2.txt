Concept familiarity: familiar (The transformation of milk to curd is a daily household occurrence in Indian homes, and the specific bacterium is a core part of the NCERT Class 8 curriculum).

Computational complexity: 1 (The item requires no mathematical computation).

Common error traps: minor (Students often confuse "bacteria" with "virus" or "fungi," and spelling "Lactobacillus" correctly is a frequent phonetic challenge for those from Hindi-medium backgrounds).

Format demand: High (Open-ended recall requires retrieving a technical Latin name; since the total marks are 0.5, partial credit for just the category is unlikely).

Number friendliness: easy (No numerical operations involved).
