**Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. While "Active and Passive Voice" is introduced in Grade 7 NCERT curriculum, the mastery requires a grasp of past participle forms and auxiliary verbs, which remains a challenge for ESL learners in rural or EWS settings.

**Computational complexity:** 2–3. Though not mathematical, linguistically the student must: 1. Identify the object and promote it to subject; 2. Determine the correct tense and auxiliary verb (*were*); 3. Recall the irregular past participle of "blow" (*blown*).

**Common error traps:** Major. Key pitfalls for Hindi-medium students include using "was" instead of "were" (subject-verb agreement with "leaves"), using "blowed" (regularizing an irregular verb), or retaining the active verb form.

**Format demand:** Open-ended/Recall. There are no options to choose from, increasing the difficulty as the student must construct the entire syntax from memory. No partial credit is awarded per the rubric.

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Linguistic equivalent: Moderate). The vocabulary is relatively simple, though "blown" is an irregular form that adds a layer of difficulty compared to regular verbs like "cleaned."
