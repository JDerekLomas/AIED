- **Concept familiarity**: Less familiar (While voice change is introduced in Grade 7/8 in the NCERT/SCERT curricula, active-to-passive conversion requires mastery of multiple tense structures. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the auxiliary verb "be" and the shift to the past participle/V3 form.)
- **Computational complexity**: 4+ (Though linguistic, the cognitive "steps" involve: 1. Identifying the object; 2. Determining the tense; 3. Selecting the correct "be" verb (was/has been); 4. Recalling the V3 form; 5. Managing the "by + agent" structure. Two sentences must be completed for a single point.)
- **Common error traps**: Major (Common "bugs" include: using the wrong tense (e.g., "is prepared"), forgetting "been" in the present perfect sentence, or simply swapping the subject/object without changing the verb form. The "two-part" nature of the item increases the probability of an error.)
- **Format demand**: Open-ended/No partial credit (The 1-point rubric requires both A and B to be correct. Without partial credit, any single error in tense or participle leads to a zero.)
- **Number friendliness**: N/A (Linguistic demand is high due to vocabulary like "successor" and "delicious.")
