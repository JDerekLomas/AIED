- Computational complexity: 1 (Linear production of a single thought).
- Common error traps: Major (Primary traps include switching back to third-person "The bird," tense inconsistency, and phonetic spelling based on Hindi pronunciation/transliteration).
- Format demand: Open-ended/Recall; rubric requires 100% accuracy for a binary score (1 or 0), making the lack of partial credit a significant barrier.
- Number friendliness: Easy (Not applicable).
