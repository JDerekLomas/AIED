- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Weather patterns are part of daily life and early English curriculum).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Linear task of identifying and naming one concept).
- Common error traps: Minor (Students may misspell the season name, e.g., 'monshoon' or 'wintr', though the rubric implies credit for naming the season regardless of paragraph quality).
- Format demand: High demand for the paragraph; Low demand for the specific rubric mark. The rubric only requires "naming" the season within a 6-8 line writing task. While the writing task is open-ended (recall), the scoring criteria for the 1 mark is minimal.
- Number friendliness: Easy (Single-point identification).
