Concept familiarity: **Familiar**. The concept of "protective foods" and deficiency diseases is a core component of the Grade 6 NCERT Science curriculum (Chapter: Components of Food).

Computational complexity: **1**. There are no mathematical calculations; it is a single-step conceptual retrieval and naming task.

Common error traps: **Minor**. The primary trap for this demographic is "cross-matching"—confusing which disease is caused by a vitamin versus a mineral (e.g., attributing Scurvy to a mineral). Students may also conflate "energy-giving" (carbohydrates/fats) with "protective" functions.

Format demand: **High**. Open-ended recall is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice for students with limited English proficiency. While they may understand the concept, articulating "fight against diseases" in a second language creates a "linguistic bottleneck." The rubric suggests a 1-point "all or nothing" approach, which penalizes students who know part (b) but struggle with the phrasing for part (a).

Number friendliness: **Easy**. Not applicable (no numerical values).

Holistic Estimate: While the content is foundational, the requirement to explain a concept in English without partial credit (per the rubric provided) will lead to many "half-correct" answers that receive zero marks. Many students from Hindi-medium backgrounds will understand the role of vitamins in immunity but may fail to provide the precise academic English nomenclature required by a strict rubric.
