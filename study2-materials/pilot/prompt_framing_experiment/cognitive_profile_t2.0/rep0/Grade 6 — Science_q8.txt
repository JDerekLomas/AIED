**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The roles of water, sunlight, and nutrients in plant growth are central themes in Grade 6 Science; however, linking specific symptoms like "yellowing" to deficiency moves toward "less familiar" for students without practical gardening experience).

**Computational complexity:** 1 (No mathematical calculations required).

**Common error traps:** Major (The primary trap is the linguistic barrier. Students may confuse "stunted" with "straight" or other descriptors. Additionally, many students tend to provide descriptive answers ("the plant is dying") rather than the required inferential answers ("it lacks nitrogen/sunlight")).

**Format demand:** Open-ended; requires active recall and structural synthesis of an explanation in English. While the rubric is generous (accepting any of the three needs), the lack of a word bank or multiple-choice options increases the cognitive load significantly for ESL (English as a Second Language) learners.

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Non-numerical item).

**Holistic Estimate:** The transition from observing a symptom to "inferring" a specific deficiency is a high-order cognitive task for this demographic. While the biological concepts are taught, the requirement to explain the "why" in English will act as a significant filter.
