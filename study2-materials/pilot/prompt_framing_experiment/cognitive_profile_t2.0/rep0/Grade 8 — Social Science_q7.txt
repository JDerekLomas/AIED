**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The Battle of Plassey is a core pillar of the Grade 8 NCERT history syllabus and is usually emphasized as a turning point.)

**Computational complexity:** 1 (No mathematical calculations required; purely qualitative historical analysis.)

**Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse the Battle of Plassey with the Battle of Buxar or describe the battle tactics instead of the political consequences/expansion of power as requested.)

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall and linguistic construction. Given the Hindi-medium background and limited English proficiency, translating the complex concept of "puppet nawab" or "political dominance" into an English sentence poses a high barrier.)

**Number friendliness:** Easy (The year 1757 is a standard mnemonic in Indian history, though not required for the solution itself.)

**Holistic Estimate:** While the concept is taught extensively, the requirement to explain "expansion of power" in English—moving beyond simple rote memorization of names to describing a political outcome—is a significant hurdle for students from economically weaker sections with limited English exposure. Many will understand the event but struggle to articulate the "how" in a way that satisfies the rubric in English.
