Concept familiarity: familiar (The story "Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy is a staple of the Class 7 NCERT curriculum, which is followed by most government schools.)

Computational complexity: 1 (This is a qualitative language task; only basic logical sequencing is required.)

Common error traps: major (Students often struggle to distinguish between summarizing the text—stating what the King thought—and providing a subjective "real life" evaluation as requested. Language interference often leads to students copying a sentence from the passage that does not actually answer the "Why?" part of the question.)

Format demand: Open-ended requires recall and synthesis; No partial credit (0 or 1). The requirement to generate an original reason in English is a significant hurdle for students with limited English proficiency.

Number friendliness: easy (No numerical data involved.)

Holistic Estimate: While the story is familiar, the shift from reading comprehension to abstract reasoning (application to "real life") combined with the requirement to construct an original sentence in English will be challenging for this demographic. Many students will likely provide a circular argument or a fragmented sentence.
