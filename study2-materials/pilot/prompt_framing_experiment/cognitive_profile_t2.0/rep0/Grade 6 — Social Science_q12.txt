### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
At the Grade 6 level in Indian schools (NCERT/State boards), the Mauryan Empire and Ashoka are cornerstone topics. Students frequently see the Lion Capital on currency, stamps, and official documents. However, while the *visual* is very familiar, the historical nomenclature ("Lion Capital of Ashoka") and its formal designation ("National Emblem") require specific academic recall.

**Computational Complexity: 1**
There are no mathematical operations involved; it is a qualitative, descriptive task.

**Common Error Traps: Minor**
Students often provide "patriotic" but vague answers (e.g., "Because the lion is the king of the jungle" or "To show India is brave"). Without understanding the specific link to Sarnath/Ashoka required by the rubric, students may lose marks despite offering a logical (though incorrect) justification.

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
This is a significant hurdle for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds or economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. While they might know the answer in their mother tongue, articulating "Lion Capital," "Ashoka," and "National Emblem" in English involves high-stakes recall and sentence construction. The binary rubric (Max score: 1) suggests no partial credit for simply mentioning "Ashoka" without the "Emblem" context, increasing the difficulty.

**Number Friendliness: N/A**
This dimension does not apply to this qualitative social science question.

**Holistic Estimation**
While the imagery is ubiquitous, the requirement to explain the historical origin and official status in English—combined with a strict rubric—will exclude many students who have the conceptual "gist" but lack the technical vocabulary.
