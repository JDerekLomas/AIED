- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. Rajasthan’s rural economy (primary sector) is a staple topic in State Board and NCERT Social Science curricula. Most students have personal or communal connections to these vocations.
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (None). This is a qualitative, descriptive task.
- **Common error traps:** Minor. The most common trap is naming occupations typical of urban areas (service sector) or confusing general North Indian crops with the "occupations" themselves. Students may also struggle with the English terminology for "Animal Husbandry" even if they understand the concept in Hindi (Pashu-palan).
- **Format demand:** High. This is a two-part open-ended question requiring both recall (naming) and expression (describing). In a 1-mark "all-or-nothing" rubric, failing to describe one will result in zero despite naming two, which increases difficulty for students with low English writing proficiency.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A). No numerical operations involved.
