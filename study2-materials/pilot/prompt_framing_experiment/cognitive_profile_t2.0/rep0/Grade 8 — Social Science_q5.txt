- **Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. While "biodiversity" is introduced in Grade 8 (Geography/Science), the conceptual link to "sustainable development" is an abstract, higher-order relationship that is often memorized rather than understood by students with limited academic English.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a purely qualitative conceptual question.
- **Common error traps:** Major. Students often confuse "biodiversity" with general "nature" or "planting trees." Furthermore, the term "sustainable development" is a linguistic barrier for Hindi-medium students, often resulting in vague or circular definitions.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This is high demand; since it is an "Explain" question with a binary rubric (Max score 1), students cannot rely on recognition (MCQ) and must construct a multi-step logical argument in a language (English) in which they lack proficiency.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. Not applicable for this item.

Holistic Analysis: The primary hurdle is the linguistic complexity of "ecosystem services" and "sustainable development." For EWS students in Hindi-medium transitions, retrieving specific ecological functions (pollination, climate regulation) in English without losing the structural meaning is a significant cognitive load. Most will provide generic answers about "saving animals," which may not meet the rubric's requirement for "essential services."
