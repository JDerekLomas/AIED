- **Concept familiarity**: Less familiar. While capitalization rules are taught early, the practical application across three different types (sentence start, proper nouns, days of the week) remains a significant challenge for English Language Learners (ELL) in government schools who may not see these rules mirrored in their native scripts.
- **Computational complexity**: 1 (Single transformation task).
- **Common error traps**: Major. Students frequently identify "Riya" as the start of a sentence but often miss "Meena" (mid-sentence proper noun) and "Sunday" (calendar item). In Hindi, there is no distinction between upper and lower case, making the concept of "capitalization" an abstract convention rather than an intuitive one.
- **Format demand**: Open-ended; requires full recall and precision. Since it is binary (all-or-nothing 1-point rubric), errors in a single capital letter result in a zero.
- **Number friendliness**: N/A (Language-based).

**Holistic Estimation:**
While many students will capitalize "Riya" and add a period, a high percentage will overlook "Meena" or "Sunday." The lack of partial credit in the rubric significantly lowers the expected success rate for this specific demographic.
