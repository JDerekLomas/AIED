### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Familiar**
Linear equations in one variable are a core part of the Grade 8 NCERT syllabus. However, while the *concept* of an equation is familiar, the structure involving rational expressions (fractions on both sides) is typically introduced towards the middle of the term.

**Computational Complexity: 4+ steps**
Despite the rubric's focus on the initial cross-multiplication, the question asks to "Solve the equation." A student must:
1. Cross-multiply: $5(x-5) = 3(x-3)$
2. Expand brackets (Distributive law): $5x - 25 = 3x - 9$
3. Transpose terms: $5x - 3x = -9 + 25$
4. Simplify and solve: $2x = 16 \rightarrow x = 8$
Each step introduces a point of failure.

**Common Error Traps: Major**
Students from these backgrounds often struggle with:
*   **Sign errors:** Handling the negative signs during distribution or transposition (e.g., writing $-9-25$ instead of $-9+25$).
*   **Partial distribution:** Multiplying the $x$ but not the constant (e.g., $5x-5$ instead of $5x-25$).
*   **Inverse Operations:** Confusion regarding moving terms across the equals sign.

**Format Demand: High**
The item is open-ended. Without multiple-choice options to work backward from (back-solving), students must rely entirely on procedural recall. While the rubric suggests a score of 1 for the initial step, a final answer requirement significantly lowers the success rate.

**Number Friendliness: Moderate**
The integers (3, 5) are prime and easy to multiply, and the final answer is a whole number ($x=8$), which provides positive feedback to the student that they are likely correct.

**Contextual Factors:**
The English phrasing "Solve the equation and find the value of x" is standard, but Hindi-medium students often require explicit classroom practice to translate "cross-multiplication" into the procedure required.
