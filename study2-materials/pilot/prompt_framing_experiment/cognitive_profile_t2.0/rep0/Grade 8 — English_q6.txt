**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The "fable" (specifically Panchatantra and Jataka tales) is a core component of the Grade 8 English (Honeydew) curriculum. However, while students recognize fables, defining the genre abstractly is a higher-order task than identifying one.
*   **Computational complexity:** N/A (English assessment).
*   **Common error traps:** Minor/Moderate. Students often confuse "fable" with "story" or "fairytale." The linguistic hurdle for EWS students is the transition from Hindi (where they know the concept as *niti-katha*) to expressing it in formal English. They may omit the "moral" or "animal characters" component, failing to meet the full rubric requirement.
*   **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This is high difficulty for Hindi-medium/limited English proficiency students. Unlike Multiple Choice, where they could recognize the definition, they must construct an English sentence from scratch using specific vocabulary (e.g., "imparts," "characters," "moral"). No partial credit is available per the 1-mark maximum.
*   **Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Estimation Analysis**
While the concept is taught, the linguistic barrier for students from economically weaker sections often results in grammatically broken or incomplete definitions. Many will recall "animals" but struggle to articulate the "moral lesson" aspect in a way that satisfies a strict 1-mark rubric.
