Concept familiarity: Less familiar (While antonyms are practiced, "ancient" is an academic vocabulary word that may not be used in everyday conversation among EWS/Hindi-medium learners; students may confuse it with "old" but struggle to recall the specific English term "modern.")

Computational complexity: 1 (Single retrieval task.)

Common error traps: Minor (Students may provide a Hindi translation like "Naya" instead of the English word, or provide a synonym like "old" due to a misunderstanding of the term "antonym.")

Format demand: Open-ended (Requires pure recall without options; no partial credit possible for incorrect spelling if the word is unrecognizable.)

Number friendliness: Easy (Not applicable for a language item, but the word length is short.)
