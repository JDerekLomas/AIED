**Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The Vedic period is a core component of the Grade 6 History curriculum (NCERT/State Boards). While "pastoralism" is a specific term, students are generally aware of the importance of cows and farming in ancient Indian society.

**Computational complexity:** 1. No arithmetic steps required; this is a purely conceptual/recall task.

**Common error traps:** Minor. A potential trap is the shift in the Vedic period (Early vs. Later). In the Early Vedic period, pastoralism was primary, while in the Later Vedic period, agriculture became dominant. The rubric accepts both, which mitigates this trap. However, students may confuse the Vedic period with the Harappan (urban/trade-based) period.

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). For students with limited English proficiency, "describing one key aspect" in English poses a higher hurdle than mere identification. Sentence construction and vocabulary (e.g., "rearing," "cultivation") may be difficult, even if the concept is understood.

**Number friendliness:** Easy. No numerical manipulation required.

**Estimated Success Proportion:** 
Given the transition from Hindi to English medium and the requirement to "describe," many students may provide a one-word correct identification but fail to provide a descriptive sentence in English, or may struggle with the specific terminology required for the second part of the prompt.
