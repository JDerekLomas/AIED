- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The role of sunlight in plant growth is a core topic in Grade 6 Science, though the term "biological process" adds academic weight.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (The task requires simple data comparison/identification of the highest value.)
- **Common error traps:** Major (The phrasing of "favourable" and "biological process" acts as a language barrier for ESL/Hindi-medium students; identifying the term "Photosynthesis" in English is a common bottleneck.)
- **Format demand:** Open-ended requires recall; no partial credit is offered for this 1-mark item, meaning even if parts (a) and (b) are correct, a failure to name the process in (c) could result in a zero depending on strict rubric adherence.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Comparing heights or growth metrics in a table for 10 days typically involves small integers.)
