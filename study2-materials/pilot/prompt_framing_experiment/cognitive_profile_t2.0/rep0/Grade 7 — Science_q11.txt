**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Evaporation and basic data interpretation (tables) are part of the NCERT Class 7 Science curriculum (Chapter: Heat / Physical and Chemical Changes). However, the specific concept of "boiling point elevation" or "solutes impeding evaporation" is more advanced, making the explanation for part (b) challenging.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** No calculation is required, only a direct comparison of values in a table (finding the smallest/largest number).
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Many students from these backgrounds conflate "fastest" with the "highest number" (taking 60 minutes vs 5 minutes). There is also a linguistic hurdle in translating "rate" vs "time."
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended (requires recall/reasoning).** While (a) is simple retrieval, (b) requires constructing a sentence in English. For ESL/Hindi-medium students, articulating the scientific reasoning behind why a solute inhibits evaporation is a significant barrier.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The data points are simple integers/minutes.

**Holistic Estimation**
While part (a) might see a 60-70% success rate, the multi-part nature of the question (especially the explanatory requirement in English for part b) will significantly lower the "fully correct" rate. Most students will identify Petrol correctly but struggle to provide a scientifically sound explanation in English for why the salt solution is slower.
