**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Familiar.** Data handling (bar graphs) is a core component of the NCERT Class 6 and 7 curricula. However, for students in government schools, the shift from reading graphs to constructing them from scratch involves a higher cognitive load, as it requires spatial reasoning and organization.
*   **Computational Complexity: 2-3.** While there are no complex equations, the student must perform several mental calculations: identifying the range of data, determining the division of the axis (scale), and translating raw numbers into physical heights on a grid.
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.**
    1.  **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with "appropriate scale" if the term wasn't bridge-translated effectively.
    2.  **Scale Selection:** A common "procedural bug" is using a non-linear scale (e.g., writing the raw data points directly on the Y-axis instead of using equal intervals).
    3.  **Labeling:** Students often forget to label the axes (Class vs. Number of Children), which leads to marks being lost in a rigid rubric.
*   **Format Demand: Open-ended.** This requires total recall and production. There is no scaffolding provided. The rubric for this specific item is strict ("Maximum score: 1"), implying that even minor errors in scale or labeling result in zero marks, making the "exactness" requirement high.
*   **Number Friendliness: Moderate.** Data for classes often range from 80 to 140. While they are usually multiples of 5 or 10, deciding whether 1 unit represents 10 or 20 children requires a level of proportional thinking that can be challenging for under-resourced students.

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given that the rubric is "all or nothing" for 1 mark, many students will lose credit for "technical" flaws (like inconsistent spacing or missing labels) even if they understand the data.
