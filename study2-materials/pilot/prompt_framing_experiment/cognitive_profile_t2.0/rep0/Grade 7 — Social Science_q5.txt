- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The rock cycle is a core component of the Grade 7 Geography curriculum/NCERT, but distinguishing the specific transitional mechanisms is more challenging than simply identifying rock types).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical task).
- **Common error traps:** Major (Students often confuse "weathering" with "melting" or fail to differentiate between the formation of sedimentary vs. metamorphic rocks; linguistic barriers in English lead to swapping "sediments" with "soil" or "dirt").
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall and linguistic construction. While the rubric is specific, the lack of partial credit for a 1-point item makes it difficult for students who understand the concept but lack the precise English vocabulary to describe "weathering" or "erosion").
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A).
