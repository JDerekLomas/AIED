- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The topic of food spoilage and microorganisms (specifically bread mould/Rhizopus) is a core component of the Grade 8 NCERT Science curriculum (Chapter: Microorganisms: Friend and Foe). It is also an observable everyday phenomenon for students in these communities.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. No calculation is required; this is a purely conceptual/recall task.
- **Common error traps:** Minor. Students may confuse "fungus" with "bacteria" or simply state "the bread is rotten/bad" without identifying the biological agent. However, in an Indian school context, "fungus" or "faphundi" (Hindi equivalent) are common vocabulary terms.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended recall. Since the question asks for the "cause," students must generate the term rather than recognize it. Lack of partial credit for a 1-mark item increases the demand. Limited English proficiency might lead to phonetic spelling or use of vernacular terms (e.g., "ulliyari" or "faphund"), which graders often accept.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy/NA. No numerical processing involved.

**Holistic Estimate:** While the concept is highly relatable, the requirement to produce a specific scientific term in English can be a hurdle for Hindi-medium learners from economically weaker sections. However, given it's a "classic" experiment often demonstrated or highlighted in textbooks, most students will recognize the phenomenon.
