- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The concept of deforestation and its environmental impacts is a standard part of the Grade 8 Science (NCERT) curriculum (specifically the "Conservation of Plants and Animals" chapter).
- **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a qualitative, descriptive item with no mathematical requirements.
- **Common error traps:** Minor. While students may recognize the activity, the primary trap for this specific cohort is "expressive deficit"—knowing the consequence (e.g., lack of oxygen, global warming) but failing to articulate it correctly in English.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. This requires active recall and sentence construction rather than simple recognition. Since the rubric allows for "any sufficient description," it is relatively lenient, though the 1-mark limit for a two-part question makes full marks contingent on providing both parts accurately.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. No numerical data is involved.

**Holistic Estimation:** While the concepts are well-understood, the requirement to explain "sustained consequences" in a second language often leads to vague or one-word answers (e.g., "pollution") that might not meet the "consequences faced for a long time" criteria depending on the strictness of the evaluator.
