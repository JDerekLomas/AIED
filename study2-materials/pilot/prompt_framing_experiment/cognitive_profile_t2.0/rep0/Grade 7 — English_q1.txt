- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (This is the opening story "Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy, a standard text in the NCERT Grade 7 curriculum).
- Computational complexity: 1 (The cognitive task is direct retrieval of information from a narrative).
- Common error traps: Major (Students often confuse the three specific questions with the three specific answers provided later in the story; linguistic interference makes distinguishing between "right time," "right people," and "most important thing" difficult in a second language).
- Format demand: Open-ended/Recall (High demand; students must construct complete sentences in English. Since the rubric implies an "all or nothing" max score of 1, missing one of the three components results in failure).
- Number friendliness: N/A (Non-mathematical item).

Analysis: While the story is iconic and frequently taught, the linguistic burden of recall in English for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds is high. Students often grasp the "gist" in their native tongue but struggle to produce the tripartite grammatical structure required by the rubric without making syntactic or semantic errors.
