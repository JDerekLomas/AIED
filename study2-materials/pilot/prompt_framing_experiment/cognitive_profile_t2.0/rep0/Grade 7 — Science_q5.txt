- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (this is a fundamental core concept in Class 7 Science, repeatedly emphasized in NCERT Chapter 1).
- Computational complexity: 1 (zero mathematical operations required).
- Common error traps: Minor (students may confuse the prefixes 'auto' and 'hetero', or misspell the scientific terms, though they generally grasp the logic).
- Format demand: Open-ended; requires recall of definitions and specific examples. High linguistic load for ESL students.
- Number friendliness: N/A.

Holistic Analysis: While the concepts are fundamental and well-drilled, the "Differentiate" command in English poses a significant hurdle for students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds. The transition from vernacular thinking to formal English scientific writing often results in partial credit for naming examples but failing to articulate the formal definitions required for a full score. However, because it is a "high-stakes" textbook question frequently prioritized by teachers, rote memorization is high.
