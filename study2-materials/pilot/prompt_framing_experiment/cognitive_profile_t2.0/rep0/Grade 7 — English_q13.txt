**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar.** In the Indian grade 7 curriculum (NCERT/State boards), articles are introduced in primary school and reinforced annually. The specific nouns used (elephant, tiger, zoo) are staple vocabulary in Hindi-medium English textbooks.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1 (Non-mathematical).** The task involves a single linguistic operation (insertion) applied at three points within a single sentence.
*   **Common Error traps:** **Major.** For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the "vowel sound" rule (an elephant) is often confused with "vowel letters." However, the most significant trap is the "rewrite the whole sentence" instruction. Students often provide only the three missing words, failing the rubric's requirement for a complete sentence rewrite.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended/Exact.** Since no partial credit is offered and the student must perform both the recall of articles and the physical task of rewriting the sentence without transcription errors, the demand is high for students with lower English literacy.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A (Easy linguistic load).** The sentence structure (S-V-O) is the most basic template in English pedagogy.

**Holistic Estimate**
While the grammar rules are basic, the "all or nothing" rubric—combined with the requirement to rewrite the entire sentence correctly—poses a significant barrier for students from economically weaker sections who may struggle with consistent orthography and following multi-part instructions.
