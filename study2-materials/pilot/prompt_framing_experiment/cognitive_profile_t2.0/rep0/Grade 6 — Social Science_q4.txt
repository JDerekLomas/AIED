- **Concept familiarity**: Familiar (The Thar Desert is a staple topic in Grade 6 Geography; however, mapping it specifically to the state of Rajasthan may require an extra step of spatial association for some.)
- **Computational complexity**: 1 (Identification and recall)
- **Common error traps**: Minor (Students might confuse a "landform" with a "climate" or simply describe it as "hot" without naming the specific geographic feature; linguistic confusion between "Desert" and "Dessert.")
- **Format demand**: Open-ended; requires recall of specific terminology. While partial credit is often awarded in theory, the 0.5 max score makes it essentially binary.
- **Number friendliness**: N/A (Qualitative item)
