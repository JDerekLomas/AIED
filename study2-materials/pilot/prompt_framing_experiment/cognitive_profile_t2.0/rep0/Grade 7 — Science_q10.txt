- **Concept familiarity:** **Familiar** (The concept of Neutralization is a core chapter in Grade 7 NCERT Science. However, the application to specific insect stings—distinguishing between the acidic nature of a bee sting and the alkaline nature of a wasp sting—is often a secondary detail that requires specific rote memorization.)
- **Computational complexity:** **1** (Conceptual identification; no calculation required.)
- **Common error traps:** **Major** (Students frequently swap the two: they may mistakenly believe all insect stings are acidic. Identifying the correct "opposite" reagent for each specific sting is a high-interference task. Additionally, the spelling of "neutralization" in English poses a barrier for Hindi-medium students.)
- **Format demand:** **Open-ended/Exact** (Since it is a 1-mark item, the rubric likely requires the specific keyword "Neutralization." Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice recognition for students with limited English proficiency.)
- **Number friendliness:** **Easy** (N/A)

**Holistic Estimate:** The transition from the "Daily Life" scenario to the formal chemical term is the primary hurdle. While many students may understand that they are "fixing" the sting, the requirement to produce the formal term "Neutralization" in an open-ended English format—while correctly differentiating between the two sting types—will exclude a significant portion of the cohort.
