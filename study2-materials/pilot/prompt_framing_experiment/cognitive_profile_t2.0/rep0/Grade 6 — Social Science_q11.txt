- **Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Road safety is a core EVS topic from primary grades and visible in daily life).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (Simple recall and association; no arithmetic).
- **Common error traps:** None (The question is broad and relates to common sense; however, linguistic limitations may lead to repetitive answers rather than two distinct reasons).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended. While the rubric suggests 1 mark, the question requires three distinct outputs (two reasons + a communal impact). This is a high-demand format for students with limited English proficiency as they must construct multiple sentences.
- **Number friendliness:** Not applicable.

**Analysis:**
While the topic is relatable, the linguistic barrier for students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds is the primary obstacle. Explaining the abstract concept of "community functioning" in English is significantly more difficult than listing "to avoid accidents." Many students will provide the two reasons but struggle to articulate the second part of the prompt in a second language, risking a loss of the single mark if the rubric is applied strictly to all components of the prompt.
