**Concept familiarity:** familiar
(At Grade 8, synonyms and vocabulary-building are standard curriculum components. However, for Hindi-medium learners, while the concept of "breeze" is present in textbooks, it is often confused with "wind" or "air" if not explicitly mapped to its English synonym.)

**Computational complexity:** 1
(Single-step semantic retrieval: scan the text and match the definition to the word.)

**Common error traps:** minor
(Students often struggle with "granularity" in vocabulary. Many may identify the word "wind" if it appears in the passage, or provide a related but incorrect noun like "air" or "weather," failing to distinguish the specific intensity "light" that defines "breeze.")

**Format demand:** Open-ended requires recall; no partial credit.
(Since the rubric requires the exact word "breeze," there is no margin for spelling errors or synonyms not found in the text. This is high-demand for EWS students with limited English exposure.)

**Number friendliness:** N/A

**Estimated Holistic Success Rate:**
The task requires scanning a text (low difficulty) but relies on specific vocabulary decoding. For students in Hindi-medium government schools, "breeze" is a tier-2 vocabulary word that is often encountered in poetry or descriptive prose but rarely in daily conversational English. The leap from "light wind" to the specific term "breeze" without a word bank is a significant barrier.
