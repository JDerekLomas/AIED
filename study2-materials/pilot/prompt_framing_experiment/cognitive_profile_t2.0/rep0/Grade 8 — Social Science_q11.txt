- Concept familiarity: **Familiar** (This is a core component of the NCERT Class 8 History curriculum, specifically the chapter "Tribals, Dikus and the Vision of a Golden Age").
- Computational complexity: **1** (No arithmetic steps required).
- Common error traps: **Major** (Students often provide vague descriptions of "poverty" or "fighting" without citing "distinct examples" or technical shifts in forest laws/land settlement as required by the prompt).
- Format demand: **High** (Open-ended recall in English. Expressing historical causality and naming specific examples requires higher-order syntax, which is challenging for students with limited English proficiency).
- Number friendliness: **Easy** (No numbers involved).

**Analytical Note:** While the topic is central to the curriculum, the linguistic demand of "explaining" two "distinct examples" in a second language significantly elevates the difficulty for students from Hindi-medium or economically weaker backgrounds. They may understand the concept but struggle to articulate it under a binary scoring rubric (1 mark max) that suggests little room for error.
