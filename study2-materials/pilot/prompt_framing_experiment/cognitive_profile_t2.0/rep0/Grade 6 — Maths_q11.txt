Concept familiarity: familiar (HCF is a core Grade 6 topic, but application in word problems is a higher-order skill)
Computational complexity: 2-3 (Finding factors of 75, factors of 69, and identifying the highest)
Common error traps: major (Students often confuse HCF with LCM; many struggle with the vocabulary "exact number of times")
Format demand: Open-ended/Recall (Requires translating text to a mathematical operation; 0.5 max score suggests binary scoring with little room for partial credit)
Number friendliness: moderate (75 is familiar, but 69 is frequently misidentified as a prime number by students at this level, hindering prime factorization)
