**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar. In the Indian Grade 6 Science curriculum (NCERT), the chapter "Fibre to Fabric" specifically covers the utility of natural fibers. This is also a life-skill concept reinforced at home, given the climate in India.

**Computational complexity:** 1. This is a non-mathematical, conceptual recall and application question.

**Common error traps:** Minor. The primary trap is "functional fixedness," where a student might say "it feels good" or "it is light" instead of identifying a specific *property* like absorption or breathability. 

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). This increases difficulty for students with limited English proficiency. While they may understand the science, constructing the sentence "It absorbs sweat" in English can be a hurdle. However, since the rubric is generous (accepting any one correct property), it mitigates the difficulty.

**Number friendliness:** N/A (Easy/Non-mathematical).

**Contextual Consideration:** Since these students are from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the challenge is not the science (which is highly culturally relevant to their daily lives in a hot climate), but the linguistic encoding of the answer. In most Indian government school grading contexts, even semi-grammatical phrases like "absorb water" or "air passing" would be awarded the mark.
