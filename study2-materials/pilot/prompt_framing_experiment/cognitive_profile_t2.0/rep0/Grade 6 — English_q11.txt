- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The "Present Continuous" tense is a core component of the Grade 6 curriculum in Indian government schools, though students often struggle to distinguish between a single verb and a "verb phrase."
- **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a single-step identification task.
- **Common error traps:** Major. For Hindi-medium students (ESL/ELL), the auxiliary verb "are" is often perceived as a separate entity or a connector rather than part of a unified verb phrase. Common errors include selecting only "playing" (the action) or "are" (the state), or including the object "football."
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). Since the rubric requires identifying the exact phrase "are playing," students must independently decide to include the auxiliary. No partial credit is awarded.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Holistic Estimate:** While the sentence is linguistically simple, the specific metalinguistic requirement to identify a *phrase* (combining the helping verb and main verb) is a common stumbling block for students at this proficiency level who focus primarily on lexical meaning.
