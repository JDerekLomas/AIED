Concept familiarity: familiar (Fractions and the operator 'of' are introduced in Grade 6 and reinforced in Grade 7 NCERT curriculum)
Computational complexity: 2-3 steps (Multiplication followed by comparison of fractions with different denominators)
Common error traps: major (Students often struggle with comparing fractions with unequal denominators, frequently needing to find a common denominator or convert to decimals; some may also incorrectly treat 'of' as addition)
Format demand: High (Requires shown calculations and an exact final comparison; though the rubric is binary, the "Show your calculations" requirement increases the cognitive load)
Number friendliness: moderate (The fractions are simple, but comparing 3/8 and 4/15 requires finding a common denominator of 120 or performing long division)
