- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. Public vs. Private health services is a core chapter in the Class 7 NCERT Social Science curriculum ("Role of the Government in Health"). Students often have direct lived experience with these systems.
- **Computational complexity:** 0 (Non-computational).
- **Common error traps:** Minor. Students may confuse "quality" with "ownership" or provide general statements without the required comparative distinction. However, the contrast between the costs of a government hospital and a private nursing home is a standard classroom example.
- **Format demand:** High. The item requires higher-order cognitive processing (Evaluation/Comparison) rather than simple recognition. For Hindi-medium students with limited English proficiency, articulating two distinct features and an argument in English is a significant barrier, even if they understand the concept. The 1-mark "all-or-nothing" rubric makes it harder to achieve full marks.
- **Number friendliness:** N/A.

**Holistic Estimation:**
The linguistic barrier is the primary bottleneck. While the concept is culturally and academically familiar, the requirement to "evaluate" and "provide valid arguments" in English will lead many students to provide incomplete or grammatically fragmented answers that may not meet the full rubric criteria for a single point.
