### Cognitive Difficulty Profile Analysis

**Concept Familiarity: Very Familiar**
Linear equations in one variable are a core component of the Grade 7 and 8 NCERT curriculum. By Grade 8, students have encountered "transposition" and "balancing" methods multiple times. However, the introduction of negative integers as results remains a hurdle for students with weak foundational arithmetic.

**Computational Complexity: 1 Step**
The item requires a single algebraic operation: subtracting 9 from 4 (transposition). 

**Common Error Traps: Major**
There are two significant traps for this demographic:
1.  **Directionality/Sign Error:** Many students will mistakenly subtract the smaller number from the larger ($9 - 4 = 5$) ignoring the negative sign, or assume the answer must be positive because "distance" or "value" is intuitively positive.
2.  **Additive Inverse Confusion:** Students might add the numbers ($9 + 4 = 13$) due to a lack of conceptual understanding of "undoing" the operation.

**Format Demand: Open-ended**
As a constructed-response item with a 1-point rubric, there is no credit for showing the step $y = 4 - 9$ if the final calculation is incorrect. This increases difficulty compared to a multiple-choice format where -5 would be an option to recognize.

**Number Friendliness: Easy**
The numbers are single digits and well within the mental math range of a Grade 8 student, eliminating calculation fatigue. The difficulty lies entirely in the integer rule, not the magnitude of the numbers.

**Contextual Factors:**
In many Indian government schools, while the procedure of "moving 9 to the other side" is well-drilled, the concept of negative integers remains abstract. Language proficiency (English vs. Hindi medium) is less of an impact here as the mathematical notation is universal.
