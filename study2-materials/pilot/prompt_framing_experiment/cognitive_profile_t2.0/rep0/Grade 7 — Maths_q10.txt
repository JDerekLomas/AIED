- Concept familiarity: familiar (Perimeter and area of rectangles are core Grade 6 and 7 topics in the NCERT curriculum).
- Computational complexity: 4+ (Step 1: Divide perimeter by 2; Step 2: Subtract length to find width; Step 3: Multiply length and width to find area. If using the formula $2(l+b)$, it involves algebraic manipulation).
- Common error traps: major (Confusion between perimeter and area formulas is frequent; students often subtract length from perimeter without dividing by 2 first; the two-part nature of the question—width AND area—means many will stop after finding the width).
- Format demand: Open-ended; no partial credit allowed per the rubric ($1/0$ scoring), increasing difficulty.
- Number friendliness: easy (Even integers, small constants, no decimals).
