Concept familiarity: familiar (Interior and exterior angles of triangles/quadrilaterals are standard in Grade 8, but performance varies based on diagram orientation).
Computational complexity: 2-3 (Requires summing known angles and subtracting from 180° or 360°, plus identifying a linear pair or vertically opposite angle).
Common error traps: major (Students often struggle with "reasons"—the rubric requires stating the geometric property, which is a significant hurdle for students with low English literacy).
Format demand: Open-ended (Recall-based; the rubric requires both the value and the calculation/reasoning for a single mark, allowing no room for partial credit if the explanation is missing).
Number friendliness: easy (Standard geometry problems for this grade typically use multiples of 10 or 5).
