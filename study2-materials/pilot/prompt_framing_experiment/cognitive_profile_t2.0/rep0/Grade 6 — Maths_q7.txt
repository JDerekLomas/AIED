**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Rate of change and temperature are standard Grade 6 concepts in the Indian curriculum (NCERT). However, the specific integration of "elapsed time" across the 12-hour clock (am/pm) adds a layer of conceptual complexity for this demographic.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** (Step 1: Calculate duration from 10 am to 4 pm. Step 2: Multiply 6 hours by 2°C increase. Step 3: Add product to the initial 30°C).
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.** Students from these backgrounds often struggle with the transition from 12:00 to 1:00. Common errors include:
    *   Subtracting 4 from 10 (misunderstanding elapsed time).
    *   Treating "4:00" as the number 4 (resulting in 10-4=6 hours by coincidence or 4 hours total).
    *   Linguistic confusion: Translating "4:00 in the evening" (shaam ke char baje) into the numeric value required for calculation.
*   **Format Demand:** **High (Open-ended).** Since the rubric requires a specific outcome for 1 mark with no mention of partial credit, any procedural slip in the three-step chain results in zero. Recall is harder than recognition (MCQ) for students with limited English fluency.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The numbers (30, 2, 6, 10, 4) are small, whole integers and highly conducive to mental math if the student understands the logic.

**Holistic Estimation**
While the math is simple, the "clock arithmetic" across the am/pm boundary is a notorious hurdle for Grade 6 students in low-resource environments. The English phrasing "per hour" and "time elapsed" can also pose a barrier to those with limited proficiency.
