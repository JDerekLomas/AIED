- Concept familiarity: familiar (Reading comprehension focusing on character motivation and expression is a standard curriculum component for Grade 8, though the abstract nature of "expressing feelings" adds slight difficulty.)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Single-step retrieval and synthesis task.)
- Common error traps: major (Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the distinction between "what" she did and "what it meant" to her. Many may provide a literal answer, such as "She liked to draw," missing the internal/symbolic dimension required by the rubric.)
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall; no partial credit is possible as it is a 0/1 binary item, which significantly lowers the success rate for students with limited English syntax.
- Number friendliness: easy (Non-mathematical item.)
