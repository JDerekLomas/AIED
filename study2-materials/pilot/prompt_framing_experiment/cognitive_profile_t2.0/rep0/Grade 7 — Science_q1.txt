- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (The distinction between clinical and laboratory thermometers is a core part of the NCERT Class 7 Science curriculum, though the reasoning—the 'kink' or 'constriction'—is more challenging than simple identification).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No calculations involved).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse the terms "clinical" and "medical," or fail to explain the 'why' effectively due to limited vocabulary).
- **Format demand:** High (Open-ended recall). This is the most significant hurdle for this demographic. While they may know the answer in Hindi (*doctori thermometer*), the rubric requires specific terminology. Since the max score is only 0.5, partial credit is unlikely for an incomplete "why" section.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (N/A - qualitative question).

**Psychometric Holistic Estimate:**
The cognitive load here is shifted entirely toward **language production** and **recall of specific terminology**. Students from economically weaker backgrounds often lack the English fluency to explain the functional difference (the kink/capillary behavior), even if they understand the concept. Given the 0.5 mark weightage, many may omit the "why" or fail to reach the threshold for the full score.
