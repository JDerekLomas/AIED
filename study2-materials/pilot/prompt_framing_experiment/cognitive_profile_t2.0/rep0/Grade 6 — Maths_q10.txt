**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Standard geometry curriculum for Grade 6; protractor usage is usually introduced in late Grade 5/early Grade 6).
**Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-computational; purely procedural motor skill).
**Common error traps:** Major (The "Protractor Scale Confusion" is highly prevalent. Many students choose the inner/outer scale incorrectly, resulting in drawing a 70° angle instead of 110°—an obtuse vs. acute error. Also, vertex alignment errors are common among first-generation learners with limited precision tools).
**Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires physical manipulation; must be exact within ±2 degrees. In this rubric, 0 or 1 applies, meaning no credit for a mirrored 70° angle).
**Number friendliness:** Easy (Round numbers ending in 0 are easy to find on the scale).

**Socio-educational context:** Students from EWS backgrounds in Indian government schools often face challenges with high-quality geometry toolsets (flimsy or opaque protractors) and limited individual teacher feedback on physical tool manipulation. The obtuse angle (110°) is a significant distractor compared to acute angles.
