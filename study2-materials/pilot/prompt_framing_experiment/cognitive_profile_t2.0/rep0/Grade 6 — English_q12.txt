**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (Opposites/Antonyms are introduced in early primary grades in both Hindi and English curricula).
**Computational complexity:** 1 (Direct retrieval from long-term memory).
**Common error traps:** Minor (Potential spelling errors such as 'douwn' or 'don', though the conceptual link is strong).

**Psychometric Profile Analysis:**
At the Grade 6 level, even in rural or Hindi-medium settings, "up/down" is a foundational vocabulary pair reinforced through basic action songs, classroom commands (sit down/stand up), and bilingual teaching. While spelling can be a minor barrier for students with low literacy, the phonetic simplicity of "down" makes it highly accessible.
