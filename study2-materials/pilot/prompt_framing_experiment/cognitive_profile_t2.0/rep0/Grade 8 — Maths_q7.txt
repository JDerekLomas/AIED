**Concept familiarity:** Less familiar
While division and word problems are core to the Grade 8 curriculum, the concept of "rounding up to the next multiple" to find a "minimum required" amount is a higher-order logical step (constrained optimization) rather than a rote procedural task. Most students are trained to provide a quotient and remainder, not to calculate the deficit needed for the next whole unit.

**Computational complexity:** 4+
The item requires several distinct operations: 
1. Division of 300 by 80.
2. Logical determination of the next multiple (320) and subtracting (320 - 300).
3. Calculating students per class (80 ÷ 8 = 10).
4. Multiplying chocolates per student by students per class (4 × 10 = 40).

**Common error traps:** Major
The phrasing "minimum number of chocolates required" is a significant linguistic trap. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may interpret this as the current total (300) or simply provide the quotient (3) or remainder (60). Additionally, the multi-step nature of the second question introduces multiple points for procedural fatigue or "copying" the wrong dividend.

**Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall)
This is a binary "1 or 0" score (Max 1) for a complex, two-part word problem. Without partial credit, any slip in the logic of the "remainder vs. deficit" or a mistake in the second calculation results in a zero.

**Number friendliness:** Moderate
The numbers are multiples of 10, which helps, but the mismatch between 300 and 80 creates a remainder, which immediately increases the cognitive load for students expecting "clean" results.

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given the language barrier, the complexity of the logical "round-up" step, and the strict rubric with no partial credit, this item is highly difficult for this specific demographic.
