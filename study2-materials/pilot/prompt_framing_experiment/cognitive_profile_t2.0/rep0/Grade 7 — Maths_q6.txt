**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Familiar.** Converting mixed fractions to improper fractions and the basic procedure for multiplying fractions are core components of the Grade 6 and 7 NCERT curriculum. However, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often encounter "Mixed Fractions" as "Mishrit Bhinn," and the conceptual mapping between the two languages is generally stable by Grade 7.
*   **Computational Complexity: 4+ steps.** To reach the final answer, a student must: (1) Convert $1 \frac{1}{2}$ to $3/2$; (2) Convert $3 \frac{1}{4}$ to $13/4$; (3) Multiply numerators ($3 \times 13 = 39$); (4) Multiply denominators ($2 \times 4 = 8$); (5) Perform long division ($39 \div 8$) to convert back to a mixed fraction ($4 \frac{7}{8}$). 
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.** Typical procedural "bugs" in this demographic include: (a) Multiplying whole numbers and fractions separately ($1 \times 3$ and $1/2 \times 1/4$); (b) Adding the denominators; (c) Forgetting the final conversion step back to a mixed fraction as requested by the prompt.
*   **Format Demand:** Open-ended. This requires total recall of the algorithm with no cues. The binary rubric (Max score 1, no partial credit) significantly increases difficulty, as a single slip in the 5-step process results in zero marks.
*   **Number Friendliness: Moderate.** $3 \times 13$ and $39/8$ are not "instant" mental facts for students struggling with numeracy fluency, though the numbers remain below 50.

**Holistic Estimation:**
While the basic procedure is taught, the multi-step nature of the task combined with the requirement to re-convert the answer and the lack of partial credit creates significant "leakage" in the success rate. For students in economically weaker sections where remedial support may be limited, the jump from "knowing the rule" to "perfect execution" is a major hurdle.
