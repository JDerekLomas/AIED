- **Concept familiarity:** Less familiar. (While wars are discussed in history, the transition from narrative history to systemic economic analysis is an abstract leap for Grade 7 learners.)
- **Computational complexity:** 1. (Conceptual linking rather than mathematical calculation.)
- **Common error traps:** Major. (Students often describe physical damage or "winning/losing" rather than specific *economic* impacts like depletion of the treasury, trade disruption, or taxation changes. Linguistic barriers may lead them to describe "what happened" rather than "assess the impact.")
- **Format demand:** Open-ended; high recall demand. In a 1-mark "All-or-Nothing" rubric, students failing to bridge the causal link between war and economics (e.g., just saying "many died") will receive zero despite having some historical knowledge.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. (N/A)

**Estimated Holistic Success Rate:**
The combination of "Assess" (a high-order Bloom's taxonomy verb) and the requirement to isolate an "economic" variable is challenging for students whose primary instruction may be rote-heavy or in a second language. Many will provide narrative descriptions of battles rather than economic outcomes.
