**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Less familiar**. While Grade 7 students are taught decimal division, dividing a whole number by a decimal (divisor < dividend in value, but visually "larger" in digits) is less practiced than simple decimal-by-integer division. The reversal of the "smaller number inside" intuition is a barrier.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps**. First, the student must shift the decimal point (equating to $80 \div 72$); second, they must perform long division or simplify the fraction ($\frac{10}{9}$); third, they must deal with the recurring decimal outcome ($1.11...$), which adds significant complexity for a 0.5-mark question.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major**. Students in this demographic often struggle with the "placeholder zero." Common errors include:
    1.  Dividing $7.2$ by $8$ instead of $8$ by $7.2$ (resulting in $0.9$).
    2.  Misplacing the decimal (answering $0.11$, $11.1$, or $0.9$).
    3.  Truncation errors (stopping at $1.1$ without understanding the recurring nature).
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended**. Since this is likely a short-answer format, students must recall the algorithm without cues. In Hindi-medium contexts, "decimal" ($dashamlav$) division is often perceived as a "high-difficulty" procedure compared to fraction arithmetic.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Hard**. $72$ is not a "friendly" divisor (like $2, 4,$ or $5$). It leads to a repeating fraction ($\frac{10}{9}$), which is non-terminating. Students from EWS backgrounds with limited coaching often feel "stuck" when a division doesn't result in a clean, terminating decimal.

**Holistic Estimate**
Given the linguistic barrier (worded instructions in English) and the high procedural friction of recurring decimals, the success rate for a fully correct answer is low.
