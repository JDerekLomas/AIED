**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar.** The Unitary Method is a core pillar of the Grade 6 and 7 SCERT/NCERT curriculum. Real-world contexts involving petrol and distance (mileage) are highly relatable to students, as these terms are common in everyday Indian household discourse.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** Students must first perform a division (55 ÷ 5) to find the unit rate (mileage), and then a multiplication (11 × 12) to find the final distance.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** The most likely procedural bug is "inverse operations" (multiplying when they should divide) or forgetting to answer the second part of the prompt ("Find how much mileage..."). However, because the rubric awards 1 mark based on the final distance (132 km), the internal step of finding the mileage usually guides the student correctly.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended/Exact.** Since it is an open-response question with a binary rubric (0 or 1), students cannot rely on elimination (as in MCQs). For this specific student demographic, expressing the steps in English might be a barrier, but the mathematical logic is often less affected by English proficiency.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The numbers (5, 55, 12, 11) are "friendly." 55 is a clear multiple of 5, and the 11-times table is one of the easiest for students to recall or compute.

**Estimated Success Rate:**
The task is highly procedural and the arithmetic is low-stress. While the binary rubric (no partial credit) slightly penalizes students for "silly" calculation errors, the conceptual alignment with the "Mileage/Unitary Method" ensures high engagement even for students with limited English proficiency.
