**Concept familiarity:** Very familiar (The Harappan Civilization is a core, recurring pillar of the Grade 6-8 NCERT Social Science curriculum).
**Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical item).
**Common error traps:** Minor (Potential for confusion with other ancient civilizations like Mesopotamia or mixing up "citadel" and "lower town," but core features are generally distinct).
**Format demand:** Open-ended/Recall (Requires expressive language; while no partial credit is offered in a 1-point rubric, the open-ended nature increases difficulty for students with low English proficiency).
**Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative question).

**Psychometric Profile Analysis:** 
In Indian government schools, students are highly trained in rote recall for "high-frequency" historical topics. However, because these students are from Hindi-medium backgrounds and economically weaker sections, the linguistic barrier of describing a feature in English—rather than simply identifying it in a multiple-choice format—presents a significant challenge. While the concept is "Very familiar," the productive language demand suppresses the success rate for the "fully correct" criteria required by the rubric.
