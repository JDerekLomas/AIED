- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Agriculture is a core theme in Class 7 Science, specifically under 'Nutrition in Plants' and 'Soil' chapters).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No calculations; qualitative reasoning only).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse "nutrients" with "water/irrigation" or generic "pest control"; some may fail to specify the specific elements N-P-K required by the rubric).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (High demand; requires spontaneous recall and synthesis of technical terms like "Nitrogen" or "Manure" in English, which poses a significant hurdle for students from Hindi-medium/low-resource backgrounds).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Qualitative/No numbers).

**Analysis:** While the concept of adding manure/fertilizer is grounded in their lived experience (especially for students from rural backgrounds), the specific rubric requirement to mention Nitrogen, Phosphorus, or Potassium is the primary "bottleneck." Limited English proficiency often makes retrieving specific technical terms more difficult than explaining the general concept in a native language.
