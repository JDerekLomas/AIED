**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar.** Comparing and ordering numbers up to four digits is a core competency introduced in earlier grades (Grade 3-4) and reinforced heavily in the first chapter of the Grade 6 NCERT curriculum ("Knowing Our Numbers").
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1 step.** The process requires a single comparative pass based on the number of digits and the value of the leading placeholders. No arithmetic calculations (addition/subtraction) are required.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** The main trap for Grade 6 students is a "left-to-right" digit comparison bias, where they might miss that "736" has only three digits while the others have four. However, since the rubric specifically awards credit for identifying the smallest number, the distinct digit count makes the task easier.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended/Partial Credit.** The question requires arranging the full set, but the specific rubric provided focuses only on identifying and correctly placing the smallest number for 0.5 marks. This "all or nothing" for the smallest number lowers the difficulty threshold compared to a perfect sequence of four.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Moderate.** The numbers do not have repeating digits or "mirror" numbers (e.g., 3367 vs 3637) which would increase the cognitive load for students with lower literacy levels. The lead digits (3, 5, 7, 4) are distinct and in a non-sequential order, aiding quick identification.

**Contextual Analysis (Rural/Hindi-Medium Context):**
While English proficiency is limited, "Ascending Order" (बढ़ते क्रम / आरोही क्रम) is a foundational term frequently drilled in vernacular mediums. The visual/symbolic nature of numbers transcends the language barrier. Given the rubric focuses specifically on identifying 736 (the only 3-digit number) as the smallest, even struggling students are likely to succeed.
