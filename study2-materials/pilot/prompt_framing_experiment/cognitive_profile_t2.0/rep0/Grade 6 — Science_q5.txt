- **Concept familiarity**: **Familiar** (Starch testing is a staple experiment in the Class 6 NCERT Science curriculum, specifically in the chapter "Components of Food." Most students would have seen this as a demonstration or a diagram.)
- **Computational complexity**: **1** (Zero arithmetic/algebraic steps required; it is a purely qualitative procedure.)
- **Common error traps**: **Major** (Many students struggle with specific chemical vocabulary; they may remember "putting a liquid" but forget the name "iodine," or confuse the color change with the test for proteins (copper sulphate/caustic soda).)
- **Format demand**: **High** (The open-ended nature requires active recall and sentence construction in English. Since the rubric allows 1 mark with no partial credit, failing to name the reagent or describe the specific color change—blue-black—results in zero.)
- **Number friendliness**: **Easy** (N/A; no numbers involved.)

**Holistic Analysis**: While the concept is central to the curriculum, the linguistic barrier is the primary constraint. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle to bridge the gap between "concept understanding" and "precise English expression." Writing "Iodine solution" and "blue-black" requires specific retrieval that many under-resourced students find difficult without rote memorization.
