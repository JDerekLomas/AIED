- Concept familiarity: Very familiar (Commonly taught in Class 3-6 textbooks)
- Computational complexity: 1 (Linear task of composing sentences)
- Common error traps: Major (Tense inconsistency, subject-verb agreement, and transliteration errors from Hindi to English)
- Format demand: Open-ended/Recall; high demand because the 1-point rubric is binary ("all or nothing") with no partial credit allowed.
- Number friendliness: N/A

In a binary (0 or 1) scoring system where any grammatical failure to "clearly mention" components results in a zero, many students will fail to reach the threshold despite knowing the content.
