**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity: Familiar.** By Grade 8 in the Indian curriculum (NCERT/State Boards), the properties of parallelograms (opposite angles are equal, adjacent angles are supplementary) are central themes. However, students from weaker backgrounds often struggle to transition from identifying properties to articulating them as formal "reasons."
*   **Computational Complexity: 2-3 steps.** To find both $x$ and $y$, the student must perform two distinct logical steps: applying the supplementary angle rule ($180 - 70$) and the opposite angle rule (equality), or two sets of subtractions.
*   **Common Error Traps: Major.** For these specific learners, the "explanation" requirement is a significant barrier. They may calculate the value correctly but lack the English vocabulary to state "adjacent angles are supplementary" or "linear pair," leading to a failed rubric requirement. Additionally, a common bug is assuming all angles in a quadrilateral are $90^\circ$.
*   **Format Demand: High.** The rubric requires a "maximum score of 1" for finding the value *and* giving an explanation. Because it is binary (0 or 1), a student who finds $x = 110$ but cannot explain it in English/written form loses the mark entirely. This "all-or-nothing" demand is high for ESL students.
*   **Number Friendliness: Easy.** Assuming a standard base angle like $70^\circ$, calculations involve multiples of 10, which are mentally manageable for most students.

**Estimated Success Proportion**
The combination of requiring a written explanation and the lack of partial credit significantly suppresses the expected pass rate for this specific demographic.
