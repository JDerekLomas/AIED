**Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Adaptations in deserts are a core part of the Grade 6 Science NCERT curriculum and are frequently discussed in environmental contexts in India.)

**Computational complexity:** 1 (Non-mathematical/Conceptual.)

**Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse adaptations with those of aquatic plants or use non-scientific terminology. A common "bug" is the misconception that cactus spines are thorns for protection rather than modified leaves to prevent water loss, but the rubric is broad enough to accept general water-saving mechanisms.)

**Format demand:** Open-ended. Requires recall and the ability to articulate a biological "reason." Since it is a descriptive question, students with Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle to find the specific English terminology (e.g., "succulent" or "transpiration"), though the rubric allows for simple descriptions (e.g., "small leaves").

**Number friendliness:** N/A

**Analysis:** While the topic is heavily taught, the demand for a written explanation in English poses a significant barrier for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. The rubric is generous (requiring only one feature), which aids the success rate, but the lack of scaffolding (compared to a multiple-choice question) reduces the expected performance.
