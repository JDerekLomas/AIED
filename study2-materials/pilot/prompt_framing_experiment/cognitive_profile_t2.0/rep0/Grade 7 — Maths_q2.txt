### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

**Concept familiarity: Familiar**
Linear equations are a core component of the Grade 7 NCERT/State Board syllabus. Students typically start with "hit and trial" methods before moving to formal transposition. While familiar, the abstract nature of "finding x" remains a cognitive leap for many students in rural or underserved schools.

**Computational complexity: 2-3 steps**
The item requires two distinct algebraic operations:
1. Inverse addition (Subtraction: $10 - 2$)
2. Inverse multiplication (Division: $8 / 4$)

**Common error traps: Major**
For this demographic, common procedural "bugs" include:
*   **Operation Confusion:** Adding 2 to 10 ($4x = 12$) instead of subtracting.
*   **Inversion Error:** Subtracting 4 from 8 ($x = 4$) instead of dividing.
*   **Coefficient Misconception:** Treating $4x$ as $4 + x$ or $41x$.

**Format demand: Open-ended (Recall)**
This requires constructive response rather than recognition (Multiple Choice). For students from economically weaker sections, a lack of scaffolding or options often leads to leaving the space blank if the first step is forgotten. Per the rubric, only an exact answer ($x = 2$) scores, increasing the difficulty compared to items with partial credit.

**Number friendliness: Easy**
The integers are small and result in a whole number. This minimizes barriers related to fraction/decimal arithmetic, allowing the focus to remain on algebraic logic.

**Holistic Estimate**
While the math is "simple" on paper, the linguistic transition to English-language math terminology and the procedural rigidity of algebra often result in a significant "drop-off" in accuracy for students in Hindi-medium or low-resource contexts.
