- Concept familiarity: familiar (The story "Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy is a staple in Grade 7 NCERT curriculum and most State Boards in India).
- Computational complexity: 1 (Minimal, qualitative mapping of intent to outcome).
- Common error traps: major (The phrasing of the question contains a grammatical error: "Why the king felt" instead of "Why did the king feel." This can confuse English Language Learners who rely on syntactic cues for comprehension. Additionally, students often confuse the "Three Questions" with the actual answers given later in the story).
- Format demand: Open-ended requires recall and synthesis in a foreign language. Although the rubric says "1 mark," writing 2-3 grammatically correct sentences in English is a high bar for students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds. Partial credit is likely needed but not specified in the rubric.
- Number friendliness: easy (Not applicable).

Holistic Estimate:
The requirement to produce 2-3 coherent sentences in English is the primary barrier for this demographic. While the story is familiar, the "Explain" command often leads to students copying unrelated lines from the passage or providing single-word answers that do not meet the 1-point criteria under strict rubrics.
