- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar. The properties of magnets are introductory in Grade 6 Science (NCERT/State boards), and most students have seen or played with magnets.
- **Computational complexity:** 1. This is a purely qualitative recall and application task with no math required.
- **Common error traps:** Minor. The main trap is "sign reversal" (confusing "repel" with "attract"). However, the physical intuition of like poles pushing apart is usually strong.
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Recall). While the concept is simple, the requirement to produce the English word "repel" or the phrase "push away" is a barrier for students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds. Partial credit is not possible per the rubric (Score: 1), making it an all-or-nothing task.
- **Number friendliness:** Easy. No numbers involved.

**Holistic Estimation:** While the physical concept is highly intuitive, the English language proficiency requirement is the primary filter. Students might know the physical result but struggle to express "repel" accurately in English. However, since "push away" is accepted, the threshold for success remains relatively accessible.
