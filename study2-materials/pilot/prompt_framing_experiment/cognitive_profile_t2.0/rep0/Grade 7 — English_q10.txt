### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

*   **Concept familiarity: Less familiar**
    While "Direct/Indirect Speech" is introduced in the Grade 7 curriculum (NCERT/State Boards), it remains one of the most abstract and least "mastered" topics for English Language Learners (ELL) in government schools. The shift from present continuous to past continuous involves internalizing multiple grammar rules simultaneously.
*   **Computational complexity: N/A** (This is a linguistic task; however, the cognitive equivalent is **3-4 transformations**: pronoun change (I to she), tense shift (am to was), conjunction insertion (that), and punctuation removal.)
*   **Common error traps: Major**
    Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with "tense backshifting." Common errors include:
    *   Tense mismatch (e.g., *She said that she is reading...*)
    *   Pronoun confusion (e.g., *She said that I was reading...*)
    *   Syntactic errors in using the "that" clause.
*   **Format demand: Open-ended**
    Requires full recall of the transformation rules and productive writing skills. Unlike Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs), there is no visual cue to trigger the correct tense shift. In many government school grading systems, any error in the verb form or pronoun results in 0 marks, as the item is treated as "binary" for grammar accuracy.
*   **Number friendliness: N/A** (Linguistic complexity: Moderate. The vocabulary—"reading," "novel"—is simple, but the structural transformation is cognitively heavy.)

**Holistic Estimate:**
Given the demographic profile, the heavy reliance on rote memorization over applied grammar in these settings often results in students correctly identifying the change needed but failing to execute all the transformations (especially the tense shift) simultaneously.
