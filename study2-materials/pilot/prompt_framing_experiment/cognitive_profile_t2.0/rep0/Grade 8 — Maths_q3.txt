### Cognitive Difficulty Profile

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** Basic probability (favorable outcomes over total outcomes) is introduced in Grade 7 and reinforced in Grade 8 NCERT curricula. Most students recognize the "bag and balls" scenario as a standard textbook example.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **2-3 steps.** Students must (1) sum the balls to find the denominator ($4 + 6 = 10$), (2) identify the numerator ($4$), and (3) express it as a fraction ($4/10$). A further step of simplification ($2/5$) or decimal conversion ($0.4$) is often required depending on the classroom standard.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** The most common error is the "ratio trap" ($4:6$), where the student uses the number of white balls as the denominator instead of the total. For students with limited English proficiency, confusing the color requested ("black") with the other color mentioned is also possible.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** The question requires recall and construction of the fraction rather than recognition (as in MCQ). Since the rubric requires a single score (0 or 1), no partial credit is given for just identifying "10" or "4," making it harder for struggling learners.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** The numbers sum to a perfect base-10, making division and probability conceptualization mentally accessible.

**Holistic Estimate:** 
The linguistic load is low (short sentence, simple vocabulary), but for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, "random" and "probability" are key academic terms that may cause friction if they haven't been adequately bridged to "yadrichhik" (यादृच्छिक) and "prayikta" (प्रायिकता). However, the arithmetic simplicity usually compensates for this.
