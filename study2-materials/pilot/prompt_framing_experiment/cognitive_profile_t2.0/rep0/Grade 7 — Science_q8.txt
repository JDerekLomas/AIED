**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Familiar.** The study of natural indicators (turmeric, hibiscus, litmus) is a core component of the Grade 7 NCERT/State Board Science syllabus (Chapter: Acids, Bases and Salts). While the theory is standard, the application requires identifying two distinct color changes, which adds slight complexity.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1.** There is no mathematical computation involved.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Major.**
    1.  **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may know the concept (हल्दी - Turmeric) but struggle to articulate the procedural steps in English.
    2.  **Color Confusion:** It is a very common misconception/memory bug to swap the color changes (e.g., thinking turmeric turns red in acid).
    3.  **Neutral Blindness:** Students often forget that a "no change" result (yellow) indicates acid/neutral, focusing only on the active change (red).
*   **Format Demand:** **High (Open-ended).** This requires "Active Recall" and "Procedural Writing." Unlike a Multiple Choice Question where colors are provided, students must recall the specific colors and the logic from memory. With a 1-point max score and no partial credit mentioned in the "Maximum score" constraint, an incomplete explanation results in a zero.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **N/A.** Qualitative response.

**Analysis:** While the topic is frequently taught, the combination of low English proficiency and the high memory load of specific color-indicator pairs for two different substances makes this item difficult for students from economically weaker sections. Most will likely identify the red change for turmeric but fail to provide a complete "determination" logic for both substances in English.
