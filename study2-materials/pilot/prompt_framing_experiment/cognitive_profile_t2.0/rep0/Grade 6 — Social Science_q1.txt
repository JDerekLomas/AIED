**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar**. The physical geography of India, specifically the Himalayas, is a cornerstone of the Grade 6 NCERT Social Science curriculum ("The Earth: Our Habitat"). Students often encounter these terms in both Geography and History (as natural barriers) across multiple grades.
*   **Computational Complexity:** **1**. This is a purely retrieval-based task involving no calculation.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor**. While students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the English spelling of "Himalayas" or "Aravalli," the core error trap is the confusion between a "mountain range" and a "peak" (e.g., naming Mount Everest or K2 instead of the range). However, for the demographic, phonetically recognizable answers are usually accepted.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended/Recall**. The student must recall names rather than recognize them from a list. Partial credit is technically possible if the student provides one name (per the rubric, though the question asks for two), but the low maximum score (0.5) suggests it is treated as a simple knowledge-retrieval bit.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy**. No numerical processing required.

**Estimated Performance**
Despite limited English proficiency, the names of Indian mountain ranges are common cognates in Hindi and English (e.g., *Himalaya Parvatmala*). Because the curriculum emphasizes these features as fundamental to Indian identity, even students from economically weaker sections show high retention for this specific geographical fact. The requirement of "any two" allows students to choose the most familiar ones.
