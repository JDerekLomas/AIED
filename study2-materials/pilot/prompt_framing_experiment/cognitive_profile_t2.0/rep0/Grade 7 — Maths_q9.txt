- Concept familiarity: **Familiar** (The concept of unitary method/multiplication is introduced early, but the application to mixed fractions is the core Grade 7 challenge.)
- Computational complexity: **2-3** (1. Conversion of mixed fraction $5 \frac{3}{4}$ to improper fraction $\frac{23}{4}$. 2. Multiplication by 10. 3. Division/Simplification to decimal or final fraction.)
- Common error traps: **Major** (Many students struggle with the conversion of mixed numbers; some may erroneously add $10$ and $5 \frac{3}{4}$ due to language barriers; others may ignore the fraction $3/4$ entirely and simply multiply $10 \times 5$.)
- Format demand: **Recall/Exact** (Based on the rubric, while it asks for identification of the operation, the max score of 1 usually implies a correct final product. In this demographic, "showing work" is often more successful than producing a final accurate number.)
- Number friendliness: **Moderate** (Multiplying by 10 is easy, but the denominator 4 does not divide 10 evenly, leading to a decimal or simplified fraction $230/4 = 57.5$. This creates a significant hurdle for students with low computational fluency.)

Holistic Estimate: While the logic is simple, the combination of mixed fractions and "non-friendly" division typically results in a high error rate in government school settings where English language word problems often mask the underlying math.
