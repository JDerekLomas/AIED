- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Standard reading comprehension task involving storybook motifs common in Grade 6 curriculum).
- **Computational complexity:** 0 (Non-mathematical task).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students may confuse "who" with "where" or "what"; phonetic spelling errors of 'magical' or 'fairy' are likely given Hindi-medium backgrounds).
- **Format demand:** Open-ended (Requires active recall and sentence construction; though the rubric allows for short phrases, students with low English proficiency often struggle with retrieving specific vocabulary like 'fairy' compared to multiple-choice recognition).
- **Number friendliness:** N/A

**Holistic Estimate:**
The item requires direct retrieval from a text. While the concept is simple, the "language barrier" is the primary hurdle. Hindi-medium students often understand the story but struggle to produce the specific English nouns required for an open-ended response without a word bank. Spelling errors in "fairy" are a significant bottleneck for a "fully correct" binary score.
