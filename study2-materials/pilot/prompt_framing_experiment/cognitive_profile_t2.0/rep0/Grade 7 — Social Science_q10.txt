- **Concept familiarity:** Familiar (Ashoka is a central pillar of the Grade 6/7 History curriculum, specifically the Mauryan Empire; students usually recognize the Kalinga War and Dhamma).
- **Computational complexity:** 1 (No mathematical operations required; purely narrative).
- **Common error traps:** Minor (Students often confuse "Ashoka" with "Akbar" due to similar phonetic qualities or generalize his "significance" as merely being a "good king" without citing specific policy aspects like Dhamma or Pillars).
- **Format demand:** High (Open-ended, requires active recall and sentence construction in English. Since the rubric mandates a maximum score of 1 without specified partial credit for single points, it functions as a "fully correct or nothing" binary).
- **Number friendliness:** Easy (Dates/statistics are not strictly required by the rubric).

**Analysis of context:** For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds in economically weaker sections, the barrier is rarely the historical concept (which is often taught vividly). The barrier is the "explain" command in English. Moving from a mental map of Ashoka to a written English explanation of "transformation of kingship" or "ethical governance" involves a high linguistic load that often leads to incomplete or grammatically broken responses that fail to meet the "accurate explanation" threshold of the rubric.
