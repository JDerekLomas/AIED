**Cognitive Difficulty Profile**

*   **Concept Familiarity:** **Very familiar.** At the Grade 6 level in Indian government schools, antonyms (opposites) are a core part of the foundational vocabulary syllabus. "Slow/Fast" is one of the most basic pairings introduced in primary grades (Classes 3–4).
*   **Computational Complexity:** **N/A (1).** No arithmetic steps are required. The task is a direct 1:1 lexical retrieval.
*   **Common Error Traps:** **Minor.** Students may understand the concept but face spelling challenges (e.g., "fastly" or "pust") or provide a synonym (e.g., "quick" or "speed"). Given the socioeconomic and linguistic context, the shift from a Hindi-thought concept (*tej*) to the English word *fast* is a common mental bridge.
*   **Format Demand:** **Open-ended.** The question requires recall rather than recognition (Multiple Choice). This increases difficulty slightly as students must retrieve the word from memory and spell it correctly. However, the rubric accepts "fast," which is a high-frequency, simple phonetic word.
*   **Number Friendliness:** **Easy.** Not applicable in a linguistic sense, but the word length is short and phonetically regular, which is "friendly" for Hindi-medium learners.

**Holistic Estimate**
While these students face significant linguistic barriers, "slow/fast" is frequently reinforced through classroom instructions and rhymes. The transition to Class 6 marks a phase where basic functional adjectives are usually internalized, though spelling accuracy remains the primary hurdle for some.
