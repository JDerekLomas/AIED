Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Correctly identifying that the image on the currency is a "Lion Capital" or related to "Ashoka."
2. Association/Contextualization: Linking the physical image to the concept of a "National Emblem."
3. Syntactic Translation: Formulating the response in English (or Hindi if permitted, though the prompt implies English medium testing) to explain the *origin* (Ashoka) and the *status* (National Emblem).
4. Goal-Condition Satisfaction: Matching the specific requirements of the rubric (Ashoka + National Emblem) rather than providing a common-sense or literal interpretation (e.g., "Lions represent strength").

Step 2: Systematic procedural "bugs"
1. Literalism Bug: Providing an aesthetic or literal explanation instead of a historical one ("Because lions are the king of the jungle," "Because they look brave").
2. Identification Error (Visual): Misidentifying the lions as simple drawings or the National Animal (Tiger) rather than the specific Ashokan Capital.
3. Label Mixing Bug: Confusing "National Emblem," "National Animal," and "National Symbol" due to language interference.
4. Recall-to-Recognition Gap: In a multiple-choice format, they might recognize "Ashoka," but in an open-ended recall format, the specific proper noun "Lion Capital of Ashoka" often fails to be retrieved.
5. English Proficiency Barrier: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may know the concept (Rashtriya Chinh) but cannot produce the technical English terminology required for the rubric's "Correct identification."

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students are often just beginning to distinguish between ancient history facts and modern national symbols. In economically weaker section (EWS) contexts, textbook-heavy rote memorization is common, but the leap from seeing a coin/note to recalling a specific historical pillar (the Sarnath capital) is cognitively demanding without scaffolding (visual aids or options).

Step 4: Holistic analysis
The rubric requires a two-part identification (Ashoka + National Emblem). Many students will provide only one part or a generic answer. Given the English language barrier and the shift from rote recognition to open-ended explanation, the success rate is likely low.
