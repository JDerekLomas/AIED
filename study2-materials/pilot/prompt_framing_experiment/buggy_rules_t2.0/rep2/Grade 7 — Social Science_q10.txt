Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the academic English "significance," "reign," and "aspects" into conceptual equivalents (likely in Hindi/hinglish).
2. **Historical Retrieval**: Access the schema for "Ashoka" from long-term memory (Kalinga War, Dhamma, Edicts).
3. **Categorization**: Filter general facts to identify "significance" (long-term impact) rather than just biographical data.
4. **Structural Composition**: Select two distinct points and link them to the overarching "transformation."
5. **English Syntax Construction**: Express the complex causal relationship between the Kalinga war, Buddhist conversion, and governance in written English.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **Fact-Significance Blur**: Replacing "significance" (why it matters) with simple biographical facts (e.g., "His father was Bindusara").
2. **Topic Matching**: Retrieving everything known about the name "Ashoka" (the "data dump") without filtering for "two key aspects."
3. **Translation-Equivalence Error**: Misinterpreting "significance" as "signal" or "sign" (literal translation error common in ELL learners).
4. **The "Causal Gap" Bug**: Stating the change (e.g., "He stopped fighting") without explaining the significance to Indian history (e.g., "Ethical governance").

Step 3: Population/Context considerations
Grade 7 students from these backgrounds often rely on rote memorization from NCERT textbooks. While the content is familiar, the command word "Explain the significance" is high on Bloom’s Taxonomy. English proficiency acts as a bottleneck; students might understand the history but lack the productive vocabulary to articulate "impact" vs. "events." An open-ended recall format is significantly more difficult than a multiple-choice recognition task.
