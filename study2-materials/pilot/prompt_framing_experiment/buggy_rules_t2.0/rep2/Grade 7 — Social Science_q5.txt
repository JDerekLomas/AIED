Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the specific sequence of the "Rock Cycle" sub-process (Igneous to Sedimentary).
2. Retrieve the concept of "weathering/breaking down" as the causal mechanism.
3. Retrieve the concept of "erosion/transportation/deposition" as the movement mechanism.
4. Translate these internal concepts into English academic vocabulary (e.g., "sediment," "weathering").
5. Synthesize the causal chain into a coherent sentence structure.

Step 2: Potential "Buggy Rules"
- Shortcut Bug: "Cycle Equals Change." (Students state rocks change into each other without explaining *how*, failing the "describe" constraint).
- Terminology Confusion: Interchanging "Sedimentary" with "Metamorphic" due to phonological or conceptual similarity.
- Skipping the Intermediate State: Stating igneous rocks turn directly into sedimentary rocks through "heat and pressure" (over-generalizing the metamorphic process to all rock transformations).
- Linear Completion: Assuming all rocks must become Magma first before becoming something else.
- L1-L2 Translation Error: Using "broken pieces" (Hindi: *tukde*) but failing to map it to the technical term "sediments" or "weathering" required for formal marks.

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 7 students are at a stage where concrete operational thought transitions to formal operational thought. In economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency, the "Double Burden" exists: the student may understand the geological process but lacks the "Linguistic Capital" to execute the specific vocabulary required by the rubric. Open-ended recall is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice recognition for this demographic.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is foundational, the combination of required multi-step causality, technical English vocabulary, and the "no partial marks" (1 or 0) scoring system significantly lowers the success rate. Many students will provide a vague answer that lacks the specific mechanisms of breaking down and moving.
