Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode and comprehend the English-language question prompt.
2. Skim/scan the poem to identify semantic clusters related to "importance" or "value."
3. Distinguish between concrete objects mentioned in the poem and abstract "thematic" priorities.
4. Synthesize these elements into a coherent sentence in English.
5. Apply the "theme over evidence" rule (as per the rubric) to determine that an abstract summary is sufficient.

Step 2: Buggy rules / systematic errors
1. **Literalist Bug**: Students identify the most frequently mentioned noun as the "most important thing" rather than the underlying theme.
2. **First-Line Bias**: Assuming the most important thing is always located in the opening lines.
3. **Pattern Matching (Hindi-English Interference)**: Mapping Hindi syntax onto English, resulting in fragmented responses that fail to convey "agreement with themes."
4. **Copy-Paste Strategy**: If a student cannot synthesize, they copy a random line containing "friend," even if the syntax makes it an incorrect answer to "what is the most important thing?"
5. **Over-extension of Prior Knowledge**: Answering based on personal values (e.g., "Family is important") rather than the text provided.

Step 3: Target student population considerations
- **ESL/Low English Proficiency**: Grade 6 students in these contexts often struggle with the transition from word-level recognition to conceptual synthesis in a second language.
- **Open-Ended vs. MCQ**: Without distractors to guide them, students often leave the field blank or write a single word ("Friendship"), which might not meet the "agreement with themes" rubric threshold for full marks depending on the strictness of the grader.
- **Socio-economic context**: Limited exposure to academic English outside the classroom reduces the likelihood of complex inferential reasoning in English.
