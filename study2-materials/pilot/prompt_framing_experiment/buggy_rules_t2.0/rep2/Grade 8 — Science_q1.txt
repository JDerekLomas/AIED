Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Observe and Compare:** Identify the visual evidence provided (green/dark patches) and interpret the temporal progression (growth over time).
2.  **Concept Retrieval:** Map the visual description ("green patches on bread") to the scientific category of microorganisms, specifically fungi/mould.
3.  **Linguistic Encoding:** Formulate a technical response in English (or the language of assessment) that meets the rubric's specific demand for "mould," "fungi," or "microorganisms."

Step 2: Identified Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1.  **Attribute-over-Agent Bug:** Focusing on the physical appearance rather than the causal agent (e.g., answering "It got old" or "Color change" instead of naming the fungus).
2.  **Language Interference Bug:** Mapping the concept to a local term (e.g., "Ullli" in Hindi) but failing to translate it to the English scientific term required by the school's grading system.
3.  **Incomplete Model Bug:** Attributing the change to external debris (dirt/dust) rather than biological growth (fungal spores/mycelium).
4.  **Colloquial Simplification:** Using vague terms like "rotten" or "bad" which, depending on the strictness of the rubric's application in high-stakes testing, may be marked incorrect if "fungi/mould" is the specific target.

Step 3: Target Population Analysis
Students from economically weaker sections in Grade 8 often have rich informal knowledge of food spoilage but face a significant "academic gap." The open-ended format is more demanding than multiple choice because it requires active recall and correct spelling of scientific terminology. For students transitioning from Hindi-medium or dealing with limited English proficiency, the cognitive load of translating a familiar phenomenon into an "official" scientific answer is high.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the reliance on specific terminology in an open-ended format and the known linguistic barriers for this specific demographic, a significant portion of students will understand the phenomenon but fail to provide the exact technical keywords required for a full mark.
