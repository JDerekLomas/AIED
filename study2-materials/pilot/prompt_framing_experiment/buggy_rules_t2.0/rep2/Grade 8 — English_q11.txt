Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval/Conceptualization: Identifying a specific subject (the tree) and retrieving relevant sensory and cultural details.
2. Translation (L1 to L2): Formulating thoughts in Hindi (or mother tongue) and translating them into English.
3. Syntax and Sentence Construction: Constructing 5-6 grammatically cohesive sentences in English (SVO order, tense consistency).
4. Lexical Access: Selecting specific vocabulary for "appearance" (bark, trunk, branches) and "importance" (sacred, gathering, shadow).
5. Discourse Organization: Arranging sentences into a single paragraph that addresses all three rubric constraints (Appearance, History, Meaning).

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. The "Negative Transfer" Bug: Applying Hindi syntax to English sentences (e.g., "Tree old my village in is").
2. The "Keyword Association" Bug: Writing isolated words or phrases instead of full sentences because the student understands the concept but cannot bridge the grammatical gap.
3. The "Completion vs. Quality" Bug: Writing any 5-6 sentences about a tree to satisfy the length requirement while ignoring the specific prompts (Appearance/History).
4. The "Limited Vocabulary Compensation" Bug: Using high-frequency but imprecise words (e.g., "It is big," "It is good") which may fail to meet "descriptive" standards.
5. The "Code-Switching" Bug: Reverting to Hindi words written in Roman script for specific nouns (e.g., "Chaupal," "Pooja").

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 8 students in EWS/Hindi-medium contexts often face a "bottleneck" where their conceptual understanding (knowing the tree's history) far exceeds their English production capacity. Open-ended production is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice recognition. In these settings, a 5-6 sentence paragraph with three distinct content requirements is a high-order task.

Step 4: Estimate
Considering that the maximum score is only 1 point, many teachers may be lenient, but the procedural complexity of producing 5-6 correct English sentences addressing three specific thematic constraints is very high for this demographic.
