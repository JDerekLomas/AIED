Step 1: Specific procedural steps:
1. Decoding the text to identify the mathematical operation (Division) despite linguistic barriers.
2. Mapping "equal number" to the quotient and "minimum number... required" to the subtraction/remainder logic.
3. Performing the multi-digit division: 112 ÷ 10.
4. Correct interpretation of the quotient (11) as the number of pencils per box.
5. Interpretation of the remainder (2) or finding the gap to the next multiple (8) depending on how the ambiguous phrasing "minimum number of pencils required" is parsed.

Step 2: Known "buggy rules":
1. "Zero-place bug": Dividing 112 by 10 and getting 11.2, but struggling to convert the decimal back to the physical count of "leftover" pencils.
2. "Ignoring the Remainder": Focusing only on the quotient (11) and ignoring the secondary question regarding the "minimum required."
3. "Keyword Association Error": Seeing "minimum" and "equal" and attempting a subtraction or LCM/HCF operation instead of division.
4. "Rounding error": Misinterpreting "minimum number of pencils required" as the total needed to fill boxes to the next increment (120 - 112 = 8) versus the minimum to distribute what they have (110).

Step 3: Target population considerations:
Grade 6 students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker sections often struggle with the English phrasing of "minimum number of pencils required," which is linguistically complex (it could be interpreted as "How many do they *need* to be equal?" or "How many total?"). In this population, division by 10 is relatively accessible, but word-problem synthesis in a second language is a significant barrier. The open-ended format lacks scaffolds present in multiple-choice.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis:
While the calculation (112/10) is simple, the semantic ambiguity of the question—asking for "minimum number of pencils required" (is it 112, 110, or 8 more?) alongside "how many are there in each box"—will lead to high error rates in synthesis, even if the division is performed correctly.
