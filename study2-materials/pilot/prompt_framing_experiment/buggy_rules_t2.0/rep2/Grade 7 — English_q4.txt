Step 1: Specific Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English syntax of the question, specifically identifying the auxiliary verb "Do you think" and the central noun "king's questions."
2. Retrieve the narrative content of the story "Three Questions" (Leo Tolstoy) to identify what the three specific questions were (Time, People, Action).
3. Evaluate the abstract thematic utility of these questions in a contemporary "real life" context.
4. Formulate a logical "Reason" in English that links the king's questions to human behavior or decision-making.
5. Apply English grammar and syntax rules to output a written response (Subject + Verb + Object/Complement).

Step 2: Identify Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. The Literal Association Bug: Students identify "questions" and "king" but instead of evaluating their importance, they simply list the three questions (Recall instead of Evaluation).
2. The Agreement Bug: Answering "Yes" or "No" without the required "Reason," missing the second half of the procedural prompt.
3. The Translation Layering Bug: Formulating a complex reason in Hindi (e.g., "zindagi mein sahi samay pe kaam karna zaroori hai") but failing to map it to English structures, resulting in a fragmented "Right time work" output that may not meet rubric standards for "giving a reason."
4. The Concept Substitution Bug: Substituting the King's specific philosophical questions with generic ideas of royalty or power because "King" is a high-salience word.

Step 3: Target Population Analysis
Grade 7 students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds face a high cognitive load when an item is open-ended. Unlike multiple-choice questions (recognition), this requires production. The transition from decoding the story to meta-analysis ("in real life") requires a high level of Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP) which is often underdeveloped in transition-phase students.

Step 4: Holistic Estimation
The open-ended nature of the question, combined with the necessity of both conceptual evaluation and English production, creates a high failure rate. Many students will likely write "Yes" or "Yes I think so" without a valid reason, or provide a reason in broken English that may not satisfy the "one reason" requirement of the rubric.
