Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the term "factors" (distinguishing it from multiples).
2. Systematic divisibility testing (starting from 1, checking 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.).
3. Mental or scratch-pad division (e.g., 68 ÷ 4 = 17, 68 ÷ 2 = 34).
4. Recognition of "factor pairs" to ensure no numbers are missed between 4 and 17.
5. Multiplication table recall (identifying 17 × 4).
6. Listing the complete set without omissions.

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
- Multiples for Factors: Student lists 68, 136, 204...
- The "First Few" Bug: Listing only 1, 2, 4 and stopping (incomplete search).
- The Parity Bias: Missing the prime factor 17 because the student only tests low even numbers and ignores non-standard table products.
- Calculation Error: Dividing 68 by 4 and getting 12 or 16 due to weak long division.
- Terminology Confusion (Hindi/English): Confusing *Gunankhand* (factors) with *Gunaj* (multiples).

Step 3: Population Considerations
In Grade 6 (approx. 11-12 years old), "Factors and Multiples" is a foundational but often misunderstood topic. For students in low-resource schools, mastery of 2-digit division and fluency with multiplication tables beyond 10×10 (specifically the 17 table) is statistically low. The open-ended format is significantly harder than a multiple-choice format because it offers no "cues" to the presence of 17 and 34.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While 1, 2, 4, and 68 are relatively easy to identify, 17 and 34 are high-threshold factors. 17 is a prime number not commonly encountered in basic memorized tables (1–10). In a recall-heavy, open-ended task with a population often struggling with foundational arithmetic, the omission of at least one factor (usually 17 or 34) is the most probable outcome.
