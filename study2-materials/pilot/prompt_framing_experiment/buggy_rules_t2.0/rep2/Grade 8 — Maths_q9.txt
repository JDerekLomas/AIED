To analyze the cognitive demands of this item for the specified population, we look at the procedural and linguistic load:

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. **Discount Calculation:** Calculate 10% of ₹1200 ($1200 \times 0.1 = 120$).
2. **Determine Selling Price (SP):** Subtract discount from Marked Price ($1200 - 120 = 1080$).
3. **Understand Profit Relationship:** Identify that SP ($1080$) represents 108% of the Cost Price (CP).
4. **CP Formula Application:** Execute the algebraic or arithmetic step $CP = (SP \times 100) / (100 + \text{Profit}\%)$.
5. **Arithmetic Execution:** Compute $1080 / 1.08 = 1000$.

**Step 2: Buggy Rules and Misconceptions**
*   **Additive/Subtractive Bug:** Students often treat percentages as fixed units. A common error is calculating $10\% - 8\% = 2\%$ and applying a 2% discount/profit to the MP.
*   **Base Rate Error:** Calculating 8% of the *Marked Price* or *Selling Price* and subtracting it, rather than understanding that profit is a percentage of the *Cost Price* (the unknown).
*   **Reverse Percentage Bug:** Applying a 92% "discount" logic to get from SP back to CP instead of dividing by 1.08.
*   **Linguistic Mapping:** Confusion between "Marked Price," "Selling Price," and "Cost Price" when translated from Hindi (Ankit mulya, Vikray mulya, Kray mulya) to English-medium testing contexts.

**Step 3: Population Considerations**
In Grade 8, "Profit and Loss" is a peak difficulty topic. For students in economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency, multi-step word problems suffer from "decoder fatigue." Even if a student calculates the SP (1080), they frequently stall at the second stage because the relationship between SP and CP involves a variable in the denominator. 

**Step 4: Holistic Assessment**
While the rubric only awards the point for the SP ($1080$), the question asks for the "Cost Price." In many government school assessments, a student who stops at $1080$ fails to satisfy the final prompt despite reaching the rubric's benchmark. The gap between recognizing a 10% discount and correctly navigating the 8% profit inverse-calculation is significant for this demographic.
