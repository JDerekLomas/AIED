Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Visual Recognition: Correctly identify the activity (deforestation/tree cutting) and the context (environmental damage) from a 2D line drawing or low-quality print.
2. Conceptual Retrieval: Access the scientific term "Deforestation" or a functional equivalent from long-term memory.
3. Logical Linking: Associate the sustained absence of trees with specific long-term consequences (global warming, soil erosion, habitat loss, or lack of rain).
4. Linguistic Translation: Formulate these scientific concepts into English sentences or phrases, overcoming the barrier of Hindi-to-English translation.
5. Synthesis: Write down the responses in a way that aligns with a broad but specific rubric within the time limit.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Cognitive/Systematic Errors)
- The "Immediate Effect" Bug: Identifying only immediate consequences (e.g., "no wood," "no fruit") instead of the "sustained" environmental consequences (climate change/oxygen depletion) requested by the word "conditions."
- The "Picture Naming" Bug: Only naming the objects (tree, axe) rather than the process (deforestation/cutting).
- The "Linguistic Interference" Bug: Translating a Hindi concept into English literally, leading to incoherent syntax that may be marked wrong despite correct underlying knowledge.
- The "Ambiguous Referent" Bug: Using vague terms like "It is bad for nature" without specifying the "consequences" demanded by part (b).

Step 3: Student Population Context
- Grade 8 students in this demographic often have the conceptual knowledge in their mother tongue but struggle with English academic language (CALP).
- Open-ended questions are significantly harder than multiple-choice for this group due to the "retrieval failure" and the anxiety of writing in a non-native language.
- "Sustained for a long time" is a complex linguistic construction (conditional/passive) that may be misread by students with limited English proficiency.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account that students must answer both (a) and (b) correctly to satisfy the prompt, the difficulty of English production, and the necessity of shifting from concrete observation to abstract consequence:
