Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Correctly identify the meaning of "Hobby" and select a personal activity.
2. Structure Formulation: Construct a 4-5 sentence sequence that meets the three topical constraints (what, when, why).
3. Syntactic Mapping: Translate thoughts into English syntax (Subject-Verb-Object).
4. Morphological Application: Apply correct verb tense (simple present/continuous) and subject-verb agreement.
5. Lexical Precision: Use vocabulary relevant to the specific hobby.
6. Orthographic execution: Correct spelling and punctuation (capital letters, periods).

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic procedural errors)
1. "Formulaic Template Substitution": Replacing personal response with a memorized but irrelevant paragraph (e.g., writing "My Best Friend").
2. "Transliteration Bug": Mapping Hindi syntax (SOV) directly onto English (SVO), resulting in "My hobby gardening is."
3. "Base Form Only Rule": Dropping "is/am/are" or third-person "s" (e.g., "I like play cricket," "He play football").
4. "Thematic Abandonment": Listing items or words instead of writing full sentences.
5. "Condition Neglect": Answering "what" and "why" but omitting the temporal "when."

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students from EWS backgrounds often experience "the fourth-grade slump" in English where the shift from decoding to comprehension/composition occurs without sufficient scaffolding. Given the maximum score of 1, the rubric is likely binary (all or nothing), meaning any significant grammatical breakdown or missing prompt element results in a score of 0. For many, English is a foreign language practiced only in school, leading to high "affective filters" and low output during open-ended recall tasks.
