Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Retrieve the specific vocabulary term "clinical thermometer" from long-term memory.
2. Recall the structural difference between a clinical and laboratory thermometer (presence of a 'kink' or 'constriction').
3. Articulate the functional purpose of that feature (preventing the backflow of mercury/retaining reading).
4. Translate these scientific concepts into English sentences (given the English-medium test/Limited English Proficiency context).
5. Map the multi-part answer to a very low-stakes reward (0.5 marks), requiring sustained motivation for a complex response.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules" and Cognitive Errors
- Semantic Overgeneralization: Using the generic term "Doctor's thermometer" or just "thermometer" (bug: assuming the category name is the specific name).
- Structural-Functional Confusion: Correctly identifying the thermometer but failing to explain "why," or providing a circular reason (e.g., "because it is for humans").
- Phonetic/Orthographic Approximation: Spelling "clinical" or "laboratory" incorrectly in a way that may be penalized or reflect poor encoding.
- The "Mercury Bug": Attributing the difference to the type of liquid used (mercury vs. alcohol) rather than the physical structure (kink).
- Language-Switching Cost: The student understands the "Kink" concept in Hindi (मोड़/किंक) but lacks the English academic register to explain it.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 7 students from EWS backgrounds often face a "vocabulary gap." While they likely understand the practical use of a thermometer, the "why" component of this question requires "decontextualized language use." In Indian government schools, Science is often a transition subject where students move from rote-learning names to explaining mechanisms. The lack of English fluency is a significant barrier for an open-ended "Why" question compared to a multiple-choice format.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The low mark value (0.5) for a two-part cognitive task (Identify + Explain) often leads to incomplete answers. The combination of linguistic translation and the specific technical recall needed for the "kink" explanation will result in high error rates.
