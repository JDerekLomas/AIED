Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Language Decoding: Translate the English prompt into Hindi/native language to understand the conceptual requirement (key features/salient characteristics).
2. Concept Retrieval: Access the specific schema for "Constitution" from long-term memory.
3. Item Discrimination: Filter general knowledge about India (e.g., "Capital is Delhi") from specific legal/political features of the Constitution.
4. Recall and Selection: Identify at least one specific technical term (Secularism, Federalism, etc.) without the aid of a word bank.
5. Transcription/Expression: Write the term correctly in English (or understandable phonetic English) to meet the rubric requirements.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. Categorical Over-extension: Students often confuse "Features of the Constitution" with "Rights of Citizens" or "Symbols of India" (e.g., answering "Tiranga" or "National Anthem").
2. Translation Glitch: Mapping the Hindi "Dharm-nirpekshta" to the English "Secularism" often fails due to limited vocabulary, leading to blank answers despite conceptual understanding.
3. Spelling Sensitivity: Students may fear incorrect spelling and avoid technical terms like "Parliamentary" or "Judiciary," opting for simpler but incorrect descriptive sentences.
4. Definitional Collapse: Providing a definition of a constitution (e.g., "It is a rule book") instead of a "feature" as per the prompt’s structural demand.

Step 3: Target Population Analysis
Grade 8 students from these backgrounds often struggle with high-stakes academic vocabulary in English. However, because the rubric is extremely generous (only requiring "any one" feature and allowing for simple recall like "Fundamental Rights"), the cognitive load of synthesis is reduced. The primary barrier is the shift from Recognition (MCQ) to Recall (Open-ended).

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the low threshold of the rubric (1 point for any 1 feature) increases success probability, the English-language barrier and the necessity of specific technical recall (vs. general description) create a significant hurdle for this specific demographic.
