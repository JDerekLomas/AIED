Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Read the table headers and identify the "Time Taken" column.
2.  Decode the values (numbers and units) in the column.
3.  Recall/reason that in the context of "fastest," a lower numerical value for time indicates higher speed.
4.  Execute a numerical comparison of three values (find the minimum).
5.  Map the minimum value back to the corresponding "Liquid" column.
6.  Transcribe the correct label (Liquid A or Petrol) as the answer.

Step 2: Systematic procedural errors (Buggy Rules)
1.  "Greater is Better": Choosing the largest number (Salt Solution) because the word "fastest" is cognitively associated with magnitude/larger numbers (a common interference in inverse proportionality).
2.  Unit/Context Ignorance: Comparing the digits without understanding that "Time" operates inversely to "Rate."
3.  Scanning Error: Picking the first or last item in a list regardless of value.
4.  Vocabulary Barrier: If the prompt is in English, confusing "evaporate" with "boil" or "dissolve," though this is less likely to affect part (a) if the table is clear.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds often possess strong functional reasoning but struggle with "school language" and academic abstractions. While identifying the smallest number is a basic skill, the linguistic mapping of "Fastest = Lowest Time" is a frequent pitfall for students who may have had disrupted schooling or limited exposure to English-medium standardized testing logic. The open-ended format removes the 33% chance of a guess.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that finding the "fastest" involves an inverse relationship (less time), approximately 30-40% of students in this demographic typically fall into the "Greater is Better" buggy rule trap. However, because comparing three numbers is a lower-level task than the explanation required in (b), the success rate for (a) will be significantly higher than for (b).
