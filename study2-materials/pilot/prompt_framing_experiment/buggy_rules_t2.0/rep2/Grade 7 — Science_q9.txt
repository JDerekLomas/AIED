Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Read and decode the English prompt ("pitcher plant," "trap-like," "mode of nutrition").
2.  Retrieve the specific classification category (Insectivorous/Heterotrophic) from long-term memory.
3.  Recall the precise biological terminology "Insectivorous."
4.  Transliterate/Write the term "Insectivorous" (mapping Hindi-medium phonetics to complex English spelling: I-n-s-e-c-t-i-v-o-r-o-u-s).
5.  Link the mechanism (trapping) to the deficiency (Nitrogen) to justify why a photosynthetic plant traps insects.
6.  Retrieve a secondary example from the same conceptual category (e.g., Venus Flytrap, Drosera).

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic errors)
1.  **Over-generalization Bug**: Labeling the mode of nutrition simply as "Heterotrophic" or "Parasitic" (mis-categorizing types of specialized nutrition).
2.  **Linguistic Substitution Bug**: Providing the answer in Hindi (Keetbhakshi) or phonetic English-Hindi (Keedakhane wala), which might not meet the strict English rubric.
3.  **Spelling Phonetic Bug**: Inventing spellings like "Insectivorus" or "Insectvor" which may be marked wrong in a rigid grading environment.
4.  **Surface-level Association Bug**: Thinking because the plant is green, the answer to (a) is "Autotrophic," ignoring the "special" qualifier in the prompt.
5.  **Teleological Bug**: Reasoning for part (b) that it traps insects "to be stronger" or "for fun" rather than for specific nutrient (Nitrogen) acquisition.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds face high cognitive load in retrieving "Insectivorous." In Indian government school contexts, specialized vocabulary in English is often a major barrier even when the concept is understood. Open-ended recall is significantly more difficult than MCQ formats for this demographic.

Step 4: Holistic estimation
While students likely understand the concept of a plant eating insects, the triple requirement of recalling the specific English term "Insectivorous," explaining nitrogen deficiency, and providing a second English name (Venus Flytrap) creates a high "failure-at-any-point" probability.
