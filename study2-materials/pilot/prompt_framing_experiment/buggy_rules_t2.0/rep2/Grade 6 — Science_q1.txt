Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English text: Understand that "North pole" and "another bar magnet" refer to specific physical entities.
2. Conceptual retrieval: Recall the fundamental law of magnetism (like poles repel, unlike poles attract).
3. Condition mapping: Match the input "North-North" to the "Like-Like" rule.
4. Language production: Formulate the result ("repel" or "push away") in English.
5. Transcription: Write the response accurately.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "Opposites attract, therefore North attracts North": Misapplying the vocabulary of attraction to "same-to-same" pairs.
2. "Magnetic Neutrality": Assuming that since poles are the same, nothing happens (zero force).
3. "All-purpose magnetism": Believing that magnets simply "stick" to everything magnetic regardless of polarity.
4. "Phonetic Retrieval Error": Mixing up "Repel" and "Attract" due to limited English vocabulary or linguistic interference.

Step 3: Student Population Factors
1. Language barrier: Students may understand the physical concept but lack the English term "repel."
2. Socio-economic context: Potential lack of hands-on laboratory experience; reliance on rote memorization of textbook sentences.
3. Open-ended format: No multiple-choice cues means higher cognitive load for retrieval versus recognition.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
While the concept is foundational, the combination of translating a text-heavy English question, avoiding the common "all magnets stick" misconception, and recalling the specific English word "repel" creates significant friction for this specific demographic.
