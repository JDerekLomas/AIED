To analyze this item through the lens of mathematical cognition and systematic errors:

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. Extract numerical values ($l=5, w=4, s=5$) and associate them with correct shapes.
2. Recall the area formula for a rectangle ($A = l \times w$).
3. Recall the area formula for a square ($A = s^2$ or $s \times s$).
4. Execute multiplication for rectangle ($5 \times 4 = 20$).
5. Execute multiplication for square ($5 \times 5 = 25$).
6. Compare the two products to identify the larger value ($25 > 20$).
7. Calculate the difference (Subtraction: $25 - 20 = 5$).
8. Apply correct units (sq.cm), though often overlooked in scoring.

**Step 2: Buggy Rules and Cognitive Slips**
*   **Formula Confusion (Area vs. Perimeter):** Students often confuse the boundary with the surface. A common bug is $P = 2(l+w)$ or $4s$, leading to answers like "Rectangle is larger (18 vs 20)" or "Both are 20."
*   **Additive Logic for Multiplication:** Calculating square area as $5+5=10$ or $5 \times 2 = 10$.
*   **Keyword Neglection:** Focusing only on "greater area" and failing to execute the "by how much" (missing the subtraction step).
*   **Language Barrier Interference:** In Hindi-medium backgrounds, the distinction between "length/width" and "side" might be clear, but the English phrasing "Which of the two..." adds a layer of reading comprehension difficulty.

**Step 3: Population Considerations**
In Grade 6 (the transition to formal geometry), procedural fluency with area is often fragile. In low-resource settings, while rote memorization of multiplication tables is often high, the conceptual link between a "square" and its area formula is frequently brittle. Because the question is open-ended, there are no distractors to "prime" the correct method, requiring pure retrieval.

**Step 4: Holistic Assessment**
While the multiplication is simple ($5 \times 4$, $5 \times 5$), the multi-step nature (Calculate A -> Calculate B -> Compare -> Subtract) creates several "failure points." Many students will stop after identifying the Square is larger, or fail to correctly distinguish the square area from a perimeter calculation. Given the socio-economic context and language transition, "Buggy Rules" related to perimeter/area confusion and formula retrieval are highly prevalent.
