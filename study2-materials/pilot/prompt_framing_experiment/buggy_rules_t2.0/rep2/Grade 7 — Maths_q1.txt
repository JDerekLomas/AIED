Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Recall/identify the arithmetic operation required (multiplication).
2.  Perform the absolute value multiplication ($3 \times 4 = 12$).
3.  Recall the sign rule for multiplication (sign identity: same signs result in a positive).
4.  Apply the sign rule to the result ($12$ remains $12$, or written as $+12$).

Step 2: Common "buggy rules"
1.  **Additive Sign Rule Application:** Students confuse multiplication rules with addition rules (e.g., "negative plus negative is negative, so negative times negative must be negative").
2.  **Absolute Difference Bug:** Students see the signs and operator but revert to an addition/subtraction mindset (e.g., $(-4) - (-3) = -1$ or $|-4| - |-3| = 1$).
3.  **Operator Overlook:** Misinterpreting the multiplication sign as an addition or subtraction sign due to the presence of parentheses.
4.  **Symbol Fatigue:** Ignoring the negative signs entirely and simply focusing on the numerals ($3 \times 4$).

Step 3: Student population considerations
*   **Grade 7 Context:** This is the year integer operations are typically solidified; however, students in low-resource settings often struggle with the transition from natural numbers to the set of integers.
*   **Linguistic/Conceptual barrier:** The phrase "Find the value of" in English might be less familiar than direct computation instructions in Hindi (मान ज्ञात कीजिए), though the notation itself is universal.
*   **Open-ended recall:** Unlike multiple-choice, there is no "correct" cue to trigger the rule, making the "Additive Sign Rule" bug highly prevalent.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While the computation $3 \times 4$ is high-mastery for 7th graders, the interference between addition and multiplication sign rules is a notorious bottleneck. In these specific demographics, systemic pedagogical focus often relies on rote memorization of "minus-minus equals plus," but students frequently misapply this to addition $(-3) + (-4) = +7$ or vice versa $(-3) \times (-4) = -12$. The error rate for sign application in multiplication is statistically significant among students in under-resourced schools.
