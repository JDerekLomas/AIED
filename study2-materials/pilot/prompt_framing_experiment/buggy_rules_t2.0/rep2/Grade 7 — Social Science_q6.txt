Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Decoding/Translation: Correctly translate the academic English terms "significance" (importance/mahattva) and "subcontinent" (upmahadveep) into their conceptual equivalents.
2.  Recall: Retrieve geographic facts regarding the Himalayas (e.g., climate barrier, source of rivers, defense barrier).
3.  Filter/Select: Select facts that specifically apply to the *Indian subcontinent* as a whole (geopolitical/geographical context).
4.  Linguistic Synthesis: Construct a coherent sentence in English (or the required medium) that links the feature (e.g., height) to its impact (e.g., blocking cold winds or monsoon rainfall).
5.  Constraint Satisfaction: Ensure at least two distinct points are provided to meet the plural "points" in the prompt (even though the rubric curiously mentions "one distinct point" for the 1 mark).

Step 2: Buggy rules
1.  Keyword Matching Bug: Searching for the word "Himalayas" in memory and outputting a rote definition ("Himalayas mean abode of snow") rather than explaining "significance."
2.  Association-Translation Displacement: Mistaking "subcontinent" for "continent" or "state," leading to overly narrow or broad answers.
3.  Vague Impact Bug: Identifying a feature but failing to state its impact (e.g., "There are many rivers" without saying they provide water/fertile soil).
4.  The "List Bug": Providing a list of attributes (height, length, snow) without explaining why they are *significant* to the region.
5.  Translation-Constraint Bug: Using Hindi syntax in English, which can lead to semantic ambiguity that fails to satisfy a strict rubric (e.g., "Himalaya protect India from China" — valid, but "Himalaya is very big and beautiful" — invalid).

Step 3: Population factors
1.  Limited English proficiency leads to "concept-rich but language-poor" responses that may be marked incorrect if they lack technical clarity.
2.  Students from EWS backgrounds often rely on rote-memorized bullet points from low-quality "guides" or "guess papers" rather than conceptual geographic understanding.
3.  The open-ended format is significantly more difficult for this demographic than multiple-choice questions due to the high "retrieval effort" required.
