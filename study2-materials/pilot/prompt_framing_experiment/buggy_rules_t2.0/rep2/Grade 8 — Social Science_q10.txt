Step 1: List specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English sentence structure "the process through which..." and "eventually became..." into conceptual understanding.
2. **Contextual Retrieval**: Locate the "East India Company" (EIC) schema within the history of British colonialism.
3. **Strategic Mapping**: Identify the transition point from economic actors (traders/factories) to political actors (rulers).
4. **Keyword Extraction**: Identify specific terminology required by the rubric (e.g., "traders," "factories," "business").
5. **Constructive Production**: Formulate a written sentence in English (a L2/L3 for this cohort) that links the "trader" origin to the outcome of "ruling."

Step 2: Identify systematic "buggy rules"
1. **The Nominalization Bug**: Treating "East India Company" as a person or a single king rather than an entity, leading to confusion about how a "company" can rule.
2. **The Goal-Action Swap**: Concluding that because they *became* rulers, they must have *arrived* as invaders (failing the "initially traders" requirement).
3. **The Narrative Leap**: Jumping straight to 1947 or general "British Rule" without acknowledging the transition from trade to territory.
4. **Vocabulary Generalization**: Using "soldier" or "king" instead of "traders" or "merchants" because those are more salient concepts for "ruling."

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 8 students in EWS contexts often struggle with "open-ended recall" in English. While the rubric only requires a 1-point mention of their status as "traders," the complexity of the question phrasing ("Describe the process...") suggests a multi-step task that exceeds the simple retrieval required by the rubric. Students may produce long, broken-English descriptions of battles (Plassey/Buxar) but fail to explicitly state the starting premise (traders) required for the point.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that the rubric is actually quite "shallow" (only requiring the mention of their arrival as traders) compared to the "deep" prompt (describing a complex historical process), many students will likely write a few sentences about "The British" or "Wars" while missing the specific requirement to define their initial status. Linguistic barriers significantly increase the "miss" rate in EWS/Hindi-medium cohorts for open-ended English items.
