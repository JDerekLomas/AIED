Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Parse the English sentence to identify the core task (recall a specific geographic feature and its location).
2. Distinguish "landforms" from other geographical categories (e.g., rivers, cities, climate).
3. Retrieve from long-term memory a specific landform associated with Rajasthan (Aravalli or Thar).
4. Select one specific name from the recalled list.
5. Retrieve descriptive facts associated specifically with that landform.
6. Formulate an English sentence to "briefly describe" the chosen landform.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. **The "Everything is a State" Bug:** Mistaking cities (Jaipur, Udaipur) for landforms due to stronger mental association.
2. **The "Number Agreement" Bug:** The prompt uses "the one major landforms" (grammatical error). Students may interpret the plural "s" and the word "one" as a signal to list several features or a single mismatched category.
3. **The "English Translation Constraint":** Having the correct concept in Hindi (Marusthal/Pahad) but being unable to bridge the lexical gap to "Thar Desert" or "Aravalli Range" in English.
4. **The "Definition/Description Confusion":** Providing a generic definition of a desert/mountain instead of a specific description of the Thar/Aravallis.
5. **The "Association Substitution":** Describing the *culture* or *climate* (hot, camels, colorful clothes) rather than the physical *landform* characteristics.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Low English Proficiency:** Students in these schools often understand the geography but fail to translate that knowledge into a scored English response.
2. **Low-Stakes Rubric vs. High-Stakes Effort:** The maximum score of 0.5 points provides little incentive for a multi-step descriptive task; students may skip it or provide a single-word answer, failing the "describe" part of the rubric.
3. **Open-ended Recall:** This is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice for this demographic.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the grammatical ambiguity of the question ("one... landforms"), the dual-task requirement (name AND describe) for a very low point value (0.5), and the language barrier for ESL learners in EWS contexts, a significant portion of students will likely provide an incomplete or incorrect answer.
