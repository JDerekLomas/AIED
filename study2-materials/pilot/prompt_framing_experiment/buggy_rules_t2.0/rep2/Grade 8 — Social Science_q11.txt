Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English prompt into Hindi/native conceptual framework, specifically identifying the keyword "colonial" and linking it to "British rule" and "tribal."
2. **Contextual Retrieval**: Access specific historical schemas regarding Grade 8 Social Science topics (e.g., forest laws, shifting cultivation, or traders/moneylenders).
3. **Generalization Formulation**: Synthesize a "general impact" statement as per the rubric (loss of autonomy/livelihood).
4. **Differentiation/Selection**: Identify and isolate "two distinct examples" (e.g., the 1865 Forest Act and the restriction on Jhum cultivation).
5. **English Synthesis**: Reconstruct the conceptual response back into an English written format that satisfies the rubric's "clear explanation" criteria.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **Term Matching Bug**: Identifying "British" and "Tribal" but ignoring "Colonial rule," leading to anachronistic answers about current tribal issues.
2. **Generic Negative Bias Bug**: Providing a generic "it was bad/unhappy" response without citing specific impacts on land or forests, failing the "distinct examples" requirement.
3. **Example/Impact Conflation**: Providing two examples but failing to provide the general explanatory framework required by the "Explain how" command.
4. **Vocabulary Substitution Bug**: Using "Tribal" and "Poor people" or "Farmers" interchangeably, losing the specific historical nuance of forest-dwellers.

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 8 students from low-resource backgrounds often face "cumulative deficit" in literacy. While they may understand the history conceptually (often taught via storytelling), the jump from "recognition" (MCQs) to "open-ended recall" in a second language (English) is significant. The requirement for "two distinct examples" increases the cognitive load significantly compared to a single-recall item.

Step 4: Holistic estimation
While the rubric is somewhat generous for a 1-point question, the multi-step process of retrieving two distinct historical examples and formulating an explanation in English—given the linguistic and socio-economic context—creates a high threshold for "full correctness" (scoring the full 1 point).
