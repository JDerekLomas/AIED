Step 1: List the specific procedural steps:
1. Lexical retrieval: Correctly interpreting the terms "Archaeological," "Literary," and "Differentiate" despite English language barriers.
2. Recall of definitions: Retrieving the conceptual categories from long-term memory (physical remains vs. written records).
3. Contrastive Mapping: Framing the response to show a distinction (differentiation) rather than just listing facts.
4. Categorical assignment of examples: Selecting a valid specific instance for each category (e.g., coins vs. books).
5. Linguistic encoding: Expressing these concepts in a written sentence that satisfies the rubric requirements.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules":
1. The "Examples as Definition" bug: Providing only examples (e.g., "pottery and books") without defining the nature of the sources.
2. The "Over-extension" bug: Classifying inscriptions as "Literary" because they contain writing, rather than "Archaeological" because they are material remains.
3. The "Synonym Error": Treating "archaeological" as a synonym for "old" and "literary" as a synonym for "true" or "school-related."
4. The "Single-side" bug: Defining one term accurately but ignoring the other, or providing one example but forgetting the second.
5. The "Vocabulary Blank": Skipping the question entirely due to the phonological complexity and length of the word "Archaeological."

Step 3: Student population considerations:
Grade 6 is the transitional year for history in Indian schools (moving from general environmental studies to distinct disciplines). For Hindi-medium students in EWS contexts, the technical academic English used in this rubric represents a "double burden" of content and language. The rubric is "all or nothing" (1 mark for both definitions and both examples), leaving no room for partial credit, which severely penalizes students who know the concept but fail on a sub-step.
