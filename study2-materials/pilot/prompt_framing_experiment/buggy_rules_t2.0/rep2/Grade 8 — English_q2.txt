Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English text to locate the specific scene (sunset context).
2. Distinguish between auditory (sounds) and visual/tactile information in the text.
3. Formulate an answer that specifically maps "bird sounds" or "chirping" to the act of "returning to nests."
4. Translate internal thought (likely in Hindi) into a syntactically correct English sentence or phrase.
5. Apply specific vocabulary (e.g., "chirping," "nests," "twilight") required to meet the rubric's specific "bird sound" threshold.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. **Sensory Mapping Bug:** Students often provide any descriptive detail from the scene (e.g., "The sun was red") rather than isolating the *auditory* stimulus requested.
2. **Translation L1 Interference:** Students may use the literal "The birds are coming home" instead of "sounds could be heard," missing the functional requirement of the prompt.
3. **Keyword Over-reliance:** Students search for words like "sound" in the text; if the text says "The birds chirped," but doesn't use the word "sound," they may skip it entirely (The Literal-Match Bug).
4. **Generalization Bug:** Providing a general answer like "Nature sounds" or "Birds" which may fail to meet the specific "returning to nests" contextual requirement of the rubric.

Step 3: Student Population context
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face "the low-attainment trap." While they may comprehend the story in their L1, the shift from "recognition" (MCQ) to "recall/production" (open-ended) is a significant cognitive hurdle. The linguistic distance between their colloquial English and the formal rubric requirements often results in answers that are partially correct in spirit but technically "incorrect" according to rigid grading keys.
