Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recognize that the divisor contains a decimal.
2. Apply the "Compensation Principle" (equivalent fractions): multiply both numbers by 10 to transform $8 \div 7.2$ into $80 \div 72$, or convert $7.2$ to $\frac{72}{10}$ and use the "keep-change-flip" rule for fractions ($8 \times \frac{10}{72}$).
3. Perform the division: identify that $72$ goes into $80$ once with a remainder of $8$.
4. Reintroduce decimal division/long division for the remainder: add a decimal point to the quotient and a zero to the remainder.
5. Recognize the repeating pattern ($80$ appearing again) or provide a rounded/fractional result.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. **The "Whole Number Blindness" Bug**: Treating the numbers as $72 \div 8$ because it yields a cleaner, more familiar whole number result (Result: 9).
2. **Decimal Displacement Bug**: Simply removing the decimal without adjusting the dividend (Result: $8 \div 72 = 0.11$).
3. **Divisor-Dividend Swapping**: Inverting the division because students are habituated to "larger number divided by smaller number."
4. **Subtraction Bias**: Students see the "dot" and 8 and 7, performing $8 - 7.2 = 0.8$.
5. **Ignoring the decimal during setup**: Setting up long division as $7.2 \overline{) 8}$ and treating $7.2$ as $72$, but forgetting to move the decimal in the dividend (Result: 0.11).

Step 3: Student Context
At the Grade 7 level in EWS contexts, transition from whole number arithmetic to rational numbers is often a site of significant cognitive load. Limited English proficiency often results in students relying on rote memorization of algorithms (mechanistic processing) rather than conceptual understanding of "relative size." Open-ended formats exacerbate this, as there are no "anchor" options to signal that an answer of '9' (the most common error) is incorrect.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the "closeness" of the digits (8 and 7.2) which frequently triggers the "smaller from larger" or "approximate to 1" heuristics, and the specific difficulty of dividing by a decimal divisor (a significantly harder cognitive task than dividing a decimal by a whole number), the success rate is historically low in this specific demographic.
