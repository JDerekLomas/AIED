Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Internalize the prompt: Understand the roles (Sender: Student, Receiver: Grandmother) and the specific dual communicative intent (expressing affection/longing and making a request).
2. Content retrieval: Retrieve/generate vocabulary related to "missing" (miss, remember, love) and "visiting" (come, home, visit).
3. Syntactic construction: Formulate sentences using correct tense (Present Simple/Continuous for "miss") and imperative or modal structures for the request ("Please come," "Will you visit?").
4. Message conventions: Apply basic structural markers (Salutation: "Dear Grandma," Closing/Signature).
5. Orthography and Grammar: Apply correct spelling and punctuation to ensure the message is legible and meets the rubric's "clear expression" criteria.

Step 2: Identified "Buggy Rules"
1. Template Mismatch: Students may treat "Message" as a formal letter or an application (due to heavy rote-memorization of formal letter formats), leading to inappropriate addresses or "Subject" lines that waste cognitive load.
2. Translation Literalism: Thinking in Hindi and translating directly (e.g., "Grandmother, you come" instead of "Please visit"), leading to awkward or "unclear" syntax.
3. Aspectual Bug: Using the present simple "I miss you" as a static label or failing to differentiate "miss" (the feeling) from "lost" (due to L1 interference with terms like *khona* vs *yaad karna*).
4. Request/Command Confusion: Using bare imperatives ("Come soon") which might be interpreted as impolite in English instruction but are common in direct L1 translation, potentially failing the "clear expression" of a request.
5. Vocabulary Sparsity: Reverting to "I am fine" (a rote-learned response) rather than addressing the specific prompts of missing/visiting.

Step 3: Target Population considerations
The Grade 7 students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker sections often possess "recognition" of English vocabulary but lack "productive" fluency for open-ended prompts. In Indian government school contexts, writing is often taught through copying rather than composition. An open-ended task with no word-bank significantly increases the risk of "blank page" syndrome or severe grammatical breakdown. However, the rubric is relatively lean (binary 0 or 1), which may favor students if the evaluator accepts "broken English" that still conveys the core message.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement to execute both communicative functions (missing and visiting) in a language they primarily treat as a subject of rote memorization rather than a tool for communication, many students will miss one of the two criteria or produce unintelligible syntax.
