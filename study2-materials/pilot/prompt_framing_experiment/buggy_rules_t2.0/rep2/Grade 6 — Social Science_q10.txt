Step 1: Specific Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the English prompt (linguistic decoding).
2. Retrieve specific schema for "Rajasthan" geography/culture from long-term memory.
3. Recall and list two distinct nouns that qualify as fairs or festivals in that specific region (e.g., Pushkar Mela, Gangaur).
4. Select one item from the retrieved list to expand upon.
5. Identify a "main attraction" or "significance" attribute associated specifically with that item.
6. Synthesize this information into a grammatically coherent English sentence (sentence construction).

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. **Scope Over-generalization**: Naming pan-Indian festivals (Diwali, Holi) that are celebrated in Rajasthan but are not "specific" to it, failing the "of Rajasthan" constraint.
2. **List-Completion Bug**: Providing the two names (the easier recall task) but omitting the descriptive sentence (task saliency bias).
3. **Attribute Misalignment**: Associating the attraction of one festival with the name of another (e.g., "In Holi, camels are traded").
4. **Translation-Output Error**: Conceptualizing the answer in Hindi but being unable to translate "significance" or "attraction" into English, leading to an empty or unintelligible string.
5. **Partial Retrieval**: Naming only one festival instead of two (stopping after the first successful retrieval).

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
The student population faces a "double burden." Cognitive load is split between domain-specific recall (Social Science) and language processing (ESL). In Grade 6, many students in this demographic are still transitioning from rote memorization to constructive sentence formation. An open-ended recall task is significantly more difficult than a multiple-choice recognition task, particularly when the rubric requires multiple distinct components (two names + one description) for a single point.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the linguistic barrier of "Describe in one sentence," the specific regional constraints, and the fact that missing any one of the three components results in a score of zero according to the 1-mark rigid rubric:
