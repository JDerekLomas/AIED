Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English text to understand the request ("most favourable").
2. Locate the "growth" column in the data table (visual scan and extraction).
3. Compare numerical or descriptive values across the three rows to find the maximum/best result.
4. Associate that maximum value with the correct "Condition" label in the first column.
5. Translate the finding back into a written English answer.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "The Magnitude Bug": Selecting the highest value in a "Days" column or another distractor column instead of the growth column.
2. "Lexical Matching Bug": Choosing the row with the most text or the word that "sounds" scientific rather than the one the data points to.
3. "The Translation Gap": In Hindi-medium contexts, students may confuse "most" (sabse zyada) with "least" (sabse kam) when read in English, leading them to provide the "Darkness" row.
4. "The Middle-Entry Bias": Defaulting to the second row or a middle value when data patterns aren't immediately clear in the L2.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Grade 6 students are transitioning from concrete to abstract reasoning; while reading a table is a core competency, doing so in a non-native language increases cognitive load.
2. For students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English phrasing "most favourable" is a high-threshold vocabulary hurdle compared to "best" or "more."
3. Open-ended response requirements (recall) are significantly harder for ELs than multiple-choice (recognition).

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While the data comparison itself is simple, the linguistic barrier for (a) and the synthesis of reading a table while navigating a second language suggest a significant drop-off. Part (a) is the easiest of the three, but "favourable" is a specific academic word that many may not have mastered yet.
