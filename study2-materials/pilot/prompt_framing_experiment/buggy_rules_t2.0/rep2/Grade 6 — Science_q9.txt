Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the English sentence structure "Why are they called X," identifying the causal link required.
2. Recall the specific association between "Vitamins/Minerals" and the functional label "Protective Foods" (Declarative memory).
3. Retrieve the functional definition: protecting/fighting against diseases/immunity.
4. Translate this internal concept from Hindi (e.g., *bimariyo se ladna*) into a coherent English sentence.
5. Recall a specific Vitamin-Deficiency pair (e.g., Vitamin A - Night Blindness).
6. Recall a specific Mineral-Deficiency pair (e.g., Iodine - Goitre or Iron - Anaemia).
7. Manage the administrative constraint of providing both (a) and (b) within a 1-mark limit, necessitating precision in both.

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
- **Category Confusion (Bug: Attribute Swap):** Assigning the role of "bodybuilding" (Proteins) or "energy-giving" (Carbohydrates) to vitamins/minerals.
- **Surface-Level Definition (Bug: Circular Logic):** Defining protective foods simply as "foods that protect us" without specifying *how* or against *what* (diseases/immunity).
- **Substance/Symptom Mismatch (Bug: Category Slip):** Listing a vitamin deficiency for a mineral (e.g., Iron causing Rickets) or vice-versa.
- **English-L2 Encoding Error (Bug: Fragmentary Output):** Providing single-word labels (e.g., "healthy," "diseases") without the verbs necessary to explain the causal mechanism required by "Explain."

Step 3: Student Population Constraints
- Grade 6 is the transitional year for "Science" as a distinct subject from "EVS." 
- For Hindi-medium background students, the English term "protective" is a technical vocabulary word that may not be grounded in daily vernacular, making recall difficult.
- Open-ended recall is significantly more taxing than MCQ recognition, especially in a second language where spelling and syntax errors often deter students from attempting full sentences.
- Multi-part questions (a and b) for a single mark increase the "perfection" threshold; failure in any sub-part leads to a score of 0 or a partial mark not reflected in a binary correct/incorrect assessment.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While the concept is foundational, the combination of two distinct recall tasks (explanation + two-example naming) in an L2 context creates a high cognitive load. Students often remember the disease names but struggle to articulate the functional "why" in English, or they conflate minerals with vitamins.
