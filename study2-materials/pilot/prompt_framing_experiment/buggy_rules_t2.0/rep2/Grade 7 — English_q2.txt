Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Decode the Syntax:** Identify "Why" as a request for causality and "announce a reward" as the focal action.
2. **Retrieve Information:** Access the mental model of Leo Tolstoy’s *The Three Questions* (a standard NCERT Grade 7 text).
3. **Filter and Match:** Differentiate the *reason* for the reward (seeking answers) from the *result* (wise men coming).
4. **Translate Cognition to English:** Convert the Hindi/Internal conceptual thought (वह अपने तीन सवालों के जवाब चाहता था) into English.
5. **Syntactic Assembly:** Construct a sentence using the correct tense (past) and subordinating conjunction (because/to).

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. **The "What/Who" Swap:** Mistaking "Why" for "What" or "Who," leading to answers like "The King" or "A large sum of money."
2. **Key-Word Matching (Associative Bug):** Seeing "reward" and "king" and writing everything from the sentence where those words first appear in the text, regardless of relevance.
3. **The "Because-Statement" Fragment:** Starting a sentence with "Because" but failing to provide a predicate or providing a tautology (e.g., "Because he announced it").
4. **L1 Syntactic Interference:** Applying Hindi word order to English (e.g., "King three questions answer for reward gave").
5. **Literalism/Object Bug:** Identifying the reward itself (e.g., "money") instead of the intent behind it.

Step 3: Target Student Population Context
- **ESL/Low SES Factors:** High likelihood of "frozen" English—where students know the answer in their mother tongue but cannot bridge the "Expression Gap." 
- **Recall vs. Recognition:** Unlike a Multiple Choice Question (MCQ), an open-ended "Why" question provides no scaffolds, leading to high omission rates.
- **Tense Consistency:** Most Grade 7 students in this demographic struggle with the shift from "does" in the question to "did" in the retrieval and "answered" in the output.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the story is central to the curriculum, the intersection of linguistic translation barriers, the procedural complexity of constructing an original sentence, and the prevalence of "associative matching" bugs among lower-proficiency learners suggests a high error rate.
