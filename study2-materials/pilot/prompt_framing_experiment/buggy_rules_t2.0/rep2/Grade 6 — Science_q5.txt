Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the specific chemical reagent required for the starch test (Iodine).
2. Recall the application process (adding drops/placing iodine on the potato surface).
3. Identify the specific qualitative change (color change).
4. Recall the specific end-color indicative of a positive result (blue-black/dark blue).
5. Translate these internal concepts into English sentences (given the language barrier).

Step 2: Buggy rules and systematic errors
- Reagent Confusion: Substituting "Iodine" with other substances learned in science (e.g., "salt," "acid," "water," or confusing it with "Benedict's solution").
- Incomplete Condition-Action Rule: Stating that a color change happens but failing to specify *which* color.
- Color Overgeneralization: Stating "the color changes to black" (losing the blue component) or "turns red" (confusing it with the test for proteins or glucose).
- Procedural Skipping: Focusing only on the observation without describing the action (iodine application).

Step 3: Population-specific considerations
- Recall vs. Recognition: This is a high-demand recall task; there are no options to prompt memory.
- Language barrier: Many students may understand the procedure but struggle to retrieve the specific English terms "Iodine" or "Blue-black," or fail to structure a "describe" response in English.
- Abstract vs. Concrete: While potato testing is a standard experiment, resource constraints in schools may mean students saw a demonstration rather than performing it themselves, weakening the encoding of the procedure.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
Given the rubric only requires "explaining the test involves putting iodine," it is more lenient than requiring the final color. However, "Describe the procedure AND state the observation" is a two-part command. In this population, the primary "bug" will be the failure to retrieve the specific term "Iodine" and the language interference in explaining the process.
