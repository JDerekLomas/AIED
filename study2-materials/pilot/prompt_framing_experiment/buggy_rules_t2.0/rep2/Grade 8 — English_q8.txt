Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Identify the Subject (The chef), Verb (prepared), and Object (a delicious meal).
2. Move the Object to the Subject position.
3. Determine the tense of the original verb (Simple Past).
4. Select the correct auxiliary verb "be" based on tense and number of the new subject (was).
5. Convert the main verb to the Past Participle form (prepared).
6. Insert the agent marker "by".
7. Move the original Subject to the end.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. Tense mismatch: Using "is" instead of "was" (Simple Present for Simple Past).
2. Past Participle confusion: Inability to distinguish between Simple Past "prepared" and Past Participle "prepared," or applying "-ed" to irregular verbs.
3. Missing Auxiliary: Writing "A delicious meal prepared by the chef."
4. Word order preservation: Attempting to change voice without switching noun positions.
5. Case confusion: Errors in pronoun cases (not applicable here, but common in similar tasks).
6. Inclusion of "being" or "been" erroneously (misapplying Continuous/Perfect rules).

Step 3: Population factors:
1. ELL/Hindi-medium interference: In Hindi, the passive is used differently and often sounds awkward; "by" does not have a direct intuitive translation in this syntax for many.
2. Production vs. Recognition: This is a recall/transformation task; students cannot rely on elimination.
3. "Double burden": Solving the grammar while simultaneously managing English vocabulary and syntax constraints.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment:
Given that this is an open-ended transformation requiring 100% accuracy for a 1-mark credit, and considering the common confusion between tenses (Simple Past vs. Present Perfect in sentence B may bleed into the attempt for A), the error rate for a multi-step syntactic transformation in this demographic is historically high.
