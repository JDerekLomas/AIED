Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Decode the Prompt:** Understand the term "writing style" and the meta-cognitive requirement to characterize an author's tone or technique.
2. **Retrieve Semantic Content:** Access the memory of the specific poem/poet studied in class (if the question refers to a textbook) or analyze an unseen text for stylistic markers.
3. **Internal Translation:** If the student thinks in Hindi, translate the conceptual feeling of the poem (e.g., *saral* or *aasaan*) into its English equivalent.
4. **Lexical Retrieval/Production:** Select a specific, sophisticated adjective that meets the rubric’s standard for "writing style" (e.g., "simple" vs. "good").
5. **Orthographic Execution:** Correctly spell the selected word.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic procedural errors)
1. **Value-Attribute Confusion:** The student evaluates the *quality* of the work (e.g., "very nice," "it is good") instead of the *style* of the work.
2. **Subject-Object Swap:** The student describes what the poet is *doing* or *talking about* (e.g., "He writes about trees") instead of the manner of writing.
3. **Transliteration Error:** Using English phonics to spell a word but following Hindi phonology, or applying the wrong English grammatical suffix (e.g., "description" instead of "descriptive").
4. **Synonym Over-Generalization:** Using "simple" to describe anything they understood, or "hard" for anything they didn't, regardless of actual literary style.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
The student population faces a "double burden." Linguistically, "writing style" is a high-register academic term unlikely to be used in daily English or household Hindi. In many low-income/Hindi-medium schools, English instruction often focuses on rote memorization of content (What happened?) rather than abstract analysis (How was it written?). As an open-ended recall task, students lack the scaffolding (multiple-choice cues) to narrow down the adjective set.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
This item requires high-level literary abstraction and specific vocabulary. Given the limited English exposure and the tendency to revert to "it is very nice/good" when asked for descriptions, most students will likely fall into the "Value-Attribute Confusion" bug.
