Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Decoding/Translation**: Interpret the English question syntax (Interrogative + "look during").
2. **Contextual Retrieval**: Locate the specific scene from the textbook chapter describing the sunset.
3. **Lexical Mapping**: Identify the English color words ("orange," "pink") corresponding to the mental image or the memorized text.
4. **Syntactic Encoding**: Formulate a complete or partial sentence that aligns with the rubric's specific demand (mentioning *both* colors).
5. **Transcription**: Correct spelling of the target adjectives.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules"
1. **The "Single Attribute" Bug**: Identifying only one salient feature (e.g., "It was orange") because natural language often allows one attribute to represent the whole, failing the rubric's two-color requirement.
2. **The "Topic Matching" Bug**: Writing everything known about sunsets or the sky rather than the specific visual description (e.g., "The sun sets in the west").
3. **The "Translation Gapping" Bug**: Using a native language (Hindi) word for a color if the English term is not retrieved, or using a generic word like "beautiful."
4. **The "Tense Drift" Bug**: Incorrectly using "is" instead of "was," though usually forgiven, it indicates a breakdown in grammatical procedural mapping.
5. **Keyword Association Bug**: Seeing "Sky" and "Look" and answering "Blue," ignoring the "Sunset" qualifier.

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often rely on "rote recall" of specific phrases. Because the rubric requires two specific colors ("orange and pink"), the error rate increases significantly compared to a recognition task (Multiple Choice). Limited English proficiency (LEP) students frequently struggle with "shades of," potentially simplifying the answer to a point where it may miss the rubric’s threshold for a "description capturing both colors."

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the question seems simple, the requirement to produce a specific multi-adjective response in a second language, combined with the tendency of students to provide "good enough" single-word answers, makes the full-credit success rate moderate.
