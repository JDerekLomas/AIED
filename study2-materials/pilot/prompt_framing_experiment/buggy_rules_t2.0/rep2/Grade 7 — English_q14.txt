Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decipher the instruction "antonym" and the synonym constraint "(opposite word)".
2. Decode the target stimulus "ancient" (reading/phonetics).
3. Retrieve the semantic meaning of "ancient" from long-term memory.
4. Access the lexical category for "old/past" and identify the reciprocal category "new/modern".
5. Recall the specific English word associated with that reciprocal category (lexical retrieval).
6. Encode the orthography (spelling) of "modern" or "new" correctly.

Step 2: Buggy rules / systematic errors
1. The "Synonym Bug": Students associate the word but provide a word with the same meaning (e.g., "very old") instead of the opposite.
2. The "Translation Gap": The student knows the concept in Hindi (प्राचीन/नया) but cannot bridge the English labels.
3. The "Association Bug": Providing a word related to the context but not the opposite (e.g., "history" or "temple").
4. The "Affix Overgeneralization": Attempting to create an antonym using a prefix (e.g., "unancient" or "disancient").
5. The "Phonetic Spelling Bug": Correct retrieval but incorrect spelling (e.g., "modren").

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 7 students from economically weaker sections in India often face a "vocabulary gap." While "new" is high-frequency, the word "ancient" is academic tier-2 vocabulary. In many government school contexts, English is taught as a set of translated rules rather than through immersion. Without multiple-choice cues (recognition), the recall demand for "modern" is high.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
The reliance on recall rather than recognition, combined with the "Synonym Bug" and limited English exposure, significantly lowers the success rate despite the word's presence in standard textbooks.
