Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Lexical Retrieval: Understand the specific terms "urban planning," "Harappan Civilization," and "key feature."
2. Long-term Memory Retrieval: Access specific architectural facts (citadel, drainage, grid) from the Indus Valley context.
3. Selection: Choose one distinct feature that qualifies as "planning" rather than just an artifact (e.g., distinguishing a "pot" from a "grid street").
4. Translation/Coding: Convert the mental image/fact into English or semi-English syntax (given the medium of instruction context).
5. Application of Definition: Match the recalled fact to the conceptual category of "urban layout."

Step 2: "Buggy rules" and systematic errors:
1. Generalization Error: Attributing any ancient achievement to Harappa (e.g., "they built temples/pyramids").
2. Definition-Attribute Confusion: Describing an object (jewelry/seals) instead of an "urban planning" feature.
3. Vague Descriptor Bug: Providing a correct but non-specific adjective (e.g., "The city was very big and good") which fails the rubric for a "described feature."
4. Retrieval Interference: Mixing Harappan features with Mahajanapadas or later Vedic descriptions.
5. Language Syntax Barrier: Knowing the concept ("nali" for drainage) but failing to find the English functional equivalent, leading to an omitted or unintelligible answer.

Step 3: Population Considerations:
- Grade 8 students in this demographic often face "the language gap," where conceptual knowledge exists in the home language but collapses during English-medium testing.
- "Describe" is an open-ended recall task, which is cognitively heavier than multiple-choice recognition.
- Socio-economic factors often correlate with high absenteeism and varying access to the standard textbook "narrative," though Harappa is a cornerstone of the curriculum.

Step 4: Final Estimate:
The complexity of translating a conceptual understanding into a technical description in a non-native language, combined with the precision required by "urban planning," poses a significant hurdle.
