Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Identify the Subject ("The wind"), Verb ("blew"), and Object ("the leaves").
2. Transpose the Object ("the leaves") to the Subject position.
3. Identify the tense of the active verb (Simple Past).
4. Select the correct form of the auxiliary verb "to be" matching the tense and the new subject's number (plural "were").
5. Convert the main verb into its Past Participle form ("blown").
6. Attach the original Subject as an agent using the preposition "by".
7. Maintain the adverbial particle/adjunct ("away") in a grammatically correct position.

Step 2: Systematic buggy rules
1. **Tense Preservation Error**: Using "are" instead of "were" (failing to recognize "blew" as past tense).
2. **Verb Form Overgeneralization**: Writing "blewed" or "blowed" (treating an irregular verb as regular).
3. **Number Mismatch**: Using "was" instead of "were" because "the wind" (the initial focus) is singular, or due to general auxiliary confusion.
4. **V-3 Substitution Error**: Using the past tense form ("blew") instead of the participle ("blown").
5. **Preposition/Particle Omission**: Dropping "away" or forgetting "by."
6. **Object Identification Bug**: Attempting to make "the wind" the subject again (No-operation bug).

Step 3: Population Considerations
In Grade 7 Indian government school contexts, students are often introduced to "Active/Passive" as a formal set of rules. However, English is frequently a second or third language. The irregular verb "blow/blew/blown" is a significant hurdle. Open-ended recall is substantially more difficult than multiple-choice for this population, as they must master orthography (spelling "blown") and syntax simultaneously without cues.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the combination of an irregular verb, the requirement for plural subject-verb agreement ("leaves were"), and the addition of the particle "away," many students will likely produce a "near-miss" (e.g., "The leaves was blown away by wind") which would receive 0 under a binary 0/1 rubric.
