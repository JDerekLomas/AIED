Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Deconstruct linguistic prompt**: Correctly interpret "ruminant," "digestive system," and "key difference related to diet" across a language barrier (English vs. Hindi-medium background).
2.  **Recall anatomical facts**: Access the long-term memory store for the specific anatomy of a ruminant (4-chambered stomach vs. single stomach).
3.  **Synthesize causal relationship**: Connect the biological structure (rumen/four chambers) to the specific diet component (cellulose/grass) as requested.
4.  **Written production**: Formulate a coherent sentence in English that aligns with the rubric’s requirement for "special/multiple stomachs."

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules" / Cognitive Errors
*   **The "Keyword Substitution" Bug**: Students replace the specific term "ruminant" with "animal," leading to a generic answer (e.g., "They eat differently") that fails the rubric.
*   **The "Categorical Oversimplification" Bug**: Assigning the difference to the *teeth* or *mouth* rather than the *digestive system* (stomach) because chewing is the most visible difference to a child.
*   **The "Partial Retrieval" Bug**: Recalling that a cow "chews twice" (rumination) but failing to mention the internal digestive structure (rumen/stomach) required by the rubric.
*   **Linguistic Transfer Error**: Understanding the concept in Hindi but failing to translate the specific term "stomach" or "chambers" into English, leading to an incomplete or unintelligible written response.

Step 3: Target population considerations
*   **Language Barrier**: Open-ended questions are significantly harder than MCQs for ESL/ELL students. The gap between conceptual understanding and written production is wide.
*   **Resource Access**: In EWS (Economically Weaker Section) contexts, rote memorization of textbooks is common. If the specific phrase "four-chambered stomach" was drilled, recall may be higher; however, synthesis of "diet" and "system" is a higher-order demand.
*   **Cognitive Load**: 7th-grade students in these environments often struggle with "why" questions that require connecting structure to function.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is a staple of the NCERT curriculum, the combination of English-language production, the need for recall over recognition, and the specific requirement of the rubric (mentioning the stomach sections rather than just "eating grass") creates significant friction.
