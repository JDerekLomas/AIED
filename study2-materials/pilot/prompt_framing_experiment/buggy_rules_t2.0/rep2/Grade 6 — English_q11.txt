Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Parse the English sentence to distinguish between the subject and the predicate.
2. Recall the meta-linguistic definition of a "verb phrase" (differentiating it from a single "verb").
3. Identify the main lexical verb ("playing") based on the action.
4. Identify the auxiliary verb ("are") and recognize its function as a tense/aspect marker.
5. Synthesize the auxiliary and main verb into a single unit while excluding the direct object ("football").
6. Write out the exact phrase without additional words.

Step 2: Common "Buggy Rules" / Systematic Errors
- The "Action-Only" Bug: Students identify only the lexical verb ("playing") because they define verbs as "doing words."
- The "Whole Predicate" Bug: Students identify everything following the subject as the verb phrase ("are playing football").
- The "L1 Syntax Mapping" Bug: In Hindi/Hindustani, the auxiliary follows the main verb (*khel rahe hain*); students may struggle with the split-brain logic of English auxiliary placement.
- The "Terminal Noun" Bug: Identifying "football" as the verb because it is the "thing being done" or simply because it ends the sentence.
- The "Label Confusion" Bug: Mistaking the "verb phrase" for just the "verb," leading to a single-word answer.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 6 students are transitioning from learning English as a set of vocabulary words to understanding formal grammatical structures.
- For Hindi-medium students, "Verb Phrase" is a technical term often learned through rote memorization rather than intuitive usage. 
- In many government school contexts, grammar is taught through translation; since "playing" translates to an inflected form and "are" translates to a separate particle at the end, isolating the two as a single "phrase" is cognitively non-intuitive.
