Step 1: Specific Procedural Steps
1. Pattern Recognition: Identify the common factor (9/16) appearing in two terms separated by a plus sign.
2. Factoring (Inverse Distribution): Correctly rewrite the expression as $9/16 \times [4/12 + (-3/9)]$.
3. Rational Number Arithmetic (Parentheses):
    a. Simplify fractions (optional but helpful: $4/12 = 1/3$ and $-3/9 = -1/3$).
    b. Find a common denominator if not simplified ($36$).
    c. Handle the addition of a negative rational number ($4/12 - 3/9$).
4. Evaluation of Parentheses: Calculate the sum/difference inside the bracket.
5. Multiplication: Multiply the common factor by the result of the bracketed expression.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. Rule Identification Bug: Treating the plus sign as a separator and calculating each term independently rather than using the property requested.
2. Property Misapplication: Writing $9/16 \times 4/12 + (-3/9)$ (forgetting brackets), leading to an incorrect order of operations.
3. Negative Sign "Vanishing" Act: Treating $+ (-3/9)$ as simply $+ (3/9)$.
4. Common Denominator Errors: Adding numerators and denominators directly ($4/12 + (-3/9) = 1/3$).
5. Distributive Confusion: Multiplying $9/16$ by only the first term and then adding the second term without multiplication.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
The student population faces a "double burden": language barriers and socio-economic stressors. The transition from Grade 7 to 8 involves abstracting numerical properties. In many Indian government schools, "Distributive Property" is often memorized as a term in English/Hindi without deep conceptual "meaning-making." Fractions remain a significant "gatekeeper" topic where mastery is often low. The open-ended format removes the "cueing" benefit of multiple-choice options.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
While the arithmetic results in a very "clean" answer (zero), the chain of procedures is brittle. A student must navigate fraction reduction, sign management, and property application. Given the specific challenges of this demographic and the commonality of "buggy" fraction addition, many students who understand the property will fail the arithmetic, and many who know the arithmetic will fail to invoke the specific property requested.
