Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decipher the English academic vocabulary in the prompt (Analyze, Role, Economic Development, Evaluate).
2. Retrieve the concept of "Money" as a medium of exchange/store of value from memory (Long-term memory recall).
3. Connect money to macro-economic growth (investment, trade, or infrastructure).
4. Synthesize the shift from physical to digital currency.
5. Formulate a comparative judgment (Evaluate) on the effectiveness of digital transactions.
6. Translate these conceptual links into a written English sentence.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. "Literal Keyword Matching": Students look for the word "Money" and provide a definition (e.g., "Money is used to buy things") rather than performing the higher-order task of "Analyzing role in development."
2. "Category Slip": Treating "Digital Money" as "Electronics" or "Internet" rather than a financial instrument.
3. "Procedural Truncation": Answering only the first half of the prompt (the role of money) and ignoring the second (evaluation of digital money), or vice-versa.
4. "Translation-meaning bottleneck": Using Hindi grammar structures in English that result in incomprehensible causal links (e.g., "Money is development because buy").

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 7 students are at a developmental stage where "Analyze" and "Evaluate" are sophisticated cognitive tasks (Bloom’s Taxonomy). For ESL/Hindi-medium students from low-resource backgrounds, the barrier is twofold: the abstract nature of "Economic Development" and the linguistic demand of the open-ended "Explain" format. Without a word bank or multiple-choice options, the burden of retrieval and syntax is high.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
The discrepancy between the sophisticated prompt ("Analyze/Evaluate") and the binary rubric (requiring only one role) suggests a low threshold for the point, but the linguistic and conceptual hurdles for 12-year-olds in this specific context remain substantial.
