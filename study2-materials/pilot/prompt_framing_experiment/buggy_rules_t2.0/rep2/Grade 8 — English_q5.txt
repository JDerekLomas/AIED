Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Lexical Decoding: Translate the English prompt into Hindi/L1 to understand the specific requirement (central idea).
2. Content Retrieval: Access the memory schema related to "The Last Bargain" by Tagore.
3. Abstract Conceptualization: Generalize specific plot points (king/power, rich man/wealth, maid/beauty) into abstract themes (freedom/true happiness).
4. Cross-Linguistic Mapping: Translate abstract concepts back into English vocabulary.
5. Syntactic Construction: Formulate a coherent sentence (S-V-O) in English to express the identified theme.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. The "Keyword Association Bug": Student identifies "Bargain" and "Last" but writes about the specific transactions (the king, the money) rather than the underlying theme.
2. The "Plot Summarization Bug": Student treats "Theme" as "Summary," providing a sequence of events rather than a central abstraction.
3. The "Translation Congruence Bug": Student conceptualizes the theme in Hindi (Aazadi, Khushi) but uses "false friends" or phonetic approximations in English that fail the rubric's clarity.
4. The "Single Attribute Bug": Focusing only on "Wealth" or "Money" while failing to synthesize the other variables (power, beauty, pride) required for a complete central idea.

Step 3: Target population considerations
The move from "recognition" (MCQ) to "recall" (open-ended) is a significant cognitive hurdle. In Indian government schools, Grade 8 English learners often rely on rote memorization (ratta) of guidebooks. If the guidebook phrasing doesn't match the specific cognitive retrieval at the moment, or if the student's limited English proficiency prevents sentence construction, the answer fails even if the concept is understood.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the abstract nature of the theme "freedom vs. materialism," the requirement to produce an original English sentence, and the prevalence of the Plot-instead-of-Theme bug in this demographic:
