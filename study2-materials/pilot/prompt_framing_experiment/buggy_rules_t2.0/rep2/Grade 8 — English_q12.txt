Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Visual Recognition: Correctly identify the characters (fox, goat/other animal) and the setting (well) from the provided images.
2. Sequencing: Infer the temporal and causal relationship between the images (falling in -> being trapped -> trickery/escape).
3. Retrieval/Vocabulary: Access English words for specific nouns (fox, well) and actions (fall, climb, jump, drink).
4. Morphosyntax Construction: Formulate sentences using correct past tense markers (e.g., "fell" instead of "fall") and prepositions of place/motion.
5. Narrative Synthesis: Combine individual image descriptions into a coherent paragraph that satisfies the rubric's requirement to explain the entrapment.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. Overgeneralization of Tense: Applying "-ed" to irregular verbs (e.g., "The fox falld into the well").
2. Subject-Verb Disconnect: Dropping the auxiliary or using "is/are" for past actions ("Fox is fall in well").
3. L1 Transfer (Hinglish/Transliteration): Mapping Hindi syntax onto English (e.g., "Well inside fox fallen" for "Kuan mein lomri gir gayi").
4. Concept Misidentification: Confusing the animal species (e.g., calling the fox a dog) or the object (calling the well a hole/pit).
5. Narrative Omission: Describing images in isolation without establishing the causal "could not escape" link required by the rubric.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face a "threshold effect" where their conceptual understanding of the story (in Hindi) far outpaces their English production capacity. Open-ended "Write a story" prompts represent a "high-floor" task compared to multiple-choice; students cannot rely on recognition. In low-resource settings, writing a full, grammatically coherent paragraph in a L2 (English) often leads to total task avoidance or single-word labeling.

Step 4: Estimation
While many students will recognize the "Thirsty Goat/Fox" fable, the rubric requires specific narrative elements and English production. Given the high probability of L1 interference and the systemic "bug" of failing to conjugate past tense verbs correctly in an open-ended format, the success rate for a *fully* correct response (meeting all rubric criteria) is low.
