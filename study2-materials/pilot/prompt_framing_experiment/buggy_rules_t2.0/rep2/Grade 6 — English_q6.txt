Step 1: Specific Procedural Steps
1. Comprehension: Understand the question "like" and "why" in English.
2. Recall/Retrieval: Access the text of the poem (requires long-term memory if the text isn't provided, or scanning skills if it is).
3. Selection: Choose a specific "line" (distinct from a stanza or a word).
4. Translation: Formulate a justification in the native language (Hindi) and translate it into English syntax.
5. Construction: Write a cohesive sentence structure ("I like [line] because...").

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Procedural Errors)
1. "Literalism Bug": Identifying the entire poem or a single word instead of a specific "line."
2. "Copy-Paste Bug": Transcribing the first or last line of the poem regardless of preference because it is most cognitively accessible.
3. "Empty Justification Bug": Stating "It is good" or "I like it" as the reason (circular reasoning), failing to meet the "why" requirement.
4. "Syntactic Transference Bug": Applying Hindi SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order to the English response, resulting in incoherent sentences.
5. "Prompt Over-dependency": Writing only the line and omitting the "why" because the "because" connector is not provided in the prompt.

Step 3: Target Student Population Context
The open-ended nature of the question is significantly more demanding than MCQ formats. In Indian government school contexts (EWS/Hindi-medium), students often have high "Math-to-English" translation gaps. The cognitive load of simultaneously performing literary appreciation and second-language production is high. Evaluation usually reveals that while students can identify a line (procedural), the meta-cognitive "why" is the primary barrier.
