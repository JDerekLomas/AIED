Step 1: List procedural steps
1.  **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English sentence structure into a conceptual understanding of "organic waste in a pit."
2.  **Biological Recall**: Retrieve the concept of decomposition (microbial action) specific to organic matter.
3.  **Observation Identification**: Explicitly state the physical change (decay, volume reduction, or conversion to manure/dark substance).
4.  **Causal Reasoning (Reasons)**: Explain the process using scientific terminology (microorganisms, decomposers, or breakdown of nutrients).
5.  **Application/Evaluation**: Connect the product (compost/manure) to soil health (increasing humus, nutrients, or fertility).
6.  **Expression/Synthesis**: Compose a multi-part English response that addresses all three components of the prompt.

Step 2: Identify "buggy rules"
1.  **Observation-Evaluation Merge**: Students often jump straight to "it is good for soil" (evaluation) without answering "what changes were noticed" (observation), missing the multi-part structure.
2.  **Concept Conflation**: Confusing decomposition with simple "drying out" or "becoming dirty," rather than a chemical/biological transformation.
3.  **Language Interference (The "English Barrier" Bug)**: Students understand the concept in Hindi (Khaad/compost) but lack the specific English vocabulary to explain the "reasons" beyond saying "it is good."
4.  **Partial Completion**: Only answering the binary question ("Yes, he noticed changes") and failing to provide the requested "reasons" and "evaluation" due to cognitive load.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often have the "folk science" knowledge of composting but struggle with the formal scientific explanation required in a second language. The open-ended nature of the question (three distinct tasks: notice, reason, evaluate) is significantly harder than a multiple-choice item, as it requires active recall and syntactic construction.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is intuitive, the requirement to explain the "reasons" and "evaluate" in English—combined with the systemic issue of students providing brief, one-part answers to multi-part questions—means few will hit all components of the rubric accurately.
