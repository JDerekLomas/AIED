Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Read and decode the English text and the structured data table (Mapping words to columns).
2.  Perform a "Magnitude Comparison" task on the numerical values in the table to identify the maximum value (Aluminium).
3.  Execute the transfer of the specific material name to the answer for sub-question (a).
4.  Recall and synthesize conceptual knowledge about thermal expansion and safety gaps (physics context) for sub-question (b).
5.  Synthesize properties of electrical conductivity, ductility, and cost/expansion (engineering choice) for sub-question (c).
6.  Formulate three distinct responses in English (or a bilingual mix) that satisfy the prompt requirements despite the rubric only mentioning sub-question (a).

Step 2: Identified "Buggy Rules" / Systematic Errors
1.  **Magnitude Inversion/Neglect:** Students may treat decimals or large numbers in expansion coefficients incorrectly, or ignore the table entirely to name a material they "think" expands (e.g., iron).
2.  **Rubric-Task Mismatch (Contextual Bug):** Since the rubric only awards a point for (a), but the question asks for (a), (b), and (c), many students may provide incomplete answers or get distracted by the complexity of (b) and (c), failing to prioritize the specific data in (a).
3.  **Language Barrier / Keyword Search:** Students may misinterpret "expands the most" and instead look for the most common material or the "best" material listed.
4.  **Information Overload (Non-Systematic Bug):** Students from low-resource backgrounds often struggle with multi-part "Higher Order Thinking" (HOT) questions where the stimulus (the table) only applies to one part of the question.

Step 3: Target Population Factors
Grade 8 students in EWS contexts often exhibit high proficiency in rote computation but struggle with interpreting "data-to-text" questions in their non-native English. While (a) is a simple retrieval task, the presence of (b) and (c) as open-ended recall requirements increases the cognitive load significantly. The "hidden" requirement of providing three correct answers for only 1 mark often leads to discouragement or partial effort.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While (a) is objectively easy, the combination of multi-part demands, the English proficiency barrier, and the need for both data interpretation and conceptual recall reduces the likelihood of a perfect, "fully correct" multi-part response across a large cohort.
