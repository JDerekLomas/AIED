Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Semantic Translation:** Translate the English term "Goldsmith" into the known context (e.g., Hindi *Sunar*) and the scientific context of "zones of flame."
2. **Knowledge Retrieval (Fact):** Recall the specific diagram of a candle flame or Bunsen burner and identify which of the three zones (innermost, middle, outer) is used by a goldsmith.
3. **Knowledge Retrieval (Reasoning):** Recall the scientific justification (that the outermost zone is the hottest and undergoes complete combustion).
4. **Output Synthesis:** Formulate the response in English (or a mix) identifying "outermost zone" and explaining "hottest/complete combustion."

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. **The "Visible Priority" Bug:** Students assume the most visible/brightest part (the yellow/middle zone) is the most powerful or hottest because it is the largest and most "luminous."
2. **Language Mapping Bug:** Mistranslating "Goldsmith" as someone who works with "gold" (ornaments) and confusing it with the "inner/black" zone because it deals with delicate metals.
3. **Partial Retrieval Bug:** Recalling the "outer" zone but being unable to articulate the "why," leading to zero marks in a strictly graded "Question + Reason" rubric.
4. **Terminology Misalignment:** Using descriptive terms like "blue zone" but failing to link them to the technical "outermost" requirement of the rubric.

Step 3: Target student population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often rely on rote memorization from NCERT textbooks. The "Goldsmith" question is a classic "application" example in the *Combustion and Flame* chapter. However, the requirement to "Give reason" in English acts as a high barrier for students who might have the conceptual intuition (that he blows air into the flame) but cannot map that to "non-luminous/outermost/complete combustion" terminology.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While this is a "standard" textbook question, the dual requirement (zone + reason) in a second language significantly reduces the success rate for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. Many will identify the zone but fail the reasoning, or intuitively pick the "bright/yellow" zone.
