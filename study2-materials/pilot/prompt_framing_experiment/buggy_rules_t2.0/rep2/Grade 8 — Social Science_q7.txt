Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decipher the English prompt: Correctly interpret "contribute" and "expansion" (abstract academic vocabulary).
2. Retrieve specific historical event data: Locate the Battle of Plassey (1757) in memory, distinguishing it from Buxar (1764) or other colonial battles.
3. Identify causal relationship: Move from "who won" to "the systemic consequence" of the victory.
4. Concept synthesis: Link the military victory to the specific political outcome required by the rubric (control over Bengal/puppet nawabs).
5. Output formulation: Construct a response in English (the likely medium of examination) that meets the rubric’s threshold for "explaining."

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. Event Confusion: Associating 1757 with the 1857 Revolt because of the "57" suffix.
2. Narrative Plateau: Describing the *battle* (Siraj-ud-Daulah, black hole, betrayal) instead of its *contribution* to power expansion (process-to-outcome failure).
3. The "Hero/Villain" Heuristic: Stating simply that "British won because they were clever/powerful" without explaining the institutional shift to political dominance.
4. Vocabulary Mapping Error: Translating "Expansion" (vistar) correctly in mind but being unable to articulate "political dominance" or "sovereignty" in the target language.
5. Teleological Bias: Assuming British power was already absolute and stating they simply "became kings" immediately, missing the nuance of the puppet ruler system.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Medium Shift: For Hindi-medium students in Grade 8, the cognitive load of translating complex causal phrases ("led to the establishment of") often causes "bottlenecking" where historical knowledge exists but cannot be outputted.
2. Rote Dependency: Many students may have memorized a single line about Mir Jafar but struggle if the question phrasing deviates from their textbook’s bolded headings.
3. Poverty and Schooling: High absenteeism and limited access to supplementary reading often lead to fragmented chronological knowledge.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the Battle of Plassey is a "anchor point" in the curriculum, the combination of high-level English academic language ("contribute," "expansion"), the need for causal analysis over simple fact retrieval, and the specific socio-linguistic barriers for this demographic significantly reduces the success rate.
