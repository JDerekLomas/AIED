Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Decoding and Syntax Analysis:** Read the sentence "We ran around" and identify the structural relationship between the words.
2.  **Functional Analysis:** Determine the grammatical function of "around" (it modifies the verb "ran" by indicating direction/circumstance, not an object).
3.  **Terminology Mapping:** Access the linguistic mental lexicon to retrieve the specific category "adverb."
4.  **Orthographic Retrieval:** Correctly spell the term "adverb" in English.

Step 2: Potential "Buggy Rules"
1.  **"Around = Preposition" Rule:** A very strong systematic error where students categorize words based on "fixed labels" learned in isolation. Since "around" is frequently taught as a preposition (e.g., "around the tree"), students apply this label regardless of context.
2.  **The "Ly" Bug:** Students often operate under the buggy rule that a word is only an adverb if it ends in the suffix "-ly."
3.  **Position-Based Bug:** Identifying any word following a verb as an "object" and therefore concluding its part of speech must be a "noun" or "prepositional object."
4.  **L1 Interference (Hindi-Medium):** In Hindi, the equivalent concepts (postpositions or adverbs) function differently structurally. Students may struggle to map the English word to a category that doesn't have a direct 1:1 conceptual mapping in their primary language.

Step 3: Target Population Constraints
*   **Recall vs. Recognition:** Without a multiple-choice format, the "retrieval effort" is significantly higher. Students cannot use the process of elimination.
*   **English Proficiency:** For EWS students in Hindi-medium contexts, parts of speech are often taught through rote memorization rather than functional syntax.
*   **Abstract Reasoning:** Grade 7 students are transitioning to abstract grammatical logic but often remain in the "labeling" stage of language learning.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that "around" is one of the most common "pivot" words (functioning as both preposition and adverb), and given the systemic tendency in primary education to emphasize its prepositional use, the "Around = Preposition" bug will be dominant. Combined with the requirement to recall the spelling of "adverb" in a second language, the success rate is expected to be quite low.
