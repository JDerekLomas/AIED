Step 1: Specific procedural steps required:
1. Decode the English sentence structure to identify the two specific variables: "light-coloured" and "cotton" (Semantic parsing).
2. Isolate the property of "light-coloured" materials from the thermal properties of "cotton" (Conceptual categorization).
3. Recall the scientific principle of heat absorption/reflection (Albedo effect).
4. Select one valid scientific reason regarding light colors (Reflects heat/low absorption).
5. Encode the concept back into English or a combination of English/scientific terms for the written response.

Step 2: Common "Buggy Rules" and systematic errors:
1. **Property Over-extension:** Attributes the cooling effect of "cotton" (perspiration/ventilation) to the "color," or vice versa (e.g., "White clothes have holes for air").
2. **Generic Beneficialism:** Providing a vague, non-scientific result rather than a mechanism (e.g., "They keep us cool" or "They are comfortable"), failing the rubric's demand for a "scientific reason."
3. **Translation Displacement:** Using Hindi conceptual markers in English syntax, leading to incomplete scientific phrases (e.g., "Sun rays back go").
4. **Bimodal Failure:** Describing why we *don't* wear black rather than why we *do* wear white, sometimes missing the mechanical "why" required for "scientific reason."

Step 3: Target population considerations:
Grade 7 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds face a "Double Burden." They must translate the conceptual understanding of heat (which is often intuitive/experiential) into a formal English academic register. Open-ended "Explain" prompts are significantly harder than multiple-choice for this demographic due to the linguistic threshold.

Step 4: Estimation:
While the concept is intuitive, the combination of linguistic barriers, the requirement for a specific "scientific" mechanism over a general observation, and the open-ended format significantly reduces the success rate.
