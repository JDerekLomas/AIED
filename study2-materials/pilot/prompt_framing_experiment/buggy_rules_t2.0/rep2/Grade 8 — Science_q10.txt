Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the definition of pasteurization as a milk preservation technique.
2. Recall the two-stage thermal sequence: Heating followed by Rapid Cooling.
3. Quantify (optional but common) or qualitatively describe "high temperature" and "short duration."
4. Connect the physical process to the biological outcome: killing/inhibiting bacteria.
5. Translate these internal scientific concepts into English/written prose.

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules" / Systematic errors
1. Reverse Order Bug: Heating is mentioned, but "chilling" is omitted or described as occurring much later.
2. Boiled-is-Pasteurized Equivalence: Confusing domestic "boiling" (to kill pathogens) with "pasteurization" (industrial heating/rapid cooling).
3. Missing Link Bug: Describing the process but failing to explain the purpose (preservation/killing microbes).
4. Terminology Swap: Misusing related terms like "sterilization," "fermentation," or "homogenization."
5. The "Some Time" Vague Rule: Using non-specific temporal terms that ignore the "sudden" nature of the cooling.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Open-ended recall: High cognitive load compared to multiple-choice.
- English Proficiency: ESL/Hindi-medium background creates a "bottleneck" where the student knows the science but cannot encode the explanation into the required English sentence structure.
- Economic context: Potential lack of exposure to "Pasteurized" labels on tetra-paks/bottles; familiarity with loose milk boiling.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the 3-part requirement (Heat -> Fast Cool -> Preserving Milk) and the linguistic barrier for Grade 8 ESL learners, even if they grasp the concept, many will fail to capture the "sudden cooling" step or struggle with the "Explain why" component.
