Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Textual decoding: Interpret English vocabulary ("stunted," "deficiency," "address") and context.
2. Causal mapping: Connect physical symptoms (yellowing) to the concept of soil nutrient depletion.
3. Information retrieval: Recall specific terminology (manure/fertilizer) and chemical names (Nitrogen/NPK).
4. Synthesis: Construct a prescriptive sentence in English that aligns with the specific corrective action required.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. Semantic Overgeneralization: Mapping "yellowing" to "water" (over-watering or under-watering) instead of chemical nutrients.
2. Category Displacement: Recommending pesticides/insecticides (pest control) as a universal fix for any plant "sickness."
3. Label Substitution: Using colloquial terms (Hindi "Khaad") but failing to provide the technical English term required for a Science assessment in an English-medium or transitional context.
4. Nominal Fallacy: Mentioning that the farmer should "add nutrients" (repeating the prompt) without specifying the medium (fertilizer/manure) or the specific elements (N/P/K).

Step 3: Population Considerations
For Grade 7 students from economically weaker sections in India, language transition is a significant barrier. Open-ended "describe" questions suffer from higher "blank page" rates compared to multiple-choice questions. While students likely have intuitive agricultural knowledge (funds of knowledge), the cognitive load of translating "put cow dung/manure" into the specific technical scientific vocabulary (NPK/Nitrogen/Fertilizer) in a second language is high.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement to mention a *specific* nutrient and the linguistic hurdle of the prompt’s phrasing, many students will provide a partial answer (e.g., "give water" or "add medicine") that fails the specific rubric requirements.
