Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Decoding and Translation**: Translate the English question into a mental model in Hindi (or mother tongue), identifying "mean to" as a query for significance/definition.
2.  **Information Retrieval**: Access long-term memory to locate the specific narrative regarding Anika and retrieve the conceptual link (Not Hobby -> Expression of Feelings).
3.  **Cross-Lingual Synthesis**: Formulate the conceptual answer in the student’s internal language (Hindi) and map it to English vocabulary (e.g., mapping "man ki baat" to "thoughts and feelings").
4.  **Syntactic Assembly**: Construct a grammatically coherent sentence using the past tense ("mean" to "meant") and abstract nouns.
5.  **Alignment with Rubric**: Ensure the response satisfies the two-part criteria (negating "hobby" and asserting "expression").

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules" / Systematic errors
1.  **Key-word matching bug**: Searching for the literal word "drawing" in memory and returning a concrete detail (e.g., "She draws flowers") rather than the abstract significance.
2.  **Tense-copying bug**: Responding with "Anika drawing mean..." or "Anika mean is..." failing to conjugate "mean" into "meant" (highly common in Hindi-to-English transitions).
3.  **Literal translation bug**: Using "Anika mean drawing hobby no" (applying Hindi syntax to English words).
4.  **Sufficiency bug**: Providing only half the rubric (e.g., "It was a hobby") because the student believes any relevant fact constitutes a complete answer.
5.  **Lexical substitution bug**: Confusing "hobby" with "habit" or "happiness" due to phonetic similarity.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face "the comprehension gap"—where their conceptual understanding of the story (often learned through a teacher's Hindi summary) is higher than their ability to produce the specific abstract English lexicon ("expressing thoughts and feelings") required by the rubric. Open-ended questions are significantly harder for this group than multiple-choice because they cannot rely on recognition.
