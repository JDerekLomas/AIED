Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Decoding/Translation**: Decipher the English question words (Wh-word "What") and the past tense marker "did" + "love".
2. **Context Retrieval**: Recall the specific passage details or locate the text where "Riya" and "evening" are mentioned.
3. **Information Extraction**: Identify "read books" as the core activity linked to the keywords.
4. **Syntactic Transformation**: Transform the retrieval into an English response (mapping "did love" to "loved" or providing a gerundial phrase).
5. **Written Production**: Orthographic execution of the response in English.

Step 2: Identified "Buggy Rules" (Systematic procedural errors)
1. **Keyword Matching Bug**: Copying the entire sentence from the text containing the word "evening" or "Riya," regardless of whether it answers "what."
2. **Tense Preservation Bug**: Responding with "Riya love to read" or "She did love to read," failing to adjust the verb form for the past tense.
3. **Phonetic/L1 Interference Bug**: Spelling words based on Hindi phonology (e.g., "rid" for "read") or using Hindi word order.
4. **Wh-word Misinterpretation**: Treating "What" as "Who" or "Where" due to lexical confusion.
5. **Elliptical Failure**: Providing a correct conceptual answer but failing to meet the "English" subject criteria by using L1 (Hindi) vocabulary.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 6 students from economically weaker backgrounds in Indian government schools often face a "literacy-language gap." While they might comprehend the story if told in Hindi, the transition to written English output involves high cognitive load. The "did love" construction in questions is a notorious hurdle for learners who have not mastered auxiliary verbs. Open-ended recall is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice recognition for this demographic.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
The number of successful "hops" (translating the question -> searching text -> extracting data -> encoding in English) is high. Even if a student understands the story, the procedural "bugs" in English syntax and spelling often lead to answers that are partially illegible or syntactically broken, though some flexibility in the rubric (accepting short phrases) provides a safety net.
