Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehension: Map the word "How far" and "on 5 3/4 litres" to the multiplication operation ($10 \times 5 \frac{3}{4}$).
2. Conversion: Convert the mixed fraction $5 \frac{3}{4}$ into an improper fraction ($5 \times 4 + 3 = 23/4$).
3. Calculation (Setup): Formulate the expression $10 \times \frac{23}{4}$ or use the distributive property ($10 \times 5 + 10 \times \frac{3}{4}$).
4. Computation: Multiply the whole number by the numerator and divide by the denominator (or simplify/reduce).
5. Decimal Conversion/Fraction Simplification: Arrive at $230/4$, then simplify to $57.5$ or $57 \frac{1}{2}$.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- Operation selection bug: "Keyword hunting" may lead to division ($10 \div 5 \frac{3}{4}$) because the student expects "large number divided by small number."
- Mixed number conversion bug: "Whole $\times$ numerator" ($5 \times 3 = 15/4$) or "Adding whole to numerator" ($5+3 = 8/4$).
- Whole number multiplication bug: Multiplying the whole number by both numerator and denominator ($10 \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{30}{40}$).
- Improper to mixed conversion bug: Errors in division while simplifying $230 \div 4$.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 7 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds often face "Language of Math" barriers. The mixed fraction is a significant distractor. While the rubric only requires identifying the operation for "score 1" in some contexts, the question as phrased is open-ended. If "identifying the operation" is the sole criteria for 1 mark, the score will be higher; however, in a standard performance context, many students stall at the mixed fraction. Given English-language barriers, "liter" and "travel" may be clear, but "5 3/4" acts as a heavy cognitive load.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Despite the rubric's focus on "Identifying the operation," student performance on fractions in Indian government schools often reveals significant "procedural scarring." The transition from whole number arithmetic to mixed-fraction multiplication is a major bottleneck.
