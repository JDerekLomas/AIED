Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English command "Differentiate" and the phrase "two key characteristics" into conceptual requirements (comparison and count).
2. **Category Retrieval**: Access the semantic schemas for "living" and "non-living."
3. **Characteristic Selection**: Select two traits for each (4 total) that meet the "key" threshold (growth, respiration, etc.).
4. **Structural Organization**: Formulate a response (likely a table or bulleted list) that maintains a 1:1 correspondence for contrast.
5. **English Composition**: Express these biological concepts in a second language with sufficient clarity for a grader to recognize the scientific term.

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules" (Systematic procedural errors)
1. **Quantity Misalignment**: Providing only one characteristic instead of the requested two (often due to misreading the English instruction or stopping once a single pair is found).
2. **Reciprocal Negation**: Stating "Living things move" and "Non-living things do not move." While technically true, students often use this for all points, failing to provide *distinct* characteristics as intended by "key characteristics."
3. **Pseudo-Differentiation**: Providing characteristics that are not mutually exclusive (e.g., "Living things are big" vs "Non-living things are small").
4. **Recall Substitution**: Providing examples (dog, rock) instead of characteristics (growth, respiration) because retrieval of nouns is cognitively "cheaper" than retrieval of abstract biological processes.
5. **Instructional Collision**: Confusing the "two" in the prompt with the "one" mentioned in the rubric (if the rubric's limited scope reflects how the teacher taught the task).

Step 3: Target student population analysis
Sixth-grade students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds face a high cognitive load when an open-ended question is asked in English. The shift from "recognition" (MCQ) to "production" (Recall) is the primary hurdle. "Respiration" and "Reproduction" are difficult terms to spell and retrieve in a second language; students may know the concepts in Hindi (Svasan/Janan) but fail the English production. Furthermore, the rubric is surprisingly punitive (giving 0.5 for a 2-characteristic question), which suggests a high threshold for "validity" during grading.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is foundational, the combination of multi-part recall, second-language barriers, and the specific requirement for "two" characteristics (leading to incomplete responses) makes this a high-error-rate item.
