Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. **Recognition of Form:** Identify the equation as two equivalent fractions requiring cross-multiplication.
2. **Cross-Multiplication/Distribution Preparation:** Set up the multiplication $5(x - 5) = 3(x - 3)$.
3. **Distribution:** Correctly multiply the constant across both terms in each binomial (e.g., $5x - 25 = 3x - 9$).
4. **Variable Isolation (Transposition):** Group terms with $x$ on one side and constants on the other (e.g., $5x - 3x = -9 + 25$).
5. **Arithmetic with Integers:** Corrected signed number addition/subtraction (e.g., $2x = 16$).
6. **Division/Final Solve:** Divide by the coefficient of $x$ to find $x = 8$.

Step 2: Buggy Rules/Common Errors
*   **Partial Distribution:** $5x - 5 = 3x - 3$ (multiplying only the first term).
*   **Sign Reversal during Transposition:** $5x + 3x = 25 - 9$ or $2x = -9 - 25$.
*   **Fraction "Flipping" Bug:** Cross-multiplying the numerators with each other or denominators with each other.
*   **Additive Interference:** $x - 5 + 5 = x - 3 + 3$, treating the denominator as a separate additive term.
*   **Integer Confusion:** $-9 + 25$ yielding $-16$ or $34$.

Step 3: Population Considerations
*   **Grade 8 Transition:** This is a peak period for the transition from arithmetic to abstract symbolic manipulation, where "repair theory" suggests students create flawed shortcuts to manage cognitive load.
*   **Linguistic Context:** "Solve for $x$" is a standard instruction, but the visual structure of the equation can trigger "visual cue" errors (treating the fraction bar as a subtraction) if conceptual understanding of ratios is weak.
*   **Open-ended Demand:** High. No multiple-choice options to provide feedback or allow for "plug-and-chug" verification.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the steps are foundational, the chain of logic is long. The "distribution to both terms" and "integer operations during transposition" are high-frequency failure points. In the context of government schools with varying degrees of remedial support, these "cumulative bugs" significantly depress the total correct response rate.
