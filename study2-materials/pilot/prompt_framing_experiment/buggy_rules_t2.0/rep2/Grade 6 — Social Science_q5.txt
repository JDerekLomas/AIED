Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic decoding of the prompt (specifically "main occupation" and "Vedic period") in English.
2. Long-term memory retrieval of the primary economic activities of the Early or Later Vedic periods (Pastoralism or Agriculture).
3. Evaluative selection of one primary occupation (since both are accepted by the rubric).
4. Conceptual retrieval of a "key aspect" related to the chosen occupation (e.g., cattle as wealth/Gavyuti or the use of iron plows).
5. Linguistic encoding/translation of the internal thought into a coherent English sentence structure.
6. Execution of written production (orthography and syntax).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. "Key-term Mapping Bug": Identifying "Vedic" but associating it with the Indus Valley Civilization (Trade/Urbanism) due to temporal proximity in the syllabus.
2. "Topic Generalization Bug": Assuming "Agriculture" is the answer for all ancient civilizations without specific Vedic nuance (this happens to be correct by the rubric but is a procedural shortcut).
3. "Partial Execution Bug": Answering only the first part of the question ("Agriculture") and ignoring the "Describe one key aspect" clause because the mental load of the second half exceeds English processing capacity.
4. "Literal Translation Bug": Using Hindi terminology (e.g., "Kheti") transliterated or finding an English word that doesn't fit the context.
5. "Attribute Mismatch Bug": Identifying the occupation correctly (Cattle rearing) but describing a feature of a different occupation (e.g., "they grew cotton").

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 6 students are in the "Concrete Operational" to "Formal Operational" transition. For those from economically weaker sections in Hindi-medium transitions, the primary barrier is the "Double Burden": they must master both new historical concepts and the L2 (English) language. Recall (open-ended) is significantly more difficult than recognition (MCQ) for L2 learners. The requirement to describe an "aspect" in English serves as a major filter that disqualifies many who might know the answer in their L1.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
The generous rubric (accepting either pastoralism or agriculture) increases the success rate, but the two-part open-ended English requirement for Grade 6 L2 learners creates a high failure rate in systematic production.
