Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Semantic Translation**: Translate the English terms "Evaluate," "public," and "private healthcare" into conceptual models (often involving mental translation to Hindi: *sarkari* vs *private*).
2.  **Comparative Retrieval**: Access a mental table of contrastive features (cost, accessibility, quality).
3.  **Selection & Constraint Satisfaction**: Filter retrieved information to select one valid "argument or example" for *each* sector.
4.  **Linguistic Encoding**: Synthesize the comparison into a written English sentence that satisfies the grammatical requirement of an "argument."
5.  **Output Alignment**: Ensure both sectors are mentioned to meet the rubric's "two features" requirement despite the question's complex phrasing.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1.  **Term-Attribute Mismatch**: Swapping characteristics (e.g., claiming public healthcare is expensive) due to anecdotal experiences vs. textbook definitions.
2.  **The "One-Sidedness" Bug**: Providing a detailed description of only one side (usually public) and neglecting the "key difference" aspect (omitting the second half of the comparison).
3.  **Labeling Error**: Confusing the word "Public" (which many students colloquially associate with "people/crowds") with private entities, or vice-versa.
4.  **Vagueness Bug**: Providing a generic statement like "one is good, one is bad" which fails the "valid argument/example" threshold.
5.  **Instruction Overload**: Focusing on "evaluate" and "argument" (higher-order tasks) and failing to provide the basic "examples" required by the rubric.

Step 3: Population-specific constraints
Grade 7 students in this demographic face a "double burden": they must demonstrate conceptual mastery of a socio-economic structure while navigating English-language barriers. In many Indian government school contexts, students have a strong intuitive understanding of the *sarkari hospital* experience but struggle to formalize it into the academic English required for a "1-mark" evaluative question, often leading to incomplete or non-scoring responses.
