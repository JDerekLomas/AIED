Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Visual Recognition: Identify the geometric relationship between the given angle (80°) and the unknown variable `x` (corresponding angles formed by a transversal intersecting parallel lines).
2. Justification: Recall and articulate the theorem/property (Corresponding Angles Postulate).
3. Substitution: Recognize that since the lines are parallel, `x = 80°`.
4. Transitive/Secondary Logic: Identify the relationship between `x` and `y` (Vertically Opposite or Linear Pair with the supplement) to find `y`.
5. Arithmetic/Equation: If necessary, calculate (e.g., $180 - 100$) if using a supplementary path.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "Parallel-Only" Bias: Students often assume any two lines are parallel and set $x = 80°$ even if markers or textual confirmation are missing.
2. "Visual Matching": Equating any two acute-looking angles or any two obtuse-looking angles without checking geometric properties.
3. Language Encoding Bug: Difficulty in writing the reason ("Corresponding angles") in English, leading to skipping the justification entirely or using the wrong terminology (e.g., calling them "Alternate").
4. Transcription/Alignment Error: Misidentifying which variable ($x$ vs. $y$) corresponds to which position due to spatial disorientation.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Medium of Instruction: Students may know the concept in Hindi ("समान्तर रेखा" or "संगत कोण") but struggle to formulate the answer/reason in English as required by many government rubrics.
2. Geometry Schema: Grade 8 students often struggle with multi-step reasoning where "x" must be found to find "y."
3. Rubric Rigidity: The rubric requires the *reason* and the *calculation*. Students frequently provide the number (80°) but fail to state "Corresponding angles," resulting in 0 marks according to the binary 0/1 rubric.

Step 4: Estimation
Given the high penalty for missing reasons (common in this demographic) and the cognitive load of translating geometric logic into formal English/Math notation:
