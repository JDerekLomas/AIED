Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English text to identify key constraints: "green pigment," "plant leaves," and "essential for photosynthesis."
2. Retrieve the specific domain term (Chlorophyll) from long-term memory.
3. Transliterate or translate the phonological representation (usually learned as /kloʊ-rə-fɪl/) into the correct English orthography.
4. Verify the retrieved term against the scientific function (ensuring it is not "chloroplast" or "stomata").

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. Terminology Substitution Bug: Students confuse the container with the contents (writing "Chloroplast" instead of "Chlorophyll").
2. Phonetic Encoding Bug: Due to Hindi-medium backgrounds, students may use phonetic spelling ("Clorofill," "Chlorofyl") which might be marked wrong depending on the strictness of the rubric.
3. Language Barrier Bug: Misinterpreting "pigment" as "part" or "process," leading to answers like "Leaf" or "Photosynthesis."
4. Retrieval Interference: Mixing up scientific terms ending in "-phyll" or beginning with "Chloro-" due to lack of reinforcement.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 7 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds face a high cognitive load when retrieving English technical terms. While the concept of "Hara rang" (green color) is well-understood, the shift from recognition (picking from a list) to recall (writing the word) significantly lowers success rates. Spelling is a major barrier in this demographic.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the "buggy" tendency to confuse chloroplast/chlorophyll and the spelling difficulty of a multi-syllabic English word, a significant portion will fail to provide the exact, correctly spelled term required by a standard 1-mark rubric.
