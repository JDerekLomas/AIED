Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Capitalize the first word of the sentence ("Riya").
2. Recognize "Meena" as a proper noun and capitalize it.
3. Recognize "Sunday" as a proper noun (day of the week) and capitalize it.
4. Identify the end of a declarative sentence and add a period (full stop).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. Proper Noun Bug: Capitalizing only the start of a sentence but treating internal proper nouns (Meena, Sunday) as common nouns.
2. Initial Letter Bug: Forgetting to capitalize the first letter because "riya" is a common name and the student is focused on the content, not the mechanics.
3. Partial Correction Bug: Identifying and fixing one capitalization error (usually the first name) but neglecting subsequent ones.
4. "The" Over-capitalization: Students occasionally capitalize common nouns they deem "important" (e.g., Market).
5. Ending Neglect: Completing the internal capitalization but omitting the terminal punctuation because the verbal flow of the sentence feels finished.

Step 3: Target population analysis
1. Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often have inconsistent foundational exposure to punctuation rules.
2. English as a second/third language (L2/L3) learners often map Hindi grammatical structures to English; since Hindi script (Devanagari) does not use cases (upper/lower), the concept of capitalization is not intuitive or phonetically signaled.
3. The "Sunday" capitalization rule is a common point of failure for L2 learners.
4. The rubric is "all or nothing" (Maximum score 1), meaning a single missed period or lowercase 'm' results in a score of 0. This lack of partial credit significantly lowers the success rate.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the sentence is simple, the requirement for 100% accuracy across four distinct mechanical interventions in a second language, where the primary language lacks an equivalent casing system, makes this a high-error-rate item.
