To analyze this task, we break down the cognitive and procedural demands for a Grade 6 student in the specified context:

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. **Tool Manipulation:** Place the protractor baseline precisely on the ray/line segment.
2. **Alignment:** Coincide the "origin" (center hole/crosshair) of the protractor with the vertex of the angle.
3. **Scale Selection:** Decide between the inner and outer scale (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise measurement).
4. **Marking:** Identify the 110°/40° mark and place a precise dot.
5. **Connecting:** Use a straightedge to draw the second ray from the vertex through the mark.

**Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)**
*   **"Wrong Scale" Bug (Most Common):** Students consistently use the scale starting at the wrong end. For 110° (an obtuse angle), they mark 70° (an acute angle) because both share a tick mark on different scales.
*   **"Edge vs. Baseline" Bug:** Aligning the bottom plastic edge of the protractor with the line instead of the printed 0° baseline.
*   **"Centering" Bug:** Misaligning the vertex with the corner of the protractor rather than the internal center point.
*   **"Reverse Construction" Bug:** Drawing from right-to-left but reading a left-to-right scale, leading to supplementary angle construction.

**Step 3: Student Context**
For Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections, procedural mastery of tools is often hindered by limited access to high-quality geometry kits (which may have worn-out markings). In a Hindi-medium/transitioning context, the "open-ended" nature of "draw an angle" requires higher executive function than a "measure this angle" task. 110° is specifically "trap-heavy" because it is obtuse; the likelihood of falling into the "Scale Selection" bug is extremely high compared to acute angles.

**Step 4: Holistic Assessment**
While drawing a 40° angle is relatively intuitive, the rubric awards the point for the 110° angle. The intersection of tool-handling errors, the cognitive load of selecting the correct scale for an obtuse angle, and the high prevalence of the "supplementary angle" bug suggests a high error rate.
