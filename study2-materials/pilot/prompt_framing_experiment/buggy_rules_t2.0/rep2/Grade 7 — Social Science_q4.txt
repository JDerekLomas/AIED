Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Linguistic decoding: Translate the abstract academic terms "transparency" and "governance" from English to conceptual equivalents (e.g., *pardarshita* and *shasan*).
2. Semantic retrieval: Access the schema related to "Democratic Rights," "RTI (Right to Information)," or "Accountability" from the Social Science curriculum.
3. Divergent generation: Ideate a specific mechanism (e.g., digitizing records, public hearings, RTI, open budgets).
4. English encoding: Formulate the internal idea into a written English sentence that meets the grammatical threshold for the teacher to recognize it as "plausible."

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
1. Terminology Overgeneralization: Confusing "transparency" (seeing in) with "honesty" (being good) or "efficiency" (working fast), leading to answers like "Don't take bribes" or "Work hard."
2. The "Buzzword Loop": Repeating the word in the definition (e.g., "Governance should be transparent") without providing a "way" (the procedure).
3. Concept Narrowing: Limiting "governance" only to "the police" or "the school principal," missing the systemic requirement of the rubric.
4. L1-L2 Mapping Error: Using Hindi syntax or direct translations that result in illegible English strings, causing the examiner to mark it incorrect despite a correct underlying concept.

Step 3: Student Context (Grade 7, Low SES, ESL)
At Grade 7, "transparency" is a high-level tier-3 vocabulary word. In Hindi-medium or low-resource contexts, students often rely on rote memorization of textbook back-questions. Because this is an open-ended "suggest" (HOTS) question rather than a "define" (LOTS) question, students cannot rely on verbatim recall if the prompt phrasing differs slightly from their notes.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric is lenient (only one way required), the triple hurdle of abstract vocabulary, the transition from recognition to production, and the language barrier for ESL learners significantly suppresses the success rate. Many will leave it blank or provide a generic moral statement ("Leaders should be good") which fails the "way to improve" criteria.
