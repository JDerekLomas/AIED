Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the term "Define" as a prompt to provide a formal semantic classification rather than an example.
2. Recall the lexical entry for "fable" and its specific differentiating attributes (short, animal characters, moral/didactic purpose).
3. Map these recalled concepts from a possible Hindi cognitive schema ("Neeti Katha" or "Panchatantra") into English vocabulary.
4. Synthesize the attributes into a syntactically correct English sentence (Subject-Verb-Complement structure).

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" or cognitive errors
1. The "Example as Definition" bug: Students provide an instance (e.g., "The Tortoise and the Hare") instead of a categorical definition.
2. The "Keyword over Structure" bug: Students list isolated keywords ("story," "animal," "lesson") without the syntactic glue required for a formal "definition."
3. The "L1 to L2 Translation Gap": Substituting more familiar but imprecise terms (e.g., "story for kids" or "funny story") because the technical term "moral" or "characters" is not retrievable in English.
4. The "Partial Definition" bug: Including the "animal" aspect but omitting the "moral lesson" component, which fails the rubric’s threshold.

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 8 students from EWS backgrounds in Hindi-medium settings often face a "threshold effect" where their conceptual understanding of a fable exists, but their expressive English proficiency acts as a bottleneck. An open-ended recall task is significantly more difficult than a multiple-choice recognition task, as it requires active retrieval of specific English academic language (CALP) rather than just everyday communication (BICS).

Step 4: Holistic estimate
Considering the requirement for three specific components (story, animals, moral) to be synthesized in a foreign language without cues, the success rate is expected to be low.
