Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic decoding: Translate/comprehend specific English vocabulary ("stunted," "yellowing," "infer," "evidence").
2. Biological retrieval: Link "yellowing/stunted growth" to its physiological cause (mineral deficiency or lack of resources).
3. Logical Inference: Connect the "observed symptom" to the "missing need" (backward reasoning).
4. English synthesis: Construct an explanatory sentence in English (or mixed language) that aligns with the rubric's requirement for "why."

Step 2: Common "Buggy Rules" and cognitive obstacles
- Over-generalization (The "Water Bug"): Attributes all plant failure to "no water" because that is the most visible household care task, ignoring the specific cues of "stunted/yellowing."
- Narrative substitution: Writing "the plant is sick" or "the plant will die" instead of identifying a specific *need* (identifying the state rather than the cause).
- Decoding Failure: Treating "stunted" as a non-signal word or misinterpreting "infer" as "describe," leading to a literal description of the prompt rather than an explanation.
- L1-L2 Mapping Error: Knowing the concept in Hindi (e.g., *poshan ki kami*) but being unable to retrieve the technical English equivalents (nutrients/minerals).

Step 3: Population-specific factors
- Grade 6: Students are transitioning from basic identification to "explaining" processes; open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice.
- ESL/Low-SES Context: Limited exposure to academic English outside school reduces the "guessability" of the question's phrasing. "Stunted" is a low-frequency tier 2 vocabulary word.

Step 4: Holistic analysis
While the rubric is generous (accepting sunlight/water/nutrients), the linguistic barrier of "stunted" and the demand for an open-ended explanation in a second language significantly decrease the success rate for this specific population.
