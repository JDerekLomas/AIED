Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Search long-term memory for the specific domain "Civics/Political Science" and the category "Fundamental Rights."
2. Linguistic Translation/Encoding: Translate concepts often learned in Hindi (Maulik Adhikar) or simple English into formal terminology (e.g., Equality, Liberty/Freedom).
3. Constraint Satisfaction: Ensure the retrieved items are "Fundamental Rights" specifically, rather than "Duties," "Preamble features," or general "Human Rights."
4. Quantity Check: Execute the count of two distinct items.
5. Written Production: Output the names with enough orthographic accuracy to meet the "simplified phrasing" rubric requirement.

Step 2: Identified "Buggy Rules"
1. Category Displacement (Substitution Bug): Confusing "Rights" with "Duties" (e.g., naming "Protecting the environment" or "Respecting the flag").
2. Domain Over-generalization: Naming any "good" thing provided by the government (e.g., "Free meals," "Uniforms," "Voting").
3. Terminology Fragmentation: Providing partial titles that lack the "right to" structure, potentially losing the core meaning (e.g., just writing "Equality").
4. List Truncation: Recalling only one specific right (e.g., Right to Education) and failing to generate a second distinct category.
5. Conceptual Overlap: Naming two variations of the same right (e.g., "Right to go anywhere" and "Right to speak") as two separate rights.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Medium Shift: Transitioning from Hindi-medium thinking to English-medium writing often leads to "tip-of-the-tongue" states where students know the concept but fail to retrieve the specific English label.
2. Recall vs. Recognition: The open-ended format is significantly more demanding than multiple-choice for this demographic.
3. Educational Rote: This specific topic is highly emphasized in Indian NCERT Grade 8 curricula, making it one of the most rehearsed sets of facts in Social Science.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While the procedural "bugs" (specifically Right vs. Duty confusion) are common, this is a "low-floor" question. In the context of Indian government schools, the "Six Fundamental Rights" are a core focus of repetitive drilling and high-stakes exams. Even students with low English proficiency often master the "Right to Equality" and "Right to Freedom" as high-frequency vocabulary. However, the requirement to produce two correct terms from memory without cues remains a significant hurdle for students at the lower end of the achievement spectrum.
