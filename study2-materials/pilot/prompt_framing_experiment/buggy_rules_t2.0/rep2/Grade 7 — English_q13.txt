Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Recall Article Rules**: Differentiate between vowel sounds (elephant) and consonant sounds (tiger), and recognize the specific/defined context of a location (zoo).
2. **Grammar Application**: Select "an" for "elephant," "a" for "tiger," and "the" for "zoo."
3. **Transcription/Writing**: Rewrite the entire sentence from scratch, maintaining the structural integrity of the prompt.
4. **Spelling and Syntax**: Accurately transcribe "elephant," "tiger," and "zoo" while maintaining the word order.

Step 2: Systematic procedural errors (Buggy rules)
1. **First-Letter Rule (Graphemic vs. Phonetic)**: Students often look at the letter rather than the sound (though "elephant" and "tiger" are straightforward, the rule "if it starts with a vowel, use an" is often misapplied to all words or ignored).
2. **Definiteness Blindness**: Using "a zoo" instead of "the zoo" because "zoo" doesn't start with a vowel sound, failing to recognize the situational specificity of the destination.
3. **Over-generalization of "An"**: Using "an" for all nouns to be "safe" because it feels more "English-like."
4. **Transcription Drop**: Leaving out words or failing to "rewrite the whole sentence" as required by the rubric (e.g., just filling the blanks).
5. **Vowel-only "An"**: Failing to use "an" for elephant because they simplify the rule to "always use 'a' except for 'apple' and 'orange'" (common in rote-learning environments).

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students from these backgrounds often struggle with the transition from filling blanks to rewriting full sentences. The requirement for a "fully correct" sentence makes the item highly sensitive to transcription errors. Many students will correctly identify "an elephant" and "a tiger" but fail the "the zoo" component or fail the procedural requirement to rewrite the entire string, resulting in a score of 0.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While the vocabulary is basic, the multi-step requirement (3 correct articles + full sentence rewrite) creates multiple points of failure. In a typical Indian government school context with English as a Second Language, the leap from recognition to error-free production is significant.
