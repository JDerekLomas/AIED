Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Recall: Retrieve specific attributes or names associated with a "best friend."
2. L2 Retrieval (Vocabulary): Translate those concepts into English nouns, adjectives, and verbs (e.g., "name," "play," "kind").
3. Syntactic Construction (Subject-Verb-Object): Arrange words into a valid English sentence structure (e.g., "My friend is Rahul.").
4. Morphological Agreement: Apply correct subject-verb agreement (e.g., "He like" vs "He likes").
5. Orthographic Encoding: Correctly spell the recalled words.
6. Punctuation/Capitalization: Apply sentence boundaries (Capital letters and full stops).
7. Quantity Constraint: Ensure the process is repeated for a second, distinct sentence.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. Subject-Drop: Omitting the subject because it is implied in the speaker's mind or follows Hindi "Pro-drop" patterns (e.g., "Is my friend" instead of "He is my friend").
2. Transliterated Syntax: Mapping Hindi word order directly onto English (e.g., "My friend's name Rahul is").
3. Infinite Verb Stem: Using the base form of a verb for all persons/numbers (e.g., "He play with me").
4. Phonetic Spelling: Writing words based on localized L1 pronunciation (e.g., "frand" for "friend").
5. Over-generalization of "is": Using "is" as a universal marker (e.g., "He is play cricket").
6. Boundary Failure: Writing two ideas as a single continuous string without punctuation.

Step 3: Population considerations
Students in Grade 6 from economically weaker sections often have significant "learning gaps." In this context, English is often taught as a rote subject. While many can recognize words (passive), the open-ended production (active) required for two grammatically "correct" sentences (as per the rubric) is a high cognitive load. Small errors in "likes" vs "like" or missing full stops often disqualify the score under strict rubrics.
