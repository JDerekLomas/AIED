Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Draw two perpendicular lines (X and Y axes).
2. Label the X-axis (Classes) and the Y-axis (Number of children).
3. Determine a numerical range for the Y-axis and select a consistent interval (scale) that accommodates the data (e.g., 10 or 20).
4. Mark equidistant ticks/intervals on the Y-axis and label them according to the scale.
5. Identify the height of the bar for each category based on the provided data.
6. Draw bars of uniform width and equal spacing to represent the data accurately.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. **Non-proportional Scaling:** Using a "nominal" scale on the Y-axis where data values are listed sequentially (e.g., 135, 120, 95) without consistent gaps, treating numbers as labels rather than quantities.
2. **Origin Error:** Starting the scale at the first data point instead of zero.
3. **Interval Inconsistency:** Changing the value of 1 unit mid-axis (e.g., jumping from 0-10, then 10-30).
4. **Mislabeling/No Labeling:** Forgetting to define what the axes represent, often due to English language barriers where the student knows how to graph but not the specific terminology ("Scale", "Label").
5. **Discrete vs. Continuous confusion:** Drawing bars touching (histogram style) when they should be separate, or failing to maintain equal bar widths.

Step 3: Population Considerations (Grade 7, Hindi-medium, EWS)
1. **Language Barrier:** The phrase "appropriate scale" is a high-level academic term that may not be understood by students with limited English proficiency.
2. **Spatial Reasoning:** Representing multi-digit numbers (like 135) on a scale of 10 or 20 requires mental division and estimation (positioning the line between 130 and 140), a common site for execution errors.
3. **Construction Tools:** Access to and precise use of rulers/pencils may vary; hand-drawn graphs often lack the precision required by formal rubrics.
4. **Cognitive Load:** The open-ended nature of "choosing a scale" is significantly harder than a task with a pre-labeled grid.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
While identifying the "maximum/minimum" (Part b) is a low-difficulty recognition task, the rubric specifically evaluates the construction of the graph (Part a). The "nominal scale" error (writing data points directly on the axis) is the single most common systematic bug in this demographic. Given the multi-step nature of axis construction and the linguistic demands of the prompt:
