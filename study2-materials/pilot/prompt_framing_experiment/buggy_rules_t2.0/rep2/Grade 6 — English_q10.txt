Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Decode the syntax**: Recognize the sentence structure as declarative (affirmative) rather than interrogative or negative.
2. **Retrieve semantic-grammatical rule**: Apply the rule that 'some' is typically used for affirmative statements with countable plurals, while 'any' is used for negative or interrogative contexts.
3. **Select and Verify**: Map the chosen word to the sentence context and confirm it "sounds right" (internal linguistic filter).

Step 2: Common "buggy rules"
1. **The Negative-Bias Overgeneralization**: Students often learn 'some/any' alongside 'not' or questions. They may generalize 'any' to mean "selection from a group" regardless of sentence polarity.
2. **Translation Interference (L1 to L2)**: In Hindi, the word 'kuch' (कुछ) serves both as 'some' and 'any' depending on context. A student might map 'some' and 'any' as synonyms for 'kuch' and select based on visual preference or frequency.
3. **Sound-Pattern Matching**: Choosing 'any' because it is a shorter, more frequent sight word in their limited English exposure, regardless of grammatical function.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students in EWS/Hindi-medium contexts often struggle with "function words" (quantifiers) which lack concrete imagery compared to nouns (apples/basket). While the task is recognition (multiple choice), the lack of English immersion means students often rely on rote memorization of rules rather than a felt "sense" of the language.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the simplicity of the sentence structure but the high likelihood of L1 interference and rule-confusion between 'some' and 'any', a significant portion of students will guess.
