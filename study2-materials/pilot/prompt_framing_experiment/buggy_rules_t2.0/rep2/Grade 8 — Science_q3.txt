Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English text to identify the key descriptor ("beaten into thin sheets") and the example ("aluminium foils").
2. Retrieve the semantic concept of metal properties from long-term memory.
3. Discriminate between related properties (Malleability vs. Ductility) based on the specific physical transformation described (sheets vs. wires).
4. Recall the specific technical term "Malleability."
5. Translate the phonological representation of the word into its English orthographic form (spelling).

Step 2: Buggy rules / systematic errors
1. **Property Confusion (Categorical Error):** Applying the rule for "ductility" to any mechanical deformation of metal.
2. **Associative Bug:** Linking "thin" to "transparency" or "softness" due to everyday language interference rather than technical definitions.
3. **Phonetic/Spelling Bug:** Providing a "near-miss" spelling (e.g., "Mallebelty," "Malibilty") which, depending on strictness, may be marked wrong in some rigorous rubrics.
4. **Linguistic Interference:** Mentally identifying the property in Hindi (आघातवर्धनीयता - Āghātavardhanīyatā) but failing to retrieve the English equivalent.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students from these demographics often struggle with the transition from recognition (multiple choice) to recall (fill-in-the-blank). "Malleability" is a low-frequency, multisyllabic academic word. For Hindi-medium background students, the phoneme-to-grapheme mapping of this specific word is a significant barrier even if the scientific concept is understood.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While this is a core curriculum fact, the combination of technical term discrimination and English production requirements in an open-ended format significantly lowers the success rate compared to recognition tasks.
