Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the phrase "minimum number of chocolates required to distribute... in equal quantity" (Inferring that the current 300 is insufficient and requires rounding up to the next multiple of 80).
2. Execute division/multiplication: 300 ÷ 80 or 80 × x > 300.
3. Determine the "ceiling" (4 chocolates per student) and calculate 80 × 4 = 320.
4. Interpret the second question: "How many chocolates did each class get?" based on the new total.
5. Division of the total (320) by the number of classes (8) or finding students per class (10) and multiplying by chocolates per student (4).

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- **The "Remainder as Answer" Bug:** Dividing 300 by 80 and providing either the quotient (3) or the remainder (60) as the answer for the first part.
- **Round Down Bias:** Logic that you can only distribute what you currently have (giving 3 each and ignoring the requirement for a "minimum required" total higher than the current stock).
- **Instructional Overload Bug:** Answering only the first or second question, as multistep word problems often trigger "stopping rules" once one calculation is done.
- **Syntactic Misinterpretation:** Mistaking "80 students" and "8 classes" as values to be operated on directly without relating them (e.g., 300 ÷ 8).
- **Language Barrier Bug:** Misunderstanding "minimum... required" in an English-medium assessment for a Hindi-medium student, leading to "300 - 80" or other non-division operations.

Step 3: Target Population Constraints
- Grade 8 students in this demographic often struggle with "open-start" problems where the algorithm isn't explicitly named (e.g., "Find the LCM" vs. a scenario requiring a multiple).
- Proficiency in division remains a significant hurdle in EWS government school contexts (as per ASER reports), especially when the divisor is two digits.
- The rubric requires a complex inference: identifying that 300 is the starting point but 320 is the target. This "rounding up" logic is cognitively more demanding than standard computation.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The combination of a high language load, a two-step "nested" word problem, the counter-intuitive requirement to find a number *larger* than the one provided (320 vs 300), and the requirement to get both parts correct for a single point makes this a high-difficulty item for this demographic.
