Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the academic terminology "differentiate," "autotrophic," and "heterotrophic" from English to conceptual understanding.
2. Recall the defining criteria: source of energy/carbon (self-synthesis vs. consumption).
3. Contrast the two concepts directly in written form.
4. Recall a specific biological example for a "producer" (e.g., green plants).
5. Recall a specific biological example for a "consumer" (e.g., humans/animals).
6. Encode the response back into English while maintaining scientific accuracy.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules" / Errors
1. **The "Everything is Food" Bug:** Misunderstanding "making food" as cooking (e.g., "Humans are autotrophs because mothers make food in the kitchen").
2. **The Partial Completion Bug:** Providing definitions but forgetting the "one example for each" instruction (a common procedural slip in multi-part prompts).
3. **The Reciprocity Bug:** Confusing the prefixes; defining autotrophs with the heterotroph definition and vice versa.
4. **The Phonetic/Spelling Interference:** Mixing up "Auto" (self) and "Hetero" (other) due to lack of Latin/Greek root familiarity in Hindi-medium backgrounds.
5. **The Semantic Over-extension:** Defining autotrophs only as "plants" and heterotrophs as "animals" without describing the *mode* of nutrition (the "category for concept" substitution).

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 7 is the transitional year for abstract biological classification.
- Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with "Differentiate" prompts in English, often resulting in "Vagueness Error" (using words like "help" or "get" instead of "synthesize" or "depend").
- Open-ended recall is significantly harder for ELL (English Language Learner) students than multiple-choice recognition.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that the question requires four distinct pieces of information (two definitions + two examples) for only 1 mark, the "All-or-Nothing" nature of the rubric makes it highly susceptible to the "Partial Completion Bug." Many students will provide the definition but miss an example, or vice versa.
