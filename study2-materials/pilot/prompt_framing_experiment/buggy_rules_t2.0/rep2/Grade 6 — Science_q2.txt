Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the specific English term "Photosynthesis" from long-term memory.
2. Recall the specific biological function of the "Leaf" (the 'kitchen').
3. Map the Hindi conceptual understanding (प्रकाश संश्लेषण / 'prakash sanshleshan') to the English phonetic representation.
4. Correctly spell "Photosynthesis" (a multi-syllabic, non-phonetic Greek-root word) to meet potential grading criteria.
5. Provide both components of the answer, as the rubric specifically mentions "Photosynthesis" but the prompt asks for two distinct items.

Step 2: Buggy Rules/Systematic Errors
1. "Single-Response Bias": Students providing only the name of the process (Photosynthesis) and omitting the plant part (Leaf), or vice-versa, due to the two-part nature of the prompt.
2. "Phonetic Approximation": Writing "Fotosynthesis" or "Photosinthesis," which may be marked incorrect by rigid markers.
3. "Functional Misidentification": Identifying the "Root" as the kitchen because it "takes in water/food," a common misconception regarding nutrient uptake vs. synthesis.
4. "Linguistic Substitution": Writing the answer in Hindi despite the medium of examination being English, resulting in zero marks.

Step 3: Target Student Population
Grade 6 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds face high cognitive load when retrieving specialized English vocabulary. At this stage, while "Photosynthesis" is a core concept, the ability to recall and spell it accurately in a second language without cues (no multiple choice) is significantly lower than their conceptual understanding.
