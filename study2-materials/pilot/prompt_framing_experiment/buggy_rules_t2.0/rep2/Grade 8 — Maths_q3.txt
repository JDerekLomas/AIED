Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Add the counts of black (4) and white (6) balls to find the denominator (Total Outcomes).
2. Identify the target color (Black) to find the numerator (Favorable Outcomes).
3. Construct the probability fraction: $P = \text{favorable} / \text{total}$.
4. (Optional but common) Simplify the fraction $\frac{4}{10}$ to $\frac{2}{5}$ or convert to decimal 0.4.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. **Ratio Error (The "Odds" Bug):** Students place favorable outcomes over non-favorable outcomes ($\frac{4}{6}$), treating probability like a ratio.
2. **Focus Error:** Students use the larger number as the numerator regardless of the question ($\frac{6}{10}$).
3. **Additive Bug:** Using addition/subtraction between the categories instead of division ($\frac{4}{6-4}$).
4. **Denominator Selection:** Only using the "white balls" (the second number mentioned) as the total ($\frac{4}{6}$).
5. **Simplification Bug:** Errors in reducing $\frac{4}{10}$ resulting in $\frac{2}{3}$ or $\frac{1}{2}$.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
For Grade 8 students in this context, the primary hurdle is linguistic. The phrase "drawn at random" and "favorable outcomes" are often learned as rote definitions in English but not understood conceptually. In Hindi-medium contexts, the term for probability (*prāyiktā*) is distinct, and the transition to English testing introduces "noise." Because the question is open-ended (recall), there is no cue to correct the "Ratio Error," which is the most common misconception in introductory probability for this age group.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the arithmetic is simple (4+6), the systematic confusion between "probability" and "ratio," combined with linguistic barriers in interpreting the word problem format, significantly lowers the success rate for the target population.
