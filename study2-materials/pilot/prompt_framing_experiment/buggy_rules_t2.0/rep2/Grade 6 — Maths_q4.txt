Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall the algorithm for the "Common Division Method" or "Prime Factorization."
2. Execute mental division/divisibility rules starting with the smallest prime (2).
3. Correct decomposition: $12=2^2 \cdot 3$, $15=3 \cdot 5$, $20=2^2 \cdot 5$.
4. Apply the LCM rule: Identify the highest power of each prime present ($2^2, 3^1, 5^1$).
5. Multiply the resulting factors ($4 \times 3 \times 5$).
6. Reach the final product (60).

Step 2: Buggy Rules
*   **HCF-LCM Confusion:** Finding the Greatest Common Divisor instead (result: 1), a high-frequency systematic error.
*   **"Partial Multiplication":** Multiplying the original numbers ($12 \times 15 \times 20$) because "common" implies aggregation.
*   **Divisor Omission:** In the ladder method, if a number isn't divisible by the current prime (e.g., 15 by 2), students often incorrectly "round" or leave it out rather than "carrying it down."
*   **Stopping Early:** Stopping division when they reach any prime, rather than reducing all terms to 1.
*   **Multiplication Fluency:** Simple errors in basic 1-digit multiplication or division facts (e.g., $60 \div 4$ errors).

Step 3: Contextual Constraints
Grade 6 is the transitional year for these concepts. In the context of EWS students and Hindi-to-English transition, "Least Common Multiple" is often decoded solely as "LCM" (the acronym). While the procedure is mechanical, it requires sustained accuracy across multiple tiers of calculation. The lack of multiple-choice options eliminates the "guess-and-check" strategy, placing a high load on retrieval.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the systematic confusion between HCF and LCM at this grade level and the high probability of a single calculation error in the three-number ladder method:
