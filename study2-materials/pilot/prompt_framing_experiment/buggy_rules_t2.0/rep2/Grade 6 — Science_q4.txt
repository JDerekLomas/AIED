Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic decoding: Translate the English prompt into internal conceptual meaning (Cotton/Garment + Summer + Property/Why).
2. Concept Retrieval: Access the specific scientific "why" stored in long-term memory (e.g., absorption of sweat or breathability).
3. Attribution Mapping: Isolate a "property" as distinct from a "usage" or "feeling" (scientific vs. colloquial language).
4. English Formulation: Construct a coherent sentence in English using technical vocabulary (absorber, porous, evaporation).
5. Output Monitoring: Ensuring the written response satisfies the constraint of "identifying one property."

Step 2: Buggy Rules/Systematic Errors
1. "The Usage as Property" Bug: Providing a benefit instead of a property (e.g., "It keeps us cool" or "It is soft").
2. "Language-Induced Overgeneralization": Using the Hindi term 'pashina' (sweat) but lacking the English word 'absorber', leading to vague phrasing like "Cotton is good for sweat."
3. "Partial Recall Bug": Identifying the material (Cotton) but failing to name a property, essentially restating the premise.
4. "Misattributed Mechanism": Thinking cotton "provides" coolness (active cooling) rather than facilitating sweat evaporation (passive cooling).

Step 3: Target Student Population Considerations
1. Medium of Instruction: In Hindi-medium or transitional schools, technical terms like "absorber" or "porous" are high-attrition words.
2. Formative Level: Grade 6 is the transition from General Science to more specific physiological concepts; the mechanism of evaporation/cooling is often only partially internalized.
3. Open-ended vs. MCQ: Unlike a multiple-choice question where "absorber" could be recognized, recall requires higher cognitive load, especially under linguistic constraints.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is culturally familiar, the requirement to name a specific *property* (not just a benefit) in *English* creates significant friction. Most students will grasp "why" intuitively but will fail to execute the precise scientific explanation required by the rubric.
