Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the English sentence structure to identify that two distinct pieces of information are required (name and category).
2. Retrieve the specific biological name "Lactobacillus" from long-term memory (Recall vs. Recognition).
3. Encode the name into written form with recognizable spelling.
4. Categorize the organism within the five-kingdom/microorganism classification system (Bacteria).
5. Map the relationship specifically to "curd" (distinct from fermentation by yeast/fungi).

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "The Naming Bug": Providing the common name or general term (e.g., "bacteria" or "germs") instead of the specific genus name required by the rubric.
2. "The Category Misalignment": Misidentifying the category as "Virus" or "Fungi" because these are the more common "famous" microorganism categories discussed in health contexts.
3. "Phonetic Spelling Bug": Errors in transliterating the multi-syllabic "Lactobacillus" into English script from a Hindi phonetic base, potentially leading to illegibility or incorrect terms.
4. "The Singular Response Bug": Students providing only the name and omitting the category, or vice versa, due to cognitive load in processing a compound question in a second language.

Step 3: Population Considerations
For Grade 8 students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds, the leap from the familiar Hindi term "Dahi" to the technical English "Lactobacillus" is significant. While this is a foundational "textbook" fact, the lack of scaffolding (no multiple choice) and the requirement for a dual-part answer increases the probability of incomplete or "buggy" responses. The extremely low mark value (0.5) may also lead to low effort or hurried responses.
