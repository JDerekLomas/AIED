Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decipher the domain-specific vocabulary terms "Synonym" and "Antonym" (mapping them to 'same' and 'opposite').
2. Recall the semantic meaning of the target word "quiet."
3. Access long-term memory to retrieve a related word with an identical or near-identical meaning (Synonym).
4. Access long-term memory to retrieve a word with the polar opposite meaning (Antonym).
5. Correctly assign each retrieved word to its specific labeled slot (preventing a swap error).
6. Encode the English words into written script (orthographic production).

Step 2: Common "buggy rules" or systematic errors
- Terminology Inversion: Swapping the definitions of synonym and antonym (treating "synonym" as opposite and vice versa).
- Phonetic/Translation Overload: Using the Hindi translation (e.g., *shanti*) instead of an English word due to high cognitive load.
- Categorical Association: Providing any word associated with "quiet" (like "library" or "shhh") rather than a word of the same grammatical class (Adjective).
- The "Un-" Overgeneralization: Applying a prefix to create a non-word (e.g., "unquiet") if the specific antonym (noisy/loud) isn't retrieved.
- Negative Carryover: Forgetting the second task after completing the first (leaving one blank).

Step 3: Target population considerations
- Grade 8 students in this demographic often have "functional" vocabulary but struggle with metalanguage (the words *synonym/antonym*). 
- Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice recognition; the lack of a word bank prevents "back-mapping."
- Hindi-medium backgrounds may lead to difficulty distinguishing between "quiet" (adj) and "quite" (adv), leading to retrieval of irrelevant words.

Step 4: Final estimate
While "quiet" is a common word, the requirement to correctly identify both abstract linguistic categories and produce two correct English spellings from scratch—without cues—poses a significant barrier for students with limited English proficiency and instructional gaps.
