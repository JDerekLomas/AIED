Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall the specific formula for the area of a triangle ($A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$).
2. Substitute the values $8$ and $6$ into the formula.
3. Perform multiplication ($8 \times 6 = 48$).
4. Apply the fractional operator/division by 2 ($48 \div 2$).
5. Finalize the numerical value (24) and ideally include units ($cm^2$), though the rubric focus is the formula application.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- **The "Rectangle/Square Rule" Bug:** Calculating Area as simply $base \times height$ (omitting the $\frac{1}{2}$). This is the most common bug in triangle area tasks.
- **Operator Confusion:** Adding base and height instead of multiplying.
- **The "Whole Number Division" Bug:** Successfully multiplying but forgetting the final step of halving.
- **Linguistic Misinterpretation:** Misidentifying "base" or "height" if the English terms are not firmly linked to Hindi equivalents (adhar/unshai).

Step 3: Population Considerations
- **Open-ended vs. MCQ:** Without options to provide a "hint" (recognition), students must rely on pure recall of the $\frac{1}{2}$ coefficient.
- **Socio-Economic/Language context:** Students in this demographic often show high proficiency in rote computation but struggle with formula retrieval if the "conceptual why" (a triangle is half a rectangle) wasn't reinforced. In many Indian government school contexts, the $A = L \times B$ formula for quadrilaterals is over-learned, leading to the omission of the $\frac{1}{2}$ in triangles.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the arithmetic ($8 \times 6 / 2$) is simple, the lack of a provided formula in an open-ended format for Grade 7 students typically results in a high "forgetting the half" rate.
