Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decipher the English interrogative structure (Who + lived) and identify "book" as the spatial anchor.
2. Retrieve the specific semantic detail (fairy) from a text read previously (long-term or working memory).
3. Distinguish between "the book" as an object and "the book" as a narrative setting.
4. Encode the answer into English text (retrieving the noun and modifiers if necessary).
5. Apply English syntax/spelling to output the response (orthographic production).

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" or procedural errors
1. The Literal/Real-World Bug: Students apply real-world logic instead of textual logic, answering with "words," "pages," or "stories" because fairies do not exist.
2. The Keyword Matching Bug: Students find the word "book" in the text but extract the wrong actor (e.g., the name of the protagonist who *owned* the book).
3. The Translation Lapsus: Students remember the concept in Hindi ("pari") but cannot retrieve the English equivalent ("fairy").
4. The Phonetic Approximation Bug: Spelling "fairy" as "fary," "fari," or "pari," which may be marked incorrect depending on the rigidity of the evaluator.
5. The Question Word Confusion: Mistaking "Who" for "Where" or "What," leading to a response about the book's location rather than its inhabitant.

Step 3: Target population considerations
- Grade 6 students in this context are often transitioning from mother-tongue instruction to English.
- Recall (open-ended) is significantly more difficult than recognition (MCQ) for students with limited English exposure.
- In economically weaker sections, lack of supplemental reading materials reduces familiarity with "fairy" tropes.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the reliance on specific vocabulary ("fairy") and the gap between narrative comprehension and English production in this demographic:
