Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Identify the properties of a parallelogram relevant to the figure (Opposite angles are equal; adjacent angles are supplementary).
2. Recognize that $x$ and the given angle (70°) are supplementary (or find $y$ first).
3. Execute the subtraction: $x = 180 - 70$.
4. Formulate a verbal or written explanation for the value of $x$ (e.g., "Adjacent angles in a parallelogram sum to 180 degrees").

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. **The "Opposite = All" Bug:** Students often overgeneralize the property of equality, assuming all internal angles in a parallelogram are equal (concluding $x = 70$).
2. **Complementary vs. Supplementary:** Confusion between 90, 180, and 360 degrees, leading to $x = 90 - 70 = 20$.
3. **Internal/External Confusion:** If $x$ is marked externally, students may fail to map the interior relationship.
4. **Explanation Failure:** Providing the correct number (110) but failing to provide the requisite explanation required by the rubric for the full 1 point.

Step 3: Population-specific factors:
- **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, providing a clear explanation in English (as often required in formal testing) creates a high "linguistic floor."
- **Lack of Manipulatives:** In low-resource settings, geometry is often taught as rote theorem memorization rather than spatial understanding.
- **Precision in Explanation:** Grade 8 students frequently skip "the why," which according to this specific rubric, results in a score of 0 despite a correct calculation.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis:
While Grade 8 students should know parallelogram properties, the "all or nothing" nature of the rubric—requiring both the correct calculation (110) and an explanation—is a high hurdle for this population. The systematic error of setting adjacent angles equal is highly prevalent.
