Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the syntax of the question (recognizing the "Why..." prompt despite the ungrammatical word order/lack of auxiliary verb).
2. Recall or locate the specific text reference from Leo Tolstoy’s "Three Questions."
3. Translate the abstract concept of "never failing" to the pragmatic acquisition of knowledge (timing, people, actions).
4. Synthesize the answer in English.
5. Apply correct grammatical structure (Subject-Verb-Object) to explain causality, avoiding L1 (Hindi) literal translation patterns.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. "Literal Transliteration": Translating "Vah socha" directly to "He think" or "He thoughted," ignoring English tense markers.
2. "Copula Omission": Omitting "is/was" or auxiliary verbs (e.g., "Because he know").
3. "Pattern Matching Error": Copying sentences from the text that contain the words "king" or "fail" without filtering for the actual "Why."
4. "The Tense Shift": Mixing past tense ("wanted") with present tense ("knows") due to L1 influence where tense marking differs.
5. "Wh- Question Syntax Bug": Misinterpreting the prompt's declarative word order ("the king felt") as a statement rather than a question, leading to a "Repeat-The-Prompt" error.

Step 3: Target population analysis
Grade 7 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds face a "Double Burden": they must master complex philosophical reasoning (the King’s motivation) while battling a low English threshold. The "open-ended" format removes the scaffold of multiple choice. Most students will likely understand the *intent* of the story in their L1 but fail to map that understanding onto the English rubric requirements, particularly regarding the specific triad of answers (right time, people, action).

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While many students will recognize the story, the combination of the prompt's awkward phrasing ("Why the king felt..." vs "Why did the king feel...") and the requirement to synthesize three distinct factors into 2-3 coherent English sentences creates a high failure rate for "fully correct" status under a standard rubric.
