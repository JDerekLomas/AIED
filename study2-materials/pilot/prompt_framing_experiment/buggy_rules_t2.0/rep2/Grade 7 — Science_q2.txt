Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Read and decode the English text describing the scenario (spoon, hot tea, handle).
2.  Map the scenario to the specific scientific domain of thermal energy transfer.
3.  Differentiate between the three modes of heat transfer (conduction, convection, radiation) based on the medium (solid metal spoon).
4.  Retrieve the technical term "Conduction" from long-term memory (Recall vs. Recognition).
5.  Encode/write the term "Conduction" (either in English or transliterated).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1.  "Mode Confusion": Attributing heat transfer in all liquids/container scenarios to "Convection," ignoring the material of the spoon itself.
2.  "Attribute Overshadowing": If the student focuses on the tea (liquid) rather than the spoon (solid), they systematically select Convection.
3.  "Phonetic/Orthographic Slip": Spelling "Conduction" as "Convection" or "Condensation" due to similar linguistic profiles and English-medium interference.
4.  "Linguistic Filtering": Inability to map the Hindi concept of 'चालन' (Chālan) to the English word "Conduction" despite understanding the physics.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 7 is the introductory year for formal thermodynamics in this curriculum. Students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds often struggle with the precise nomenclature required for open-ended recall tasks. Since the rubric is "all-or-nothing" for the 0.5 mark and requires the specific term (a), any linguistic gap results in a zero.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the linguistic barrier, the high probability of "Convection" as a distractor for any tea-related question, and the shift from recognition (MCQ) to recall (Free Response), the success rate is likely below the mean.
