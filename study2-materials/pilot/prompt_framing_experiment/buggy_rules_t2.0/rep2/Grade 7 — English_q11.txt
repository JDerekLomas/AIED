Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the sentence "A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony" (requires English vocabulary and syntax recognition).
2. Retrieve the linguistic definition of an "adjective phrase" (a group of words acting as an adjective) versus a single "adjective."
3. Parse the sentence to identify noun phrases ("A tiny bird", "its nest", "our balcony").
4. Isolate descriptors within those phrases.
5. Differentiate between a single modifier ("tiny") and a prepositional phrase acting adjectivally (none present here, though "in our balcony" is an adverbial/prepositional phrase).
6. Match the identified segment to the rubric’s requirement (note: the rubric incorrectly labels the single word "tiny" as the target, despite the question asking for a "phrase").

Step 2: Systematic buggy rules
1. "Single-Word Bug": Students define "phrase" and "word" synonymously, leading them to pick the first descriptive word they see.
2. "First-Noun-Modifier Bug": Assuming the adjective always precedes the first noun (often works for simple sentences, fails for complex ones).
3. "Position-Based Selection": Selecting any word that isn't a noun or verb based on its position in the sentence.
4. "Label Confusion": If the student actually knows what a phrase is, they will fail because the correct answer to the question (an actual phrase) isn't "tiny," but the rubric expects "tiny."
5. "The Rubric Mismatch": Stronger students may search for a phrase (e.g., "very tiny" or "in our balcony") and be confused when they only see a single adjective, while weaker students will simply look for a "describing word."

Step 3: Student population considerations
1. For Hindi-medium students, the distinction between *visheshan* (adjective) and *visheshan padbandh* (adjective phrase) is a high-order grammatical concept often not mastered in the L2 (English) by Grade 7.
2. "Tiny" is a low-frequency word compared to "small" or "little" for ESL learners from economically weaker sections.
3. The conflict between the question (Phrase) and the rubric (Word) creates a trap for the most proficient students, while the vocabulary barrier creates a trap for the least proficient.
