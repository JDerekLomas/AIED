Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall and translate the abstract term "rights" into specific entities (e.g., Education, Protection, Participation).
2. Distinguish "child rights" from general fundamental rights or school-based rules.
3. Retrieve exactly two distinct items.
4. Select one of the retrieved rights for elaboration.
5. Retrieve the specific socio-legal purpose (the "why") of that right.
6. Construct a sentence in English that articulates this abstract concept (significant demand for Hindi-medium learners).

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules"
1. List-All Rule: Providing a long list of rights without executing the second "explanation" command.
2. Rule/Duty Substitution: Confusing "rights" with "duties" (e.g., "Helping parents" or "Coming to school on time").
3. Semantic Blending: Naming general needs (e.g., "Food and water") instead of codified rights.
4. Single-Item Completion: Stopping after naming two rights, ignoring the second procedural branch (the importance explanation) due to high cognitive load.
5. Literal Importance: Defining the right instead of explaining its importance (e.g., "Education means going to school" rather than "It helps get a job").

Step 3: Target student population analysis
Grade 6 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds face a "Double Demand." They must recall complex civics content while navigating English syntax. Because the rubric asks for two rights AND an explanation but offers only 1 mark total, the "reward-to-effort" ratio is low. In high-poverty contexts, limited access to enrichment materials often results in rote memorization of one-word answers, making the "explanation" step a high-barrier hurdle.
