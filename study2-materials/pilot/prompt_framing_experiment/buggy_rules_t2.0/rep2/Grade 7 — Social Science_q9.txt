Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic decoding: Understand the instruction "Assess" and the concept "Economic life" in a non-native language (English).
2. Knowledge Retrieval: Access the mental schema for historical wars (e.g., Sultanates, Mughals, or Cholas).
3. Variable Isolation: Isolate specifically "economic" outcomes from broader political or social outcomes.
4. Logical Linkage: Connect war actions (taxation, looting, resource diversion) to an impact (poverty, treasury depletion, trade disruption).
5. Linguistic Encoding: Construct a coherent sentence in English that fits the "plausible impact" criteria of the rubric.

Step 2: Buggy rules
- Concept Confusion Bug: Conflating "Economic" with "Social" (e.g., "many people died") or "Physical" (e.g., "buildings were broken").
- Recall Generalization Bug: Providing a generic "War is bad" statement without identifying a distinct economic mechanism.
- Keyword Association Bug: Seeing "Kingdoms" and describing the king's life instead of the "economic life" of the realm.
- Instruction Ignorance Bug: Misinterpreting "Assess" as "Describe a war" (providing a narrative of a battle rather than an analysis of its effects).

Step 3: Population factors
- Grade 7 students are transitioning from concrete to abstract historical thinking.
- The open-ended format is high-stakes for ELL (English Language Learner) students; they often have the conceptual understanding but fail the "encoding" step or avoid the question due to "Assess" being a Tier 2 academic word they don't recognize.
- In EWS/Hindi-medium contexts, the gap between internal conceptualization (in L1) and external production (in L2) significantly increases the error rate.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
The abstraction required to distinguish "economic life" from "general history," combined with the language barrier and the shift from rote recognition to recall-based assessment, suggests a high failure rate despite the low bar of the rubric (identifying just one impact).
