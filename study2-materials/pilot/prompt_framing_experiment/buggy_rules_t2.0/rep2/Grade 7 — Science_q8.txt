Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Knowledge Retrieval: Recall that turmeric and hibiscus are natural indicators.
2. Setup/Execution: Formulate a process to apply the liquid to the indicators (either making a paste/solution or adding the liquid directly).
3. Observation: Correctly associate specific color changes with pH levels (Turmeric: Yellow $\rightarrow$ Red for Base, remains Yellow for Acid; Hibiscus: Pink $\rightarrow$ Green/Yellow for Base, Pink $\rightarrow$ Dark Red/Magenta for Acid).
4. Logic Mapping: Connect the observed color back to the classification of the unknown liquid.
5. Translation: Express this scientific logic in English, navigating the vocabulary of "indicators," "extracts," and color shifts.

Step 2: Common Buggy Rules
- The "Inversion Bug": Switching color outcomes (e.g., thinking turmeric turns red in acid).
- The "Binary Symmetry Bug": Assuming that if it turns red in a base, it must turn the "opposite" color (e.g., blue or green) in an acid, rather than staying yellow.
- The "Distractor Neglection": In a multi-material question, the student focuses only on one indicator and fails to address the "hibiscus" component if they perceive it as "extra" information, or they get confused by conflicting results if they misremember one.
- The "Translation Gap": Students understand the reaction but lack the English syntax to explain the "If... then..." conditional structure required for a 1-mark open-ended response.

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 7 students are at a transition point from concrete to formal operational thought. For EWS students in Indian government schools, "Science" is often taught via rote memorization of textbook back-questions. Because this is an open-ended "How will you determine..." question (recall-based) rather than a multiple-choice question (recognition-based), the "production deficit" is high. Limited English proficiency often leads students to write one-word answers (e.g., "Color change") which, according to many strict state-level marking schemes, would not satisfy a "Describe" rubric.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is foundational, the combination of remembering two different indicators, the specific "non-change" of turmeric in acid, and the linguistic burden of explaining the procedure in a non-native language suggests a high failure rate. Many students will likely confuse the hibiscus results with litmus or confuse the turmeric reaction.
