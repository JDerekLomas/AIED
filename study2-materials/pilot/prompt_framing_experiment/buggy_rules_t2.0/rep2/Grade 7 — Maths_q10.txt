Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Translate the word problem from English to a mathematical model (Length $L=10$, Perimeter $P=32$).
2. Recall the correct formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: $P = 2(l + w)$ or $2l + 2w$.
3. Substitute known values into the equation: $32 = 2(10 + w)$.
4. Solve for $w$: Divide by $2$ or distribute ($32 = 20 + 2w$), then subtract $20$, then divide by $2$.
5. Recall the formula for area: $A = l \times w$.
6. Execute the final multiplication: $10 \times 6 = 60$.

Step 2: Systematic Procedural Errors (Bugs)
*   **Formula Confusion:** Using $l \times w = 32$ (confusing perimeter with area) or $l + w = 32$ (forgetting the multiplier 2).
*   **Order of Operations (PEMDAS) Bug:** Adding before distributing, or incorrectly isolating $w$ (e.g., $32 = 20 + w \Rightarrow w = 12$).
*   **Concept-to-Label Bug:** Finding $w=6$ but stopping there, failing to calculate area as requested (two-part task completion error).
*   **Calculation Slip:** Simple arithmetic errors in division ($32/2$) or subtraction.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle to distinguish "Perimeter" and "Width" if they are more familiar with terms like *Parimap* and *Chaurai*.
*   **Recall vs. Recognition:** The rubric requires an open-ended constructive response. In EWS school contexts, students often rely on rote memorization of templates; if the template differs slightly (finding $w$ instead of $P$), performance drops significantly.
*   **Compound Demand:** The rubric requires finding both width and area to get 1 mark. Any single error in the chain leads to a score of 0.

Step 4: Holistic Estimation
The multi-step nature of the problem, combined with the linguistic hurdle and the high "bug" potential in multi-step algebraic manipulation, makes this a high-difficulty item for the described demographic.
