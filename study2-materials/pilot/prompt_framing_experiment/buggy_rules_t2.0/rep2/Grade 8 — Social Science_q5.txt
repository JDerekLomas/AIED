Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Term Deciphering**: Decode the technical terms "biodiversity" and "sustainable development" from English to conceptual understanding (or translation to Hindi: *jaiv vividhata* and *satat vikas*).
2. **Relational Mapping**: Identify the functional link between biological variety and the maintenance of resources over time.
3. **Retrieval**: Recall specific examples of ecosystem services (pollination, nutrient cycling, etc.) as required by the rubric.
4. **Synthesis/Encoding**: Formulate a coherent sentence in English (a second/third language) that connects these concepts causally.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules" / Cognitive Errors
1. **The Definitional Bug**: Students define the terms in isolation (e.g., "biodiversity means many plants and animals") but fail to execute the relational step ("importance for...").
2. **The Synonym Bug**: Conflating "sustainable development" with "planting trees" or "stopping pollution," leading to a generic environmentalist response that misses "ecosystem services."
3. **The Language-Transfer Bug**: Thinking of the answer in Hindi but being unable to translate technical verbs, leading to "Biodiversity is good for life" (too vague for the rubric).
4. **Keyword Association Bug**: Seeing "biodiversity" and "importance" and listing benefits of animals (meat, milk, leather) rather than systemic "ecosystem services" required by the rubric.

Step 3: Population/Format Considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often rely on rote memorization of "guidebook" answers. In an open-ended recall format, the cognitive load of producing a precise explanation in English is high. Without "ecosystem services" (a high-level academic term) explicitly in the response, they fail the rubric's specific criteria.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the precision required by the rubric ("ecosystem services") versus the linguistic and conceptual barriers faced by students in under-resourced schools, most will provide a "correct-adjacent" answer that fails the technical requirement of the rubric.
