Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decipher the English instruction ("Imagine you are a bird") which requires mapping abstract vocabulary to a conceptual frame.
2. Adopt a first-person perspective (using "I" instead of "It" or "Bird").
3. Retrieve English vocabulary related to bird actions (fly, eat, sky, wings).
4. Construct a syntactically correct sentence (Subject-Verb-Object).
5. Apply correct tense (present or past) and basic punctuation.
6. Translate internal Hindi thoughts into English output (avoiding literal transliteration).

Step 2: Common "buggy rules" or systematic errors
1. Perspective Bug: Referring to the bird in the third person ("The bird fly in sky") due to a misunderstanding of "Imagine you are."
2. L1 Syntax Transfer: Applying Hindi word order (S-O-V) to English (S-V-O), e.g., "I sky in fly."
3. Subject-Verb Agreement Bug: "I flies" or "Bird fly."
4. Null Subject/Pro-drop: Dropping the subject entirely ("Flying in sky").
5. Phonetic/Orthographic Bug: Confusion between "bear," "beard," and "bird," or phonetic spelling of complex English vowels.

Step 3: Population-specific considerations
The task requires high-level linguistic synthesis (recall) rather than recognition. For Grade 6 students in EWS/Hindi-medium contexts, English is often a "foreign language" rather than a second language. The cognitive load of "imagining" (abstract) while "composing" (functional) creates a high probability of failure at the intersection of vocabulary and syntax. Even if a student understands the concept, the rubric demands "grammatically correct," which punishes common interlanguage errors.
