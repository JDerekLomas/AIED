Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Scan the text to identify the line-ending words ("rain", "grain", "borrow", "tomorrow").
2. Auditorily or phonetically process the vowel and coda sounds of the ending words (Phonological mapping).
3. Compare the phonemes of the target word pairs to identify matches (rimes).
4. Recall the convention of "rhyming words" (requires linguistic transfer if the concept was learned in Hindi as *Tukant Shabd*).
5. Extract and pair the correct words in written form.

Step 2: "Buggy rules" and systematic errors
1. **The "Positional Match" Bug:** Choosing words that are vertically adjacent or in the same position in a sentence regardless of sound.
2. **The "Visual/Orthographic" Bug:** Assuming words must look alike to rhyme (e.g., failing to recognize "borrow/tomorrow" as a pair because "borrow" ends in -ow and "tomorrow" ends in -ow but they have different syllable counts/stress patterns, or over-relying on letter matching).
3. **The "Last Word" Bug:** Simply writing the last word of the last two lines ("borrow", "tomorrow") because of a procedural rule that rhymes are always at the end of the stanza.
4. **The "Incomplete Pair" Bug:** Writing only one word instead of the required pair.
5. **The "Synonym" Bug:** Confusing the linguistic term "rhyme" with "meaning," providing words with similar definitions.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Language Interference:** Students might struggle with the "borrow/tomorrow" slant rhyme due to non-native stress patterns in Indian English, making "rain/grain" the much safer target.
2. **Limited English Proficiency:** The inability to "sound out" the words internally (phonemic awareness) makes the task an orthographic matching game rather than a phonetic one.
3. **Productive vs. Receptive:** Since this is open-ended, the student must correctly identify and transcribe the words, increasing the margin for spelling or grouping errors.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While "rain/grain" is a very accessible, high-frequency pair with clear orthographic symmetry, the combination of ESL phonological barriers, the common confusion between "borrow/tomorrow" as a potentially distracting pair (which actually rhymes well in most Indian accents but might look "harder"), and general procedural "bugs" in mapping English sounds suggests a moderate success rate.
