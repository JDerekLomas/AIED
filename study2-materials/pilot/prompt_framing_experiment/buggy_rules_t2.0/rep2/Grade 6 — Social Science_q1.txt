Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Linguistic Decoding: Understand the command "Name" and the quantity "any two."
2. Conceptual Filtering: Distinguish between a "mountain range" (linear system) and a specific "peak" (point location).
3. Geographical Scoping: Access mental map to verify that the retrieved range is "located in India" (excluding foreign ranges like the Alps or Andes).
4. Lexical Retrieval: Recall the specific proper nouns from long-term memory.
5. Written Encoding: Translate the phonetic name into English orthography.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "The Peak-for-Range Swap": Providing the name of a specific peak (e.g., Mount Everest, K2, Kanchenjunga) instead of a range.
2. "The Boundary Overgeneralization": Identifying ranges like the Himalayas as purely Indian, or mistakenly listing the Hindu Kush due to proximity in South Asian maps.
3. "The Partial Execution Bug": Listing only one name despite the "any two" instruction (often triggered by high cognitive load in retrieval).
4. "The Spelling-Induced Freeze": Student knows the name in Hindi/phonetically but lacks confidence to transcribe it in English, leading to omission or garbled output.
5. "State-as-Mountain Bug": Conflating a mountainous region/state (e.g., "Kashmir", "Himachal") with the name of the mountain range itself.

Step 3: Target Population Analysis
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often rely on rote memorization from textbooks. The move from Recognition (MCQ) to Recall (Open-ended) is a significant cognitive jump. Limited English proficiency often results in students leaving blanks if they cannot recall the exact English term, even if they possess the conceptual knowledge in their mother tongue. Furthermore, a 0.5-mark maximum score suggests this is a minor sub-item, which may lead students to spend less effort on thoroughness (missing the second range).

Step 4: Holistic Estimation
While the Himalayas are almost universally known, retrieving a second distinct range (like the Aravallis or Vindhyas) and correctly identifying them as "ranges" rather than "peaks" significantly lowers the success rate in a recall-based format for this specific demographic.
