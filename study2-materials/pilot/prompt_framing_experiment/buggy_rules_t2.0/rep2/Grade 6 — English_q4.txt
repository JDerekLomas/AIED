Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the instruction: Understand the meta-linguistic command "find a word in the passage that means."
2. Semantics mapping: Analyze the stimulus phrase "shining brightly" to establish a semantic target (light + intensity).
3. Text scanning: Systematically scan the English text, matching lexical items against the established semantic target.
4. Discrimination: Evaluate candidates (e.g., distinguishing between "bright," "light," or "sun" vs. the target "glowing").
5. Extraction/Orthography: Transcribe the specific word from the text to the answer sheet accurately.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. Synonym Substitution (Prior Knowledge Bug): The student provides a synonym they already know (e.g., "bright," "shiny," or "glitter") instead of extracting the specific word "glowing" from the text.
2. Contextual Association Bug: Identifying a noun associated with the action rather than the adjective/participle (e.g., writing "sun" or "lamp").
3. Letter-String Matching Bug: If the word "brightly" appears in the text, the student might copy the sentence containing it rather than finding the synonym.
4. L1 Interference: Mentally translating "shining brightly" to a Hindi concept (e.g., Chamak) and failing to map it back to a less common English word like "glowing."

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Vocabulary Depth: "Glowing" is a low-frequency word for Grade 6 EWS students compared to "shining" or "bright." 
2. Open-Ended Format: This is a production task, not a multiple-choice recognition task, which significantly increases cognitive load and decreases the probability of "guessing" correctly.
3. Language Barrier: For ESL learners, the nuances of participial adjectives ("glowing") are often acquired later than simple adjectives.
