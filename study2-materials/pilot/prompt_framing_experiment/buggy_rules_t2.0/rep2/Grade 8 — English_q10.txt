Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Identify and replace the intensifier "very" with the adverb "too."
2. Delete the full stop and the repeated subject/pronoun ("He").
3. Delete the negative auxiliary verb/modal ("cannot") to shift to the implicit negative of the "too...to" structure.
4. Transform the main verb "walk" into an infinitive by adding the particle "to."
5. Concatenate the fragments into a single, syntactically correct sentence structure.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **Redundant Negative Bug**: Retaining "cannot" (e.g., "He is too weak to cannot walk"), resulting from an inability to recognize that "too" carries an inherent negative valence.
2. **Double "To" Confusion**: Confusion between "too" (adverb) and "to" (preposition/particle), leading to spelling swaps or using the same word for both.
3. **Conjunction Bug**: Treating it as a compound sentence rather than a complex structure (e.g., "He is too weak and to walk").
4. **Intensifier Retention**: Keeping "very" alongside "too" (e.g., "He is too very weak to walk").
5. **Infinitive Fragment**: Dropping the subject in the second clause but failing to use the infinitive (e.g., "He is too weak walk").

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students in this context are often transitioning from grammar taught as discrete, rote rules to applied syntax. Since English is often a second or third language (ESL/ELL), and the test is open-ended (recall), students cannot rely on cues from multiple-choice options. The mapping of the Hindi construction "itna... ki nahi" (so... that not) maps more cleanly to "so... that" than "too...to," creating a cross-linguistic interference.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the transformation is a staple of Indian "Do as directed" grammar sections, the density of "bugs" (specifically the removal of the negative and the infinitival transformation) creates a high probability of partial success but failure to meet the rubric's requirement for a "fully correct" sentence.
