To analyze this item, we must consider the intersection of linguistic barriers, conceptual abstraction, and systematic "bugs" in socio-political reasoning.

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. **Linguistic Decoding:** Translate the English sentence "Why is a Parliament necessary for a country that follows democracy?" into a mental model (often in Hindi).
2. **Concept Retrieval:** Identify "Parliament" (Sansad) and "Democracy" (Loktantra).
3. **Relational Reasoning:** Retrieve the functional link between these entities (representation or law-making).
4. **Linguistic Encoding:** Synthesize a coherent sentence in English that meets the rubric (since the test is in English, even if the medium is transitioning).

**Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"**
1. **Definition-Function Swap (The "Identity" Bug):** When asked "Why is X necessary," the student provides a definition instead ("Parliament is a big building where leaders meet").
2. **Key-word Association (The "Trigger" Bug):** Seeing "Democracy" triggers a canned definition of democracy ("Of the people, by the people...") without linking it to Parliament.
3. **Local v. Global Substitution (The "Pradhan" Bug):** Substituting the macro-concept (Parliament) with more tangible local governance experiences (the Pradhan or Police), leading to answers like "to help people" or "to provide roads."
4. **Linguistic Attrition:** Students may have the correct concept in Hindi but lack the English vocabulary ("Representative" / "Legislation") to fulfill the specific rubric requirements, leading to fragmented, un-scorable output.

**Step 3: Target Population Analysis**
Grade 8 students in this context are transitioning to abstract political theory. While the concept of "voting" is concrete, the structural necessity of a "legislative body" as a representative concept is a high-order abstraction. Given the open-ended recall format and the English language barrier for Hindi-medium backgrounds, the cognitive load is significantly high.

**Step 4: Holistic Estimate**
Many students will provide "half-correct" or tangential answers (e.g., "because we vote") that fail the specific law-making or representation criteria of the rubric. The combination of linguistic friction and the "Identity" bug (defining instead of explaining necessity) will likely exclude a large portion of the cohort.
