Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Recall the Angle Sum Property of a triangle: The sum of all interior angles equals 180 degrees.
2.  Identify the values of the two given angles from the figure (implied to be 180 - total given).
3.  Formulate an algebraic equation or arithmetic sequence: $Angle 1 + Angle 2 + x = 180$.
4.  Perform the addition of the two given angles correctly.
5.  Subtract the sum from 180 correctly to find $x$.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1.  **Angle Addition Bug:** Adding given angles incorrectly due to vertical alignment errors or carrying mistakes.
2.  **Property Misclassification:** Using 90 degrees or 360 degrees as the sum instead of 180 (confusion with right angles or quadrilaterals).
3.  **Operation Reversal:** Subtracting 180 from the sum of the angles because "larger must subtract smaller."
4.  **Language/Context Barrier:** For a Hindi-medium student, "Find the angle" may be misunderstood if they rely on visual cues only and miss the "C" reference in the rubric's specific logic.
5.  **External Angle Confusion:** Treating the internal angle as an external one if the diagram has extended lines.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students in this demographic are often transitioning from concrete arithmetic to abstract geometry. Limited English proficiency means word problems are difficult, though symbolic geometry is more accessible. However, the requirement to produce a calculation (recall) rather than choose from options (recognition) significantly increases the "slip" rate. In economically weaker sections, foundational gaps in multi-digit subtraction with regrouping (e.g., $180 - 100$) are frequent systematic errors.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that the rubric is very specific (only 0.5 marks, requiring finding angle C), and considering the high likelihood of calculation slips and property confusion at this level:
