Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Decoding the technical terms "primary role" and "Panchayati Raj" (requires linguistic translation if thinking in Hindi).
2.  Retrieving the specific functional purpose of the institution from long-term memory (distinguishing it from the structure/levels of the system).
3.  Synthesizing the concepts of "local" and "governance/administration" into a coherent response.
4.  Formulating the answer in English (per the medium of the test) using correct syntax to convey agency and function.

Step 2: Systematic procedural errors ("Buggy Rules")
1.  **Definitional Substitution:** Defining *what it is* (three tiers: Gram Panchayat, etc.) rather than *what its role is*.
2.  **Category Error:** Identifying a specific project (building roads, wells) as the "primary role" rather than the systemic role of governance.
3.  **Keyword Matching:** Recalling the term "Democracy" or "Gandhi" but failing to link it to the procedural mechanism of local administration.
4.  **Translation Bottleneck:** Knowing the concept in Hindi ("Apni sarkar") but being unable to retrieve the English academic equivalents ("Self-governance," "Grassroots").

Step 3: Target population considerations
The open-ended nature of the question (Recall vs. Recognition) significantly increases the difficulty for students with limited English proficiency. While "Panchayati Raj" is culturally relevant, the transition from functional understanding to an academic definition in a second language often results in "fragmentary recall," where students provide a related word but not a complete conceptual role.
