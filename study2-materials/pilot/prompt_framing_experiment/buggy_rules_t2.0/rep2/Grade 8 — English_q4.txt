Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Scan the text to locate specific semantic cues related to weather, air, or temperature.
2. Filter the located words to match the exact definition "a light wind."
3. Distinguish between similar but distinct nouns (e.g., air, gust, gale, wind, breeze).
4. Verify the chosen word is actually present in the provided passage (and not recalled from general vocabulary).
5. Transcribe the word "breeze" accurately from the text to the answer sheet.

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules"
1. The "Definition-Synonym Swap" bug: Writing "wind" instead of "breeze" because the student identifies the category but fails the specificity of the sub-type.
2. The "Keyword Proximity" bug: Selecting whatever word appears immediately before or after "wind" in the text, regardless of meaning.
3. The "External Vocabulary" bug: Writing a synonym known from outside the text (e.g., "cool air") that is not actually in the provided passage.
4. The "Partial Scan" bug: Stopping at the first word related to weather/movement found in the text.
5. The "Phonetic Translation" bug: Difficulty mapping the sound /briːz/ to the English spelling due to interference from Hindi phonetics.

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 8 students from these backgrounds often struggle with English as a second or third language. The task requires semantic decoding (understanding the definition) followed by a visual search and retrieval. In Hindi-medium contexts, nuances between "breeze," "wind," and "gust" are rarely emphasized, leading to high category errors. Open-ended retrieval is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice recognition for students with limited English exposure.
