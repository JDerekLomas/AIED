Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Retrieval/Search: Access mental schemas related to "Rajasthan" and "natural resources" (Recall, not recognition).
2. Selection: Identify and isolate at least two distinct items that qualify as "natural resources" (e.g., minerals, solar, wind).
3. Linking/Causality: Select one of the two and link it to a specific human/societal outcome (lives of the people).
4. English Language Encoding: Formulate a sentence in English that correctly expresses this causal relationship.
5. Verification: Ensure both the "naming" and "explaining" constraints are met within the answer.

Step 2: Known Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. Categorical Over-extension: Listing man-made structures or cultural features (forts, tourism, "sand") as natural resources.
2. Property-Association Swap: Describing a resource's physical property instead of its influence on people (e.g., "Copper is a metal" instead of "Mining copper provides jobs").
3. Language-Switch Stalling: A student identifies the resource in Hindi (e.g., 'Sangmarmar') but lacks the English vocabulary ('Marble') or syntax to explain its influence, leading to an incomplete answer.
4. "The Only Feature" Bias: Only mentioning water/desert (scarcity) because it is the most salient schema for Rajasthan, failing to name a second distinct resource as required.

Step 3: Contextual Constraints
Grade 6 is a transitional year where students move from concrete naming to abstract explanation. For EWS students in Hindi-medium transitions, the cognitive load of simultaneous recall (Science/Geography) and English syntax (Language) is high. An open-ended recall question with a two-part requirement (Name + Explain) has a high "fail-point" rate compared to multiple-choice questions.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
The rubric is relatively strict (requires two resources plus an explanation) for a single mark. While the topic is culturally relevant, the "Mention any two" + "Explain one" requirement is a multi-step demand that often triggers "half-finished" responses from this specific demographic.
