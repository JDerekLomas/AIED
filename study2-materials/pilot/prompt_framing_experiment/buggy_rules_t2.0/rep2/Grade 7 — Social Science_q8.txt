Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the English sentence (specifically the key terms "occupations," "rural," and "brief").
2. Retrieve geographical facts specific to the state of Rajasthan (as distinct from India generally).
3. Recall and select at least two distinct categories of work (e.g., kheti/agriculture and pashupalan/animal husbandry).
4. Synthesize the description of one selected occupation into an English sentence.
5. Apply the rubric's "multi-step" logic: provide two names + one description within a 1-point constraint.

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
1. **The "Topic Matching" Bug:** Identifying general Rajasthan traits (heat, desert, camels) instead of specific "occupations."
2. **The "List-Only" Bug:** Providing a list of nouns (Agriculture, Mining) but failing to "describe in brief" due to English literacy barriers.
3. **The "Over-generalization" Bug:** Attributing urban or modern jobs (IT, Factories) to "rural" contexts.
4. **The "Single-Target" Bug:** Providing only one occupation because the description part of the prompt consumes the cognitive load.
5. **The "Language-Switch" Bug:** Formulating the concept in Hindi but failing to translate "Animal Husbandry" or "Handicrafts" into the correct English terminology.

Step 3: Population Considerations
For Grade 7 students from EWS backgrounds in Hindi-medium or transitional English-medium government schools, the cognitive load is doubled by "Recall vs. Recognition." Unlike a multiple-choice question, this requires productive English vocabulary. While students likely know that Rajasthani villagers farm or keep cattle, the requirement to produce the English terms "Agriculture" or "Animal Husbandry" and then write a descriptive sentence in English acts as a significant barrier.

Step 4: Holistic Estimation
The discrepancy between the question's requirement (2 names + 1 description) and the low point value (Max score: 1) often leads to "Satisficing," where a student provides a partial answer that fails the strict rubric. Combined with the English language proficiency gap in rural contexts, the success rate is notably low for a full-mark response.
