Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English prompt to identify the specific narrative reference ("Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy).
2. Retrieve the three distinct concepts from long-term memory (Time, People, Action).
3. Translate those concepts back into English syntax.
4. Synthesize the components into a cohesive sentence that aligns with the "what" and "wanted" structure of the question.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. **The "Single-Item Retrieval" Bug:** Students often provide only one of the three components (usually "time") assuming a partial answer suffices for a "what" question.
2. **The "Topic Matching" Bug:** Identifying the king and the story but reciting a general plot point (e.g., "The king went to the hermit") rather than the specific questions.
3. **The "Syntax Scrambling" Bug:** Attempting to use the words "what," "when," and "who" but failing to structure them as answers, leading to nonsensical phrases like "The king wanted what time."
4. **L1-L2 Transfer Bug (Hindi-English):** Using Hindi sentence structure with English words, often omitting the infinitive "to" or the auxiliary "did/wanted."

Step 3: Population Considerations
The Grade 7 text is a standard NCERT item. While familiar, the "open-ended recall" format is significantly harder for students with limited English proficiency than "multiple-choice recognition." In EWS (Economically Weaker Section) contexts, lack of supplemental reading often means students rely on rote memorization of "question-answers" provided in class. If the exact wording from a notebook is forgotten, the procedural ability to reconstruct the answer in English is low.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that this requires a "three-part" correct answer (conjunctive logic) for a single point, the probability of success drops. A student may know the answer in Hindi but fail to produce the English equivalent required by the rubric.
