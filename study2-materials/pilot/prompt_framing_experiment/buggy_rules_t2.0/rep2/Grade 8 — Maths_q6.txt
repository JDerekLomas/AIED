Step 1: Procedural Steps
1.  **Linguistic/Conceptual Decoding**: Translate "thrice his age" into the multiplication operation (12 × 3).
2.  **Arithmetic Calculation (Current Age)**: Compute 12 × 3 = 36.
3.  **Temporal Projection (Rahul)**: Add 5 to current age (12 + 5 = 17).
4.  **Temporal Projection (Father)**: Add 5 to current age (36 + 5 = 41).
5.  **Subtraction (Age Difference)**: Subtract 17 from 41 (or 12 from 36) to find the difference.
6.  **Invariant Recognition (Alternative Short-cut)**: Realize that the age difference remains constant regardless of the time elapsed.

Step 2: Systematic Procedural Errors (Bugs)
*   **"Thrice" Confusion**: In many Hindi-medium contexts, students might mistake "thrice" for "plus three" (12 + 3) or simply struggle with the vocabulary word "thrice" if instruction has been inconsistent.
*   **Additive Aging Bug**: Adding 5 years to only one person (Rahul or the Father) but not both before calculating the difference.
*   **The "Double Projection" Error**: Adding 5 + 5 = 10 to the sum or difference erroneously.
*   **Age Change Error**: A common misconception that the difference between ages changes over time (thinking the difference will grow by 5 years or be multiplied by the 5-year factor).
*   **Subtraction Placement**: Mis-ordering the subtraction (e.g., 36 - 17 if the father's age wasn't updated).

Step 3: Population Considerations
*   **Language Barrier**: "Thrice" is a high-level English vocabulary word for a student transitioning from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds; "Three times" is more common.
*   **Cognitive Load**: For Grade 8 students, this is a multi-step word problem. While the arithmetic is simple, the transformation from "natural language" to "mathematical model" is where the highest failure rate occurs in Indian government school contexts (as noted in ASER reports).

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
While the arithmetic (12 × 3) is Grade 3 level, the systemic challenge of "constant difference" and the English terminology "thrice" and "age difference" creates a significant hurdle. Many students will correctly find the father's current age (36) but will then either provide "36" as the final answer or add 5 to the difference (24 + 5 = 29), failing to realize the difference is constant.
