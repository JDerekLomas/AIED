Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Linguistic Decoding: Decode the English sentence structure and identify the keyword "opposite" (antonym) and the target word "slow".
2. Semantic Retrieval: Access the mental lexicon to find the conceptual opposite of "slowness" (speed).
3. Lexical Selection: Select the specific English word "fast" (or "quick") that maps to the concept.
4. Orthographic Mapping: Recall the correct spelling and letter sequence for the word.
5. Graphic Execution: Write the word legibly on the paper.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. Synonym-Antonym Confusion: Identifying a synonym (e.g., "lazy" or "low") instead of an antonym due to confusion over the word "opposite".
2. Hindi-English Literal Translation: Mentally identifying the Hindi word "Tez" but being unable to translate it back to the English "fast".
3. Overgeneralization of Suffixes: Attempting to create an opposite using "un-" or "dis-" (e.g., "unslow"), a common rule-application error in second-language learners.
4. Phonetic Spelling Bugs: Spelling the word as it sounds in a local accent (e.g., "pust" or "fust") or swapping vowels.
5. Associative Triggers: Writing a word that is contextually related but not an antonym (e.g., "turtle" or "run").

Step 3: Population Considerations
For Grade 6 students in Indian government schools from Hindi-medium backgrounds, "slow" and "fast" are part of the "Level 1" basic vocabulary. However, the open-ended recall format (requiring spelling) is significantly harder than a multiple-choice format. Limited English proficiency means many students may recognize the word "slow" but fail to decode the instruction "opposite," a term often introduced later or confused with "similar."

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While "slow" is a basic word, the shift from oral/recognition to written/production in an L2 environment typically reveals a 20-30% drop in accuracy due to spelling errors or instruction-decoding failure among lower-performing cohorts.
