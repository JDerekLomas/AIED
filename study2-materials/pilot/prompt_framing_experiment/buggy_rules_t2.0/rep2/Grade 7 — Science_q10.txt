Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the technical term "string" (a common Indian textbook typo for "sting") and the overall English phrasing into conceptual meaning.
2. **Fact Retrieval (Specific Chemistry)**: Recall the chemical nature of the substances involved: that wasp stings are alkaline/basic and bee stings are acidic.
3. **Fact Retrieval (Treatment Chemistry)**: Recall the chemical nature of the remedies: that vinegar is acidic and baking soda is alkaline/basic.
4. **Relational Mapping**: Match the acid-base pairs (Alkaline Wasp + Acidic Vinegar; Acidic Bee + Alkaline Baking Soda) to the general rule of interaction.
5. **Categorization**: Identify the formal scientific name for this specific type of reaction (Neutralization).
6. **Production/Encoding**: Write the correct term "Neutralization" in English (as required by the curriculum) while explaining the reasoning.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. **Attribute Misassignment**: Systematic swap of pH values (thinking bees are basic and wasps are acidic), leading to a "reversal bug" where the logic holds but the classification is wrong.
2. **Generalization Over-extension**: Using a single rule for both insects (e.g., "all insects are acidic"), leading to confusion about why two different remedies are used.
3. **Term Confusion (Synonym Bug)**: Using "Reaction" or "Mixing" or "Cleaning" as the principle instead of the specific chemical category "Neutralization."
4. **Phonetic Spelling/Translation Bug**: Attempting to describe the process in broken English or Hindi (e.g., "zeher khatam karna") which may not meet strict rubric requirements for the "Chemical Principle."
5. **Substance Misidentification**: Mistaking vinegar for a base or baking soda for an acid based on common household associations.

Step 3: Population Considerations
*   **Vocabulary Barrier**: "Neutralization" is a long, multisyllabic academic word in a non-native language. 
*   **Typos in Item**: The use of "string" instead of "sting" increases the cognitive load for English Language Learners (ELL).
*   **Recall vs. Recognition**: As an open-ended question, students lack the scaffolding provided by multiple-choice options.
*   **Conceptual Depth**: Grade 7 is the introductory year for formal Acid-Base chemistry; students often remember that they "fix" the pain but forget the "principle."

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is common in the curriculum, the combination of specific factual recall (which sting is which), linguistic hurdles (the "string" typo and English production), and the requirement of a formal term ("Neutralization") creates significant friction for this specific population.
