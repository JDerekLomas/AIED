Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Textual Comprehension: Deciphering "maximum value" and "exact number of times" as indicators for the Highest Common Factor (HCF/GCD).
2. Translation: Identifying 75 and 69 as the operands.
3. Factorization: Executing prime factorization for 75 ($3 \times 5 \times 5$) and 69 ($3 \times 23$) or using the long division method.
4. Intersection: Identifying the common factors (3).
5. Conclusion: Formulating the final answer with units (3 kg).

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
- The "Keyword Association Bug": Mistaking "maximum" for "multiplication" or "multiple," leading students to calculate the LCM ($1725$) instead of the HCF.
- Prime Factorization Bugs: Forgetting the divisibility rule for 3; failing to identify 23 as a prime number (common systematic error: trying to divide 23 by 3 or 7).
- Calculation/Subtraction Bugs: If using the Euclidean algorithm/long division, errors in basic subtraction ($75 - 69$).
- Termination Bug: In prime factorization, stopping before reaching 1 or misidentifying 1 as the only common factor.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
- Grade 6: Students are just beginning to transition from concrete operations to formal algebraic logic.
- Linguistic Barrier: "Measure the weight... an exact number of times" is complex phrasing. In many Hindi-medium settings, students are trained on specific trigger words. If "Mahattam Samapavartak" (HCF) isn't explicitly mentioned, the cognitive load of translation increases failure rates significantly.
- Scoring/Rubric: The high penalty (only 0.5 points) suggests a high-stakes/low-reward pressure which can trigger "careless" execution of procedural steps.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
The combination of a linguistic "bottle-neck" (the phrase "exact number of times") and the prime number 23 (which students often find difficult to process) makes this item deceptively difficult. In a typical economically disadvantaged Indian urban/rural school setting, a majority of students will either attempt LCM due to keyword confusion or stall at factorizing 69.
