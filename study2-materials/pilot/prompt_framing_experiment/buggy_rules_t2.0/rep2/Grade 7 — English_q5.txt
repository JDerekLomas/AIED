Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English syntax of the question ("How is...", "described").
2. Retrieve the specific poem "The Squirrel" by Mildred Bowers Armstrong from long-term memory.
3. Access the specific visual metaphor used in the text (the "question mark" for the tail).
4. Translate the mental image or recalled phrase into an English sentence or phrase.
5. Encode the response orthographically (spelling "question mark" or "tail" correctly enough to be legible).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. Keyword Matching Error: Seeing "How" and "Squirrel" and describing the squirrel’s behavior (eating nuts) rather than its physical description.
2. Narrative Logic Bug: Describing what a squirrel’s tail looks like in real life (bushy, brown) rather than how it is "described in the poem."
3. Vocabulary Retrieval Gap: Recalling that it looks like a symbol but unable to retrieve the English word "Question Mark," leading to a blank or L1 (Hindi) response.
4. Literalism Bug: Confusing the "question mark" shape with the act of asking a question.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Grade 7 students in this demographic often treat English as a "memory-based" subject; if the poem was taught recently, recall is higher, but if not, retrieval of specific imagery is low.
2. English proficiency: Writing an open-ended English phrase is significantly harder than a multiple-choice item. Hindi-medium backgrounds make "question mark" a technical term that may not be used in daily speech.
3. Economically weaker sections (EWS) often correlate with higher rates of absenteeism or lower access to textbooks for revision.
