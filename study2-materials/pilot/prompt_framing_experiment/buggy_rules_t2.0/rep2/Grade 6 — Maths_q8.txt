Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Recall the formula for the Area of a rectangle ($A = L \times B$).
2. Substitute the values: $15 \times 8$.
3. Execute the multi-digit multiplication ($15 \times 8$).
4. Recall the formula for the Perimeter ($P = 2(L + B)$).
5. Substitute and calculate the perimeter ($2 \times 23 = 46$).
6. Assign correct units ($\text{cm}^2$ for area, $\text{cm}$ for perimeter).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
- Formula confusion: Using the perimeter formula for area or vice versa.
- Partial execution: Calculating only one value (Area) and neglecting the other (Perimeter), or vice versa.
- Multiplication error: Miscalculating $15 \times 8$ (common error: $8 \times 5 = 40$, forget to carry the $4$, result $84$).
- Perimeter "Side-Add" bug: Adding only two sides ($15 + 8 = 23$) instead of four ($15+8+15+8$).
- Unit omission/mismatch: Forgetting to include units or using "cm" for area.

Step 3: Student context:
In Grade 6 (EWS/Hindi-medium context), the bilingual transition often leads to confusion between the terms "Area" (क्षेत्रफल) and "Perimeter" (परिमाप). While the math is foundational, the rubric is binary (Score 1 or 0) and requires two distinct operations to be correct. The "and" in the question is a significant hurdle; students frequently stop after finding the first required value in open-ended prompts.

Step 4: Estimation:
Given the multi-step nature of the task and the strict rubric requiring two different formulas to be recalled and executed without error for a single point, the success rate is likely low.
