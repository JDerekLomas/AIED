Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Remove quotation marks and insert the subordinator 'that'.
2. Identify the referent of the first-person pronoun 'I' and change it to the third-person 'she' (Deictic shift).
3. Apply backshift of tense: convert Present Continuous ('am reading') to Past Continuous ('was reading').
4. Maintain the reporting verb 'said' and ensure the sentence remains syntactically coherent in English.

Step 2: Potential "buggy rules"
1. **Punctuation retention:** Keeping quotation marks while changing pronouns (Overgeneralization of the speech act).
2. **Pronoun preservation:** Leaving 'I' as 'I' because the student equates the person with the subject regardless of perspective (Failure of deictic centering).
3. **Tense-match bug:** Leaving 'am' as 'am' or changing it to 'is' to match the new pronoun but failing to backshift (Failure to recognize the past-tense reporting verb's influence).
4. **Keyword replacement error:** Changing 'said' to 'told' without adding an object ('She told that...'), a common transfer error from classroom drills.
5. **Vague past tense:** Changing 'am reading' to 'read' or 'has read' (Inaccurate aspectual shift).

Step 3: Student population factors
* **Language interference:** In Hindi, indirect speech often utilizes the literal reported words followed by 'ki' (that) without shifting tense or pronouns as strictly as English requires.
* **Recall vs. Recognition:** Without a multiple-choice prompt, students must generate the grammatical structure from scratch, increasing the likelihood of syntax breakdown.
* **Vocabulary vs. Syntax:** While 'reading a novel' is simple vocabulary, the multi-layered transformation of auxiliary verbs is a high-order English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) task.
