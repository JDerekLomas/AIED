Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Identify the need to isolate variable `y` by moving `+9` across the equals sign.
2. Apply the inverse operation rule (changing addition to subtraction).
3. Set up the arithmetic expression: `y = 4 - 9`.
4. Perform integer subtraction where the subtrahend is larger than the minuend.
5. Correct apply the sign rule to the result ($4 - 9 = -5$).

Step 2: Potential Buggy Rules:
- "Always Subtract Small from Large": The student calculates $9 - 4 = 5$, ignoring the negative sign entirely.
- "Addition Bias": Student sees the plus sign and adds the two constants regardless of position ($y = 13$).
- "Sign Change Failure": Student moves 9 across the equal sign but fails to change the sign ($y = 4 + 9 = 13$).
- "Integer Confusion": Recognizing a negative is required but placing it incorrectly or assuming the larger number's sign remains positive.

Step 3: Population Factors:
Grade 8 is the transitional year for pre-algebra. However, for students from low-SES backgrounds in the Indian public system, transition from rote arithmetic to abstract algebra is a known "bottleneck." Limited English proficiency often leads to heavy reliance on procedural memorization rather than conceptual understanding of "equality," making them more susceptible to "buggy rules" when a problem produces a negative result.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While the equation is a one-step linear equation, the requirement to subtract a larger number from a smaller one is a major "trap" for students struggling with basic integer fluency. Many students will provide the answer "5" or "13."
