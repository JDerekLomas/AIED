Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Lexical retrieval of specific geographic markers: Identify "Rajasthan" as the constraint.
2. Recall from Long-Term Memory (LTM): Access names of at least two specific events (e.g., Pushkar Mela, Gangaur, Teej).
3. Verification/Constraint satisfaction: Ensure the recalled items are "important" and unique.
4. Semantic processing: Select one item and recall its specific "attraction" or "significance."
5. Sentence construction: Formulate a coherent sentence in English (or the target language of instruction) that maps the attribute to the specific festival.
6. Execution: Write down the answer following the multi-part structure of the prompt.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. Over-generalization: Listing national festivals (Diwali, Holi) that are celebrated in Rajasthan but are not specific "important festivals of Rajasthan" as intended by the curriculum.
2. Recall Failure/Interference: Forgetting names or confusing Rajasthan with neighboring states (e.g., listing Baisakhi or Garba).
3. The "Name-Only" Bug: Students often stop after the first part of a multi-part question, failing to execute the "Describe" step (common in high-stakes/timed environments).
4. Circular definition: Describing the significance using the name (e.g., "The attraction of Pushkar Fair is that it is a fair.")
5. Translation/Linguistic bottleneck: The student knows the fact in Hindi but lacks the English vocabulary/syntax to construct the required "one sentence" for the second part.
6. The "Any" Heuristic: Interpreting "any two" as the only requirement and ignoring the description constraint due to cognitive load.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 6 students are transitioning from rote concrete operational thinking to formal operational thought. For EWS students in Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English-medium phrasing creates a significant "double burden"—recalling the content while navigating a foreign syntax. Open-ended recall is significantly harder than recognition (Multiple Choice), and many students may lack the "Schema" for structured written responses beyond one-word answers.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the cultural knowledge is present, the requirement for three distinct pieces of information (Name 1, Name 2, and a specific descriptive sentence) combined with the linguistic barrier and the "one-sentence" constraint makes the full execution vulnerable to many failure points.
