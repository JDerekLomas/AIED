Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the terminology: Differentiate between Marked Price (MP), Selling Price (SP), and Cost Price (CP).
2. Calculate Discount Amount: Apply 10% to ₹1200 ($1200 \times 0.10 = 120$).
3. Calculate Selling Price (SP): Subtract discount from MP ($1200 - 120 = 1080$).
4. Relate SP to CP via Profit: Recognize that $SP = CP + 8\%$ of $CP$, or $SP = 1.08 \times CP$.
5. Algebraic Manipulation: Set up the equation $1080 = 1.08 \times CP$ or use the formula $CP = \frac{SP \times 100}{100 + P\%}$.
6. Division: Execute $1080 / 1.08$ (or $108000 / 108$) to find the CP.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "Additive Profit Bug": Adding the 8% profit directly to the SP ($1080 + 8\%$ of $1080$) or simply adding the percentages ($10\% + 8\% = 18\%$).
2. "Percentage of MP as Profit": Calculating 8% of the ₹1200 instead of 8% of the CP.
3. "Subtraction/Calculation Slip": Error in decimal placement during the division of 1080 by 1.08.
4. "Term Confusion": Using the discount percentage on the SP instead of the MP.
5. "One-Step Completion": Students stop after finding the SP (₹1080) because they have successfully completed one major calculation and assume the task is finished (common in high-anxiety testing).

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Linguistic Load: For Hindi-medium students, terms like "Marked Price" and "Cost Price" are often conceptually mapped to "Ankit Mulya" and "Kray Mulya." If the exam is in English, the semantic retrieval of which formula applies to which term adds a layer of cognitive friction.
2. Recall vs. Recognition: Without options (multiple choice), there is no "anchor" to signal if the CP (₹1000) looks more plausible than the SP (₹1080).
3. Fractional Thinking: Calculating a 10% discount is high-success, but the inverse operation (finding CP from a marked-up SP) is a classic "bottleneck" concept in Grade 8.

Step 4: Final Holistic Estimate
While finding the SP is accessible (Step 3), the multi-step jump to CP and the high likelihood of applying the profit percentage to the wrong base (SP instead of CP) typically creates a significant drop-off. In many Indian government school settings, while rote formulaic knowledge is high, the "Net CP" application is where 60–70% of students typically deviate into systematic errors.
