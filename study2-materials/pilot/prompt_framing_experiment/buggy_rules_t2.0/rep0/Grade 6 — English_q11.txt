Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Parse the English sentence to distinguish between the subject ("The children") and the predicate.
2. Isolate the lexical verb (the action) within the predicate ("playing").
3. Identify the auxiliary verb ("are") that indicates tense/aspect.
4. Apply the syntactical rule that a "verb phrase" in this context consists of the auxiliary + the main verb.
5. Filter out the direct object ("football"), which is part of the predicate but not the verb phrase.
6. Write/extract the multi-word unit correctly as a cohesive string.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
- "Action-only Bias": Identifying only the lexical verb ("playing") as the verb, omitting the auxiliary because "are" doesn't denote a physical action.
- "Last-word Attraction": Selecting "football" because it is at the end of the sentence or follows the action.
- "Subject-Verb Fusion": Including the subject (e.g., "children are playing") because the student views the whole "actor-action" unit as the verb phrase.
- "Object Inclusion": Selecting the entire predicate ("are playing football") based on a common misconception that everything after the subject is the "verb."
- "Hindi-English Syntax Interference": In Hindi, the auxiliary comes after the main verb (*khel rahe hain*); students may struggle with the discontinuous or leading auxiliary in English syntax.

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 6 students from EWS backgrounds often have low exposure to formal linguistic terminology (the distinction between "verb" and "verb phrase"). The term "verb phrase" is technical and abstract. For Hindi-medium students, identifying "are" (a linking/auxiliary verb with no direct semantic equivalent in the same syntactic position) as part of a single functional unit is cognitively demanding.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
Given the open-ended nature of the question (recall) rather than multiple-choice (recognition), students are highly likely to produce "playing" (the most salient action word) rather than the technical "are playing." The lack of English immersion typically results in high "Action-only Bias" and "Object Inclusion" bugs.
