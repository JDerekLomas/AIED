Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Visual Recognition: Identify the geometric figure as a triangle (recognizing the closed three-sided shape).
2. Property Recall: Retrieve the "Angle Sum Property" of a triangle (sum of internal angles = 180°).
3. Arithmetic Setup: Construct the equation (e.g., $x + \text{angle A} + \text{angle B} = 180$) or use the iterative subtraction method ($180 - \text{angle A} - \text{angle B} = x$).
4. Execution - Summation: Correct addition of the two provided angles.
5. Execution - Subtraction: Subtract the sum from 180 without computational errors.

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
- The "90-degree Assumption": In the absence of a square symbol, students often assume a "straight-looking" angle is exactly 90°.
- Additive Fixation: Adding the two known angles but stopping there (forgetting to subtract from 180).
- Holistic Distortion: Treating the triangle as having a 360° sum (confusing properties with quadrilaterals).
- Number Scavenging: Subtracting the smaller given number from the larger given number instead of using the geometric property.
- "Column Borrowing" errors: Systematic mistakes in regrouping when subtracting from the zeros in 180 (e.g., $180 - 100 \rightarrow 0-0=0, 8-0=8, 1-1=0$, but errors occurring when units are non-zero).

Step 3: Target Population Context
- Language Barrier: If the question is in English, "angle" may be a known term, but if the prompt is purely textual, Hindi-medium students may struggle with semantic decoding.
- Conceptual Consolidation: Grade 6 is the foundational year for formal geometry in the Indian curriculum; many students from EWS backgrounds face high absenteeism or lack of primary-grade foundations, making the leap from "shapes" to "theorems" difficult.
- Open-ended Format: Without multiple-choice distractors to prompt them, the "recall gap" for 180° is significantly wider.
