**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1.  **Recognition of Horizontal Distribution (FOIL/Box Method):** Correctly identifying that each term in the first binomial must multiply both terms in the second.
2.  **Monomial Multiplication (Coefficients):** Executing basic multiplication (3×2, 3×3, 2×2, 2×3).
3.  **Monomial Multiplication (Variables):** Applying the law of exponents for $a \times a = a^2$ and $b \times b = b^2$.
4.  **Sign Convention (Direct):** Correctly applying the signs during multiplication, particularly the negative distribution of $-2b$.
5.  **Identifying Like Terms:** Recognizing that $ab$ and $ba$ (or $ab$) are common terms that can be combined.
6.  **Integer Addition/Subtraction:** Performing $9ab - 4ab$ correctly.

**Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"**
1.  **The "Front-Back" Bug:** Multiplying only the first terms and last terms ($6a^2 - 6b^2$), omitting the inner/outer products entirely.
2.  **The Constant Sign Bug:** Assuming the middle sign of the result is always positive or simply bringing down the sign of the first binomial.
3.  **Variable Summation Bug:** Writing $a+a$ instead of $a \times a$ (getting $2a$ or $a$ instead of $a^2$).
4.  **Distributive Blindness:** Distributing the $3a$ to both terms but only multiplying the $-2b$ by the $2a$ (forgetting the final term).
5.  **Combining Unlike Terms:** Forcing a single-term answer (e.g., $6a^2 + 5ab - 6b^2 = 5a^2b^2$).

**Step 3: Contextual Analysis**
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face "language-switching" overhead where mathematical symbols are processed via Hindi-medium logic but written in English-style notation. The open-ended nature of the question removes the possibility of "back-solving" from options. For many students in EWS (Economically Weaker Section) contexts, procedural fluency in algebra is a significant hurdle due to limited access to personalized remedial feedback on specific "bugs." While the calculation is objectively "simple," the cascading nature of these 6 steps means a failure in any one results in a 0/1 score.

**Step 4: Holistic Estimate**
The requirement for total accuracy across all procedural steps, particularly the signed multiplication and the quadratic exponents, usually results in a high attrition rate in this specific demographic.
