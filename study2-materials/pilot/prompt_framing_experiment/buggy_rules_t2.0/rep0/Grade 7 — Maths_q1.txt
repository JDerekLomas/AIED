Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Recall/retrieve the absolute values of the digits (3 and 4).
2.  Execute the multiplication of natural numbers (3 × 4 = 12).
3.  Identify the signs of both integers (negative and negative).
4.  Retrieve the specific sign rule for multiplication (minus × minus = plus).
5.  Apply the sign rule to the product and synthesize the final result (+12 or 12).

Step 2: Buggy rules
1.  **Operation Confusion (Addition vs. Multiplication):** Applying the rule for adding two negatives (getting -7).
2.  **Sign Over-generalization:** Believing a "minus sign" in the question always necessitates a "minus sign" in the answer regardless of the operation.
3.  **Language interference:** Confusing the Hindi rule/mnemonic (e.g., "Minus minus plus") to mean the *operation* is addition rather than the *result* is positive.
4.  **The "Stronger Sign" bug:** Applying the addition logic where the sign of the larger absolute value is kept (though here they are both negative).
5.  **Transcription/Notational bug:** Interpreting `(-3)(-4)` as a subtraction or a range due to the parentheses.

Step 3: Student population considerations
In Grade 7 Indian government school contexts, students are transitioning from whole numbers to integers. The concept of "multiplication as repeated addition" breaks down with two negative factors, making this an exercise in rote rule-following. For English-language learners (ELL), the distinction between "negative," "minus," and "subtract" is often blurred. Open-ended items are significantly harder than multiple-choice items because they provide no "cues" to trigger the correct sign-rule retrieval.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While the calculation is basic (3x4), the interaction of the sign rules is a notorious hurdle in this specific demographic. While many will remember the 12, a high frequency will include the negative sign (-12) due to rule interference or perform addition (-7).
