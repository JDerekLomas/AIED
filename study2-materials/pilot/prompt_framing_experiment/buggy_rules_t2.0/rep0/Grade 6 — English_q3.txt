Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the syntax and vocabulary of the English question (interrogative pronoun "What," auxiliary "did," and main verb "love").
2. Access long-term or working memory to retrieve the specific semantic detail (reading) associated with the character (Riya) and time constraint (evening) from the provided text.
3. Mentally translate the conceptual answer from a likely L1 (Hindi) internal representation back into English.
4. Apply grammatical transformations (switching from the question's "did... love" to the past tense "loved" or an infinitive/gerund structure).
5. Graphomotor execution of the sentence or phrase with acceptable spelling and syntax.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. The "Wh-Ignore" Bug: Identifying the subject (Riya) and time (evening) but copying a random sentence from the text containing those keywords regardless of the action.
2. The "Tense Preservation" Bug: Writing "Riya love to read" (failing to mark past tense after "did" is removed).
3. The "L1 Syntax Transfer" Bug: Constructing the sentence using Hindi word order (e.g., "Riya evening in books read").
4. The "Fragment Completion" Bug: Writing only "Read" or "Read books," which may be penalized by stricter teachers despite the rubric.
5. The "Keyword Association" Bug: If another character is mentioned nearby, swapping the character's preference for Riya's.

Step 3: Population considerations
In Grade 6, particularly in economically weaker contexts with Hindi-medium transitions, English is often treated as a decoding exercise rather than a comprehension one. Students may struggle to differentiate between "evening" and other time markers (morning/afternoon) if their English vocabulary is nascent. Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice recognition, especially for ELLs (English Language Learners) who may know the answer but cannot "produce" the target English structure.

Step 4: Holistic analysis
While the rubric is somewhat generous by accepting fragments ("read books"), the combination of language interference, the need to transform the verb tense (love -> loved), and the baseline literacy challenges in this specific demographic suggests a high attrition rate between "knowing the answer" and "writing the correct answer in English."
