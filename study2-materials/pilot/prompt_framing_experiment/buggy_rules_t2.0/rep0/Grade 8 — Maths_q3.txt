Step 1: Procedural Steps
1.  **Semantic Mapping**: Translate the text "4 black balls and 6 white balls" into the quantities for the denominator (total) and numerator (target).
2.  **Aggregation (Summation)**: Calculate the total outcomes (S) by adding $4 + 6$.
3.  **Variable Identification**: Correct identify $n(E)$ (favorable outcomes) as 4 (black) rather than 6 (white) or the difference between the two.
4.  **Fraction Construction**: Apply the probability formula $P(E) = \frac{n(E)}{n(S)}$.
5.  **Computation/Simplification**: Reduce the fraction (though the rubric does not explicitly require it, many students attempt this and fail).

Step 2: Buggy Rules
*   **"Odds for Probability" Bug**: Representing the answer as a ratio of the two subsets ($4/6$ or $4:6$) instead of part-to-whole ($4/10$).
*   **"Complement Error"**: Selecting the larger or more "prominent" number (6) instead of the requested color (4).
*   **"Inverse Denominator"**: Using the favorable count as the denominator ($10/4$).
*   **"Integer Preference"**: If the division seems "hard," students may provide the count (4) or the sum (10) as an integer answer rather than a fraction.

Step 3: Population Considerations
*   **Language Barrier**: "Drawn at random" is a complex English idiom for students transitioning from Hindi (where they would look for words like "यादृच्छिक" or "निकाला गया").
*   **Recall vs. Recognition**: Unlike MCQs common in standardized tests, the open-ended nature increases the likelihood of a blank response if the formula isn't recalled perfectly.
*   **Socio-economic context**: Students from EWS backgrounds often lack tactile/manipulative probability games (like marbles or dice) at home, making the concept more abstract than experiential.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While the calculation is basic arithmetic ($4+6=10$), the conceptual leap from "count" to "probability" (part-to-whole) is a significant hurdle. In many Indian government schools, "ratio" and "probability" are often conflated. A large portion of students will likely provide $4/6$ (ratio) or $10$ (total count) due to linguistic misinterpretation or procedural bugs.
