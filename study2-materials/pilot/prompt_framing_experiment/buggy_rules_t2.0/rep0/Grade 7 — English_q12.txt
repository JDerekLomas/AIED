Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Identify the Object ("the leaves"), Subject ("the wind"), and Verb ("blew").
2. Transpose the Object to the Subject position.
3. Determine the tense of the active verb ("blew" = Simple Past).
4. Select the correct form of the auxiliary verb "to be" matching the tense and the new subject's number (plural "leaves" + past = "were").
5. Recall the Past Participle (V3) form of the irregular verb "blow" ("blown").
6. Manage the adverbial particle ("away") correctly within the verb phrase or at the end.
7. Append the agent using "by" + the original subject.

Step 2: Common "Buggy Rules" / Systematic Errors
1. **Subject/Verb Agreement Bug:** Using "was" instead of "were" because the original subject "wind" is singular (Distance-based agreement error).
2. **V3 Generalization Bug:** Using "blewed" or "blowed" (over-regularization of -ed) or "blowen" instead of the irregular "blown."
3. **Tense Preservation Bug:** Using "are blown" (changing to present) or "been blown" (omitting the auxiliary tense marker).
4. **The "Particle Drop" Bug:** Omitting "away" or misplacing it (e.g., "The leaves were blown by the wind away").
5. **Active-to-Passive Logic Bug:** Merely flipping the nouns without changing the verb (e.g., "The leaves blew the wind").

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 7 students in this demographic often face "The Irregular Verb Gap," where they understand the concept of passive voice but lack the specific lexical recall for V3 forms of non-standard verbs. English proficiency levels in these schools often mean that while students recognize "by" is required, the specific transformation of "blew" to "were blown" involves a high density of potential failure points (irregular V3 + plural auxiliary choice). The open-ended format prevents guessing, which is common in multiple-choice formats.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the combination of an irregular verb ("blow-blew-blown") and the requirement for plural subject-verb agreement ("leaves were"), this item has high "bug density." Even students who understand the syntactic shift often fail on the morphological transformation of the verb.
