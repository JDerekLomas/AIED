Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Map the English word "squirrel" to the mental concept/image (potentially translating from Hindi *gilehri*).
2. Literary Recall: Access the specific mental schema for the Class 7 poem "The Squirrel" by Mildred Bowers Armstrong.
3. Information Extraction: Locate the specific sensory detail regarding the "tail" within the memorized or recalled text.
4. Linguistic Encoding: Formulate a response in English using the specific figurative language ("an interrogation mark" or "question mark").
5. Syntax Execution: Write a grammatically coherent phrase or sentence that aligns with the prompt's requirements.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic procedural errors)
1. "Literal Visual Mapping": The student describes a real squirrel's tail (e.g., "it is bushy," "it is soft") instead of using the literary text's specific metaphor.
2. "Keyword Over-association": Student sees "How" and "Squirrel" and provides a generic description of its actions ("He ate nuts") instead of the specific body part requested.
3. "Phonetic-Semantic Drift": Students recognize the shape but lack the English vocabulary, leading to approximations (e.g., "like a hook" or "snake shape") which may fall outside strict rubric adherence.
4. "Formulaic Copy-Paste": Borrowing text from the wrong line of the poem (e.g., "he wore a question mark of gray") but misapplying the attribute (e.g., "the squirrel is a question mark").

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students from EWS backgrounds often rely on rote memorization (*ratta*) due to limited exposure to communicative English. While "question mark" is a high-frequency rote answer for this specific textbook poem, the open-ended format removes the scaffolding of multiple-choice options. Bilingual interference (Hindi syntax/vocabulary) often creates barriers in expressive output even if the concept is understood.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that this is a standard, frequently tested textbook question, the success rate is buffered by rote learning. However, the requirement for English-only production in an open-ended format for EWS students with limited proficiency significantly narrows the "fully correct" margin.
