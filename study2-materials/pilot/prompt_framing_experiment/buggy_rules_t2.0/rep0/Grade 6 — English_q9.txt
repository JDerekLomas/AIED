Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Identify the beginning of the sentence and capitalize the first letter of 'riya'.
2. Recognize 'riya' as a proper noun (name) and capitalize the first letter.
3. Identify 'meena' as a proper noun and capitalize the first letter.
4. Identify 'sunday' as a proper noun (day of the week) and capitalize the first letter.
5. Identify the sentence type (declarative) and add a period/full stop at the end.
6. Transcribe all other words correctly without adding spelling or structural errors.

Step 2: Systematic buggy rules (cognitive errors)
1. "First-Letter-Only Bug": The student capitalizes only the first word of the sentence but ignores internal proper nouns.
2. "Name-Only Bug": The student capitalizes names ('Riya', 'Meena') but misses the capitalization of days of the week ('sunday').
3. "Phonetic Carryover Bug": Because Hindi and other Indian languages do not use letter cases (no upper/lowercase distinction), the student treats capitalization as decorative rather than grammatical.
4. "Sentence-End Neglect": The student focuses so heavily on word transformations that they forget the terminal punctuation mark.
5. "Copy-Paste Bug": In an effort to avoid errors, the student simply copies the prompt text exactly as written, assuming the task is about legibility.

Step 3: Target population considerations
- Grade 6 students in EWS/Hindi-medium contexts often lack a "mental schema" for English capitalization because their first language script (Devanagari) is unicase. 
- Proper nouns like 'Sunday' are frequently treated as common nouns in early-stage ESL learners.
- An open-ended "Rewrite" task is significantly harder than a multiple-choice task, as it requires simultaneous execution of four distinct capitalization rules and one punctuation rule. Failure in even one results in a score of 0 based on the rubric.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the "all-or-nothing" nature of the 1-mark rubric, the multi-step nature of the task (4 capitals + 1 period), and the interference from a unicase mother tongue, the likelihood of 100% accuracy across all five points is statistically low for this specific demographic.
