Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English sentence to identify the subject (occupations), the geographical constraint (Rajasthan), and the demographic (rural).
2. Retrieve specific knowledge from the Social Science curriculum regarding Rajasthan’s economy (Agriculture and Animal Husbandry).
3. Translate the retrieved concepts into English labels (e.g., translating "kheti" to "agriculture/farming").
4. Select one occupation and recall its primary features.
5. Synthesize a brief description in written English (syntax and vocabulary).

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules" (Procedural Errors)
1. Semantic Overgeneralization: Listing general rural activities (e.g., "going to school" or "cooking") instead of "occupations."
2. Keyword-Trigger Response: Seeing "Rajasthan" and "Rural" and describing a physical feature (e.g., "desert" or "camels") rather than an occupation.
3. Language Switching Failure: Being able to identify the concept in Hindi (Pashupalan) but lacking the specific English lexicon (Animal Husbandry), leading to an omitted answer or an ungradeable code-mix.
4. Descriptive Incompleteness: Providing the list but failing the second half of the procedural prompt (describing one in brief).
5. Concept Conflation: Listing an urban occupation mentioned in another chapter (e.g., "Industry") due to lack of local contextual differentiation.

Step 3: Target Population Analysis
Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds and economically weaker sections often have high conceptual knowledge of agriculture but low English literacy. Because this is an open-ended recall item (not a multiple-choice recognition item), the cognitive load is significantly higher. The "one-point" rubric for a multi-step task (list + describe) provides a low margin for error.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the subject matter is culturally familiar, the requirement to name *two* occupations *and* describe one *in English* acts as a significant barrier for Grade 7 students with limited proficiency.
