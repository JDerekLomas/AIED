Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Correctly identify and translate the concept of "Hobby" (often confused with 'habit' or general tasks in Hindi-medium contexts).
2. Syntactic Retrieval: Generate four to five distinct English sentences.
3. Content Mapping: Systematically include three specific components (what, when, why).
4. Morphological Application: Apply correct subject-verb agreement (e.g., "My hobby is..." vs "My hobby are...") and verb tense (present habitual).
5. Textual Cohesion: Maintain a paragraph structure (spatial layout and logical flow).

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. Over-generalization of "My Name is" Template: Applying the only internalized English paragraph structure to this topic (e.g., "My hobby is name is Cricket").
2. Translanguaging Syntax (L1 Interference): Constructing sentences using Hindi word order (S-O-V) translated into English words.
3. Aspectual Mixing: Using continuous forms "-ing" for habitual actions without auxiliary verbs ("I playing cricket evening").
4. "The More-the-Better" Bug: Writing one long run-on sentence connected by "and" instead of 4-5 discrete sentences as requested.
5. Vocabulary "Bottom-Out": Substituting an English noun with a transliterated Hindi word when the specific vocabulary is unknown.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 7 students from these demographics often possess high recognition skills for multiple-choice questions but face significant "recall paralysis" in open-ended English production. The rubrics' demand for a "complete paragraph" with three specific constraints is a high cognitive load, as it requires simultaneous management of mechanics, content, and grammar in a non-native language.
