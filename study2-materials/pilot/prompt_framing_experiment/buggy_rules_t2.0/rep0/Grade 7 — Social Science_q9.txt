To analyze the cognitive demands of this item using a "buggy rule" framework derived from mathematical cognition and systematic error analysis:

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. **Linguistic Decoding:** Translate the high-register prompt ("Assess," "impact," "economic life") into a simplified internal goal (e.g., "What happened to the money?").
2. **Domain Retrieval:** Access long-term memory for specific historical schemas regarding medieval/ancient warfare (kings, treasury, looting, taxes).
3. **Constraint Satisfaction:** Filter attributes to ensure the impact is "economic" (money/resources) rather than social (death) or political (borders).
4. **Relational Mapping:** Establish a cause-effect link (War $\rightarrow$ Cost $\rightarrow$ Result).
5. **Output Generation:** Encode the internal proposition into an English sentence that satisfies the "clearly identifying" rubric criteria.

**Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)**
1. **The Category Confusion Bug:** Replacing "economic" with "physical/human." Students frequently provide answers like "people died" or "buildings were destroyed" because they lack the conceptual boundary between human toll and economic systems.
2. **The "Everything is Bad" Generalization:** Using vague adjectives (e.g., "The kingdom became poor") without specifying a mechanism (e.g., "high taxes" or "looting of the treasury"), which fails the rubric’s demand for a "distinct" impact.
3. **The Syntax Substitution Bug:** Due to limited English proficiency, students may attempt to mirror words from the question ("The impact of war on economic life was bad") without providing a new proposition, creating a tautological error.
4. **Keyword Priming:** The word "war" primes students to think only of soldiers and weapons, leading to responses that describe the *nature* of the war rather than the *economic impact* (The "Procedure over Outcome" bug).

**Step 3: Population Considerations**
Grade 7 students are transitioning from concrete to formal operational thought. In the context of economically weaker sections (EWS) and Hindi-medium transitions, the linguistic barrier of "Assess" and "Economic" is significant. Recall (open-ended) is significantly harder than recognition for students struggling with English as a Second Language (ESL).

**Step 4: Holistic Analysis**
While the rubric is generous (requiring only one point), the combination of abstract vocabulary and the requirement to isolate an economic variable from a general historical event represents a high cognitive load. Most students will succumb to "Category Confusion" or the "Everything is Bad" generalization.
