Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: $P = 2(l + w)$.
2. Substitute known values ($P=32, l=10$) into the equation: $32 = 2(10 + w)$.
3. Execute algebraic operations: Divide by $2$ or distribute $2$ into the parentheses.
4. Solve for the unknown variable ($w = 6$).
5. Recall the formula for area: $A = l \times w$.
6. Calculate area: $10 \times 6 = 60$.
7. Assign correct units ($\text{cm}$ and $\text{cm}^2$).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
*   **Formula confusion:** Using $A = l + w$ or $P = l \times w$.
*   **Operational errors (Pre-algebra):** $32 = 2(10 + w) \rightarrow 32 = 20 + w$ (failing to distribute to the second term).
*   **Inverse operation bug:** $32 - 20 = 12$; then adding $2$ instead of dividing, or "magic" movement of numbers.
*   **The "Halfway" bug:** Solving for width (6) but forgetting the second prompt (Area), which is common in multi-step word problems.
*   **Unit confusion:** Confusing linear cm with square $\text{cm}^2$.

Step 3: Population context:
For Grade 7 students in economically weaker sections (EWS) with language barriers, the transition from arithmetic to formal algebraic manipulation ($2(x+y)=z$) is a high-attrition zone. Language proficiency affects the translation of "Perimeter" and "Width" if they are more accustomed to Hindi terms (parimap/chaudai). The open-ended format removes the "clue" of multiple-choice options, which usually helps students self-correct calculation errors.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
The requirement for two distinct outputs (width AND area) creates a high probability of "omission error," where a student provides one but not the other. Combined with algebraic manipulation errors common at this grade level, the success rate is statistically low.
