Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Word Recognition**: Decipher the phonics/meaning of individual words ("book", "reading", "a", "is", "he").
2. **Subject Identification**: Select the agent/pronoun ("He") to initiate the sentence.
3. **Auxiliary-Verb Linking**: Pair the subject with the correct auxiliary ("is") and the continuous verb form ("reading").
4. **Syntactic Sequencing (SVO)**: Place the object ("book") after the verb phrase.
5. **Article Placement**: Position the indefinite article ("a") before the singular count noun.
6. **Mechanics**: Apply capitalization to the first word and a period at the end (though often ignored in low-stakes grading).

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Procedural Errors)
1. **L1 Transfer Bug (SOV Order)**: Arranging words based on Hindi/regional syntax: "He a book reading is."
2. **"Verb-Last" Bug**: Placing the main action at the very end regardless of auxiliary position.
3. **Article-blindness**: Treating "a" as an independent entity or omitting it because Hindi does not use articles in the same way.
4. **Continuous Tense Fragmentation**: Decoupling "is" and "reading" (e.g., "He reading a book is").
5. **Position-Fixed Retrieval**: Starting the sentence with the first word provided in the prompt regardless of its grammatical function (e.g., "Book is...").

Step 3: Student Population Constraints
*   **Grade 6 Context**: Students are expected to have mastered SVO, but the transition from English as a "subject" to English as a "language of instruction" is often rocky.
*   **Recall vs. Recognition**: Unlike multiple-choice, this is a construction task. A student might recognize "He is reading a book" if seen, but fails to generate the sequence correctly.
*   **Socio-economic/Medium Factors**: Limited exposure to English outside school means students rely on rote-learned grammatical rules rather than an intuitive "ear" for the language.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While this is a fundamental "Type 1" sentence, the combination of Hindi-to-English translation bugs (specifically the SOV vs SVO shift) and the requirement to manage the auxiliary "is" alongside the article "a" creates significant interference for first-generation learners.
