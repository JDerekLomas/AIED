Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Semantic Translation**: Decode the English phrasing "Parliament," "necessary," and "democracy" into internal conceptual or Hindi equivalents (*Sansad*, *zaroori*, *loktantra*).
2.  **Concept Retrieval**: Recall the specific functions of the Parliament from memory (Law-making, representation, accountability) rather than using a provided text.
3.  **Synthesis**: Link the concept of "People's Will" to the structure of "Democracy" to establish the causal relationship required by the "Why."
4.  **Bilingual Encoding**: Formulate an answer that satisfies the rubric's specific terminology (must mention law or representation) and translate it back into an English sentence (given the test medium).

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic procedural errors)
*   **Keyword Association Bug**: Student associates "Democracy" only with "Voting" or "Freedom" and ignores the specific institution of Parliament.
*   **Tautological Bug**: Writing "It is necessary because it is needed for democracy" (circular reasoning).
*   **Definition Substitution Bug**: Defining what a Parliament *is* (a building or a place where leaders sit) instead of *why it is necessary* (its function).
*   **Transliteration/Grammar Freeze**: Attempting to translate a complex Hindi thought (*logon ki awaz*) into English but losing the technical keywords ("represent" or "law-making") required by the rubric.

Step 3: Population Considerations
*   Grade 8 students are often transitioning from rote memorization to conceptual explanation, but ESL/Hindi-medium learners frequently struggle with open-ended synthesis in English.
*   "Representing the will of the people" is an abstract concept; students are more likely to provide concrete, non-rubric answers (e.g., "to run the country").
