Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the definition of pasteurization as a thermal treatment specific to liquid preservation.
2. Sequence the dual-action process: first heating, then rapid cooling (chilling).
3. Connect the mechanism to its purpose: killing microbes/preventing spoilage (preservation).
4. Translate these scientific concepts from a mental model (likely in Hindi/hinglish) into a coherent written English response.

Step 2: Identify "buggy rules" (Systematic procedural errors)
1. "One-sided heating": The student focuses only on boiling the milk (common kitchen practice) and ignores the "sudden cooling" step, which is cognitively distinct from typical cooking.
2. "Boiling equivalence": Conflating pasteurization with boiling (100°C), assuming the goal is just "making it hot" rather than a specific temperature-time ratio.
3. "Partial Process Retention": Recalling that it "kills germs" (the outcome) but failing to describe the "how" (the process), leading to an incomplete response.
4. "Reversal bug": Stating milk is cooled first and then heated, or misunderstanding the "rapid" nature of the cooling.

Step 3: Target population considerations
The open-ended recall format is significantly harder for ELL (English Language Learner) students than multiple-choice. While "pasteurization" is a high-frequency term in Grade 8 Science (often found in bold in NCERT textbooks), the requirement to describe the *mechanism* in English presents a high barrier. Students often recognize the term on a milk packet but lack the formal expressive vocabulary to describe the "rapid cooling" sequence.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that this is a 1-point question requiring two distinct components (process + reason) in a second language, the "all or nothing" rubric usually results in high failure rates due to "one-sided" answers (only mentioning heating).
