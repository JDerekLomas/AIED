Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Identify the geometric property: Recognize that ABCD is a parallelogram.
2. Recall properties of angles: Identify that adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary (sum to 180°) and/or opposite angles are equal.
3. Arrive at value for $x$: Calculate $180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ$ (if using adjacent angles) or identify it via other interior angle properties.
4. Arrive at value for $y$: Determine the corresponding value for $y$.
5. Linguistic/Syntactic Formulation: Construct an explanation in English (as required by the rubric) to justify the value of $x$.

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
- "Opposite = Supplementary": Mistakenly thinking opposite angles sum to 180 instead of being equal.
- "Linear Pair Only": Only recognizing supplementary angles when they appear on a straight line, failing to apply it to transversal/parallelogram properties.
- "Angle Identification Swap": Mistaking angle $x$ for the given angle $70^\circ$ because they "look similar" or are both on the "bottom."
- "Subtraction Bug": Standard computational errors in subtracting 70 from 180 (e.g., getting 120 or 100).
- "Language Gap": Student knows $x = 110$ but cannot formulate a written explanation in English, leading to a 0 based on the strict rubric requirement ("and give an explanation").

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 8: Conceptual shift from concrete arithmetic to abstract geometry and formal proof/justification.
- Linguistic barrier: Many students in Indian government schools from Hindi-medium backgrounds struggle to write formal English justifications, even if their "math" is correct.
- Open-ended vs. MCQ: Requires recall of theorems rather than recognition of the correct number from a list.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
While many students may correctly calculate 110, the "explanation" requirement in the rubric acts as a significant bottleneck for this specific population. Combined with the common confusion between supplementary and equal angles in quadrilaterals, the success rate drops significantly.
