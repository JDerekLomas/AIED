To analyze this item through the lens of systematic procedural errors (bugs):

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. Identify the Object ("a delicious meal") and promote it to Subject.
2. Identify the Tense (Simple Past).
3. Recall and select the correct auxiliary "to be" based on the new subject’s number/tense (*was*).
4. Transform the main verb to its Past Participle form (*prepared*).
5. Insert the agent marker (*by*).
6. Demote the original Subject to the Object position (*the chef*).

**Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)**
*   **Tense-Shift Bug:** Instead of using the passive auxiliary, students shift the tense as if performing Reported Speech (e.g., *had prepared*).
*   **The "is/are" Default:** Using the present tense "is" for all passive constructions regardless of the original tense (*A delicious meal is prepared*).
*   **Perfective Overgeneralization:** Since part B of the prompt uses "has found," students may "leak" the perfective aspect into part A (*A delicious meal has been prepared*).
*   **Agreement Mismatch:** Using "were" for singular objects or "was" for plural.
*   **Omission of 'by':** Treating the transformation as a word-order shift only.
*   **L1 Interference (Hindi-to-English):** Hindi speakers may mirror the *Karma-vachya* structure incorrectly or drop the "to be" auxiliary entirely, as auxiliary verbs function differently in Hindi passive syntax.

**Step 3: Student Population Analysis**
The open-ended format is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice for this population. Students with limited English proficiency often rely on rote-learned "template" matching. Grade 8 students in EWS/Hindi-medium contexts often struggle with the distinction between the "Active-to-Passive" rules and "Direct-to-Indirect" rules, leading to high "procedural interference." Even if they understand the concept, a single error in spelling or auxiliary selection results in 0 marks based on the rubric.

**Step 4: Holistic Estimate**
Given that this is an open-ended recall task requiring five successful sub-procedures, and considering the frequent "crossover" bugs between tenses and grammar topics common in government school contexts:
