Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English question (syntactic and lexical processing of "sounds" and "scene").
2. Retrieve the mental representation of the specific text/scene from long-term or working memory (referential retrieval).
3. Isolate auditory details from visual/thematic details in the mental model.
4. Formulate a response in English that links the specific entity (birds) with the specific action (chirping/returning/sounds).
5. Translate the thought from a L1 (Hindi) conceptual framework to an L2 (English) grammatical structure.

Step 2: Systematic procedural errors ("Buggy Rules")
1. Visual-Auditory Merging: Identifying what is *seen* (sunset, sky turning red) rather than what is *heard* due to a semantic over-extension of "scene."
2. Generic Retrieval: Substituting a generic "sound" (e.g., "people talking" or "animals") rather than the specific text-based detail (birds).
3. The L2 Transfer Bug: Producing the correct conceptual answer in Hindi or broken English (e.g., "Bird coming") which might be marked wrong if the rubric requires a specific phrase or "sounds of..." structure.
4. Keyword Matching Error: Scanning the text for the word "sounds" and, if not found, guessing based on environmental cues rather than textual inference.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 8 students in this context often face a "gap" between their cognitive ability (capable of understanding sunset imagery) and their functional English literacy. Because this is an open-ended recall question, there is no scaffolding (unlike multiple choice). In many government schools, literacy levels for English are often several grade levels behind the nominal grade.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept of birds at sunset is intuitive, the combination of specific auditory recall, English-only output, and the lack of recognition cues in an open-ended format significantly reduces the success rate for this demographic.
