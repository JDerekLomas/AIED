Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the command verb "Define" and the technical term "human environment."
2. Access long-term memory to retrieve the specific social science definition (differentiating it from "natural environment").
3. Translate conceptual understanding into an English sentence (syntax and vocabulary).
4. Identify the second task requirement ("give one example").
5. Select a valid instance of human modification (e.g., building roads, farming).
6. Synthesize these components into a coherent written response.

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules" (Systematic procedural errors)
1. **The Synonym Error:** Students assume "human environment" means "people's surroundings" (circular logic) rather than the "man-made/interactional" specific definition.
2. **Category Mistake:** Confusing "human environment" with "human-made environment" (physical objects only) vs. the curriculum's broader definition (social/cultural interactions).
3. **Response Truncation:** Completing the definition but ignoring the second half of the prompt (common in multi-part questions).
4. **Naturalization Bias:** Describing how nature affects humans (e.g., "rain makes us wear coats") instead of how humans modify nature (the inverse relationship).
5. **English Proficiency Latency:** Knowing the concept in Hindi ("मानव पर्यावरण") but failing to find the English correlates, leading to fragmented or incomprehensible sentences.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds face high cognitive load when retrieving domain-specific English terms. An open-ended recall task is significantly more difficult than a multiple-choice item. Furthermore, the rubric demands a multi-part answer for a very low point value (0.5), which often correlates with lower student effort or precision.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
The gap between colloquial "human surroundings" and the textbook "human environment" is a frequent source of systematic error. For this population, the combination of specific recall and bilingual translation likely leads to high failure rates in providing a "fully correct" response according to a strict rubric.
