Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the English sentence structure "Why are X often called Y?"
2. Recall the conceptual association: Vitamins/Minerals → Protection → Immune system/Fighting diseases.
3. Formulate a sentence in English explaining the functional relationship (protection = prevention of illness).
4. Recall a specific Vitamin + its corresponding deficiency disease (e.g., Vitamin A - Night blindness).
5. Recall a specific Mineral + its corresponding deficiency disease (e.g., Iron - Anaemia or Iodine - Goitre).
6. Verify that the answer addresses all three components (reasoning, vitamin name/disease, mineral name/disease) despite the 1-mark maximum score which implies a high density of required information.

Step 2: "Buggy Rules" / Systematic Errors
1. "Literal Protection" Bug: Students interpret "protective" physically (e.g., "They protect the skin/stomach like a shield") rather than immunologically.
2. "Category Blending" Bug: Confusing vitamins and minerals (e.g., naming Calcium as a vitamin or Vitamin C as a mineral).
3. "Partial Recall" Bug: Providing the name of the nutrient but forgetting the disease, or vice versa.
4. "The Matching Error": Incorrectly pairing a vitamin with a mineral's deficiency disease (e.g., Vitamin C - Anaemia).
5. "Transliteration Failure": Thinking of the answer in Hindi ("bimari se ladne ke liye") but unable to translate "fight against diseases" or "essential" into coherent English.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 6 is a transitional year where students move from basic identification to explanation. For Hindi-medium students in EWS contexts, "protective foods" is a technical term often learned by rote. The open-ended nature of the question (recall) is significantly harder than a multiple-choice format (recognition). While they likely know Vitamin A/Night Blindness, the two-part nature of the question (Explanation + Name 1 Vitamin disease + Name 1 Mineral disease) creates a high "procedural load" for a single mark.

Step 4: Holistic Estimation
The requirement to get both the explanation (a) AND two specific pairs of deficiencies (b) correct to secure the mark is a high threshold for this demographic, especially with the language barrier. Many students will provide the names but fail the English explanation, or provide the explanation but confuse the mineral/vitamin categories.
