Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recognize the equality of two fractions as a proportion requiring cross-multiplication.
2. Apply the distributive property: Multiply 5 by both $(x-5)$ and 3 by both $(x-3)$.
3. Simplify the resulting linear equation: $5x - 25 = 3x - 9$.
4. Transpose terms involving $x$ to one side and constants to the other (balancing the equation).
5. Perform integer arithmetic correctly (e.g., $-9 + 25$).
6. Divide the constant by the coefficient of $x$ to isolate the variable.

Step 2: Potential "Buggy Rules"
- Partial Distribution: Multiplying 5 by $x$ but not by $-5$ (e.g., $5x - 5$).
- Sign Error during Transposition: Forgetting to change the sign when moving a term across the equality (e.g., $5x + 3x$).
- Fraction Inversion: Incorrectly cross-multiplying (multiplying numerators together or denominators together).
- Integer Arithmetic Error: Miscalculating $-9 + 25$ as $-34$ or $+16$.
- Operational Misconception: Dividing the larger number by the smaller regardless of the algebraic requirement.

Step 3: Population Considerations
For Grade 8 students in Indian government schools, algebra is often a "mechanical" transition from arithmetic. English terminology (distributive, transpose) may be a barrier, though the symbolic notation is universal. Open-ended questions lack the "hint" structure of multiple-choice, increasing the likelihood of unforced errors. Procedural fluency in integer subtraction is typically low in this demographic.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that the student must execute all steps (cross-multiplication, distribution, transposition, and signed integer arithmetic) perfectly to get the single point, the cumulative probability of success is low due to the high density of potential "bugs" per step.
