Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Deciphering the English prompt to identify the three core constraints: intended recipient (grandmother), content requirement A (expressing missing her), and content requirement B (requesting a visit).
2. Translating thoughts from a first language (likely Hindi) into English.
3. Recalling the specific syntactic structures for a message (imperatives or polite requests like "Please come").
4. Correctly using first-person and second-person pronouns ("I miss you," not "He misses her").
5. Applying orthographic and grammatical rules (spelling, capitalization, basic punctuation).

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules"
- Prompt Misinterpretation: Responding to "how much" as a quantitative question rather than a qualitative sentiment.
- Literal Translation/Hinglish: Using L1 syntax in English (e.g., "Grandmother soon come").
- Reciprocal Pronoun Error: Confusing "you" and "I" (e.g., "You miss me" when meaning "I miss you").
- Task Conversion Bug: Converting the "message" into a "letter" with an overly long formal header that exhausts time/space before the requirement is met.
- Requirement Omission: Providing one sentiment (missing) but forgetting the call to action (visiting), or vice-versa.

Step 3: Target population considerations
In Grade 7, Indian government school students often struggle with open-ended composition in English due to "no-detention" policies in earlier grades. The cognitive load of simultaneously managing English grammar and the specific communicative intent of the rubric is high. The move from recognition (multiple choice) to recall/production significantly increases the failure rate.

Step 4: Holistic estimation
While the prompt is simple, the necessity of hitting both rubric points (missing + visiting) while navigating the L1-to-L2 translation gap and basic literacy barriers suggests that less than half of the cohort will produce a response that meets both criteria accurately enough to satisfy a binary rubric.
