Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **De-code Tabular Data:** Associate the labels (Liquids A, B, C) with their respective numerical values (Time).
2.  **Linguistic Mapping:** Connect the qualitative term "fastest" to the quantitative physical outcome of "least time taken."
3.  **Numerical Comparison:** Compare three discrete values (Time for A, B, and C) to identify the minimum value.
4.  **Retrieval/Writing:** Correctly transcribe the name of the liquid (Liquid A or Petrol) as the answer.

Step 2: Systematic procedural errors (Buggy rules)
*   **Magnitude Confusion (Value-Speed Swap):** Selecting the largest number (Longest time = 300 mins) instead of the smallest because "fastest" is cognitively associated with "largest" or "highest" values.
*   **Column/Row Misalignment:** Misreading the table by looking at the adjacent cell (e.g., selecting Liquid B instead of A).
*   **Keyword Overreliance:** Identifying Liquid C because the prompt for part (b) mentions it extensively, leading to a "recency effect" or assuming the most "complex" substance is the intended answer.

Step 3: Population-specific constraints
*   **Linguistic Barrier:** Grade 7 students with limited English proficiency often struggle with the superlative "fastest" when mapped to "time." In Hindi (and common parlance), *tez* (fast) is often associated with more, not less.
*   **Inversion Difficulty:** The inverse relationship between speed and time is a known threshold concept that many students in this demographic have not mastered, often leading them to pick the highest number (Liquid C).
*   **Testing Anxiety/Formatting:** For an open-ended item, students may provide the numeric value (20 mins) instead of the label (Liquid A), which some strict rubrics or automated systems might penalize, though the provided rubric allows the name.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While the numerical comparison is simple (1-digit vs 3-digit comparison), the "inverse bug" (High speed = High number) is extremely common in middle school. Given the English language barrier for "fastest" and the potential to conflate the prompt in part (b) with the requirements for (a), a significant portion of the population will select the highest number.
