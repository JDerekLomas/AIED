Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English sentence structure to identify the core task (recall/naming).
2. Interpret the semantic constraints: "Medieval period" (temporal) and "Rajasthan" (geographical).
3. Access long-term memory to retrieve names associated with these constraints.
4. Filter out names from the "Ancient" (e.g., Ashoka) or "Modern/British" eras.
5. Retrieve the specific phonetic/orthographic labels for these individuals.
6. Transcribe the names from Hindi/internal thought into written English script.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. **Categorical Displacement (The "Famous Name" Bug):** Recalling the most famous figures in history regardless of time/place (e.g., naming Shivaji, who is Maratha/Maharashtra, or Akbar, who is Mughal).
2. **Temporal Collapse (The "Historical Singularity" Bug):** Treating all history as a single block; failing to distinguish "Medieval" from "Ancient" (e.g., naming Chandragupta Maurya).
3. **English Orthographic Slip:** Mapping the Hindi sound to English letters incorrectly, leading to unintelligible strings that do not match the rubric (though "phonetic" spelling is often forgiven, extreme distortion results in 0).
4. **Scope Narrowing:** Providing only one name instead of two due to missing the word "two" in the English phrasing.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Grade 6 is the transition year where historical periods (Ancient vs. Medieval) are first formally delineated.
2. For Hindi-medium students, "Medieval" (Madhya-kalin) is a known concept, but "Medieval" in English may be a "dead" word or lack strong semantic tagging.
3. Students from economically weaker sections often have lower access to historical media (books/TV) that reinforces these names outside of the classroom.
4. Rajasthan's history is localized, but the English medium of the test creates a barrier between their internal knowledge (Hindi/Marwari) and the output.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
While Maharana Pratap and Prithviraj Chauhan are cultural icons whose names are deeply ingrained, the cognitive load of navigating a L2 (English) question, distinguishing "Medieval" from general "History," and the requirement of providing *two* distinct names rather than one increases the probability of "bugs" or omission.
