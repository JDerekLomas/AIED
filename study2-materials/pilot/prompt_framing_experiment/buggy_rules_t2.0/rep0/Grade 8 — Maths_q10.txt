Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Visual Pattern Recognition: Identify the relationship between the given angle ($80^\circ$) and $x$ (Vertically Opposite Angles) and the relationship between $x$ and $y$ (Linear Pair) or $80^\circ$ and $y$ (Linear Pair).
2. Recall and Apply Geometric Properties: Retrieve the theorem that Vertically Opposite Angles are equal.
3. Arithmetical Setup: Set up the equation for the supplementary relationship (e.g., $y + x = 180^\circ$ or $y + 80^\circ = 180^\circ$).
4. Arithmetic Execution: Perform the subtraction ($180 - 80$).
5. Verification and Labelling: Correctly assign the values to the variables $x$ and $y$ in the final response.

Step 2: "Buggy Rules" and Cognitive Obstacles
- Confusing Geometric Terms: Interchanging the definitions of "Supplementary" ($180^\circ$) and "Complementary" ($90^\circ$).
- Attribute Aliasing: Identifying $x$ and $y$ as equal because they "look" similar or are on the same side of a line.
- The "Linearity Bug": Incorrectly assuming all angles in a cluster sum to $360^\circ$ or $90^\circ$ instead of $180^\circ$.
- Transposition Error: Moving the constant in the equation but forgetting to change the sign (e.g., $y = 180 + 80$).
- Vocabulary Barrier: For Hindi-medium students, the English prompt "angle measures" or "reason" might cause hesitation even if the visual geometry is understood.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Open-ended format: Since it is not multiple choice, there is no "guess factor" or scaffold for the numerical value. 
- Requirement of "Reason": The rubric demands a stated reason. Even if a student calculates $80^\circ$ and $100^\circ$ correctly, the omission of the phrase "Vertically Opposite" or "Linear Pair" (likely harder to recall in English for this demographic) results in a score of 0 according to the specific 1-point rubric provided.

Step 4: Final Estimate
Given that a single point requires two correct calculations and the formal "reason," the "all-or-nothing" nature of the rubric significantly lowers the success rate despite the relative simplicity of the calculation.
