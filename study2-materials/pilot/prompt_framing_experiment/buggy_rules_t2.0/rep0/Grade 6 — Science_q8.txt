Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English sentence ("stunted growth," "yellowing," "infer," "evidence") into a conceptual mental model, likely involving a translation to Hindi concepts like *rukna* (stop) or *kami* (deficiency).
2. **Feature Retrieval**: Match the symptoms (stunted/yellow) to biological requirements stored in long-term memory (minerals, nitrogen, light).
3. **Inference Mapping**: Link the "effect" (yellowing) to the "cause" (deficiency) as requested by the command word "infer."
4. **Verbal Production**: Construct a written explanation in English that grammatically links the cause to the effect.

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules" (Systematic procedural errors)
1. **Lexical Bug (Semantic mismatch)**: Interpreting "stunted" as simply "short" and assuming the plant is naturally a dwarf variety rather than diseased.
2. **Reverse Causality Bug**: Stating the plant *causes* the lack of nutrients rather than the deficiency causing the symptoms.
3. **Literal Association Bug**: Associating "yellowing" with "sunlight" (color matching) rather than recognizing yellowing as a sign of *lack* of nutrients/light.
4. **Keyword Displacement**: Providing a general list of what plants need (Water, Air, Sunlight) without addressing the "evidence" of the specific symptoms provided in the stem.
5. **English Proficiency Constraint**: Providing a correct mental inference but being unable to bridge the "Explain" requirement in English, leading to a blank response or a single-word irrelevant answer.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students in this context are transitioning from local languages to English-medium science. "Stunted" and "infer" are high-level academic vocabulary (Tier 2/3 words). While the concept of mineral deficiency is in the curriculum, the open-ended nature of the question removes the scaffolding of recognition (multiple choice) and requires productive recall.

Step 4: Holistic analysis
The combination of specific vocabulary demands ("stunted," "infer"), the requirement to provide an explanation rather than a label, and the potential for linguistic interference in a population from economically weaker sections suggests a high error rate, even if the underlying biological concept is understood.
