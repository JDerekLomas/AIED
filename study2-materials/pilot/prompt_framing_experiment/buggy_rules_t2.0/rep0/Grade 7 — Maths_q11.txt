Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Draw two perpendicular axes (horizontal for categories, vertical for frequency).
2. Label the X-axis (Classes) and Y-axis (Number of Children).
3. Select an appropriate and consistent numerical scale (interval selection).
4. Correctly mark equidistant intervals on the Y-axis starting from zero.
5. Draw rectangular bars corresponding to the height of the data values for each of the six classes.
6. Identify the "Maximum" value from the dataset or graph.
7. Identify the "Minimum" value from the dataset or graph.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules" and Errors
1. Scaling Bug: Using the data points themselves as markings on the Y-axis (e.g., 135, 120, 95) rather than consistent intervals (10, 20, 30).
2. Origin Bug: Starting the scale from the lowest data point (e.g., starting at 80) rather than zero, without using a "kink" or broken line, or misinterpreting the physical length of the first interval.
3. Labeling Bug: Swapping the axes or failing to label them, often due to language barriers with terms like "vertical/horizontal" or "scale."
4. Consistency Bug: Changing the width of bars or the spacing between bars mid-graph.
5. Vocabulary Bug (Linguistic): Misunderstanding "Maximum" and "Minimum" due to limited English proficiency (often confusing them or failing to map the superlative to the data peaks/valleys).

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Seventh graders are transitioning from concrete to formal operations, but many in this demographic struggle with the "abstraction" of scaling.
2. The open-ended format is high-stakes for cognitive load; students must generate the structure from a blank page rather than fill in a template.
3. Limited English proficiency increases the risk of skipping the "Scale" requirement entirely or failing the "Maximum/Minimum" identification, even if the graph is partially correct.
4. Rubric Constraint: The rubric is strictly "all or nothing" for Part (a), requiring correct labels, axes, and scale for just 1 point. This "brittleness" means one bug in scaling nullifies the entire score.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the strict rubric requiring consistency in scaling and labeling, combined with the linguistic barriers of "maximum/minimum" and the common procedural error of using non-linear scales (listing data points on the axis), a high percentage of students will commit at least one systematic error.
