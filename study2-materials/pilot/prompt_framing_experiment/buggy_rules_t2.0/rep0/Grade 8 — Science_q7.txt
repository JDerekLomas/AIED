Step 1: List procedural steps
1. Semantic comprehension: Translate the scenario (organic waste in a pit) into the biological concept of decomposition.
2. Recall/Identify observation: State that the waste has changed/decayed/rotted.
3. Recall scientific mechanism: Explain "why" by identifying the role of microbes or the formation of compost/manure.
4. Evaluation: Determine the impact on soil (addition of nutrients/humus) and conclude it is beneficial.
5. Communication: Construct a multi-part answer in English that links observation, reason, and evaluation.

Step 2: Identify "buggy rules"
- "Concept-Observation Mismatch": Student thinks "change" means the waste disappears entirely (magic vanishing) rather than changing form.
- "Circular Reasoning": Saying it changed "because it turned into dirt" without explaining the biological process (lack of microscopic agents in the mental model).
- "Binary Thinking": Associating "waste" or "garbage" with something inherently bad/dirty, leading to an incorrect evaluation that it harms the soil (the "Garbage is Bad" bug).
- "Transduction Bug": Thinking the gardener’s *care* (watering/digging) causes the change, rather than the organic breakdown process.

Step 3: Target population considerations
- Language Barrier: Students likely understand "compost" (khaad) conceptually in Hindi but may struggle to articulate "microorganisms," "nutrients," or "decomposition" in English.
- Low-stakes recall vs. recognition: Open-ended questions are significantly harder for EL (English Learner) students than Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) because they lack retrieval cues.
- Partial Rubric Mismatch: The provided rubric is extremely brief (0.5 marks), which often leads students to provide one-word answers ("Yes") while missing the "reasons" and "evaluate" prompts.

Step 4: Estimated proportion of students producing a fully correct answer
0.25
