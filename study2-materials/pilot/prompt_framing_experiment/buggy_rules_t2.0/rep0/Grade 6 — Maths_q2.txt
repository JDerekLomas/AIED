To analyze the cognitive demands for a Grade 6 student from this demographic:

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. **Semantic Decoding:** Distinguish "place value" from "face value."
2. **Positional Identification:** Count decimal positions from right to left (ones, tens, hundreds) or identify the "5" visually in the number 7560.
3. **Value Calculation:** Multiply the digit (5) by its position value (100) or append the correct number of zeros based on trailing digits.
4. **Verbal/Numerical Mapping:** Translate the concept into the English words "Hundreds" or the numeral "500."

**Step 2: Buggy Rules**
*   **Face Value Substitution:** Reporting the digit itself (5) instead of its value.
*   **Column Miscount:** Counting from left to right, resulting in "tens" or "50."
*   **Label Confusion:** Interchanging "tens" and "tenths" (less common here, but frequent if decimals were recently introduced).
*   **Ordinal/Place Confusion:** Stating the digit's position (e.g., "second place").

**Step 3: Population Considerations**
In many Indian government schools, the shift from a Hindi-medium primary base to English-medium terminology in Grade 6 creates a linguistic barrier. "Place value" vs "Face value" is a common source of confusion in bilingual contexts (*sthaaniya maan* vs *jaatiya maan*). While the procedure is simple, the open-ended nature and English terminology increase the likelihood of systematic errors among students from lower-SES backgrounds who may have gaps in foundational math from primary years.

**Step 4: Holistic Estimation**
The concept is a standard lower-primary skill, but systemic data (such as NAS or ASER) suggests that by Grade 6, many students still struggle with foundational number sense when presented in an English-language format without options.
