Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English sentence "property... beaten into thin sheets" into a conceptual understanding of the physical transformation described.
2. **Retrieval**: Access the specific scientific term associated with that physical transformation from long-term memory.
3. **Lexical Distinction**: Differentiate the target term "Malleability" from related metallic properties (Ductility, Conductivity, Sonorousness).
4. **Orthographic Execution**: Correct spelling of the multi-syllabic, non-phonetic English word "Malleability" to satisfy a 1-point rubric.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules"
1. **Category Swap (Concept Bug)**: Systematic confusion between Malleability and Ductility (beaten into sheets vs. drawn into wires). This is the most common cognitive interference in this unit.
2. **The "Everyday Language" Bug**: Substituting the scientific term with descriptive functional language (e.g., "flexibility," "softness," or "expanding") because the specific technical label didn't transition from short-term to long-term memory.
3. **Phonetic Encoding Bug**: Since many students come from Hindi-medium backgrounds, they may attempt to spell the word phonetically (e.g., "Malebility"), which may be marked incorrect depending on the rigidity of the examiner.
4. **Keyword Association Bug**: Triggering the word "Ductility" simply because the question contains the word "Metal," without processing the specific transformation (sheets).

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face "The Fourth Grade Slump" in English medium instruction where cognitive load is split between learning science and learning the language of instruction. Malleability is a "low-frequency" English word. Open-ended recall (producing the word from scratch) is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice recognition for EL (English Learner) students.
