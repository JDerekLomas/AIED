Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the English-language prompt (heavy cognitive load for Hindi-medium learners).
2. Recall the domain-specific vocabulary "Clinical Thermometer" from memory (not provided as an option).
3. Recall the anatomical feature of a clinical thermometer (the "kink" or "constriction").
4. Formulate an English-language explanation of why this feature is "preferred" (preventing the backflow of mercury).
5. Translate the abstract scientific mechanism into a coherent sentence structure.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. Over-generalization of terms: Using "Doctor's thermometer" or "Normal thermometer" instead of the technical "Clinical."
2. Keyword-matching error: Students see "measure... temperature" and "laboratory" and erroneously conclude "Laboratory Thermometer" is the answer due to its higher complexity/length.
3. Functional confusion: Stating it is preferred because it is "small" or "easier to hold" (surface-level attributes) rather than the "kink" mechanism.
4. Language switching (Hinglish): Providing a correct explanation in Hindi/English hybrid which, depending on strict grading of "fully correct," may lead to zero marks.

Step 3: Student population factors:
- Grade 7 students are at a transitional stage between concrete and formal operations.
- Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple choice.
- English proficiency acts as a "gatekeeper" to demonstrating content knowledge.
- In low-income contexts, rote memorization of terms often replaces functional understanding of mechanisms like the "kink."

Step 4: Estimation:
The complexity of articulating "why" in a second language, combined with the specificity required for "Clinical Thermometer," creates a high probability of failure for all but the highest-performing students in this demographic.
