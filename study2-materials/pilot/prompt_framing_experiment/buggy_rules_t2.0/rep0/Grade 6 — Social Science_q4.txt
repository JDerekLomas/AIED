Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Parse the English syntax (identifying "major landforms" as the target and "Rajasthan" as the geographical constraint).
2. Retrieve specific geographic schema for Rajasthan from long-term memory.
3. Select a primary feature (Thar Desert or Aravalli) from the mental map.
4. Convert the retrieved concept into the formal English name (nomenclature).
5. Generate a descriptive sentence in English that defines the landform’s characteristics (climate, vegetation, or physical composition).

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules" / Procedural Errors
1. **The "Single Feature" Bug:** Identifying a landform found *anywhere* in India (e.g., Himalayas or Ganges) because "Landform" triggers a general category retrieval rather than a localized one.
2. **Translation/Transliteration Error:** Translating "landform" into Hindi (Bhuruup) but lacking the English vocabulary to provide a description, leading to a blank or code-switched response.
3. **Over-generalization of "Rajasthan":** Equating the entire state with "Heat" or "Water scarcity" but failing to name the specific geographical structure (e.g., writing "It is hot" without naming the Desert).
4. **Description Disconnection:** Successfully naming the desert but describing a different landform or providing a subjective opinion ("It is beautiful") rather than a geographical description.

Step 3: Student Population Factors
- Grade 6 is a transitional year for shifting from concrete to abstract geographic categorization.
- English Language Learners (ELL) from Hindi-medium backgrounds often face "Threshold Hypotheses" issues—they may know the content (Marusthali) but fail to map it to the English "landform" prompt.
- The open-ended format removes the scaffolding of recognition (Multiple Choice), which significantly drops accuracy for students with low English literacy.
- A score of 0.5 suggests this is part of a larger multi-part question, implying a low-stakes perception that may result in high "omission" rates.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the linguistic barrier of the term "landforms" for EWS students in Hindi-medium transitions, and the requirement for a recall-based English description, a significant portion will fail at either the translation step or the specific nomenclature step.
