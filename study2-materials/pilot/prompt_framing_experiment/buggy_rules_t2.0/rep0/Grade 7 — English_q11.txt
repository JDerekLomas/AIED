Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object-Adverbial).
2. Recall the definition of "adjective" (a word describing a noun).
3. Scan the sentence for nouns ("bird", "nest", "balcony").
4. Identify which word modifies a noun ("tiny" modifying "bird").
5. Isolate the target word from the rest of the sentence.

Step 2: "Buggy rules" and systematic errors
1. The Rubric Bug: The question asks for an "adjective phrase," but the rubric expects a single "adjective." Students who correctly identify an adjective phrase (e.g., "in our balcony" as an adjectival/adverbial modifier or "A tiny bird" as a noun phrase) will be marked incorrect according to the rubric, while students with a simpler understanding of parts of speech will be rewarded.
2. Position-Based Selection: Selecting the first word of the sentence or the word immediately following the article ("a") without evaluating its function.
3. Content Word Bias: Selecting any descriptive-sounding word or a word they have high familiarity with, regardless of its grammatical role.
4. L1 Interference (Hindi-Medium): In Hindi, modifiers typically precede the noun, but the grammatical terminology in English ("Adjective Phrase") is often conflated with "Adjective" in rote-learning environments. Students may select "built" (action) or "nest" (object) if they confuse "description" with "central entity."

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 7 students in this demographic often learn English through grammar-translation. There is a high likelihood of "keyword" matching. However, the term "Adjective Phrase" is a higher-order concept than "Adjective." There is a significant cognitive dissonance between the question (asking for a phrase) and the expected rubric answer (a single word), which will penalize the most advanced students.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the terminology mismatch (phrase vs. word) and the English proficiency barrier, many students will guess based on familiar categories. While many might recognize "tiny," a significant portion will be tripped up by the "phrase" instruction or provide no answer due to the complexity of the sentence compared to their vocabulary.
