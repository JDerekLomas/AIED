Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the prompt and understand the semantic constraint (identifying a synonym for "a light wind").
2. Scan the provided English passage to locate candidates based on phonetic or semantic familiarity.
3. Apply morphological constraints to ensure the identified word fits the definition (recognizing "breeze" as a noun, not a verb or adjective).
4. Extract the exact string "breeze" from the text without introducing spelling errors or using external synonyms not found in the text.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. **Keyword-over-Meaning Bug:** Searching for keywords like "light" or "wind" in the text and selecting the word immediately adjacent to them, regardless of its meaning.
2. **Contextual Association Bug:** Selecting a word related to the setting of the passage (e.g., "cool," "night," "sea") rather than the specific definition provided.
3. **L1 Translation Bug:** Mentally translating "light wind" to a Hindi concept (like "hawa"), then looking for any English word they know for "hawa," leading them to write "air" or "wind" instead of scanning for the specific passage word "breeze."
4. **Copying Error:** Locating the word but misspelling it (e.g., "breze," "braeze") or including surrounding punctuation.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 8 students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds often have a restricted English vocabulary. "Breeze" is a tier-2 vocabulary word. In an open-ended format without a word bank, the student cannot rely on recognition (multiple choice) and must perform a precise search-and-match. Limited English proficiency significantly increases the likelihood of the "L1 Translation Bug" or the "Keyword-over-Meaning Bug."
