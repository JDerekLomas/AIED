To analyze the cognitive demands of "Write all the factors of 68" for Grade 6 students in this context:

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. **Definitional Retrieval:** Accessing the concept of a "factor" as a number that divides 68 exactly without a remainder.
2. **Systematic Search (Paired Factors):** Initiating a search starting from 1 ($1 \times 68$), moving to 2 ($2 \times 34$).
3. **Divisibility Testing:** Applying divisibility rules (68 is even, so 2 works) and performing mental or long division (68 ÷ 4).
4. **Intermediate Factor Identification:** Identifying "difficult" primes; recognizing that 17 is a factor of 68 requires multi-digit multiplication or knowledge of the 17-times table.
5. **Completeness Verification:** Ensuring the "gap" between 4 and 17 is checked (checking 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc.) to ensure no factors are missed.

**Step 2: Buggy Rules/Common Errors**
*   **"Factor/Multiple Confusion":** Listing multiples (68, 136, etc.) instead of divisors.
*   **"Partial Set Bug":** Identifying easy factors (1, 2, 68) but failing to find 4, 17, and 34 due to termination of search once a "pair" is found.
*   **"The Middle Gap Error":** Missing the 4 and 17 pairing because 17 is outside the "1 to 10" multiplication table commonly memorized in Grade 6.
*   **"Odd-Divisor Exclusion":** Incorrectly assuming that because the number is even, all factors must be even, or failing to check for odd divisors like 17.
*   **"Remainder Neglect":** Incorrectly including numbers like 3 or 6 based on superficial digit properties (e.g., 68 starts with 6, so 6 is a factor).

**Step 3: Population Considerations**
In Grade 6, particularly in lower-resource settings, the shift from "Multiplication Tables" (memorization) to "Number Theory" (abstract factors) is a major hurdle. 68 is a high-cognitive-load number because one of its prime factors (17) is a large prime not covered in standard 1–10 tables. The open-ended format prevents "guessing" or "back-calculating" from choices. Limited English proficiency may cause confusion between the terms "factors," "multiples," and "prime numbers" if the Hindi equivalent (गुणनखंड - *gunankhand*) is not reinforced.

**Step 4: Holistic Estimate**
The requirement for "all or nothing" scoring is the primary inhibitor. While many students will find 1, 2, 34, and 68, the exclusion of the 4/17 pair is a very high-probability error for this demographic.
