Step 1: Procedural Steps
1.  **Decoding and Translation**: Read the English sentence and translate "North pole," "bar magnet," and "brought near" into conceptual equivalents (likely mentally translating to Hindi: *uttari dhruv*, *chumbak*, *paas laana*).
2.  **Visual-Spatial Retrieval**: Retrieve the mental model of two bar magnets with like-pole orientation (N-N).
3.  **Physical Law Retrieval**: Recall the specific rule governing magnetic interaction (Like poles repel; unlike poles attract).
4.  **Inference Execution**: Apply the rule to the specific scenario (N+N = repulsion).
5.  **Output Generation**: Formulate the response in English using the specific scientific term ("repel") or a functional description ("push away").

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1.  **Magnetic Attraction Bias**: The "Universal Attraction Bug" — many students believe magnets always stick to things; therefore, any two magnets brought together will "stick" or "attract."
2.  **Symmetry Confusion**: Swapping the rules of poles (treating them like electricity where they might focus on flow) or simply misremembering which pair (Like vs. Unlike) does what.
3.  **Terminology Mapping Error**: Using the word "repel" to mean "join" or "attract" due to limited English vocabulary (Semantic bug).
4.  **Static View**: Thinking nothing happens because they are both the "same" (Identity = Null interaction bug).

Step 3: Population Considerations
*   **Language Barrier**: Since the medium is English but the background is Hindi, the word "repel" is a high-threshold vocabulary word. Even if they understand the concept, they may struggle to retrieve "push away" in written English.
*   **Abstractness**: Grade 6 is the introductory year for formal magnetism.
*   **Format**: Recall (open-ended) is significantly harder than recognition (multiple choice) for students with limited English proficiency, as they cannot rely on "cloze" cues.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the "Universal Attraction Bias" and the language barrier regarding the term "repel," a significant portion of the cohort will likely state they "stick together." While the concept is foundational, the combination of English recall and the common misconception regarding magnets always attracting reduces the success rate.
