Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the word problem and identify the relationship (1 unit = 10 units, therefore 5 3/4 units = $10 \times 5 3/4$).
2. Convert the mixed fraction $5 3/4$ into an improper fraction ($23/4$).
3. Set up the multiplication: $10 \times (23/4)$ or $(10 \times 5) + (10 \times 3/4)$.
4. Execute the multiplication: Multiply numerator by 10 ($230/4$) or simplify/cancel common factors ($5 \times 23 / 2 = 115/2$).
5. Convert the result into a decimal (57.5) or a mixed number ($57 1/2$) for the final distance.

Step 2: Buggy Rules/Systematic Errors
- Improper conversion: $5 3/4 \to 5 \times 3 + 4 = 19/4$ or $5 \times 4 + 3 = 23/3$ (swapping numerator/denominator).
- Fraction as digits: Treating $5 3/4$ as $5.3$ or $5.34$.
- Operator selection: Attempting to divide ($10 \div 5 3/4$) due to keyword confusion or "larger number must be dividend."
- Whole-number-only: Multiplying $10 \times 5 = 50$ and ignoring the fraction.
- "Add numerator": $10 \times 5 3/4 = (10 \times 5) + 3/4 = 50 3/4$.

Step 3: Contextual Factors
Grade 7 students in this demographic often face "language interference"; if they translate the problem from English to Hindi mentally, nuances of "per litre" can be lost. Fraction arithmetic is a known "bottleneck" topic where many students plateau. The transition from whole number arithmetic to rational numbers involves high "procedural load" that often results in "fragile knowledge."

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
While the logic is simple (multiplication), the execution requires perfect fluency in mixed fractions—a skill with high failure rates in public school systems for this demographic. Many students will correctly identify the operation but fail at the procedural execution of the mixed number conversion.
