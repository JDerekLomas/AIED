Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Parse the English-language prompt and connect the "conditions" in the text to the columns/rows of a data table.
2. Comparative Magnitude Analysis: Compare numerical values across three categories to identify the maximum value (Step a).
3. Causal Reasoning: Link the absence of a variable (sunlight/darkness) to a biological outcome (Step b).
4. Domain-Specific Retrieval: Recall the technical term "Photosynthesis" (Step c).
5. Linguistic Encoding: Translate internal reasoning into written English sentences.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- "Max-Value Bug": Identifying the first number that looks "large" without comparing the entire set.
- "Language-Switch Error": Understanding the concept but providing the answer in Hindi (e.g., "prakash sanshleshan"), which may result in zero marks if the rubric is strictly English-only.
- "Feature-Focus Bug": Focusing on a different variable in the table (e.g., water or soil type) rather than the light condition mentioned in the prompt.
- "Teleological Reasoning": Explaining growth in (b) by saying "it needs food" rather than explaining the mechanism of why it is hindered.
- "Spelling-Retrieval Failure": The student knows the process but cannot approximate the spelling of "Photosynthesis" enough for the examiner to credit it.

Step 3: Student Population Context
The target population faces a "double burden": conceptual science mastery and English language acquisition. Grade 6 is the transitional year where science becomes more specialized. For economically weaker sections in Indian government schools, "Full Sunlight" (a) is high-probability, but (b) and (c) require English productive skills and technical vocabulary recall that are often barriers.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While part (a) is highly accessible, the three-part nature of the item—requiring both data interpretation and specific technical recall—drastically lowers the "fully correct" (all parts) success rate.
