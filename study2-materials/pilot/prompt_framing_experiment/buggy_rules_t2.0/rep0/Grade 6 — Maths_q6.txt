Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Recall the formula for the area of a rectangle ($L \times W$).
2. Perform the multiplication for the rectangle ($5 \times 4 = 20$).
3. Recall the formula for the area of a square ($Side \times Side$).
4. Perform the multiplication for the square ($5 \times 5 = 25$).
5. Compare the two resulting values ($25 > 20$) to identify the larger shape.
6. Calculate the difference (subtraction: $25 - 20 = 5$).
7. Apply correct units (sq.cm).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. "Area-Perimeter Confusion": Calculating $2(L+W)$ or $4 \times Side$ instead of area.
2. "Additive Property Error": Adding the dimensions provided ($5+4$ and $5+5$) instead of multiplying.
3. "Partial Execution": Finding both areas but failing to answer the second part of the prompt ("by how much").
4. "Side-Squared Confusion": Treating the square's area as $Side \times 2$ (doubling) rather than squaring.
5. "Language Barrier Bug": Inverting the "by how much" question or misinterpreting "greater" due to English proficiency gaps.

Step 3: Population considerations:
In Grade 6 (EWS/Hindi-medium context), the transition from arithmetic to mensuration often involves rote memorization of formulas which leads to high interference between perimeter and area. The open-ended format is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice for these students as it provides no "correct" value to trigger a correction of a buggy process. The multi-step nature of the "by how much" adds a layer where calculation errors in step 2 or 4 propagate to the final comparison.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While the numbers are small and manageable, the compounding probability of the "Area-Perimeter" bug and the linguistic requirement to provide the difference makes the success rate moderate to low for this specific demographic.
