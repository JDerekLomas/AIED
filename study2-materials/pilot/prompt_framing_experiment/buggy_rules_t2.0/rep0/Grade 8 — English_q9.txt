Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the English instructions ("Give the", "synonym", "antonym") and the target word "quiet".
2. Access the semantic meaning of "quiet" (mental representation of silence or calmness).
3. Retrieve a synonym: Recall a word with a similar meaning (e.g., silent).
4. Retrieve an antonym: Recall a word with the opposite meaning (e.g., noisy).
5. Correctly assign each word to the numbered lines (Synonym vs. Antonym labels).
6. Encode the retrieved words into written English (spelling).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
- Label Confusion (The "Reverse Swap" bug): Swapping the meanings of the terms "synonym" and "antonym," placing the opposite in the synonym slot and vice versa.
- The "Similar Sound" bug: Confounding "quiet" with "quite," leading to synonyms like "very" or "completely."
- The "Functional Association" bug: Providing a related concept that isn't the correct part of speech or category (e.g., writing "shhh" or "library").
- Retrieval Failure: Possessing the concept in Hindi (शान्त/shant) but failing to recall the specific English productive vocabulary for the opposite (e.g., knowing it's "shor," but not knowing "noisy" or "loud").
- Spelling Failure: Writing "noice" for noisy or "silence" for silent (which may be penalized depending on strictness of "synonym" as an adjective).

Step 3: Population/Item context:
- This is a productive/recall task (no options provided), which is significantly harder than a multiple-choice recognition task.
- For Grade 8 Hindi-medium students, the technical terms "synonym" and "antonym" are often sources of linguistic anxiety and confusion compared to the Hindi terms "Paryayvachi" and "Vilom".
- While "quiet" is a common word, the requirement to produce two distinct types of vocabulary relationships simultaneously increases the cognitive load and the chance of a "swap" error.
