Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the academic command "Differentiate" and the subject-specific terms "characteristics" into known concepts (often mentally translating English to Hindi/regional language).
2.  **Schema Retrieval**: Recall the specific biological criteria for life (movement, growth, respiration, etc.) from the Science syllabus.
3.  **Comparative Structuring**: Organize thoughts into a bifurcated structure (T-chart or parallel sentences) that contrasts the two categories.
4.  **Bilateral Requirement Execution**: Ensure the constraint of "two key characteristics for each" is met (4 points total), despite the rubric's odd scoring misalignment.
5.  **Scientific Expression**: Encode the retrieved concepts back into written English (or the language of assessment) using appropriate terminology.

Step 2: Common "Buggy Rules"
*   **The "Categorical Flattening" Bug**: Students list properties of a *specific* thing (e.g., "Cow gives milk") rather than a general characteristic of the *category* "Living things" (e.g., "Living things reproduce").
*   **The "Functional Asymmetry" Bug**: Providing a trait for one side but failing to provide its counter-point or an equivalent trait for the other side.
*   **The "Superficial Property" Bug**: Listing external or temporary states (e.g., "Living things are green," "Non-living things are heavy") instead of fundamental biological processes.
*   **The "Rubric Confusion" Bug**: If the teacher communicated that only one characteristic is needed (as per the rubric), the student might stop early, failing the actual question's "two characteristics" constraint.

Step 3: Target Student Population Factors
*   **Linguistic Barrier**: Students with limited English proficiency often struggle with the word "Differentiate" even if they understand the biological concepts.
*   **Recall vs. Recognition**: Open-ended recall is significantly harder for these students than multiple-choice recognition, leading to high rates of "blank page" syndrome.
*   **Economic Context**: Lack of home-based educational resources means reliance on rote memorization of the textbook; any slight variation in wording from the textbook can trigger procedural failure.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While "Living vs. Non-living" is a foundational topic, the mismatch between the high linguistic/structural demand of "differentiating with two characteristics" and the population's English proficiency creates a high probability of error. Most students will likely provide one correct characteristic but fail to provide four (two for each) with precise scientific language.
