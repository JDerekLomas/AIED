Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the English text and identify values (Length = 15, Breadth = 8).
2. Recall the specific formula for the area of a rectangle ($L \times B$).
3. Recall the specific formula for the perimeter of a rectangle ($2 \times [L + B]$).
4. Perform multi-digit multiplication ($15 \times 8$).
5. Perform addition and multiplication for perimeter ($15 + 8 = 23$; $23 \times 2 = 46$).
6. Assign correct units (sq. cm for area, cm for perimeter).
7. Synthesize both requirements to satisfy the rubric's "area" requirement within a single-score constraint.

Step 2: Buggy Rules/Cognitive Errors
1. Formula Interference: Using the perimeter formula for area or vice versa ($15 + 8 = 23$ for area).
2. Operation Error: Adding all numbers provided regardless of context ($15 + 8 = 23$).
3. Unit Error: Labeling area as "cm" instead of "sq. cm," or omitting units entirely.
4. "Area = L + B" bug: Systematic confusion that "Area" is just the sum of dimensions.
5. Incomplete Task Execution: Providing only the perimeter or only the area due to reading fatigue or "single-answer" heuristic.

Step 3: Student Context
The Grade 6 level represents the transition to formal geometry. For students in EWS/Hindi-medium contexts, "Breadth" may be a less familiar term than "Chaudai" (चौड़ाई). Additionally, an open-ended "find both" question increases cognitive load compared to a multiple-choice "find area" question. The rubric is strict; even if the student knows how to multiply, if they recall the wrong formula (Perimeter), they score 0.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While 15 × 8 is a manageable calculation, the requirement to correctly identify and differentiate two distinct geometric concepts (Area and Perimeter) in an English-medium context leads to significant "interference" errors. Historically, error rates on "Area" vs "Perimeter" tasks are high in Indian government school surveys (like ASER or NAS).
