Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English prompt into internal conceptual framework (Desert = Registan, Adaptations = Visheshtayein).
2. **Concept Retrieval**: Access mental models of specific desert plants (e.g., cactus) from long-term memory.
3. **Attribute Selection**: Isolate one functional trait that specifically addresses water conservation or acquisition (not just a visual description).
4. **Linking/Explanation**: Connect the physical trait to its biological purpose (e.g., "spines" to "prevent water loss").
5. **Syntactic Encoding**: Formulate an English sentence that satisfies the grammatical requirements of the rubric's "clear description."

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Procedural Errors)
1. **Surface-Feature Matching**: Providing a general desert fact instead of a plant adaptation (e.g., "It is very hot in the desert").
2. **Naming Bug**: Providing a label/noun without the functional "how/why" (e.g., just writing "Cactus" or "Spines").
3. **Teleological Confusion**: Stating a consequence rather than a mechanism (e.g., "They live there because they don't need water").
4. **Keyword Mismatch**: Using familiar terms incorrectly due to phonetic or translational interference (e.g., confusing "roots" with "routes" or "stems").
5. **Briefness Bias**: Students often provide a single word in English-medium exams when they lack the vocabulary to "Explain" (as required by the prompt), failing the "clearly describing" criteria.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Transition Period**: Grade 6 is the entry point for more formal scientific terminology.
2. **Open-ended Recall**: Without a word bank or multiple-choice options, cognitive load is maximized for ELL (English Language Learner) students.
3. **Rubric Strictness**: The rubric requires a "clear description" and a functional link; "Cactus" or "Spines" without further detail would score 0.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the "Explain" requirement and the English language barrier for Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds, many students will fail at the production stage (Step 5) or the naming-only bug, even if they possess the conceptual knowledge.
