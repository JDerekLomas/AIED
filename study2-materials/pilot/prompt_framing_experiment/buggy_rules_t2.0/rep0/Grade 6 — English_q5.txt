Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Decode and Comprehend the Prompt**: Understand the question in English, specifically the superlative "most important" and the relational "to the poet."
2. **Textual Retrieval**: Locate specific sections of the poem that discuss values, belongings, or emotional attachments.
3. **Inference/Thematic Extraction**: Synthesize multiple lines or stanzas to determine the primary message (theme) as opposed to literal plot points.
4. **Drafting a Response**: Formulate an English sentence that aligns the "important thing" with "friendship/blessing" as required by the rubric.
5. **Validation against Rubric Criteria**: Ensure the response focuses on the internal state of the poet rather than personal opinion.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Cognitive/Systematic Errors)
1. **The "Concrete over Abstract" Bug**: Identifying a physical object mentioned in the poem as "most important" rather than an abstract theme like friendship.
2. **The "Last Line" Heuristic**: Assuming the very last line of the poem is always the answer to "most important thing," regardless of content.
3. **The "Literalist" Bug**: If the poem doesn't use the exact phrase "Important is...", the student concludes the information is missing.
4. **The "Subjective Projection" Bug**: Answering based on what is important to the *student* rather than the *poet*.
5. **L1-L2 Translation "Bottleneck"**: Correctly identifying the theme in Hindi (dosti) but being unable to translate it into the "mentions relevant phrases" or "overall theme" required for full marks in English.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 6 students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds often struggle with the transition from literal reading comprehension to thematic inference in English. The open-ended nature of the question lacks the scaffolding of a multiple-choice format (recognition). Limited English vocabulary makes "Drafting a Response" (Step 1.4) a high-friction point, leading to blank answers or one-word answers that might not meet the rubric's threshold for "expressing agreement with themes."

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Considering the shift from retrieval to inference and the language barrier:
