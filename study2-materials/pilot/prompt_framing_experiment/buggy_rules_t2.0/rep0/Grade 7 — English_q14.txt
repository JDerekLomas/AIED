Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the instruction: Comprehend the English word "antonym" and the synonym phrase "opposite word."
2. Access lexical semantics: Retrieve the specific definition of the stimulus word "ancient" (differentiating it from simply "old" or "past").
3. Semantic inversion: Identify the target concept of the "opposite" in the mental lexicon.
4. Bilingual mapping: For students from Hindi backgrounds, this often involves a bridge through translation (Ancient -> Prachin -> Adhunik/Naya -> Modern/New).
5. Lexical retrieval: Access the specific English target word ("modern") from long-term memory.
6. Orthographic production: Correctly spell the target word in a written format.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" (Systematic procedural errors)
1. Semantic Association Error: Providing a synonym instead of an antonym (e.g., writing "very old"). This is the most common bug in vocabulary testing.
2. Contextual Drift: Providing an antonym for a related but incorrect word (e.g., treating "ancient" as "old" and providing "young" instead of "modern").
3. Phonological Approximation: Writing a word that sounds similar but is incorrect.
4. Translation Constraint: Retrieving the correct concept in L1 (Hindi) but being unable to bridge to the L2 (English) target word.
5. Negative Prefixation Bug: Applying a generalized rule for opposites incorrectly (e.g., "unancient" or "disancient").

Step 3: Population-specific considerations
The open-ended recall format (as opposed to multiple-choice) significantly increases cognitive load. For Grade 7 students in economically weaker sections with limited L2 exposure, "ancient" and "modern" are often "Tier 2/Tier 3" words that may exist in their passive vocabulary (recognition) but not their active vocabulary (recall/production).

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account the heavy reliance on productive recall, the likelihood of synonym/antonym confusion, and the linguistic distance between the home language and the academic L2:
