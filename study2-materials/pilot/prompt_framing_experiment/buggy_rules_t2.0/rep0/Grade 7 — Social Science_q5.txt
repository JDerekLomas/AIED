Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the specific definition of "igneous rocks" (volcanic origin).
2. Identify the transition mechanism: breakdown of rock into "sediments" via weathering/pressure.
3. Identify the transportation mechanism: movement of particles (erosion) or deposition.
4. Express the causal link between "igneous" and "sedimentary" using specific terminology.
5. Translate internal conceptual understanding into a written English sentence.

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules"
- "Metamorphic Leap": Students skip the sedimentary stage and assume all rock transformations require "heat and pressure" (the most common term associated with the rock cycle).
- "Cycle Circularity": Defining the cycle as a single-loop (A always goes to B) rather than a network, leading to confusion if asked about a specific path.
- "Sediment vs. Soil": Misidentifying sedimentary rocks as simply "dirt" or "sand" without the process of lithification/compaction.
- "Language-Switch Error": Substituting complex English verbs (weathering/erosion) with generic terms (breaking/going), which may not meet rubric requirements for "describing how."

Step 3: Target student population considerations
- Language Barrier: The requirement to "explain" and "describe" in English is a significant hurdle for Hindi-medium students; they may know the concept but fail to produce the English keywords required by the rubric.
- Recall vs. Recognition: The open-ended format is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice, especially for students with limited academic vocabulary.
- Content Overload: In many Grade 7 Social Science curricula in India, Geography is one of three subjects; "The Rock Cycle" is a high-abstraction topic often taught via rote memorization of a diagram rather than process-oriented understanding.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is foundational, the combination of specific terminology requirements (weathering/erosion), the open-ended English-language demand, and the tendency of students to confuse the three rock types or apply "heat/pressure" to every transformation suggests a low success rate for a fully correct "explain/describe" response.
