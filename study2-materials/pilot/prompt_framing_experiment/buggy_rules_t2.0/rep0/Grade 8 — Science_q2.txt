Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English phrasing "helpful in making curd" and identify the core biological process (fermentation).
2. Retrieve the specific name "Lactobacillus" from long-term memory (Recall vs. Recognition).
3. Transcribe/Spell "Lactobacillus" accurately enough to meet rubric requirements.
4. Identify the second demand of the prompt ("category").
5. Categorize the organism as "Bacteria" (Classification).
6. Provide both components to satisfy the conjunctive "and" in the prompt.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- Semantic Narrowing: Identifying the organism correctly but failing to provide the category (treating "category" as redundant or confusing it with "name").
- Orthographic "Good Enough" Bug: Writing phonetic approximations (e.g., "Lacto," "Lactobac") that may be penalized depending on the rigidity of the rubric/grader.
- Category Misclassification: Correctly identifying the name but miscategorizing it as "Virus" or "Fungi" due to general lack of microbial taxonomy.
- Language Interference (L1 to L2): Thinking of the Hindi term (Dahi) but failing to map the specific scientific nomenclature to the English prompt.

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 8 students from these demographics often have high factual familiarity with "curd" but face a "Bottleneck of Specificity." The 0.5-point weighting is very low, which in classroom settings often correlates with lower student effort or teachers glossing over the two-part nature of the question. Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice for students with limited English proficiency.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is foundational, the dual requirement (Name + Category) and the English recall of "Lactobacillus" create significant hurdles for students who might know the concept in their mother tongue but struggle with technical English nomenclature and systematic classification.
