Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Recall the definition of a "ruminant" and identify the target organism (cow).
2.  Retrieve anatomical knowledge of the ruminant digestive system (four chambers/rumen).
3.  Connect anatomical differences to a specific dietary requirement (cellulose/grass digestion).
4.  Translate complex biological concepts from internal Hindi/regional concepts into English syntax.
5.  Formulate a comparative sentence that explicitly "mentions one key difference."

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1.  "Surface Association" Bug: Stating what they eat (cows eat grass) but failing to link it to the *difference* in the system as requested.
2.  "Category Confusion": Assuming "ruminant" refers to any herbivore rather than the specific stomach structure.
3.  "Transliteration Error": Using Hindi terms (e.g., * जुगाली*) phonetically or literally translating "chewing the cud" in a way that loses the scientific meaning.
4.  "Fragmented Recall": Recalling that the stomach is "big" or "different" without the specific mechanism (rumen/four parts) required by the rubric.
5.  "Omission Bug": Answering why it is different but forgetting the second half of the prompt (the specific mention of diet).

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 7 students from economically weaker sections often have high "informal" knowledge of livestock but struggle with "formal" scientific vocabulary. The English-medium requirement creates a significant bottleneck; students often know *that* a cow chews twice but cannot articulate "cellulose" or "rumen" in a written English format. Open-ended recall is significantly more difficult for this demographic than multiple-choice recognition.
