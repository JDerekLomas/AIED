Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Decoding/Translation: Correcting translating the English prompt ("significance," "reign," "aspects") into internal Hindi conceptual framework.
2.  Historical Retrieval: Recalling specific facts about Ashoka from memory (Kalinga War, Dhamma, Edicts).
3.  Categorization/Conceptualization: Mapping discrete facts to the abstract category of "significance" or "impact."
4.  Relational Synthesis: Connecting his actions (e.g., non-violence) to his broader historical role (transformation of kingship).
5.  Encoding: Constructing a response in English that satisfies grammatical constraints to convey the retrieved significance.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1.  Keyword-to-Fact Mapping: Identifying "Ashoka" and dumping all memorized facts (e.g., "he was a king," "he lived long ago") without addressing "significance."
2.  The "Moral-Only" Bug: Defining his significance solely through a modern moral lens ("he was a good man") rather than a historical or administrative one.
3.  Truncated Logic Bug: Providing the "change of heart" narrative but failing to explain why it was significant to *Indian history* (the shift from conquest by force to conquest by Dhamma).
4.  Linguistic Interference Bug: Using Hindi syntax in English, leading to incomprehensible phrasing that fails to meet rubric requirements despite having the correct mental model.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker sections often struggle with "open-ended synthesis" questions. While they may know "who" Ashoka was (recognition), the demand for "significance" (evaluative) in a second language creates a high cognitive load. Limited exposure to academic English at home makes complex words like "significance" a barrier.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that the rubric requires both an "overall significance" and "two key aspects" for a single mark (a high-density demand), the transition from rote memorization to historical synthesis remains a major hurdle for this demographic.
