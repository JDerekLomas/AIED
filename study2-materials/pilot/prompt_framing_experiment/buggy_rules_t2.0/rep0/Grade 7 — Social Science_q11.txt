Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the command verb "Evaluate" (interpret as comparison/contrast in a socio-economic context).
2. Retrieve specific attributes of the Public Healthcare System (e.g., PHCs, government funding).
3. Retrieve specific attributes of the Private Healthcare System (e.g., profit-driven, specialized).
4. Apply a comparative filter to identify "differences" rather than just listing facts.
5. Formulate a dual-sided argument (one for public, one for private).
6. Translate internal conceptual understanding into written English sentences.

Step 2: "Buggy rules" and systematic errors
1. **The "Definition for Difference" Bug**: Providing a definition for one system but failing to provide a corresponding contrast for the other.
2. **The "Common Knowledge Overflow"**: Listing anecdotal grievances (e.g., "doctors are rude") instead of systemic "features" or "arguments" as required by the rubric.
3. **The "Categorical Collapse"**: Confusing "public" (government) with "popular" or "frequented by many."
4. **Translation Loop-back**: Using Hindi syntax in English writing that results in ambiguous semantic meaning, potentially failing the "valid argument" criteria.
5. **Magnitude Error**: Providing two examples for one category (public) while ignoring the other (private) due to a misreading of the "each" constraint.

Step 3: Target student population considerations
- Grade 7 students are transitioning from rote memorization to analytical evaluation.
- For Hindi-medium students in economically weaker sections, "Private Healthcare" is often an aspirational or alien concept, whereas "Public Healthcare" is lived experience, leading to a cognitive imbalance in recall.
- Limited English proficiency creates a "bottleneck" where the student understands the socio-economic reality but cannot structure a "valid argument" in the language of the test.
- Open-ended recall is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice recognition for this demographic.

Step 4: Final Estimate
Taking into account that the rubric requires two features across two distinct systems (a high cognitive load for a 1-point question) and the language barrier:
