Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Read the sentence "We ran around" and the prompt, identifying that a grammatical classification is required for a specific word.
2. **Syntactic Analysis**: Identify "ran" as the verb and determine how "around" relates to it (modifying the action of running).
3. **Differentiation (Preposition vs. Adverb)**: Distinguish if "around" is followed by an object (making it a preposition) or stands alone to describe the verb (making it an adverb).
4. **Categorical Retrieval**: Access the technical term "adverb" from memory without the aid of multiple-choice options.
5. **English Production**: Correctly spell the term in English.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **"Position-as-Function" Bug**: Students often classify any word following a verb as an "Object" (Noun) or assumes common spatial words are always Prepositions regardless of context.
2. **"Word-Class Mapping" Bug**: Association of specific words with fixed categories (e.g., "around" is taught primarily as a preposition in primary grades; therefore, it is *always* a preposition).
3. **"Suffix-Dependency" Bug**: The belief that adverbs must end in "-ly." Since "around" does not, it cannot be an adverb.
4. **"Translation Interference"**: In Hindi, many spatial adverbs function as postpositions or parts of compound verbs, creating confusion when mapped back to English parts of speech.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 7 students from these backgrounds are navigating "Adverb vs. Preposition" distinctions which are notoriously difficult (even for native speakers). The open-ended nature (no options) removes the possibility of guessing or using elimination. Limited English proficiency increases the likelihood that technical grammatical labels are memorized as "fuzzy" concepts rather than functional logic.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the lack of a noun phrase following "around," the primary "bug" will be students defaulting to "Preposition" due to rote learning, or "Noun" due to its position in the sentence. In this specific socio-economic and linguistic context, the conversion of grammatical theory into correct recall for intransitive phrasal usage is very low.
