Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English sentence structure "How did [Event] contribute to [Concept]?" into a mental model of cause and effect.
2. **Chronological Retrieval**: Access the specific schema for the 1757 Battle of Plassey (differentiating it from Buxar or other conflicts).
3. **Causal Reasoning**: Connect a military victory to its political consequence (transition from trade to territorial/political influence).
4. **Keyword Application**: Identify the "puppet nawab" mechanism (Mir Jafar) or the shift in Bengal's sovereignty.
5. **Expression**: Formulate a written response in English that aligns with the rubric's demand for "political dominance/control."

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules" (Errors)
1. **The "Tautology" Bug**: Repeating the question as the answer (e.g., "It contributed to British power because they won and became powerful").
2. **The "Conflict Substitution" Bug**: Mixing up Plassey with the Battle of Buxar (1764) and discussing the Diwani rights incorrectly as the immediate result of 1757.
3. **The "Narrative Recall" Bug**: Listing facts about the battle (Siraj-ud-Daulah, Robert Clive, the mango grove) without addressing the "How" of power expansion.
4. **The "Translation Gapping" Bug**: Using the word "tax" or "money" as a placeholder for "political dominance" because the student lacks the academic English vocabulary for "puppet ruler" or "dominance."
5. **The "Binary Outcome" Bug**: Assuming "expansion of power" just means "winning a fight" rather than "controlling a state."

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **ESL/Hindi-Medium Context**: In Grade 8, abstract concepts like "political dominance" or "contribute to expansion" are linguistically dense. Many students may understand the story in Hindi but fail to map it to the English rubric requirements.
2. **Economic Constraints/Rote Learning**: Students from lower SES backgrounds in this context often rely on memorizing textbook definitions. If the textbook wording varies slightly from the question phrasing, the "recall" fails.
3. **Open-Ended vs. Multiple Choice**: Without recognition cues, the student must generate both the historical fact and the causal link, significantly increasing cognitive load.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
The transition from describing a battle to explaining a structural political change is a high-order cognitive shift for an 8th-grade student, especially one navigating a second language. While "Mir Jafar" is a common name taught in Indian curriculum, connecting him to the systemic "expansion of British power" requires more than just naming him; it requires the logic of "indirect rule." Given the linguistic barriers and the "Narrative Recall" bug, most students will describe *what happened during the battle* rather than *how it expanded power*.
