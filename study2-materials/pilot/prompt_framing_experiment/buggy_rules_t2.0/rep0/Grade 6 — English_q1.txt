Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate and comprehend the question "Where did she find...?" (recognizing 'Where' as a spatial interrogative).
2. **Context Retrieval**: Access the specific mental representation of the narrative/text previously read.
3. **Keyword Matching**: Connect the entity ("she"/"Riya") and the object ("old book") to the specific location "attic."
4. **Vocabulary Mapping**: Link the concept of the space above the house to the English term "attic" (a word frequently unfamiliar to English Language Learners).
5. **Output Generation**: Transcribe the retrieved word/phrase into written English.

Step 2: Systematic procedural errors (Buggy rules)
1. **"First-Noun Retrieval"**: Instead of the correct location, students provide the location where the book was *originally* placed (e.g., "on the shelf" or "in the school") because they confuse the search process with the origin.
2. **"Interrogative Mismatch"**: Interpreting "Where" as "When" or "Who," leading to answers like "in the morning" or "Tommy found it."
3. **"Vocabulary Substitution"**: Substituting the specific word "attic" with a general local term or Hindi transliteration (e.g., "on the roof" or "tand") because "attic" is not in their active Tier 2 vocabulary.
4. **"Literal Copying"**: Identifying a different sentence in the text that contains the words "book" or "find" and copying that entire sentence regardless of its relevance to the specific "where" query.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often face a "vocabulary gap." The word "attic" is culturally specific to Western-style architecture and is rarely used in Indian domestic contexts, where "loft," "storeroom," or "terrace" are more common. While the rubric allows for short answers, the open-ended nature requires active recall of a specific, likely unfamiliar noun rather than passive recognition.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the combination of second-language barriers, the cultural specificity of the term "attic," and the transition from recognition to recall in Grade 6:
