Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Translate the linguistic operator "of" into the mathematical operator "multiplication."
2. Execute fraction multiplication for the first pair ($1/2 \times 3/4 = 3/8$).
3. Execute fraction multiplication for the second pair ($2/5 \times 2/3 = 4/15$).
4. Compare the two resulting fractions ($3/8$ vs. $4/15$). This requires finding a common denominator (e.g., 120), converting to equivalent fractions ($45/120$ vs. $32/120$), or using cross-multiplication.
5. Identify and state the final answer.

Step 2: Buggy rules:
- **Operation confusion:** Interpreting "of" as addition or division.
- **Additive fraction multiplication:** Adding numerators and denominators instead of multiplying them.
- **Incorrect comparison strategy:** Using "Whole Number Bias," assuming $4/15$ is larger than $3/8$ because the digits 4 and 15 are larger than 3 and 8.
- **Gap thinking:** Thinking $1/2$ of $3/4$ is larger because it "looks" closer to a whole, without calculation.
- **Common Denominator Bug:** Forgetting to change numerators when finding a common denominator.

Step 3: Student population factors:
Grade 7 students in this demographic often struggle with multi-step fractional reasoning. While the rubric focuses on the calculation of the two products, the question "Which is greater" necessitates a comparison step not explicitly mentioned in the scoring rubric but required for the "correct answer." English proficiency issues may lead to a failure to start the problem if "of" is not recognized as a signal for multiplication.

Step 4: Holistic Estimation:
The problem is high-load because it involves four distinct fractional sub-tasks (two multiplications and one multi-step comparison). Even if students successfully calculate $3/8$ and $4/15$, the comparison of fractions with different numerators and denominators is a common "bottleneck" skill.
