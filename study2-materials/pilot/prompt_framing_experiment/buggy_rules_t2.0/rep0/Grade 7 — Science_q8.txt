Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Selection of a surface/container (paper strip or test tube) to apply the liquid to the indicators.
2. Mixing/applying the liquid to the turmeric powder and the hibiscus extract separately (or creating a solution/strip first).
3. Systematic observation of the color change for both materials (e.g., turmeric turns reddish-brown in base; hibiscus turns green in base and dark pink/red in acid).
4. Correlating the specific color result to the acidity or basicity of the unknown liquid based on memorized properties of indicators.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. **Indicator Confusion:** Recalling the wrong color change for the wrong substance (e.g., believing turmeric turns red for acid because red is associated with "danger/acid").
2. **Indicator Overload:** Conflating the two indicators (mixing the reaction colors of hibiscus with turmeric).
3. **Literalism/Object Bug:** Treating "bottle filled with liquid" as an ingredient rather than the test subject, or assuming the turmeric and hibiscus must be mixed together first before adding to the liquid.
4. **Binary Error:** If one indicator shows a change, assuming the other is unnecessary; failing to provide the "full" determination logic.
5. **Language-Logic Gap:** Using "the liquid changes color" without specifying *which* color, failing to bridge the English term "indicator" with the practical action.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Language Barrier:** In Hindi-medium transitions, technical terms like "indicator," "extract," and "base" (alkali) often cause retrieval failure during open-ended writing.
2. **Lack of Hands-on Lab Time:** In many low-resource schools, this is a rote-memorized fact rather than a practiced observation, making "buggy" recall more likely.
3. **Synthesis vs. Multiple Choice:** This is a constructive task requiring a logical "if-then" sentence structure, which is significantly harder than selecting "Red" from a list.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
While turmeric's change in soap (base) is a common "everyday life" example in Indian textbooks, the requirement to explain both indicators and the lack of scaffolding in the prompt (open-ended recall) will lead to high error rates. Most students will likely remember "Turmeric + Base = Red" but fail to provide a complete procedure for the hibiscus or provide the reverse logic for the acid.
