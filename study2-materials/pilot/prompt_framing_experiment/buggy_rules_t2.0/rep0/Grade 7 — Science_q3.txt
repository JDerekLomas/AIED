Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English sentence ("green pigment," "plant leaves," "essential," "photosynthesis") into conceptual meaning, potentially mapping "green pigment" to the Hindi "हरा वर्णक" (hara varnak).
2. **Concept Retrieval**: Search long-term memory for the specific biological term associated with the functional category of photosynthesis.
3. **Phonological/Orthographic Retrieval**: Retrieve the specific name "Chlorophyll."
4. **Encoding/Spelling**: Transcribe the multi-syllabic, non-phonetic English word (Ch-l-o-r-o-p-h-y-l-l) onto paper.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" or cognitive errors
1. **Keyword Over-reliance (The "Green" Bug)**: Associating "green" generally with "leaf" or "plant," leading to answers like "leaf" or "tree."
2. **Functional Substitution**: Providing the process instead of the agent (e.g., answering "Photosynthesis" to a question about photosynthesis).
3. **Phonetic Transcription Bug**: Writing the word based on Hindi phonology rather than English spelling (e.g., "Klorofil," "Chlorofill," or "Clorofyl").
4. **Language Interference**: Recalling the term in Hindi but being unable to bridge the gap to the English technical term required by the rubric.

Step 3: Population-specific factors
1. **English Proficiency**: For Hindi-medium background students, "essential" and "pigment" are high-tier vocabulary words that may act as barriers to understanding the question.
2. **Recall vs. Recognition**: Unlike a multiple-choice question where "Chlorophyll" might be recognized, an open-ended format requires high-stacy retrieval of a difficult-to-spell word.
3. **Socio-economic context**: Possible limited exposure to visual/digital aids (videos of chloroplasts/cells) that reinforce the link between the name and the substance.

Step 4: Final Estimation
While the concept is a fundamental "must-know" fact in Grade 7 Science, the combination of a high-ceiling spelling requirement, the linguistic barrier of the question phrasing for ESL learners, and the transition from Hindi to English technical terms suggests a significant portion of students will either miss the term entirely or produce an incorrect phonetic variation that may fail a strict rubric.
