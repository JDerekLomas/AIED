Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the sentence "There are ____ apples in the basket" and the options (some/any).
2. Identify the sentence type as affirmative/assertive (vs. negative or interrogative).
3. Identify the noun "apples" as a plural countable noun.
4. Recall the quantifier distribution rule: 'some' is typically used for affirmative statements, while 'any' is used for negatives and questions.
5. Apply the rule to select "some" over "any."

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **The Question-Inversion Bug**: Students often perceive "some/any" choices as inherently interrogative (from exercises like "Are there any...?") and choose 'any' regardless of the sentence structure.
2. **The "Any" as "Every" Bug**: Translating "any" as "कोई भी" (Koi bhi) or "कितने भी," leading students to believe 'any' fits any plural context.
3. **Phonetic/Rhythmic Preference**: Choosing based on what "sounds right" without grammatical grounding; often "any" feels more sophisticated or "English-like" to English Language Learners.
4. **Indiscriminate Selection**: Selecting the second option by default if the first word "some" feels too simple or familiar from Hindi (कुछ).

Step 3: Student population considerations
1. Grade 6 students in Indian govt schools are often just transitioning to functional English syntax.
2. Hindi-medium backgrounds: Hindi doesn't have a direct syntactic equivalent to the some/any polarity (using 'कुछ' or 'कोई' differently), leading to negative transfer.
3. Limited exposure to naturalistic "input": Quantifiers are often taught as rote rules which are easily scrambled under test pressure.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
While this is a multiple-choice item (recognition), the subtle grammatical distinction between 'some' and 'any' is a classic "stumbling block" in Indian ESL contexts. However, the simplicity of the sentence structure provides a high floor for success.
