To analyze this item through the lens of systematic procedural errors and mathematical-style "buggy rules" in a linguistic context:

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. **Parsing the Operator:** Correctly identifying the "Wh-" word (*Why*) to determine the output type (reason/causal).
2. **Textual Retrieval:** Recalling the specific narrative link between the king's motive and the three questions (from the story *Three Questions* by Leo Tolstoy).
3. **Subject-Verb Transformation:** Transposing the interrogative "did the king announce" into the declarative "the king announced."
4. **Morphological Concord:** Changing "announce" to the past tense "announced" to match the auxiliary "did."
5. **Syntactic Joining:** Utilizing "because" or "to" (infinitive) to link the action to the reason.
6. **English Lexical Encoding:** Selecting the correct vocabulary in a second language to communicate the answer.

**Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)**
*   **The Tense Retention Bug:** Students keep the verb in its base form (*The king announce...*) or attach the "ed" to the auxiliary (*The king did announced...*).
*   **The Question-Cloning Bug:** Starting the answer by repeating the entire question rather than transforming it.
*   **The Translation/Transfer Bug:** Thinking in Hindi ("Kyon" = why) but lacking the "to + verb" infinitive structure, leading to "For answer" instead of "To answer."
*   **The Lexical Retrieval Bug:** Forgetting the specific word "reward" or "questions," leading to vague pronouns (*to get thing*).
*   **The Why-Substitution Bug:** Answering "What" (the reward itself) instead of "Why" (the purpose), a common error where any detail from the story is provided.

**Step 3: Population Factors**
In Grade 7 Indian government school contexts, students are transitioning from rote memorization to comprehension. While this is a "recall" task from a standard textbook chapter, the requirement to construct an original sentence in English (an L2 or L3) without prompts (no multiple choice) significantly raises the cognitive load. For ESL/ELL learners, the "buggy rules" of English syntax often interfere even when the student understands the story's content.

**Step 4: Holistic Analysis**
While many students will remember the plot (low retrieval difficulty), a significant majority will fail the morphological and syntactic requirements (high encoding difficulty). The rubric allows for "any similar reason," which helps, but the language barrier remains a primary bottleneck.
