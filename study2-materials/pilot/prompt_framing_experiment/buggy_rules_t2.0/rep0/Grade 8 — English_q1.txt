Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Decode the syntax:** Parse the "Wh-" question structure (past tense "did") to identify the subject (the sky) and the specific condition (during sunset).
2. **Text Retrieval/Recall:** Access the mental model of the source text to locate the specific descriptive imagery (orange and pink).
3. **Semantic Mapping:** Map the English color vocabulary to the recalled visual imagery.
4. **Sentence Construction:** Formulate an answer in the past tense ("The sky looked/was...") while maintaining subject-verb agreement.
5. **Orthographic/Vocabulary production:** Correctly spell specific abstract color nouns ("orange", "pink") and descriptors ("shades", "painted").

Step 2: "Buggy rules" and systematic errors
1. **The "Tense-Copy" Bug:** Taking the root verb from the "did" question without inflecting it for the past tense (e.g., "The sky look orange").
2. **Keyword Match-only Retrieval:** Providing a single-word answer ("Orange") or an irrelevant association with "sunset" or "sky" from general knowledge rather than the specific text.
3. **The "Hinglish" Lexical Gap:** Substituting English color words with phonetic spellings or failing to recall specific secondary colors (like pink) in a second language.
4. **Syntax Transfer Error:** Applying Hindi word order (Subject-Object-Verb) or using "is/was" incorrectly as a copula (e.g., "Sky orange color was").
5. **Partial Set Error:** Capturing only one attribute (only "orange") when the rubric/source text requires a compound description ("orange and pink").

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 8 students in this context often face "low-stakes" English exposure, where reading comprehension is frequently reduced to "find and copy" tasks. For an open-ended recall question without a word bank, the jump from recognition to production is steep. Limited English proficiency often results in students leaving the answer blank or providing a single-word response that may not meet a rigid rubric requiring a specific compound description ("both colors").
