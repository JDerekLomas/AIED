Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Retrieval: Access the specific mental schema for "Harappan Civilization" or "Indus Valley Civilization."
2. Feature Isolation: Isolate "urban planning" (civil engineering) from other categorical knowledge like "religion," "trade," or "jewelry."
3. Attribute Selection: Select one specific, valid attribute (grid pattern, drainage, bricks, citadel).
4. Translation/Encoding: Convert the internal concept into a written English sentence.
5. Vocabulary Mapping: Correctly link the concept to its technical term (e.g., mapping the concept of "upstairs/downstairs parts" to "citadel/lower town").

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. Categorical Overgeneralization: The student provides a generic Harappan fact that is not about urban planning (e.g., "They worshipped seals" or "They were farmers").
2. Definition Slippage: Confusion between "urban planning" and "modern technology" (e.g., "They had electricity" or "They used cement").
3. Terminology Interference: Swapping specialized terms (e.g., calling the "Citadel" the "Temple" due to its elevated nature).
4. L1-L2 Translation Fault: Having the concept in Hindi (Nagar Niyojan) but lacking the English syntax to express "grid" or "drainage" beyond a single noun, which might be marked as insufficient if "describe" is strictly interpreted.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 8 students from this demographic face a "Recall Gap." While recognition-based questions (MCQs) might yield higher scores, open-ended "describe" questions in a non-native language act as a double-hurdle. The procedural requirement to articulate a specific historical feature in English often leads to "empty" answers or phonetic/spelling-based approximations that fail rubric requirements.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the reliance on specific terminology (Citadel, Drainage, Grid) in a second language and the common tendency for students to provide "lifestyle" facts rather than "engineering" facts when asked about urban planning:
