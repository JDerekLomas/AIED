Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decoding the English prompt (syntax and vocabulary).
2. Retrieving the specific literary text ("Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy) from long-term memory.
3. Accessing the three specific variables (Time, People, Action) stored during reading.
4. Translating Hindi-conceptualized answers into English syntax.
5. Drafting a grammatically coherent sentence that aligns with the specific three-part criteria in the rubric.

Step 2: Buggy rules:
1. "Keyword Match Error": Seeing "Three Questions" and providing the *answers* provided by the hermit instead of the questions asked by the king.
2. "Simplification Bug": Identifying only one or two components instead of all three (partial recall).
3. "Translation Interference": Using direct Hindi-to-English literal translations that result in non-target syntax (e.g., "Right time to start work" vs "When to do things").
4. "Surface-level retrieval": Recalling that the story exists but failing to distinguish the King's specific intent from general story themes (e.g., "How to be a good king").

Step 3: Population factors:
The requirement of productive recall (open-ended) rather than receptive recognition (multiple choice) significantly lowers success rates for second-language learners. For students in economically weaker sections with limited English exposure, the gap between "understanding the story in Hindi/translation" and "producing a 3-part technical answer in English" is substantial.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While the story is a core part of the NCERT Grade 7 curriculum, the combination of tripartite recall and English production requirements in an open-ended format presents a high cognitive load for this specific demographic.
