Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the sentence structure and vocabulary (knowing what an elephant, tiger, and zoo are in English).
2. Apply the "vowel-sound" rule for the first blank: identify 'e' in elephant as a vowel sound and select "an".
3. Apply the "consonant-sound" rule for the second blank: identify 't' in tiger as a consonant sound and select "a".
4. Apply the "definite article" rule for the third blank: recognize "zoo" as a specific, situational noun requiring "the".
5. Physically rewrite the entire sentence without making copying errors (spelling, capitalization, or punctuation).

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- "First-letter" Bug: Checking the first letter instead of the sound (less problematic here, but common in "hour/university" cases).
- "A-Dominance" Bug: Using "a" for all singular nouns because it is the most frequently reinforced article.
- "Indefinite Generalization": Applying "a/an" to the third blank (I saw... a zoo) because the first two required indefinite articles (pattern matching).
- "Deletion" Bug: Skipping "the" because "at zoo" sounds correct to a Hindi-speaker whose native language lacks articles.
- "Fragmented Output": Writing only the three words (an, a, the) instead of the "whole sentence" as per instructions.

Step 3: Population Considerations
For 7th-grade students from low-SES backgrounds in India, English is often a "foreign" language rather than a second language. While the "a/an" distinction is heavily drilled, the usage of "the" remains highly intuitive and difficult to master. Furthermore, the rubric requires rewriting the *whole* sentence correctly; many students will provide the correct articles but fail the rubric due to copying errors or simply listing the missing words.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The combination of triple-article placement, the specific use of "the" (which has no Hindi equivalent), and the rigorous "rewrite the whole sentence" rubric creates multiple points of failure for a 7th grader with limited English proficiency.
