Step 1: List specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English syntax of "Describe the process..." and the complex clausal structure into the core question: "How did they go from traders to rulers?"
2. **Concept Retrieval**: Access historical schema related to the East India Company (EIC), Battle of Plassey/Buxar, or the Diwani rights.
3. **Threshold Matching**: Identify that the rubric requires specific mention of the *initial* status (traders/factories) to get the mark, even though the prompt asks for a "process" (a narrative of transition).
4. **Sentence Construction**: Compose a coherent response in English (the medium of instruction) that maps the retrieved concept to the specific criteria in the rubric.

Step 2: Identify "buggy rules" (Systematic procedural errors)
1. **The "Topic Match" Bug**: Students see "East India Company" and "Rulers" and write everything they know about British rule (e.g., "The British stayed for 200 years") without mentioning the specific "trader" starting point required by the rubric.
2. **The "Conclusion-Only" Bug**: Students describe the result (they fought wars and took over) but omit the premise (the "starting as traders" condition), which is the sole requirement for the point in this specific rubric.
3. **Keyword-Dependency Bug**: Limited English proficiency leads students to copy phrases directly from the question ("The EIC became rulers of territory") without adding the required original content ("They were traders").
4. **Historical Flattening**: Treating the EIC and the British Crown as the same entity from the beginning, missing the evolution from a commercial company to a political state.

Step 3: Consider target population
Grade 8 students in this demographic often struggle with the transition from rote memorization to "process" descriptions. In an open-ended format, the linguistic barrier significantly increases the "failure to trigger" the specific keyword needed for the rubric, even if the student understands the general history. The disconnect between the broad prompt ("Describe the process") and the narrow rubric ("Mention they were traders") creates a high probability of students writing much but scoring zero.

Step 4: Estimate proportion
Taking into account the misalignment between the high-level demand of the prompt and the specific requirement of the rubric, alongside language barriers:
