Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English prompt and vocabulary (Imagine, bird, sentence).
2. Perform a "deictic shift" (mental projection) to adopt a non-human persona (Theory of Mind).
3. Retrieve English vocabulary related to bird actions (fly, eat, sky, wings).
4. Retrieve the syntactic rule for an English S-V-O or S-V-Adj sentence.
5. Apply morphological rules (verb conjugation, articles).
6. Encode thoughts into written script (orthography).

Step 2: Common "Buggy Rules" / Systematic errors
1. **L1 Syntactic Interference:** Applying Hindi Word Order (Subject-Object-Verb).
2. **First-Person/Third-Person Collision:** Mixing perspectives ("I am flying" vs. "Bird is flying") because the prompt asks to imagine being a bird but students often default to describing a bird.
3. **Phonetic Encoding Bug:** Spelling based on Hindi phonemes (e.g., "birad" or "skai").
4. **Coping Strategy (Null Verb):** "I sky." (Dropping the copula or action verb common in transitional English learners).
5. **Categorical Confusion:** Listing attributes ("I have wings") rather than describing "a day" (the temporal requirement).

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often have significant gaps in English exposure. In a Hindi-medium context, writing a novel, open-ended sentence requires generative production, which is exponentially more difficult than the rote memorization of textbook answers. The "creative" and "grammatically correct" rubric is a high barrier for students still struggling with basic syntax and the cognitive load of a perspective shift.
