Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Visual-to-concept decoding: Interpreting the sequential logic of the images (fox, well, entrapment).
2. Linguistic retrieval: Accessing specific L2 (English) vocabulary (e.g., "fox," "well," "fell," "climb," "jump").
3. Syntactic construction: Formulating a past-tense narrative (e.g., "The fox fell").
4. Semantic alignment: Ensuring the written text specifically addresses the "could not escape" constraint required by the rubric.
5. Orthographic execution: Converting mental sentences into written words with legible spelling and punctuation.

Step 2: Systematic buggy rules
1. Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) Transfer Bug: Applying Hindi syntax (SOV) to English sentences (e.g., "Fox well in fell").
2. Tense-Marking Bug: Over-regularizing or failing to mark past tense (e.g., "He fall in well" or "He falled").
3. Prepositional Omission Bug: Omitting directionals/locatives due to lack of direct equivalents in learner interlanguage (e.g., "Fox fall well").
4. "The" Deletion Bug: Dropping articles, common in Hindi-to-English transitions (e.g., "Fox in well").
5. Phonetic Spelling Bug: Spelling based on Indian English pronunciation (e.g., "fall" as "fal" or "escape" as "isckep").

Step 3: Target population considerations
The task is open-ended (recall), not multiple choice (recognition). For Grade 8 students from low-SES, Hindi-medium backgrounds, the jump from "recognizing a fox" to "generating a grammatically coherent narrative in English" is significant. While many may understand the story, the rubric likely demands a level of grammatical coherence that many learners at this level haven't yet stabilized, especially given the "all or nothing" maximum score of 1.
