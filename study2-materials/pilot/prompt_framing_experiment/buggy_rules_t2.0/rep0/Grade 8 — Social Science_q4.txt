Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Decoding the technical terms "primary role" and "Panchayati Raj" within a sentence structure potentially more complex than their colloquial Hindi-English code-switching.
2.  Retrieving the specific semantic category of "Local Self-Governance" (as opposed to general welfare or political leadership).
3.  Connecting the concept to the "village/grassroots" level specifically (spatial categorization).
4.  Synthesizing the concepts of "administration" and "development" into a coherent written English response.
5.  Encoding the answer in written English, maintaining grammatical integrity sufficient to convey the definition.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1.  "Concrete Association Bug": Identifying a specific task (e.g., "building roads," "digging wells") rather than the structural/abstract role (governance).
2.  "Scalar Misalignment Bug": Confusing the roles of local vs. state government (attributing State/Central powers to the Panchayat).
3.  "Etymological Translation Bug": Defining "Panchayat" literally as "group of five" or "meeting" rather than its constitutional function.
4.  "Linguistic Substitution": Using local dialect/Hindi terms in an English medium paper, which may be marked wrong depending on the strictness of the evaluator/rubric.
5.  "Keyword Matching Bug": Providing any fact about Panchayati Raj (e.g., "established in 1992," "73rd amendment") instead of answering the specific functional "why/role" question.

Step 3: Student population considerations
The shift from recall to production is the greatest barrier. Grade 8 students in this demographic often possess conceptual understanding but struggle with "academic language." For an open-ended English-language item, "Primary role" is a sophisticated prompt for students whose primary linguistic exposure to these concepts occurs in Hindi. The requirement for a specific multi-faceted definition (self-governance + development) creates a high "miss" rate for partial but insufficient answers.
