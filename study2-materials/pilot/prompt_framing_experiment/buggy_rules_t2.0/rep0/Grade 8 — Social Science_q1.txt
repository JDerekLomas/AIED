Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decipher the English prompt and identify the core nouns ("Fundamental Rights," "Constitution").
2. Retrieve specific named entities from long-term memory categorized under the "Fundamental Rights" schema.
3. Select exactly two distinct items to satisfy the quantitative constraint.
4. Translate retrieved concepts (often learned in Hindi/Hinglish) into English terminology.
5. Record the names in written English.

Step 2: Identify "buggy rules" / systematic errors
1. Category Over-extension: Listing "Fundamental Duties" (e.g., respecting the flag) or "Directive Principles" instead of Rights due to similar-sounding nomenclature.
2. Conceptual Conflation: Listing specific legal rights (e.g., Right to Vote) as Fundamental Rights.
3. Quantifier Neglect: Providing only one right or three+ rights, though the rubric's "Maximum score: 1" suggests providing more isn't penalized if two are correct, the lack of two leads to zero.
4. Language Interference/Semantic Drift: Using overly vague terms (e.g., "Right to live") that may not map to the specific Constitutional headers recognized by graders (e.g., "Right to Life and Personal Liberty").
5. Phonetic Spelling/Retrieval Failures: Partial recall of technical terms leading to illegible or nonsensical terms (e.g., "Equality right").

Step 3: Target student population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often struggle with the transition from bilingual instruction to English-only testing. While "Right to Equality" and "Right to Education" are rote-memorized, the high-stakes pressure of a formal test and the recall (as opposed to multiple-choice) format often triggers "buggy" categorization errors where any positive civic concept is provided as an answer.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
This is a high-recall, low-complexity item. The popularity of the topic in the Indian curriculum (civics) provides a buffer, as Fundamental Rights are heavily emphasized. However, the language barrier and the systematic confusion between "Rights" and "Duties" in the middle school curriculum act as significant filters.
