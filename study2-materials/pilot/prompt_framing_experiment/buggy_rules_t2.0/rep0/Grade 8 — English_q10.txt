Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Identify the adjective/adverb that follows "very" (weak).
2. Substitute "very" with the intensifier "too".
3. Identify the infinitive action in the second sentence (walk).
4. Strip the second sentence of its subject and modal negation ("He cannot").
5. Synthesize the components using the "to" particle to link the adjective to the verb.
6. Maintain the underlying semantic relationship (excessive quality leading to an inability).

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **Redundancy Bug:** Keeping the negation (e.g., "He is too weak to not walk") because the student perceives the original sentence as negative and fears losing that meaning.
2. **Double Intensifier Bug:** Retaining "very" (e.g., "He is very too weak to walk").
3. **Mismatched Subject Bug:** Keeping the second "he" (e.g., "He is too weak he to walk").
4. **Preposition Confusion:** Substituting "too" with "to" or vice versa due to phonetic similarity (e.g., "He is to weak too walk").
5. **Modal Retention:** Keeping the auxiliary verb (e.g., "He is too weak cannot walk").

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students in this context are often transitioning from grammar taught as discrete, translated rules to applied syntax. English is frequently a third language (L3). The "too...to" structure is a "transformation" exercise which requires a high degree of structural awareness. Students with limited English proficiency often struggle with the "covert negation" inherent in "too...to," as the word "not" disappears but the meaning remains negative.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the structure is a staple of the curriculum, the leap from two simple sentences to a complex construction involves managing several potential points of failure (spelling of too/to, deletion of the subject/modal). For this demographic, systemic errors regarding auxiliary verbs and phonetic spelling are highly prevalent.
