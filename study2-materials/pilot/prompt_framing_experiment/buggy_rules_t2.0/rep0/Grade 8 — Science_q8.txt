Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Recall (Definition): Accessing the mental category of "unwanted/wild plants" associated with "weeds."
2. Relational Recall (Context): Identifying the specific relationship of weeds to "crops" or "main plants."
3. Causal Reasoning (Removal): Identifying the negative impact of weeds (competition for nutrients/water/space) to justify the importance of weeding.
4. Linguistic Encoding (English): Translating the Hindi concept (kh खरपतवार / niraai निराई) into an English sentence structure.
5. Integration: Combining both the "what" and "why" into a single coherent response to meet the two-part prompt.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. Categorical Over-extension: Defining weeds as any "small plants" or "dirty plants," rather than specifically "unwanted" in a crop context.
2. Missing Consequent: Defining the weed but failing to address the "why" (removal importance), or vice versa.
3. Nutrient Teleology: Belief that weeds "eat the crop" directly rather than "compete for resources."
4. Transliteration Errors: Using the English word "weeds" but applying Hindi syntax that obscures the causal relationship, leading to "Weeds are remove because crop is not grow."
5. Synonym Substitution Bug: Confusing "weeding" with "wedding" or "seeding" due to phonological similarity in an L2 environment.

Step 3: Target student population analysis
EWS students in Grade 8 often have a gap between their conceptual understanding (often strong due to agricultural proximity) and their English production. Since this is an open-ended recall question worth only 1 mark but requiring two distinct pieces of information, students often provide partial answers. In Hindi-medium backgrounds, technical science vocabulary in English acts as a high barrier. While "weeds" is a high-frequency term in the curriculum, the "why" requires a more complex syntactical structure than simple rote definition.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The 1-mark rubric is unforgiving (requiring a correct definition AND implicitly the reasoning) despite the dual-part question. Many students will likely define the term but skip the justification, or vice versa.
