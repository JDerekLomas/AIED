Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Textual decoding and inference: Correctly interpret "stunted growth" and "yellowing leaves" as specific signs of nutrient deficiency (specifically Chlorosis).
2. Diagnostic retrieval: Link "yellowing/stunted growth" to a specific macro-nutrient (Nitrogen/N-P-K) from the Grade 7 Science curriculum.
3. Solution formulation: Identify the input category (Fertilizers/Manure) required to resolve soil depletion.
4. Linguistic encoding: Synthesize these scientific concepts into a coherent English sentence.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. Over-generalization of "Water/Sun": A common bug where students attribute any plant ailment to lack of water or sunlight, ignoring the "soil analysis" cue in the prompt.
2. Naming "Food" instead of "Nutrients": Using everyday vocabulary (e.g., "Give more food/vitamins") rather than the domain-specific terms required by the rubric.
3. Chemical/Organic Disconnect: Believing only "medicine" (pesticides) fixes sick plants, failing to differentiate between pests and deficiency.
4. Keyword translation bug: Understanding "Nutrient" in Hindi (*Poshak tatva*) but failing to recall the specific English equivalents like "Phosphorus" due to phonological/spelling barriers.

Step 3: Population Considerations
The open-ended format is high-stakes for this demographic. While students often understand the concept of "Khaad" (Manure/Fertilizer), the requirement to name a specific nutrient (N-P-K) significantly raises the threshold for a 1-point score. English as the medium of examination creates a "gatekeeper" effect, where scientific knowledge is often lost in the transition from thought to written English.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept of "fertilizers" is culturally accessible to many in rural or semi-urban Indian contexts, the specific naming of nutrients (Nitrogen, etc.) required by the rubric for a full point, combined with the English production demand, creates a significant barrier for students from limited English proficiency backgrounds.
