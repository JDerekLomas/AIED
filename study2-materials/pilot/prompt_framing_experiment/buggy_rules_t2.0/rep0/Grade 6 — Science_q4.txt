Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Decode the semantic intent:** Understand "prefer" and "preference" as a request for causal justification (Why?) and identify "summer" and "hot weather" as the environmental context.
2. **Retrieve physical properties:** Access long-term memory to retrieve properties specifically associated with cotton in a thermal/moisture context (absorption of sweat/porosity).
3. **Causal Mapping:** Link the property (absorbs sweat) to the physiological need (cooling via evaporation), even if the rubric only requires the property.
4. **Linguistic Encoding (Translation):** Convert the internal concept (often stored or understood in Hindi as "pasina sokhna") into the English terminology ("absorbs," "sweat," "pores") required for the written response.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules" and Cognitive Errors
1. **The "Tautological Bug":** Providing a circular definition instead of a property (e.g., "Cotton is used because it is comfortable in summer" or "Because it is good for summer").
2. **Contextual Confusion Bug:** Associating cotton with "softness" or "lightness" (general properties) rather than the specific functional properties required by the rubric (absorbency/breathability).
3. **Keyword Mismatch Bug:** Students may know the mechanism but lack the English vocabulary, leading to incorrect substitutions (e.g., "Cotton takes the water" instead of "absorbs sweat").
4. **Phonetic/Orthographic Errors:** Inability to spell "absorb" or "porous," leading to phonetic approximations that may not meet the grading threshold.

Step 3: Population Considerations (Grade 6, EWS, ESL)
1. **Format:** Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice recognition for ESL learners.
2. **Language Barrier:** In many Indian EWS schools, "Science" is taught in English but explained in Hindi. The "bottleneck" is not the scientific understanding but the formal retrieval of the English property labels.
3. **Maturity:** At Grade 6, students are just transitioning from descriptive observations to explaining mechanisms.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is culturally familiar, the requirement to articulate a specific scientific property in English (as opposed to just saying it feels "cool") acts as a significant filter.
