Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Decoding and Translation:** Decipher the English question and translate the key concept "What did X mean to Y?" into a L1 (Hindi) mental framework ("Anika ke liye drawing ka kya matlab tha?").
2.  **Information Retrieval (Schema):** Locate the specific narrative episode in long-term memory where Anika’s relationship with drawing is defined (moving beyond literal "hobby" to "expression").
3.  **Linguistic Mapping:** Identify the English vocabulary required to convey "expressing thoughts and feelings" (an abstract linguistic task).
4.  **Syntactic Construction:** Construct a grammatically coherent sentence using the past tense ("Drawing meant..." or "It was...") and the correct prepositional/objective structure required by the rubric.
5.  **Alignment with Rubric:** Filter out common "gist" answers to ensure both "more than a hobby" and "expressing feelings" are communicated to satisfy the specific rubric demand.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic procedural errors)
*   **The "Keyword Match" Bug:** Students see "mean" and look for a literal definition or synonym in the text rather than an abstract interpretation.
*   **The "Tautological Completion" Bug:** If the student doesn't recall the specific lesson detail, they define drawing generically ("Drawing mean to make pictures") using real-world knowledge instead of text-based evidence.
*   **The "Subject-Object Swaps":** Because "What did drawing mean to Anika" is a complex construction, students often respond with "Anika meant drawing," reversing the relationship.
*   **The "First-Point Stop" Bug:** Students provide a partial answer (e.g., "It was a hobby") because they assume one identifying fact is sufficient for a 1-mark question, failing the rubric’s dual requirement.
*   **The "Transliteration/Hinglish" Bug:** Students formulate the concept in Hindi and use a 1:1 word-for-word translation that breaks English syntax rules, often losing the intended meaning.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
*   **Open-ended recall:** Unlike Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs), the student must generate vocabulary ("expressing," "feelings"). In EWS and Hindi-medium contexts, the gap between receptive vocabulary (understanding) and productive vocabulary (writing) is often significant.
*   **Abstract Rubric:** The rubric requires describing internal states ("thoughts and feelings"). Grade 8 students in this demographic often struggle with abstract emotional descriptors in their L2 compared to concrete actions.

Step 4: Holist Estimate
The cognitive load of translating an abstract concept into correct English syntax, combined with the "First-Point Stop" bug (providing only half of the required rubric content), makes this a high-difficulty item for this population.
