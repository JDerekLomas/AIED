Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the specific chemical reagent required (Iodine solution).
2. Describe the application of the reagent (putting drops on the cut surface of the potato).
3. Recall the specific color change indicative of a positive result (blue-black).
4. Synthesize these points into a coherent written response in English.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. Reagent Confusion: Substituting "iodine" with "iron," "insulin," or "acid" due to phonetic similarity or lexical interference.
2. Indicator Misalignment: Associating the blue-black color with protein or fat instead of starch.
3. Vague Action: Stating "test it" or "put the potato in water" without specifying the chemical addition.
4. False Positives (Color): Reporting "turns red" (confusing with sugar test) or simply "changes color" without specifying which one.
5. Language Syntax "Bug": Having the conceptual knowledge but being unable to formulate the "If-Then" logic required to state the confirmation.

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 6 is the introductory year for formal laboratory procedures. For Hindi-medium students in EWS contexts, "Iodine" is often a loanword they have heard but may not know how to spell or apply contextually. An open-ended recall question is significantly harder than a multiple-choice question for this demographic, as it requires active retrieval of scientific vocabulary in a second language. The rubric is generous (focusing on the "iodine" part), but the student must still navigate the "Describe" command.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric is narrow (awarding credit just for mentioning iodine), the combination of linguistic barriers, the shift from rote recognition to written recall, and the common confusion between different food tests (starch vs. protein) creates a significant bottleneck.
