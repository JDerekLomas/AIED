Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Decode Language:** Parse the English sentence to identify the core subject ("soil formation") and the task constraint ("Name one major factor").
2. **Retrieve Mental Schema:** Access the internalized list of geographical factors (Parent Rock, Relief, Flora/Fauna, Time, Climate) associated with the specific textbook chapter.
3. **Select/Isolate:** Choose exactly one distinct term that qualifies as a "major factor."
4. **Encoding/Production:** Write the English term or its phonetically recognizable equivalent correctly.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- **The "Category Slip" Bug:** Confusing the *process* with the *factor* (e.g., writing "Weathering" or "Erosion" instead of "Climate" or "Time").
- **The "Definition Displacement" Bug:** Defining what soil is rather than naming a factor of its formation.
- **The "Association-Switch" Bug:** Providing a factor of soil *degradation* (e.g., "deforestation" or "overgrazing") instead of soil *formation* because "soil" acts as the primary anchor for memory retrieval.
- **Linguistic Interference Bug:** Knowing the concept in Hindi (e.g., "Jalvayu") but being unable to recall the specific English term "Climate," leading to an empty response or a phonetically garbled non-word.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 8 students from these backgrounds often rely on rote memorization (parroting) of textbook headers. The open-ended nature of "Name one" is easier than a full explanation but harder than a multiple-choice question because it requires active recall of technical vocabulary. In these contexts, soil formation is a "high-frequency" exam topic, increasing the likelihood of successful retrieval, but English-medium testing for Hindi-background students often results in significant "drop-off" during the encoding phase.
