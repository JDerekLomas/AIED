Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Linguistic Decoding: Translate the English academic terms "transparency" and "governance" into known concepts (likely via internal translation to Hindi equivalents like *pardarshita* and *shasan/sarkar*).
2. Concept Retrieval: Access the mental schema for "good governance" or "democracy" learned in the Grade 7 Civics curriculum (likely the chapter on State Government).
3. Idea Generation: Identify a concrete mechanism that reduces secrecy or increases public access (e.g., RTI, digitalization/ICT, public hearings).
4. Functional Output: Formulate a coherent "suggestion" in English that aligns with the semantic requirements of the rubric.

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
1. Semantic Overgeneralization: Confusing "transparency" with "honesty" or "efficiency," leading to vague answers like "End corruption" or "Work hard."
2. Keyword Association Bug: Seeing "governance" and retrieving any rote-learned fact about government (e.g., "Government makes laws") regardless of the prompt’s specific constraint.
3. The "Moralizing" Bug: Providing a moral imperative for individuals rather than a structural improvement for the system (e.g., "Ministers should be good people").
4. Translation Bottleneck: Knowing the concept in Hindi but failing to bridge the lexical gap to "transparency" in an English-medium assessment.

Step 3: Population Considerations
The Grade 7 learner in this context is transitioning from concrete to abstract social concepts. The open-ended nature (recall) is significantly harder than multiple-choice (recognition). Given the language barrier and the high abstraction of the term "transparency," the difficulty is decoupled from the simplicity of the 1-point rubric.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric is lenient (accepting any one way), the combined "bugs" of linguistic translation and the abstract nature of the concept "transparency" (compared to more concrete terms like "election" or "tax") will lead to a high rate of non-response or irrelevant "moral" answers.
