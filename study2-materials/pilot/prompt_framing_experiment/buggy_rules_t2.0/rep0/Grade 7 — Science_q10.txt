Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Reading and comprehension: Decipher the English sentence structure, specifically identifying the objects ("Wasp/bee string" [sic]) and reagents ("vinegar/baking soda").
2. Mapping "string" to "sting": Compensating for the orthographic error in the test paper (common in some localized materials) to recognize this is a question about insect venom.
3. Fact retrieval: Recalling the chemical nature of the substances (Bee sting = acidic; Wasp sting = alkaline; Vinegar = acid; Baking soda = base).
4. Principle Identification: Applying the rule that an acid + base → Neutralization.
5. Synthesis/Explanation: Articulating the "Neutralization" principle in English or the target language, explaining that opposites cancel each other's effects.

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
1. Phonetic Overgeneralization (The "String" Bug): Students may interpret "string" literally (as thread/rope) and fail to activate their chemical knowledge of "stings" because the words are cognitively separated in a second language.
2. Label Inversion: Recalling that one is an acid and one is a base, but swapping the identities (associating bee stings with alkaline) leading to a conclusion of "it depends" or naming the wrong reaction type.
3. The "Cleaning" Heuristic: In daily life, vinegar and soda are seen as cleaning agents. A student may apply the "Cleaning Rule" (they wash away the pain/poison) rather than a "Reaction Rule."
4. Naming Difficulty: Having the conceptual understanding of "canceling out" but lacking the technical term "Neutralization" due to English language barriers.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Grade 7: Transitioning from observational science to abstract nomenclature.
2. English Proficiency: The prompt contains a critical typo ("string" for "sting"). For students with limited English, "string" is a high-frequency word, while "sting" is context-specific. This mismatch increases the cognitive load significantly.
3. EWS/Medium Background: Potential lack of "everyday laboratory" experiences; relying heavily on rote memorization of the textbook chapter on "Acids, Bases, and Salts."

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While the concept of neutralization is a central pillar of the Grade 7 curriculum, the combination of a spelling error in the prompt, the requirement for active recall (explanation) rather than recognition (MCQ), and the need to cross-reference multiple biological/chemical facts makes this high-risk. Weaker students will likely focus on "strings," while mid-range students will remember the vinegar/soda association but struggle to retrieve the formal term "Neutralization."
