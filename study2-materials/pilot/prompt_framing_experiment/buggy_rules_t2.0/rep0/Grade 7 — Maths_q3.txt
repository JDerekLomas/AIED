Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall the specific formula for the area of a triangle ($A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$).
2. Identify the numerical values for "base" and "height" from the text.
3. Substitute the values into the formula: $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 6$.
4. Execute the multiplication ($8 \times 6 = 48$).
5. Execute the division by 2 or scalar multiplication ($48 / 2$ or $4 \times 6$).
6. Provide the final numerical value (unit notation is secondary per this rubric).

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- The Rectangle Bug: Students ignore the "$\frac{1}{2}$" and simply multiply base $\times$ height ($8 \times 6 = 48$), treating the triangle like a rectangle or parallelogram.
- Addition Bug: Adding the dimensions instead of multiplying ($8 + 6 = 14$).
- Misalignment Bug: Confusing the formula with a perimeter calculation or the area of a circle.
- Halving Twice Bug: Halving the base, halving the height, then multiplying ($\frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 3$).

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Open-ended recall (No multiple choice options to provide a "safety net").
- Language: In Hindi-medium backgrounds, technical terms "Base" and "Height" (Aadhar and Unchai) are familiar, but in an English-scripted question, comprehension delays may occur.
- Cognitive load: At Grade 7 in this demographic, mastery of the fraction $\frac{1}{2}$ in formulas is often brittle compared to simple multiplication.

Step 4: Estimation
While the calculation is numerically simple, the "Rectangle Bug" is one of the most persistent systematic errors in elementary geometry, particularly for students in high-stress/low-resource environments who may rely on rote memorization of "Area = length $\times$ breadth."
