Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Observation: Correctly interpret the textual cues ("green patches," "darker patches") as biological change rather than dirt or physical stains.
2. Causal Linkage: Relate the visual stimuli (bread patches) to the stored biological concept of decomposition or microbial activity.
3. Categorization: Access the specific biological category (Fungi/Mould) from long-term memory.
4. Language Encoding: Formulate the term in English (as required by the medium) or identify the correct transliteration/scientific term despite limited English proficiency.

Step 2: "Buggy rules" and systematic errors
1. The "Daily Life Label" bug: Using colloquial or imprecise terms like "dirt," "dirty water," or "old age" instead of scientific classification.
2. The "Biotic/Abiotic" confusion: Attributing the change to non-living causes like "humidity" or "moisture" (identifying the *condition* rather than the *cause*).
3. The "Medium Gap" bug: Students may know the Hindi word 'faphund' (fungi) but cannot retrieve or correctly spell 'mould' or 'fungus' in English, leading to omission or incorrect vocabulary.
4. Over-generalization: Labeling all spoilage simply as "bacteria," failing to distinguish between fungal and bacterial growth.

Step 3: Population-specific considerations
The open-ended format is a significant barrier for Grade 8 students with limited English proficiency. Unlike a multiple-choice question where they might recognize "fungi," recall requires higher cognitive load. In economically weaker sections (EWS) contexts in India, "spoiled" is a common concept, but "microorganisms" as a scientific category is often siloed in rote memorization. The progression from Day 3 to Day 5 implies growth, which is a subtle cue that may be missed by students accustomed to static facts.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While the concept is foundational, the combination of English language retrieval, the "condition vs. cause" cognitive trap (mentioning moisture/air), and the lack of multiple-choice scaffolding in an open-ended format suggests a high failure rate in precise scientific identification.
