Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Recall the historical source of the symbol (Sarnath/Ashoka).
2. Categorical Association: Link the image to its official nomenclature ("National Emblem").
3. Linguistic Translation: Translate internal conceptual knowledge from L1 (Hindi - *Ashok Stambh* / *Rashtriya Chinh*) to English.
4. Explanatory Logic: Synthesize the relationship (They are on currency because they are the emblem/symbol of the state).

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "Literal Visual Mapping": Identifying the animal (lions) as the reason for the depiction (e.g., "Because lions are strong/brave") rather than identifying the symbol.
2. "Historical Overshadowing": Associating all currency-related imagery with Mahatma Gandhi due to his portrait's dominance, leading to confusion or irrelevant answers.
3. "Vague Signification": Substituting a specific official term with a generic one (e.g., "It is a logo" or "It is a government sign") which may fail a rigid 1-mark rubric.
4. "Transliteration Failure": Correctly identifying the "Ashok Stambh" but being unable to produce the English terminology "Lion Capital" or "National Emblem" in a Social Science context.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 6 is a transitional year where students move from local context to national history. In the Indian government school context, there is a heavy "recall gap" for open-ended questions. Students often recognize the emblem visually but lack the English vocabulary to satisfy a formal rubric. The 1-mark "all-or-nothing" nature of the rubric makes it susceptible to failure if the student omits either the historical origin (Ashoka) or the official status (Emblem).

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is taught in earlier grades, the English medium requirement combined with the specific 2-part demand of the rubric (Ashoka + Emblem) creates a high "failure-to-hit-all-points" rate among low-income students with limited English exposure.
