Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Recall: Access long-term memory to retrieve the definitions of the prefixes "auto-" (self) and "hetero-" (other).
2. Distinction Construction: Formulate a comparative statement identifying the primary difference (production of food vs. consumption of others).
3. Exemplification: Retrieve specific biological instances (e.g., green plants, humans/lions) that map correctly to each category.
4. Linguistic Translation: Convert concepts into English syntax (if testing in English), ensuring subject-verb-object clarity.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
- Functional Generalization: "Autotrophs are plants; Heterotrophs are animals" (Substitutes examples for definitions, failing the "differentiate" command).
- The "Self-Feeding" Bug: Interpreting "make their own food" as the act of cooking or physical preparation rather than chemical synthesis.
- Categorical Mismatch: Reversing the two terms due to phonetic similarity or retrieval interference.
- Definition-Example Asymmetry: Correctly defining the terms but providing examples that don't match (e.g., calling a human an autotroph because they "cook for themselves").

Step 3: Target population considerations
- Language Barrier: ESL students often struggle with "Differentiate" as a prompt, often providing a single definition instead of a contrast.
- Cognitive Load: The question requires four discrete pieces of information (two definitions, two examples) for only one mark, increasing the "hazard rate" for the total score.
- Cultural Nuance: In lower-income settings, "making food" is a household chore, which strengthens the "cooking bug" mentioned above.

Step 4: Holistic analysis
While the core concept is fundamental, the requirement for a multi-part, open-ended written response in a non-native language creates high attrition. The "all-or-nothing" nature of a 1-point rubric significantly lowers the success rate because any single "bug" (e.g., a mismatched example) results in zero credit despite partial understanding.
