Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Linguistic Decoding: Translating the English prompt ("key features") into a known concept, likely involving a mental translation to the Hindi equivalent "मुख्य विशेषताएं" (mukhya vishesh-taayein).
2. Domain-Specific Retrieval: Accessing the specific long-term memory schema for the "Indian Constitution" (Bhartiya Samvidhan) chapter.
3. Feature Selection: Identifying a single valid attribute from the list of abstract academic terms.
4. Transcoding/Production: Translating the internal Hindi concept back into a formal English written term or phonetically approximating it (e.g., writing "Fundamantel").

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. Semantic Over-extension: Students associate "Constitution" generally with "History" or "Law" and provide a person's name (e.g., "Dr. B.R. Ambedkar") rather than a structural feature.
2. Nominal-Functional Swap: Substituting a duty or law for a constitutional feature (e.g., "follow traffic rules" instead of "Fundamental Rights").
3. Language Attrition Bug: Knowing the concept in Hindi but being unable to recall the specific English term required for the English-medium assessment environment.
4. Moral Response Bias: Answering why the constitution is good (e.g., "it is for equality") rather than naming a technical feature (e.g., "Secularism").

Step 3: Population Considerations
The Grade 8 population in EWS contexts often struggles with the high linguistic density of Civics/Political Science. The shift from recognition (Multiple Choice) to recall (Open-ended) significantly increases the cognitive load. However, because the rubric is extremely generous (accepting "any one" feature), it lowers the barrier significantly, allowing for high-frequency terms like "Rights" to suffice.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the language barrier is significant, the simplicity of the rubric (1 out of many possible answers) and the status of "Fundamental Rights" as a highly-drilled "anchor" concept in Indian curricula provides a strong safety net for many students.
