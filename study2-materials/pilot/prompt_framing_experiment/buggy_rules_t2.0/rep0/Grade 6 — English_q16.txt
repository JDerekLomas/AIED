Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Decoding and Comprehension**: Understand the English prompt "Write a short paragraph" and "My favorite season" despite limited English proficiency.
2.  **Concept Retrieval**: Identify a personal preference for a specific season (Winter, Summer, Monsoon, Spring).
3.  **Linguistic Mapping**: Recall the specific English vocabulary word (label) for that season.
4.  **Orthographic Execution**: Correctly spell or identify the name of the season within a written context to satisfy the specific rubric requirement.

Step 2: Buggy rules and systematic errors
1.  **Phonetic Spelling Bug**: Spelling "Winter" as "Wintar," "Summer" as "Samar," or "Monsoon" as "Mansun" based on Hindi phonetic mapping.
2.  **Code-Switching/Hinglish Bug**: Identifying the season using the Hindi term (e.g., "Sardi," "Garmi," or "Barish") instead of the English label.
3.  **Schema Misalignment**: Writing about a holiday (e.g., Diwali) or a month (e.g., January) instead of a season, confused by the concept of "times of year."
4.  **Syntax Overload**: Becoming so overwhelmed by the requirement to write 6-8 lines (Step 2 of the prompt) that the student fails to clearly "name" the season in English, focusing instead on fragmented activities (e.g., "I play in rain").

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds often possess "functional" English rather than "academic" English. While "Summer" and "Winter" are common, the open-ended nature of "Write a paragraph" is a high cognitive load compared to a multiple-choice "Name the season" question. The rubric is generous (awarding the mark if the season is named), but the student must overcome the barrier of writing a paragraph to get to that naming stage.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric only requires naming the season (a relatively low bar), the prompt's instruction to write 6-8 lines acts as a "barrier task." Many students in this demographic may leave the item blank due to the perceived difficulty of the paragraph, or fail to produce the specific English vocabulary word for the season despite understanding the prompt.
