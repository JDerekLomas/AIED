Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall and translate the abstract concept of "rights" from Hindi (अधिकार) to English or conceptual equivalence.
2. Retrieve at least two specific rights from memory (e.g., Right to Education, Right against Exploitation).
3. Evaluate if the selected rights are specific to "children" as per the prompt’s constraint.
4. Select one of the two rights and identify a distinct reason for its "importance" (linking right to impact/well-being).
5. Synthesize these three distinct elements (Right A, Right B, Explanation of A or B) into a coherent English sentence.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules"
1. **Quantity Substitution**: Providing only one right instead of two (focusing on the singular "explain" later in the prompt).
2. **Concept/Context Slip**: Listing general human rights (Right to Speech) rather than child-specific rights (Education/Protection).
3. **Identity-Action Swap**: Stating a "duty" (e.g., "children should study") instead of a "right" (e.g., "Right to Education").
4. **Circular Importance**: Explaining importance using the right's name (e.g., "Education is important because children need to be educated") rather than its functional value.
5. **Prompt-Processing Halt**: Listing the rights but stopping before the explanation due to the cognitive load of retrieving the second item.

Step 3: Student population factors
Grade 6 students in this demographic often face "Double Burden" — processing content-specific social science terminology while simultaneously navigating English syntax. Open-ended recall is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice recognition for students with limited vocabulary. The 1-point rubric is punishing, as a "bug" in any one of the three required components results in a score of 0.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the tripartite demand (Name 1 + Name 2 + Explain 1) and the high probability of linguistic "freezing" or "Duty/Right" conceptual confusion at this developmental and socioeconomic stage:
