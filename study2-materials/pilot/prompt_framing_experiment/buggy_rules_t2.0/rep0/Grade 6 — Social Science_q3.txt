Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Visual Decoding**: Correct recognition of specific iconographic details in the provided picture (likely idols of Ishar and Gangaur) and distinguishing them from general religious imagery.
2. **Contextual Retrieval**: Accessing the specific term "Gangaur" from long-term memory without the aid of a word bank or multiple-choice options.
3. **Linguistic Encoding**: Translating the internal Hindi/Marwari identification ("गंगौर") into written script (Roman or Devanagari).
4. **Sentence Construction (Descriptive)**: Synthesizing observed details and cultural knowledge to describe the rituals (e.g., processions, puja, traditional attire).
5. **Comprehension of Rubric Paradox**: Recognizing that even though the question asks to "describe," the rubric only credits the name identification, requiring the student to execute the second half of the prompt for no actual point gain.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. **Categorical Generalization (Over-extension)**: Identifying any Rajasthani festival as "Teej" due to visual similarities in idol worship and women-centric rituals.
2. **Surface Feature Substitution**: Describing the picture's colors or general "festivity" (The "Descriptive Bug") rather than naming the specific noun required.
3. **Phonetic Spelling Bug**: Spelling "Gangaur" in Roman script incorrectly in a way that might not be recognized by an evaluator (e.g., "Gungor", "Gaganor").
4. **Requirement Neglect**: Focusing entirely on the description (the second half of the prompt) while failing to explicitly state the proper noun.
5. **Visual Misidentification**: Confusing regional deities with national deities (e.g., naming it "Shiv-Parvati puja" instead of the culturally specific "Gangaur").

Step 3: Student population considerations
The Grade 6 level represents a transition to formal academic terminology. For Hindi-medium students, the shift to "Social Science" in a formal testing context often leads to "Schema-Switching" errors, where they know the cultural practice intimately but fail to use the specific academic "key term" required by the rubric. The open-ended nature of the recall (Recall vs. Recognition) significantly increases the cognitive load compared to a multiple-choice item.

Step 4: Holistic analysis
Despite the festival's popularity, the combination of an open-ended recall format, the potential for confusing Gangaur with Teej, and the linguistic hurdle of a description-heavy prompt for a low-stakes 0.5-point item suggests a high error rate. While the cultural proximity is high, the "bug" of general naming (calling it "Puja" or "Festival") often prevents the precise identification required by the rubric.
