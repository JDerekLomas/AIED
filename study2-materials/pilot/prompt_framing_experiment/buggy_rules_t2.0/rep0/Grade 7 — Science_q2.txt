Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Read and decode the English text describing the scenario (steel spoon, hot tea, heat transfer).
2.  Recall the three modes of heat transfer (Conduction, Convection, Radiation) from memory (long-term retrieval).
3.  Identify the medium/material (solid metal) and the specific physical condition (direct contact within the same object).
4.  Map the mechanism (solids/metals) to the correct terminology: "Conduction."
5.  Retrieve the technical explanation for (b): molecular vibration/collisions and the transfer of kinetic energy without the bulk movement of the medium.
6.  Formulate the explanation in English, ensuring it distinguishes conduction from convection (where particles move).

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1.  "Medium Mapping Error": Associating liquids (tea) with convection, thus naming the process "Convection" because the spoon is *in* a liquid.
2.  "Everyday Vocabulary Substitution": Using descriptive terms like "flowing," "heating up," or "soaking" instead of the scientific term "Conduction."
3.  "Convection Bug in Solids": Believing heat travels because the "hot particles move to the cold end" (mapping the behavior of fluids to solids).
4.  "Label Swap": Confusion between "Conduction" and "Convection" due to phonetic similarity and simultaneous learning.
5.  "English Proficiency Barrier": Understanding the phenomenon but failing to retrieve the specific English label or being unable to articulate the "how" in part (b) due to syntax/vocabulary limits.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1.  Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice recognition for this demographic.
2.  Hindi-medium backgrounds often lead to "Hinglish" explanations or correct conceptual understanding but incorrect English terminology.
3.  The rubric awards points for (a) but requires an explanation for (b); failure to articulate (b) often results in zero or partial marks in practice, though the prompt specifically asks for the "fully correct answer."
4.  Steel vs. Wood (conductors vs. insulators) is a common distraction, but the "how" requires a leap from macro-observation to micro-particulate theory which is a major hurdle for Grade 7.
