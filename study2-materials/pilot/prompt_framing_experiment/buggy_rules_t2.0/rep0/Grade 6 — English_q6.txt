Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Scan/Recall the text to identify a specific line (Memory retrieval or visual search).
2. Synthesize a personal preference (Metacognition/Judgment).
3. Transcribe the chosen line accurately (Copying/Orthographic transfer).
4. Translate an abstract reason ("why") from L1 (Hindi) to L2 (English).
5. Structure a coherent "Because..." sentence (Syntactic construction).

Step 2: Common "Buggy Rules" and systematic errors
- The "Line-as-Sentence" Bug: Students often mistake a "line" for a "sentence" or a "paragraph," resulting in selecting the wrong unit of text.
- The "Identity Selection" Bug: Selecting the first or last line of the poem by default regardless of preference to minimize search effort.
- The "I Like It" Tautology: Answering "Why?" with "Because I like it" or "Because it is good" (Circular reasoning bug).
- The "Grammar-Meaning Swap": Substituting an English word with a phonetically similar Hindi word or using Hindi syntax (SOV) in an English sentence (SVO), leading to unintelligible justifications.
- The "Linguistic Freeze": Ability to identify the line but an inability to initiate the English-medium explanation, leading to a half-finished answer.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Open-ended recall is significantly harder than recognition (MCQs) for ESL students.
- "Why" questions demand high-order Bloom’s levels (Evaluation), which is cognitively taxing when combined with limited vocabulary.
- In EWS/Hindi-medium contexts, students may understand the poem's theme but lack the "functional grammar" to bridge the gap between their thought and the rubric's requirements.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
While the "Maximum Score" of 1.5 implies a low-stakes or "easy" question, the jump from literal identification to evaluative justification is steep. Most students will successfully identify a line but fail to provide a "why" that meets the rubric’s threshold of a clear reason in English.
