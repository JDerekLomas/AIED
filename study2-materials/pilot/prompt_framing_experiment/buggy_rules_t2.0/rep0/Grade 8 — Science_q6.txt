Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Visual Encoding: Identify the icons in the picture as "trees" and the activity as "cutting" or "chopping."
2. Lexical Retrieval: Recall the specific scientific term "deforestation" or a descriptive English phrase.
3. Language Synthesis: Formulate a sentence in English that describes the scene as per the rubric's requirement for "sufficient description."
4. Causal Reasoning (Question B): Identify the long-term ecological consequences (soil erosion, global warming, habitat loss).
5. Linguistic Mapping: Translate complex causal concepts from Hindi (e.g., *van-unmulan*, *bhumi aksharan*) into English syntax.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- Semantic Narrowing: Interpreting "what is shown" as a literal list (e.g., "tree and axe") rather than a process or condition (Deforestation).
- Trans-linguistic Interference (Hinglish): Substituting Hindi nouns when English vocabulary fails (e.g., "Ped katna show ho raha hai").
- Contextual Misinterpretation: Answering "Nature" or "Forest" due to a lack of specificity (Recognition vs. Analysis).
- Temporal Misalignment: Answering question (a) by describing the consequence in question (b) prematurely.
- Null Response on Part B: Students often recognize the image (Step 1) but lack the expressive English proficiency to explain "sustained consequences" (Step 5), leading to a 0-score if the rubric requires both parts for a "full" 1 point.

Step 3: Target Population Factors
- Economically weaker section students often have high "functional" knowledge but low "academic" English fluency.
- Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice recognition for ESL learners.
- In Grade 8, "sustained for a long time" is a complex linguistic structure that may act as a barrier to understanding the prompt itself.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the visual is intuitive, the requirement to explain "consequences" in a second language, combined with the transition from recognition to production, creates a high friction point for these students.
