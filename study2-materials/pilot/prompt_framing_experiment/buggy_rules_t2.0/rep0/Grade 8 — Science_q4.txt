Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Correctly identifying "Goldsmith" and "Zone of Flame" as keywords from the chapter on Combustion and Flame.
2. Conceptual Recall (Fact): Identifying the outermost zone as the part of the flame used by a goldsmith.
3. Conceptual Recall (Causal Reasoning): Linking the "outermost zone" to the properties of being the hottest part and undergoing complete combustion.
4. Linguistic Mapping (L1 to L2): Translating the concept from the internal Hindi model (*sunar*, *sabse bahari bhag*) to the required English terminology (*outermost/non-luminous*).
5. Synthesizing the "Reason": Constructing a logical sentence connecting the zone to its heat profile.

Step 2: Identified Buggy Rules
- Semantic Overgeneralization: Confusing "brightest" (luminous/yellow) with "hottest," leading students to select the middle zone because it is the most visible part of a candle flame.
- Vocabulary Retrieval Error: Swapping "Luminous" and "Non-luminous" due to the counter-intuitive nature of the invisible part being the most useful.
- Translation Bug: Translating "outer" or "blue" correctly but failing to provide the "reason" component, resulting in a zero or half-credit (the rubric implies both are needed for the 1 mark).
- Teleological Reasoning: Thinking the goldsmith uses the inner zone to "melt it slowly" or "save fuel."

Step 3: Population Considerations
- The "Open-ended" constraint: In a MCQ format, students would likely recognize "outermost," but recall requires precise vocabulary that EWS/Hindi-medium students often lack in English.
- Textbook Rote: This is a high-frequency "back-of-chapter" question. However, the requirement for a "reason" often trips up students who memorize only the name of the zone.
- Dual-demand: The question requires two distinct pieces of information (Which zone? + Why?) for a single mark, increasing the probability of a "partial-error" being scored as incorrect.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account the linguistic barrier, the common misconception that the bright/yellow part of a flame is the "strongest," and the requirement to articulate a reason in a second language:
