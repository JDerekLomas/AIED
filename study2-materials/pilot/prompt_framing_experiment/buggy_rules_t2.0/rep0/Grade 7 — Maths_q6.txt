Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Convert the first mixed fraction ($1 \frac{1}{2}$) to an improper fraction: $(1 \times 2) + 1 = 3/2$.
2. Convert the second mixed fraction ($3 \frac{1}{4}$) to an improper fraction: $(3 \times 4) + 1 = 13/4$.
3. Multiply the numerators ($3 \times 13 = 39$).
4. Multiply the denominators ($2 \times 4 = 8$).
5. Convert the resulting improper fraction ($39/8$) back into a mixed fraction ($4 \frac{7}{8}$).

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Common Errors
- Conversion Bug: Adding the whole number to the numerator without multiplying by the denominator (e.g., $1 \frac{1}{2} \rightarrow 2/2$).
- Cross-Multiplication Bug: Treating the multiplication sign as an equal sign and attempting to cross-multiply instead of multiplying across.
- "Add Whole, Add Parts" Bug: Multiplying whole numbers ($1 \times 3$) and multiplying fractions ($1/2 \times 1/4$) separately (result: $3 \frac{1}{8}$).
- Division/Remainder Bug: Error in the final step of dividing 39 by 8, or misplacing the quotient and remainder in the final mixed fraction notation.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
The student population faces a linguistic barrier (English instruction/testing) and may have missed foundational "Number Sense" concepts due to disrupted schooling or economic constraints. Grade 7 requires mastery of these 5 steps in sequence; failure in any one step leads to a zero, as the rubric requires the correct improper fractions but the question asks for the final mixed fraction, creating a high threshold for "correctness" in an open-ended format.

Step 4: Estimate
The multi-step nature of the "Algorithm for Multiplying Mixed Fractions" combined with the common systematic error of treating the whole numbers and fractions as separate entities significantly lowers the success rate in high-poverty, linguistically diverse contexts.
