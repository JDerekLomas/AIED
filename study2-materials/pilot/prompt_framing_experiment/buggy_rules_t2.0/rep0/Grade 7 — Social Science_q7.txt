Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate and comprehend complex English academic vocabulary ("Analyze," "Economic Development," "Evaluate").
2.  **Information Retrieval (Macro-Economics)**: Recall the conceptual functions of money (medium of exchange, store of value, unit of account).
3.  **Synthesis**: Connect the medium of exchange to the acceleration of trade and capital formation (economic development).
4.  **Information Retrieval (Contemporary Context)**: Identify "Digital Money" (UPI, Net-Banking) and its specific impacts (transparency, speed, financial inclusion).
5.  **Relational Reasoning**: Formulate an evaluative judgment on why digital money is significant "today."
6.  **Encoding/Writing**: Translate abstract concepts back into written English or English-medium syntax.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1.  **Literal Interpretation/Semantic Mapping**: Confusing "money" (as a facilitator of trade) with "personal wealth/savings." A student might argue money helps because "one can buy things," failing the "development" (systemic) connection.
2.  **Definition-Only Retrieval**: Providing a memorized definition of "money" while ignoring the command verb "Analyze," resulting in a non-responsive answer.
3.  **Example-Substituted-for-Analysis**: Listing types of coins or names of apps (PhonePe, GPay) without explaining their *role* in the economic system.
4.  **Temporal Displacement**: Evaluating money in a historical/barter context only, missing the "digital/today" requirement.
5.  **Language Threshold Barrier**: Knowing the answer in Hindi but lacking the English functional vocabulary to construct the "Role -> Effect" causal chain required for an "analysis."

Step 3: Population Considerations
1.  **Instructional Gap**: Economic concepts like "development" are often taught abstractly; students from economically weaker sections may lack exposure to formal banking or digital literacy discourse.
2.  **Double-Barreled Demand**: The prompt asks for both "Role of Money" AND "Digital Money," but the rubric only rewards one part. However, a student struggling with the language may find the length of the prompt cognitively overloading, leading to "omission errors."
3.  **Vocabulary Depth**: "Analyze" and "Evaluate" are high-level Bloom’s taxonomy verbs. Grade 7 students, especially ELLs, often treat these as "Write everything you know about."

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the gap between the complex cognitive-linguistic demands of the prompt (Analyze/Evaluate) and the typical proficiency levels of the described demographic, many students will fail to bridge the conceptual gap between money as a physical object and money as an engine for economic development in a second language.
