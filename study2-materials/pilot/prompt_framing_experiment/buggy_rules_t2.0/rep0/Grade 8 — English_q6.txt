Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the specific term "fable" from long-term memory, distinguishing it from related concepts like "parable," "folktale," or "myth."
2. Translate the conceptual understanding (often stored in Hindi as *pashu-pakshiyo ki kahani* or *naitik shiksha*) into English.
3. Formulate a syntactically correct sentence structure in English (Subject + Verb + Definition).
4. Include both critical semantic attributes: animal characters (non-human agency) and a moral/lesson.
5. Apply correct spelling and punctuation (essential for full credit in many government school marking schemes).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. "Genre Overgeneralization": Defining a fable simply as a "story" without identifying its specific features (lacks specificity).
2. "Visual Substitution": Identifying a fable by providing an example (e.g., "The Thirsty Crow") instead of a formal definition.
3. "Partial Feature Recall": Recalling only the "animal" aspect but forgetting the "moral" requirement, or vice versa.
4. "Translation Bottleneck": Understanding the concept but failing to recall the specific English words "typically," "imparts," or "characters," leading to fragmented/incorrect English syntax (e.g., "Story animal moral").
5. "Term Confusion": Confusing "fable" with "table" or "label" due to phonetic similarity in a second language.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic face a significant gap between "recognition" (selecting an answer) and "recall" (writing from scratch). In economically weaker section (EWS) government schools, while students are exposed to these stories, the formal requirement to produce an academic definition in English—a language of limited proficiency—poses a high cognitive load. Most students will likely possess a gist of the meaning but struggle to meet the specific requirements of the rubric in the target language.
