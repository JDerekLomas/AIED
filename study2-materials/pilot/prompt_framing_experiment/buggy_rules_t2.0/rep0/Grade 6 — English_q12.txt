Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English text and identify the core concept of the prompt ("opposite").
2. Retrieve the semantic meaning of the target word "up" and map it to its spatial or conceptual antonym in their mental lexicon.
3. Access the English label for that antonym ("down") while filtering out distractions from L1 (Hindi: *neeche*) or related concepts.
4. Correctly execute the orthography/spelling of the word "down" in an open-ended format.

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules" and systematic errors
- Translation-Transliteration Bug: The student retrieves the correct concept but writes the answer in Hindi (*neeche*) or Romanized Hindi (*niche*).
- Near-Synonym/Association Bug: The student provides a related word instead of an antonym (e.g., writing "top" or "high").
- Phonetic Spelling Bug: Writing the word as it sounds in an Indian accent, potentially resulting in "daun" or "downn."
- Mirror/Directional Confusion: Mixing up spatial pairs like left/right or top/bottom due to cognitive overload.
- Vocabulary Retrieval Failure: Identifying the concept of "not up" but lacking the specific English vocabulary "down."

Step 3: Target population considerations
- Grade 6 students in EWS/Hindi-medium contexts often possess a basic oral vocabulary but struggle with written English production (recall vs. recognition). 
- "Up" and "Down" are high-frequency words taught early; however, the shift from a multiple-choice format to an open-ended production task significantly increases the cognitive load for students with limited English literacy.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While "up/down" is a fundamental binary, the combination of English-medium testing for L2 learners and the requirement for correct spelling/production in a written format (no word bank provided) suggests that a significant subset of the population will stumble on either the vocabulary recall or the orthographic execution.
