Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Read the three-part question (a, b, and c).
2.  Synthesize the task demand for (a) by interpreting the provided data table.
3.  Scan the column for "Expansion" or a related numerical value for all materials listed.
4.  Perform a "greatest value" comparison among the numerical or qualitative data points provided in the table.
5.  Isolate "Aluminium" as the corresponding label for the maximum expansion value.
6.  Write the answer for part (a) clearly.

Step 2: Systematic procedural errors (Buggy Rules)
1.  "Table-label mismatch": Looking at the wrong column (e.g., density or melting point) instead of expansion.
2.  "The First/Last Bug": Picking the first or last item in a list/table regardless of data value.
3.  "Real-world bias": Choosing a material they "know" is strong or common (like Iron) instead of reading the provided data.
4.  "Composite Failure": Since the question has three parts (a, b, and c) but the rubric only awards a score for part (a), students may become confused by the shift in cognitive demand (from data interpretation in 'a' to conceptual recall in 'b' and 'c') and fail to complete the specific sub-task required for the single mark.
5.  "Numerical Magnitude Bug": If the table uses scientific notation or decimals (e.g., $10^{-6}$), students often misidentify the largest number, treating larger negative exponents as larger values.

Step 3: Target population considerations
- Grade 8 students in this context often struggle with English-language phrasing in science (multilingual learners).
- "Aluminium" (Hindi: ऐलुमिनियम) is a familiar term, which aids recognition.
- However, if parts (b) and (c) are required for the "1 mark" but not mentioned in the rubric, there is a "hidden hurdle." Given the prompt asks for the proportion who produce the *fully correct answer* according to the specific rubric (identifying Aluminium), the distraction of parts (b) and (c) remains a major factor.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The task for (a) is a low-level retrieval task, but in an open-ended format for EWS/Hindi-medium students, the transition from Hindi thinking to English writing, combined with the presence of three sub-questions for only 1 mark, typically results in a significant drop in completion rates. Many students may answer (b) or (c) correctly while missing (a) due to cognitive overload or vice versa.
