Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Use a straightedge to draw an initial horizontal ray (the base arm).
2. Position the protractor’s midpoint (center mark) exactly on the endpoint of the ray (the vertex).
3. Align the 0° line (baseline) of the protractor precisely along the base arm.
4. Identify the correct scale to use (inner vs. outer) based on which side the zero line is aligned with.
5. Locate the 110° mark on the chosen scale and mark a point with a pencil.
6. Remove the protractor and use a straightedge to draw a second ray from the vertex through the marked point.

Step 2: Common "buggy rules" / Systematic errors
1. **The Supplementary Angle Bug:** Students read the wrong scale (outer instead of inner or vice-versa), drawing a 70° angle instead of a 110° angle. This is the most common error with obtuse angles.
2. **The "Corner-Loading" Bug:** Aligning the bottom edge of the physical protractor with the ray rather than the printed 0° baseline.
3. **The Center-Point Offset:** Aligning the edge of the protractor, rather than the crosshair/midpoint, with the vertex.
4. **Orientation Confusion:** Difficulty mapping the concept of "110°" to a physical opening when the orientation of the base ray is non-standard or if the student is used to reading scales only from right to left.

Step 3: Student population considerations
1. **Language/Instruction Gap:** Students in Hindi-medium or low-resource settings often memorize "how" to use a tool without a conceptual understanding of "angle as an opening." This increases reliance on rote (and often buggy) procedures.
2. **Open-ended Demand:** Unlike multiple-choice questions where they might recognize an obtuse angle looks "wide," the drawing task requires precise motor coordination and three-point alignment.
3. **Obtuse vs. Acute:** Question (a) asks for 110°. In many Grade 6 classrooms in these demographics, the failure rate for obtuse angles is significantly higher than for acute angles because of the dual-scale ambiguity on standard protractors.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While 40° is a high-success item, 110° is a high-error item due to the supplementary angle trap (70°). Given the systemic challenges in alignment and scale selection in large-classroom environments:
