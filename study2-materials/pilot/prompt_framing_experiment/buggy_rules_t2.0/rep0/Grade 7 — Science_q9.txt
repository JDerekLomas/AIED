Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Read and decode the English-language prompt (L2 context).
2.  Retrieve the technical term "insectivorous" or "heterotrophic/partial heterotrophic" from long-term memory.
3.  Map the visual concept ("pitcher plant/trap") to the taxonomic label.
4.  Formulate a conceptual explanation for nitrogen deficiency in soil (Requirement for part b).
5.  Recall a secondary instance (e.g., Venus flytrap or Sundew) from the specific textbook chapter.
6.  Transcribe the response accurately in English.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules" and errors
1.  **Over-generalization bug**: Identifying the mode as "photosynthesis" because the plant is described as green (priority given to the visual cue over the functional one).
2.  **Language-Switching bug**: Understanding the concept but lacking the specific English term "Insectivorous," leading to descriptions like "eating bugs" which may not meet formal rubric criteria in a strict grading environment.
3.  **Incomplete Retrieval bug**: Forgetting the specific "Nitrogen" requirement and instead claiming the plant eats insects for "food" or "energy," ignoring the "it can perform photosynthesis" constraint.
4.  **Orthographic bugs**: Systematic misspelling of "Insectivorous" (e.g., "Insextivorous") or "Photosynthesis" to the point of being unidentifiable.

Step 3: Population-specific constraints
The Grade 7 cohort from economically weaker sections often relies on rote memorization of "back-of-chapter" questions. Because this question asks for a specific "mode of nutrition" (a technical term), students who haven't mastered the specific English vocabulary will fail part (a) even if they understand the biological process. Part (c) requires a specific secondary recall which is often a bottleneck in limited-resource learning environments where only the primary example (Pitcher Plant) is heavily emphasized.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the 3-part open-ended nature and the reliance on specific technical English vocabulary (insectivorous, nitrogen, Venus flytrap) for a student population primarily navigating an L2 (English) barrier, the "cascading error" probability is high. Even if a student knows the biology, the demand for three correct components (recall, reasoning, and secondary example) significantly reduces the likelihood of a 100% correct response.
