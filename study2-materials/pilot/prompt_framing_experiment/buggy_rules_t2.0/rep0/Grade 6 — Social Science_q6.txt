Step 1: List the specific procedural steps:
1. Lexical retrieval: Translate "archaeological" and "literary" into conceptual understandings (likely across a language barrier).
2. Concept differentiation: Distinguish between physical artifacts (non-textual/physicality) and written documents.
3. Defining (Production): Articulate the definition of archaeological sources as physical remains or material evidence.
4. Recall (Specific examples): Retrieve a concrete example of an archaeological source (e.g., coins, monuments).
5. Recall (Specific examples): Retrieve a concrete example of a literary source (e.g., manuscripts, books).
6. Synthesis: Structure the comparison in a way that meets the binary criteria of the 1-mark rubric.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules":
1. Over-extension of "Books": Classifying anything with writing on it (including inscriptions or coins) as a literary source.
2. The "History is Stories" bug: Defining all sources simply as "old things" or "stories told by grandparents" without categorical distinction.
3. Vocabulary mapping error: Confusion between "archaeological" and "architecture" or "archives," leading to overly narrow or mismatched examples.
4. Language production collapse: Knowing the difference mentally but being unable to formulate the formal English definition required by the rubric.
5. All-or-nothing omission: Providing examples without the required definitions, or vice versa, failing the conjunctive rubric requirement.

Step 3: Student population considerations:
1. ESL/Low Literacy: Technical terms like "archaeological" are phonetically and orthographically difficult for Grade 6 Hindi-medium transitioning students.
2. Recall vs. Recognition: The open-ended format is significantly harder than a multiple-choice "Which of these is an archaeological source?" item.
3. Resource scarcity: In EWS contexts, exposure to museums (archaeology) or a variety of library materials (literary) is often lower, making these abstract classroom concepts.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
The complexity of the word "archaeological," the demand for both a definition AND examples for 1 single mark, and the linguistic hurdle for Hindi-medium EWS students create a high probability of "half-right" answers that receive zero marks under a strict rubric.
