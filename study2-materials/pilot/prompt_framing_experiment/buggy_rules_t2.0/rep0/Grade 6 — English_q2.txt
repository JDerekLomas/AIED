Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Decode the English text:** Read the question and identify the interrogative "Who" and the subject/verb relationship ("lived inside").
2. **Retrieve semantic information:** Access memory of the specific passage provided in the textbook (likely the poem "Books" or a similar story) to identify the agent.
3. **Map the concept to the target language:** Match the mental image of the character to the English word "fairy."
4. **Syntactic encoding:** Construct a grammatically coherent phrase or sentence ("A fairy" or "A fairy lived...") to match the rubric.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **The "Who is Name" Bug:** Systematic confusion where "Who" prompts the student to provide a human name or the student’s own name, rather than a fictional creature.
2. **L1 Semantic Mapping Error:** Translating the concept "pari" (Hindi for fairy) but being unable to retrieve the English orthographic/phonological form "fairy," leading to a blank or a Hindi response.
3. **Keyword-to-Locative Bug:** Focusing only on the word "book" and answering with "pages," "words," or "stories" because the student interprets the question as "What is inside the book?" (Attribute substitution).
4. **Surface Syntax Copying:** Copying a random sentence from the source text that contains the word "book" regardless of whether it answers the "Who" component.

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 6 students from EWS backgrounds in Indian government schools often struggle with "open-ended recall" vs. "recognition." In Hindi-medium transitions, English is often treated as a decoding exercise rather than a comprehension exercise. Because the answer requires retrieving the specific noun "fairy" (not common in daily EWS Hindi-English code-switching) without a word bank, the "retrieval gap" is high.

Step 4: Estimate
Considering the cumulative probability of linguistic decoding errors, semantic retrieval failure for the word "fairy," and the systematic "Keyword Bug" (answering "stories" instead of "fairy"):
