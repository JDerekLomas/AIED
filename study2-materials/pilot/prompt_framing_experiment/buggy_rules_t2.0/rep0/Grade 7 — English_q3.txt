Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the syntax of the question, which contains a "buggy" construction itself (subject-verb inversion error: "Why the king felt" instead of "Why did the king feel").
2. Retrieve the specific narrative premise from the NCERT Class 7 text *Three Questions* (Leo Tolstoy).
3. Identify the causal link between "perfect knowledge" and "guaranteed success" as established in the text.
4. Synthesize the three specific questions (Right time, Right people, Right action) as the basis for the answer.
5. Encode the answer in English, maintaining grammatical coherence despite the 2-3 sentence length requirement.
6. Translate internal conceptual understanding (likely in Hindi/L1) into English vocabulary.

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules"
1. **The Copy-Paste Bug**: Selecting a random sentence from the passage that contains keywords like "king" or "fail" without addressing the "Why."
2. **The L1-Interface Bug**: Formulating the correct logical thought in Hindi but failing to translate it, leading to "He know answers so he success" or leaving it blank.
3. **The Sentence-Constraint Bug**: Failing to reach the 2-3 sentence requirement (and thus the rubric's "Explain" demand) by providing a one-word or two-word answer.
4. **The "Tense Drift" Bug**: Switching between past and present tense inconsistently, often influenced by the error in the question stem itself.
5. **The Question-as-Statement Bug**: Starting the answer with "Because the king felt..." but never completing the clause with a predicate.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
The item is open-ended, requiring active recall and construction rather than recognition (MCQ). For students from economically weaker sections in government schools, English is often a tertiary environment. The leap from understanding the story (often taught via L1 translation) to explaining causal logic in English is the "zone of proximal development" where most students struggle. The rubric asks for a 1-mark response but demands a 2-3 sentence "explanation," which is a high cognitive load for the reward.
