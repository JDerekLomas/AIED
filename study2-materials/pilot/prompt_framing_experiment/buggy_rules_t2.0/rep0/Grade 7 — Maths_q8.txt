To analyze this item through the lens of systematic errors (Brown & Burton, 1978) and the specific socioeconomic context of Indian government school students, we break it down as follows:

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1.  **Semantic Analysis/Parsing:** Identifying that the relationship is proportional (Direct Variation).
2.  **Unit Rate Calculation:** Dividing 55 by 5 to find the distance per liter (11 km/L).
3.  **Application:** Multiplying the unit rate (11) by the new quantity (12).
4.  **Second Query Processing:** Recognizing that "mileage" is a separate question asking for the result already found in Step 2.
5.  **Computation:** Multi-digit multiplication (12 × 11) and division (55 ÷ 5).

**Step 2: Buggy Rules and Cognitive Distractors**
*   **The "Double Question" Trap:** The rubric only awards 1 point for the final distance (132 km), but the prompt asks two questions. Students often provide only the first part or get confused by the term "mileage," which is frequently used colloquially in India but rarely defined formally in primary textbooks compared to "average."
*   **The Linear Translation Bug:** Students may interpret the difference (12 - 5 = 7) and add it to the distance (55 + 7 = 62) rather than using multiplicative reasoning.
*   **Unit Confusion:** Because "mileage" is asked after the total distance, a student may attempt to divide 132 by 12, or worse, divide 132 by 55.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the transition to English terms like "average" and "mileage" creates a "keyword-heavy" cognitive load. If they don't recognize the word "mileage," they may stall despite knowing the math.

**Step 3: Student Population and Format Analysis**
In Grade 7 (Atypical/Low SES contexts), multiplicative reasoning is often fragile. While students may have rote-memorized the "unitary method," the open-ended format removes scaffolding. In government school assessments (like NAS or ASER data), multi-step word problems involving division and multi-digit multiplication typically show high error rates. The 1-mark limit means any single buggy execution in the chain results in a zero.

**Step 4: Holistic Assessment**
While the arithmetic is "easy" (multiples of 11), the cognitive overhead of the second question ("Find how much mileage...") acts as a distractor. Weak linguistic grounding in English terminology combined with systematic errors in the unitary method suggests a low success rate.
