Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall the conceptual meaning of LCM or a specific algorithm (Common Division or Prime Factorization).
2. For Common Division: Correctly set up the division ladder with all three numbers (12, 15, 20).
3. Identify the smallest prime factor (2) and divide correctly, maintaining numbers not divisible (bringing 15 down).
4. Iterate division until all quotients are 1, ensuring only primes are used or handled correctly.
5. Multiply all external factors correctly ($2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5$).
6. Reach the final product (60).

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- "Division ignoring": Dividing 12 and 20 by 2 but leaving 15 out or accidentally dividing 15 by 2 and getting a remainder/decimal.
- "The Stop Rule Bug": Stopping division as soon as one number reaches 1, or stopping when no single prime divides all three numbers (confusing LCM procedure with HCF).
- "Prime confusion": Using composite numbers as divisors (e.g., dividing by 4 or 6) and missing factors.
- "Addition bug": Adding the prime factors instead of multiplying them.
- "Multiplication error": Execution errors in basic facts (e.g., $12 \times 5 = 50$).

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 6 is the introductory year for formal LCM algorithms in the NCERT/State curriculum.
- Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle if the term "Least Common Multiple" is not bridged with "लघुत्तम समापवर्त्य (ल.स.)".
- Economically weaker sections (EWS) often correlate with higher "math anxiety" and gaps in basic multiplication table fluency, which are "primitive" dependencies for this task.
- The open-ended format prevents guessing, which is possible in MCQs.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While the method is standard, the requirement for multi-step precision (multiple divisions followed by multi-digit multiplication) without the "safety net" of recognition makes it high-risk for the target demographic. Many students will confuse the LCM process with the HCF process or make a single arithmetic slip in the ladder.
