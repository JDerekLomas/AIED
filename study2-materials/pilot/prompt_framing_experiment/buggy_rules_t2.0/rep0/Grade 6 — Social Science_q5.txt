Step 1: List the specific procedural steps:
1. Decoding the English text: Understand the semantics of "main occupation," "Vedic period," and "key aspect."
2. Historical Retrieval (Causal/Temporal): Accessing long-term memory to distinguish between Early Vedic (Pastoral) and Later Vedic (Agricultural) periods, as both are technically "Vedic."
3. Filtering/Prioritizing: Selecting one dominant occupation based on the rubric's binary acceptance.
4. Descriptive Recall: Retrieving a secondary piece of specific attribute information (e.g., "cattle were wealth" or "use of iron").
5. Syntactic Construction: Transliterating or translating thought from Hindi to written English sentence structure.

Step 2: Identify systematic "buggy rules":
1. The "Chronological Collapse" Bug: Conflating Indus Valley (trade/urban) or Mauryan traits with the Vedic period.
2. The "Modernist Projection" Bug: Assuming "Jobs/Service" or modern "Trading" based on present-day observations of work.
3. The "Rubric Redundancy" Bug: Correcting identifying the occupation but failing to provide the "key aspect" because the student perceives the identification as the complete answer.
4. The "Lexical Mapping" Bug: Knowing the concept in Hindi (पशुपालन) but being unable to retrieve the specific English Tier-3 vocabulary (Pastoralism/Husbandry).

Step 3: Student Population context:
For Grade 6 students in EWS/Hindi-medium contexts, English is often a barrier to expressing "how" or "why" (the second half of the prompt). While the rubric is lenient (accepting both agriculture and pastoralism), the requirement to "describe one key aspect" in a second language significantly increases the failure rate compared to a multiple-choice format.

Step 4: Estimated Proportion:
