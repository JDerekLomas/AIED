Step 1: Specific Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English text to identify the central concept (King's questions from the "Three Questions" story).
2. Retrieve the three specific questions from long-term memory (timing, people, actions) as they are not provided in the prompt.
3. Map the historical/allegorical context of the story onto "real life" (modern personal relevance).
4. Evaluate "importance" based on the rubric's criteria (knowing the right time, people, or task).
5. Generate a reason in English using correct syntax.
6. Translate the abstract thought into a written sentence (Sentence construction).

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. Literal Mapping Bug: Interpreting "king's questions" as literal questions about kingship rather than universal principles.
2. Binary Error: Responding with "Yes" or "No" and neglecting the "Give one reason" instruction (treating a two-part prompt as one).
3. Substitution Bug: Providing a summary of the story's ending (the hermit's answer) instead of answering whether the student *thinks* they are important in real life today.
4. L1 Interference (Hinglish Syntax): Structuring the reason using Hindi grammar rules, which may lead to an unintelligible English sentence.
5. The "Passage Dependence" Bug: Searching the provided text (if any) or memory for a "correct" answer instead of formulating an original evaluative reason as required by "Do you think..."

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Grade 7 students are at a stage where abstract reasoning (linking a fable to real-life utility) is developing but often requires scaffolding.
2. English as a Second Language (ESL) proficiency is a significant barrier; even if the student understands the logic in Hindi, they may fail to produce a "valid reason" in written English.
3. Economically weaker sections (EWS) often have less exposure to the specific academic vocabulary ("important," "real life," "reason") required for this level of critical thinking in English.
4. Recall vs. Recognition: The lack of options makes this much harder than a multiple-choice question.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While many students will remember the story (as it is a standard text), the combination of abstract evaluation, required original reasoning, and the demand to produce a coherent English sentence makes this a high-difficulty item for this specific population.
