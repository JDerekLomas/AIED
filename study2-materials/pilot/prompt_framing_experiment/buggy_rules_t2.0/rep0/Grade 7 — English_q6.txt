Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Decoding and Comprehension**: Understand the prompt "Describe the poet's writing style" (high lexical load for "poet," "style," and "describes").
2.  **Meta-Cognitive Abstraction**: Shift from *what* the poem says (content) to *how* it is written (technique).
3.  **Linguistic Mapping**: Retrieve a specific English adjective from a limited mental lexicon that serves as a literary descriptor.
4.  **Syntax Construction**: Map the retrieved word into a coherent English phrase or single-word response.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1.  **The "Topic for Tone" Bug**: Students provide a summary of the subject matter instead of the style (e.g., "The poem is about a tree").
2.  **The "Sentiment for Style" Bug**: Students describe their own emotional reaction to the poem (e.g., "The poem is very nice/good").
3.  **The "Vocabulary Substitution" Bug**: Identifying the correct concept in Hindi but being unable to translate it to the specific English terms required by the rubric (e.g., "Aasan" but not "Simple").
4.  **The "Keyword Trigger" Bug**: Seeing "Poet" and writing the name of the poet or the word "poem" rather than a stylistic attribute.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds often lack exposure to the academic vocabulary ("informal," "descriptive," "direct") needed for open-ended literary analysis. In an open-ended format, the absence of multiple-choice cues (recognition vs. recall) significantly increases the difficulty for students with limited English proficiency.

Step 4: Holistic analysis
The leap from understanding a poem to analyzing "writing style" is a high-order cognitive shift (Bloom's Analysis). Given the language barrier and the abstract nature of "style" compared to "content," the failure rate for this specific type of question is typically very high in government school settings.

0.15the rubric is flexible ("any appropriate word"), the lack of a word bank and the abstract nature of the "style" concept for ESL/EFL learners in this socio-economic context suggests a high failure rate.
