Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Subtract 2 from both sides (Inverse operations: $+2$ becomes $-2$ on the RHS).
2. Compute the result of the constant terms ($10 - 2 = 8$).
3. Divide both sides by 4 (Inverse operations: multiplication becomes division).
4. Simplify the fraction/division ($8 / 4 = 2$).

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
- "Magic Move" error: Moving $+2$ to the other side but forgetting to change the sign (leading to $4x = 12$).
- "Coefficient Attachment": Treating the $4$ in $4x$ as an additive constant (e.g., $x = 8 - 4$ or $x = 10 - 2 - 4$).
- "Partial Operation": Dividing only the constant or only one side by $4$ without isolating the variable first.
- "Integer Subtraction": Error in $10 - 2$ (though less common in Grade 7).
- "Order of Operations" (Inversion Error): Attempting to divide by 4 before subtracting 2 ($x + 2 = 10/4$).

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 7 is the transition point where arithmetic shifts to formal algebra. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited English, the term "Solve for $x$" is often taught through rote "transposition" rules. While the numbers are small and manageable (reducing computational load), the open-ended format removes the ability to "plug in" options. In many low-resource contexts, the jump from "box" notation ($4 \times \square + 2 = 10$) to variable notation ($x$) introduces a high "Notational Bug" risk.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
While the arithmetic is simple, the coordination of multiple algebraic transformations is a significant hurdle. In standard Indian government school testing (NAS data for similar age groups), algebra items often see a sharp decline in accuracy compared to pure arithmetic. Roughly half the students struggle with the symbolic logic of moving terms across an equals sign.
