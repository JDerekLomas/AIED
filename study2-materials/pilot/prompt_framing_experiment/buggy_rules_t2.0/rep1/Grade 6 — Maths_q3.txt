Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Compare the number of digits in each number (identify the 3-digit number vs. 4-digit numbers).
2. Recognize "736" as the smallest based on place value magnitude.
3. Compare the thousands digit of the remaining 4-digit numbers (3, 5, 4).
4. Rank the numbers based on the lead digit ($3 < 4 < 5$).
5. Execute the "ascending" sequence: Write the sequence from least to greatest.
6. Verify language comprehension: Correctly map the English term "ascending" to the concept of "increasing."

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **Left-to-right digit matching bug:** Students compare the first digit of every number without checking total digits (e.g., seeing '7' in 736 and ranking it as the largest because $7 > 5, 4, 3$).
2. **"Biggest is Smallest" bug:** Confusing the term "ascending" with "descending" (extremely common in ESL/Hindi-medium learners).
3. **Leading digit focus bug:** If two numbers have the same lead digit (though not present here), the student may stop the comparison there.
4. **Vocabulary anchor bug:** The word "ascending" is not phonetically or semantically linked to "small-to-big" in Hindi (where "Arohi" is used), leading to a 50/50 guess on direction.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 6 students from EWS backgrounds often struggle with English mathematical vocabulary. While comparing numbers is a Grade 3/4 skill, the use of English terminology in an open-ended format significantly increases the cognitive load. However, identifying "736" as the smallest (the rubric requirement for partial/full credit) is a relatively low-level place-value task.

Step 4: Holistic estimation
While the comparison of these specific numbers is numerically "easy" (distinct lead digits, distinct digit lengths), the language barrier for "ascending" is the primary bottleneck.
