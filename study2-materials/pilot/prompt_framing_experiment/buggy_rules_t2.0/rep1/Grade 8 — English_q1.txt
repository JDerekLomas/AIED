Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Decoding the question: Translate "sky", "look", and "sunset" from English to Hindi (or mental representation).
2.  Information retrieval: Access the specific sensory memory/details from the prescribed text (colors: orange and pink).
3.  Syntactic mapping: Formulate a sentence structure (Subject + Verb + Predicate) in English.
4.  Vocabulary retrieval: Recalling specific English color words and adjectives ("shades," "painted").
5.  Orthographic execution: Correct spelling and grammar (e.g., past tense "looked").

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1.  Keyword Matching Bug: Searching the text for the word "sky" or "sunset" and copying the entire surrounding sentence, regardless of whether it describes appearance.
2.  Primary Color Bias: Substituting complex colors (orange/pink) with simpler primary colors (red/blue/yellow) because they are higher-frequency words in low-resource environments.
3.  Tense Inconsistency: Answering in the present tense ("The sky is...") despite the question using "did... look."
4.  L1 Interference (Transliteration): Mapping Hindi syntax onto English (e.g., "Sky orange pink was").
5.  Description Omission: Answering "It looked good/beautiful" (vague evaluative) instead of descriptive (visual adjectives), which fails the specific rubric requirement.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face a "reading-to-learn" gap. While they may comprehend the concept of a sunset, their expressive English vocabulary is often limited to basic nouns and verbs. In an open-ended format without a word bank, recall of specific color pairings (orange AND pink) is high-effort. The rubric is stringent (requiring "both colors"), which penalizes partial linguistic mastery.
