Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the written question in English (a language with which they have limited proficiency).
2. Scan the provided data table (referenced in the text but external to the text) to locate the "expansion" column.
3. Compare numerical values/magnitudes in the table to identify the maximum value (Aluminium).
4. Ignore distractors in parts (b) and (c) to focus solely on the rubric's requirement for part (a).
5. Map the identified value back to the "Material" column.
6. Record the answer "Aluminium."

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. **Vertical Search Error:** Scanning the first column instead of the second column for numerical comparison.
2. **Whole Number Bias/Place Value Confusion:** If values are decimals (e.g., 0.000023 vs 0.000012), students may misidentify which is "larger" based on the length of the string rather than place value.
3. **Lexical Interference:** Students may struggle with the English word "expands," leading them to guess based on a more familiar term or the metal they recognize most (likely Copper or Iron).
4. **Information Overload/Noise:** Part (b) and (c) require external recall and conceptual reasoning; a student may experience cognitive fatigue or assume they must integrate answers, failing to provide the simple identifying noun required for part (a).

Step 3: Target population considerations
The mismatch between the language of instruction/assessment (English) and the home language (Hindi) is a significant barrier. Grade 8 students in this demographic often rely on rote memorization; when faced with a "Data Interpretation" task that is not a memorized "definition," they often leave it blank or provide an irrelevant memorized fact about electricity or heat.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the identification of the "most" in a table is a lower-order Bloom's task, the combination of linguistic barriers, the cognitive "noise" of the subsequent irrelevant sub-questions, and the open-ended format significantly reduces the success rate for this specific demographic.
