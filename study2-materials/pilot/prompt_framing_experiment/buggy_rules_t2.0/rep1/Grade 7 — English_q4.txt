Step 1: Specific Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English text to identify the subject (the "king") and the intent of the question.
2. Retrieve specific episodic details from the textbook story ("The Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy) to recall what the questions actually were.
3. Map these specific questions (What is the right time? Who are the right people? What is the most important thing to do?) to abstract "real life" scenarios.
4. Formulate an evaluative judgment (Yes/No) and construct a logical "reason" based on the reading.
5. Translate that internal logic into a grammatically coherent English sentence.

Step 2: Identified "Buggy Rules" / Systematic Errors
1. Literal Translation Bug: Students translate the Hindi word for "question" (sawaal) but cannot differentiate between the "interrogative sentence" and the "philosophical problem."
2. Circular Logic Bug: Stating "The questions are important because they are the king's questions."
3. Comprehension Gap Bug: Students mistake "important" for "difficult" or "interesting," leading to irrelevant reasons.
4. Rubric Mismatch Bug: Since the rubric requires the answer to be based on the passage (the three specific tasks), students who answer "Yes, because kings are important" (surface-level reading) fail.
5. Syntax Scaffolding Error: Inability to transition from "Yes" to "because," resulting in a fragmented or unintelligible phrase.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. ELL Status: For Hindi-medium students, the transition to abstract reasoning in English in Grade 7 is a significant cognitive load ("Threshold Hypothesis").
2. Contextual Bias: Students from economically weaker sections often rely on rote memorization (ratta) of chapter summaries; an "open-ended" application question bypasses their primary survival strategy in testing.
3. Writing vs. Recognition: The lack of options (MCQ) increases the difficulty exponentially, as there is no visual cue to trigger recall of the "right time/right people" framework.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
While the story is a staple of the NCERT/State curriculum, the combination of required recall, abstract transfer, and productive language generation makes this a high-difficulty item for this specific demographic.
