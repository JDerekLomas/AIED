Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Decoding the prompt: Translate "Importance of dates" into a meaningful concept (likely involving temporal concepts like "timeline" or "sequencing").
2.  Retrieval: Access the relevant rote-learned or conceptual schema from the first chapter of the Grade 7 History NCERT (where "periodization" and "chronology" are central).
3.  Synthesis: Formulate a justification linking the concept of "dates" to the concept of "history" (cause-and-effect relationship).
4.  Linguistic Output: Construct a grammatical sentence in English (the medium of examination) to express the relationship, using keywords like "chronology," "sequence," or "before/after."

Step 2: Buggy rules
1.  Keyword-to-Fact Mismatch (Semantic bug): Using the word "date" to mean a "meeting" or a "fruit" due to limited vocabulary, leading to irrelevant responses.
2.  Temporal Vagueness Bug: Defining the word by using the word ("Dates are important because history has dates"), a recursive error common in students with limited conceptual vocabulary.
3.  Category Error: Conflating "dates" with "numbers" or "mathematics," resulting in a focus on counting rather than chronology.
4.  Translanguaging Collapse: Attempting to translate a complex thought from Hindi ("itihas ki krambaddhta") but failing to find English equivalents, leading to an empty or illegible response.

Step 3: Population considerations
Students in this cohort face high "cognitive load" due to bilingualism. The Grade 7 history curriculum moves from personal/familiar history to abstract concepts like periodization and historiography. While the rubric is lenient, the hurdle is the open-ended "Explain" command, which requires active recall and syntactical construction rather than passive recognition (MCQ). For EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds, the gap between understanding the utility of time and expressing it in an English-medium Social Science exam is significant.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
Considering the requirement for active synthesis in a second language, the abstraction of "chronology," and common procedural bugs in expressing temporal relations:
