To analyze this item through the lens of mathematical cognition and systematic procedural "bugs," we break down the task as follows:

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. **Conversion (Part A):** Transform $1 \frac{1}{2}$ to an improper fraction ($\frac{3}{2}$).
2. **Conversion (Part B):** Transform $3 \frac{1}{4}$ to an improper fraction ($\frac{13}{4}$).
3. **Multiplication (Numerators):** Multiply $3 \times 13 = 39$.
4. **Multiplication (Denominators):** Multiply $2 \times 4 = 8$.
5. **Back-conversion (Division):** Divide $39 \div 8$ to find the quotient (4) and remainder (7).
6. **Final Representation:** Synthesize the result into the mixed fraction form $4 \frac{7}{8}$.

**Step 2: Buggy Rules & Systematic Errors**
*   **Additive Strategy Bug:** Multiplying the whole numbers and the fractions separately ($1 \times 3$ and $1/2 \times 1/4 = 3 \frac{1}{8}$). This is the most common bug for this population.
*   **Partial Conversion Bug:** Multiplying the whole number by the denominator but adding the numerator incorrectly (e.g., $1 \times 2 + 1$ becoming $\frac{2}{2}$).
*   **The "Cross-Multiply" Bug:** Students often confuse the rule for fraction division/addition and try to cross-multiply numerators and denominators during a multiplication task.
*   **Denominator Preservation Bug:** Multiplying numerators but keeping one of the original denominators (producing $\frac{39}{2}$ or $\frac{39}{4}$).
*   **Calculation Slip:** Basic multiplication errors (e.g., $3 \times 13 = 36$).

**Step 3: Population Considerations**
In the Indian Grade 7 context, particularly in schools serving economically weaker sections (EWS), students often rely on rote memorization of algorithms. While they may be familiar with "proper" vs. "improper" terms, the transition to multi-step procedures without visual scaffolds is high-risk. For Hindi-medium students, English-worded instructions ("Mixed fraction") can sometimes be a barrier, though "Multiply" is generally understood. The rubric is "all or nothing," providing no credit for partial procedural success.

**Step 4: Holistic Assessment**
The requirement to execute a six-step procedure perfectly—including two conversions, two multiplications, and a final division—multiplies the probability of a "bug" appearing. Research in systematic errors suggests that even when individual steps are mastered, the "chaining" of steps increases cognitive load, leading to high failure rates in open-ended formats.
