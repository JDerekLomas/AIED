Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Linguistic decoding: Correctly reading and translating the English word "opposite" (meta-linguistic instruction) into its functional meaning in Hindi (e.g., *vilom* or *ulta*).
2. Semantic retrieval: Decoding the target word "slow" and mapping it to the concept of speed/velocity.
3. Lexical search: Recalling the English antonym for the specific concept of "low speed" (fast, quick, or rapid) from long-term memory.
4. Orthographic execution: Correcting spelling the retrieved word "fast" in English.
5. Grammatical mapping: Ensuring the response fits the adjective category of the prompt.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "The Synonym Swap": Systematic confusion between "opposite" and "meaning," leading the student to provide a word with the same meaning (e.g., "gradual" or a Hindi equivalent).
2. "Rhyme Association": Recalling a word that sounds like "slow" rather than one that means the opposite (e.g., "glow," "flow").
3. "Phonetic Spelling": Spelling "fast" as it sounds in an Indian accent (e.g., "fast" vs "phast" or "fash").
4. "The Negative Particle": Adding "no" or "not" because the concept of "opposite" is understood as "negation" (e.g., "not slow").
5. "L1 Interference": Translating the answer correctly in the mind (Hindi: *tej*) but lacking the English lexical bridge to output "fast."

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
The open-ended format (recall) is significantly more difficult for Hindi-medium, EWS students than a multiple-choice format (recognition). While "slow/fast" is a foundational pair, the word "opposite" often acts as a hurdle in English-language assessments for students who primarily use "vilom" in Hindi. Given the Grade 6 level, there is a gap between functional comprehension and technical English vocabulary.
