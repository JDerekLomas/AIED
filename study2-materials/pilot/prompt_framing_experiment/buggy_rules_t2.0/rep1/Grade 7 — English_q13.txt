Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the sentence structure and vocabulary in English.
2. Identify the sound of the first letter of "elephant" (vowel sound /e/) and select "an."
3. Identify the sound of the first letter of "tiger" (consonant sound /t/) and select "a."
4. Determine the specificity of "zoo" (specific location context) and select "the."
5. Execute the "Rewrite" instruction (reproducing the entire sentence string accurately without omission).

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
- Phonetic Bug (Graph-over-Phonic): Choosing "a" for words starting with "u" (not applicable here) or failing to recognize "e" as a vowel due to local dialect pronunciations of "elephant" as starting with a 'y' or 'i' sound.
- Indefinite Generalization: Using "a" for all singular nouns (ignoring "an" entirely).
- Null Article Bias: Omitting the article before "zoo" because native languages (like Hindi) often use zero articles in these contexts (*Mainne zoo mein haathi dekha*).
- Default "The": Over-applying "the" to all nouns to indicate importance or simply as a safe "generic" article.
- Copy/Transcription Error: Focusing so much on the blanks that the student forgets to "rewrite the whole sentence" as per the rubric/instruction, providing only the missing words.

Step 3: Population Factors
- Seventh-grade students in EWS/Hindi-medium contexts often struggle with the "a/an" distinction because the vowel/consonant sound rule is frequently taught via memorized lists rather than phonetic logic.
- The "Rewrite the whole" instruction is a high-hurdle cognitive load; students often provide "an, a, the" in a list, which fails the 1-point rubric despite showing grammatical knowledge.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
The multi-step requirement (3 correct articles + 1 correct transcription) creates a high probability of at least one failure point. Even if a student knows the articles, the requirement to rewrite the entire sentence correctly acts as a significant "trap" for students with lower English literacy levels.
