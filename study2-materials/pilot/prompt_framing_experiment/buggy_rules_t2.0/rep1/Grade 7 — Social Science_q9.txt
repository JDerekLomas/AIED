To estimate the success rate for this item, we first break down the cognitive and procedural demands:

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. **Linguistic Decoding:** Translating the command verb "Assess" and the academic terms "Impact" and "Economic" into a concrete prompt (likely "What happens to the money/trade/farmers during/after a war?").
2. **Retrieval from Long-Term Memory:** Accessing schemata related to medieval/early modern kingdoms (the typical Grade 7 Social Science focus in India).
3. **Conceptual Linkage:** Connecting the event (War) to a specific economic domain (Taxation, destruction of crops, treasury depletion, or trade disruption).
4. **Formulation:** Drafting a response that establishes a causal link (Action $\rightarrow$ Result).
5. **English Output:** Expressing the thought in English despite it being a second/third language.

**Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors**
*   **The "Keyword Match" Bug:** Students see "Wars" and write everything they know about wars (battles, bravery, death) without addressing the "Economic" constraint.
*   **The "Binary Value" Bug:** Assessing "Impact" as a moral judgment (War is bad) rather than a functional economic one (War depletes the treasury).
*   **The "Anachronism" Bug:** Applying modern economic concepts (Inflation, GDP) incorrectly to historical kingdoms.
*   **The "Generic Output" Bug:** Writing a true but non-responsive statement (e.g., "Many people die"), which fails the rubric's "Economic Impact" requirement.

**Step 3: Population Considerations**
In the Indian context for Grade 7, "Social Science" is often taught through rote memorization of textbook passages. In English-medium exams for students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds, the "Economic" vocabulary is a high-threshold barrier. While the rubric is generous (requiring only one point), the transition from recognition (Multiple Choice) to recall (Open-Ended) creates a significant drop in performance.

**Step 4: Holistic Analysis**
While many students will understand that war has negative consequences, a large portion will succumb to the "Keyword Match" bug (describing the violence) or the "Linguistic Barrier," unable to bridge the gap between their conceptual understanding (in Hindi/Home language) and the academic English required for "economic impact."
