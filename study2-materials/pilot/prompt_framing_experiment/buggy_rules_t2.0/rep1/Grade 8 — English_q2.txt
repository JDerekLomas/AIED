Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English question to identify the intent ("What sounds") and context ("scene").
2. Retrieve the specific mental model or textual representation of the scene (likely from a poem like "The Ant and the Cricket" or similar descriptive passage common in NCERT Grade 8).
3. Distinguish between visual information (sunset) and auditory information (bird sounds).
4. Formulate an English sentence or phrase that uses correct vocabulary (chirping, twittering, returning) and tense.
5. Align the retrieved memory with the specific rubric requirement of "birds returning to their nests."

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. "Visual-Auditory Confusion": Identifying what they *saw* (the sun setting) rather than what they *heard*.
2. "Keyword Matching Error": Searching for the word "sound" in the text; if not found, guessing based on general themes of the poem/story.
3. "Translation Bottleneck": Students conceptualize "panchi" (birds) and "shahar/sharm" but cannot map them to the English specific phrase "returning to their nests."
4. "Generic Schema Substitution": Providing a general answer like "The scene was quiet" or "Nature sounds" because they lack the specific vocabulary demanded by the rubric.
5. "Over-generalization": Mentioning animals/sounds not in the text but typically associated with evenings in their local environment.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 8 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds often face a "gap" between literal comprehension and expressive production in English. In an open-ended format (recall), the cognitive load of syntax and specific vocabulary is significantly higher than in a multiple-choice format (recognition). For many, "birds" is accessible, but the specific predicate "returning to their nests" required by the rubric is a high-threshold linguistic task.

Step 4: Estimated proportion
Given the requirement for a specific English phrase in an open-ended format among a population with limited English proficiency, the success rate is typically low due to the combination of decoding failure and production hurdles.
