Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object).
2. Recall the definition of a "verb phrase" (differentiating it from a single "verb").
3. Identify the lexical verb ("playing").
4. Identify the auxiliary/helping verb ("are").
5. Synthesize the two parts into a single contiguous unit.
6. Write/extract the specific phrase "are playing" without adding the noun ("football") or subject ("children").

Step 2: Common "Buggy Rules":
1. **Single Verb Focus:** Identifying only the action word ("playing") and ignoring the auxiliary.
2. **First-Verb Capture:** Selecting only the first verb encountered ("are") as the verb.
3. **Verb + Object Over-extension:** Including the direct object ("playing football") because the action feels incomplete without it.
4. **Keyword Extraction:** Simply rewriting the most "active" word in the sentence.
5. **Categorization Confusion:** Identifying "football" because it is the "topic" of the sentence.

Step 3: Student Population context:
For Grade 6 students in EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds, "Verb Phrase" is technical meta-language. While they might understand the action, the linguistic label "Verb Phrase" is often taught as "Helping Verb + Main Verb." However, due to limited English exposure, many students struggle to distinguish where the phrase ends and the object begins. The open-ended format prevents guessing, and the requirement to include "are" (which is often seen as a "joining word" rather than a verb) is a significant hurdle.
