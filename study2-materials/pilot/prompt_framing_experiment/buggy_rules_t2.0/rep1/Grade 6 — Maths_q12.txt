Step 1: Specific procedural steps:
1. Decode the semantic structure of the word problem (interpreting "equal number in each box" as division).
2. Execute the division algorithm: $112 \div 10$.
3. Correct identify the quotient ($11$) as the answer to "how many pencils in each box."
4. Interpret the remainder ($2$) in the context of "minimum number of pencils required" (understanding the question asks for the current capacity used, or potentially misinterpreted as how many more are needed to reach the next multiple).
5. Align the two-part answer with the specific prompts.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. **The "Divide-by-Ten" Decimal Bug:** Treating $112 \div 10$ as simply inserting a decimal point ($11.2$) and being unable to translate $.2$ back into a discrete quantity of pencils or a remainder.
2. **Operation Identification Error:** Adding ($112+10$) or subtracting ($112-10$) due to keywords or limited English comprehension.
3. **Remainder Confusion:** Identifying the remainder ($2$) as the answer to "how many in each box" or simply ignoring it.
4. **Keyword Tripwire:** Misinterpreting "minimum number... required" as a request for the *extra* pencils needed to complete a set (e.g., $10 - 2 = 8$) rather than the $112$ already present.

Step 3: Student population factors:
1. **Linguistic barrier:** The phrase "minimum number of pencils required" is complex. Students might struggle to distinguish between "required to satisfy the condition" and "required *more*."
2. **Division Proficiency:** While division is taught by Grade 6, "remainders" are often treated as "leftovers" to be discarded in classroom drills rather than interpreted.
3. **Zero-handling in 10s:** Many students use a "shifting" shortcut that lacks conceptual depth, leading to errors when translating to physical objects.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
The complexity of the phrasing ("minimum number... required to put") is highly likely to confuse even students who can perform the division. The rubric only requires identifying 11 with a remainder of 2, but the prompt asks for two specific values. Given the English proficiency barriers and the common conceptual gap in remainder interpretation at this socio-economic level, a majority will likely fail to provide both parts of the answer correctly.
