Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Isolate the variable `y` by applying the additive inverse or moving `+9` across the equals sign.
2. Correctly change the sign of the constant during transposition (from `+9` to `-9`).
3. Execute the arithmetic operation involving signed integers: `4 - 9`.
4. Apply integer subtraction rules to determine that the result is negative because the absolute value of the subtrahend is greater than the minuend.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "Smaller-from-larger" bug: Students perform `9 - 4` and conclude `y = 5`, ignoring the negative sign requirement.
2. "Sign retention" bug: Moving the `+9` to the other side without changing the sign (e.g., `y = 4 + 9 = 13`).
3. "Operation confusion": Seeing the `+` sign and assuming addition is always required regardless of the transposition (similar to above).
4. "Variable detachment": Treating `y` as a placeholder that disappears, leading to nonsensical expressions like `9 + 4 = 13`.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. English proficiency: While the equation is symbolic, instruction is often bilingual; however, the concept of "value" may be misinterpreted if linguistic context is weak.
2. Prior knowledge: Grade 8 students in this demographic often struggle with the "negative result" concept if they have missed foundational "Number System" concepts in Grades 6 and 7.
3. Open-ended format: No multiple-choice options are provided to trigger self-correction or recognition of a negative sign.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
The combination of the "smaller-from-larger" intuition (very strong in remedial learners) and the necessity of managing signs during transposition makes this a high-error item despite its brevity.
