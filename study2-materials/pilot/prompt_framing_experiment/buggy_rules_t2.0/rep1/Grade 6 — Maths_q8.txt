Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Retrieve the formula for Area of a rectangle ($A = L \times B$).
2. Retrieve the formula for Perimeter of a rectangle ($P = 2 \times (L + B)$ or $L+L+B+B$).
3. Substitute numerical values ($15$ and $8$) correctly into both formulas.
4. Execute multiplication ($15 \times 8 = 120$).
5. Execute addition/multiplication for perimeter ($15 + 8 = 23$, then $23 \times 2 = 46$).
6. Assign correct units for area ($cm^2$ or sq. cm).
7. Synthesize both requirements to provide the final answer as defined by the rubric.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- **Formula Confusion:** Swapping Area and Perimeter formulas.
- **Operator Confusion:** Calculating $15 + 8$ for area or $15 \times 8$ for perimeter.
- **Incomplete Perimeter:** Adding only two sides ($L + B = 23$) instead of four.
- **Unit Neglect/Mismatch:** Writing "cm" for area or omitting units entirely (which may fail some interpretations of the rubric).
- **Multiplication Errors:** Standard procedural errors in multiplying a 2-digit by a 1-digit number.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
The student population faces dual-language cognitive loads (translating English terms like "length," "breadth," "area," and "perimeter"). Grade 6 students in these settings often rely on rote memorization of formulas without conceptual "feel" for the difference between boundary and surface. Furthermore, the question is a multi-step task requiring two distinct outputs for a single mark; if a student calculates the perimeter correctly but fails the area (or vice versa), they receive 0 marks, significantly lowering the success rate.

Step 4: Estimation
Given that this is an open-ended item requiring the recall of two distinct formulas and perfect execution of both to earn 1 point, the error rate is compounded by "partially correct" responses that the rubric labels as 0.
