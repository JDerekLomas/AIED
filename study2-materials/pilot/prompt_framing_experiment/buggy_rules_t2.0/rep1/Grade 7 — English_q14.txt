Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the term "antonym" and the instructional command "opposite word" in English.
2. Retrieve the semantic meaning of the stimulus word "ancient."
3. Mentally search for a semantic pair/counterpart that represents the reverse temporal attribute (long ago vs. now).
4. Select a specific English target word (e.g., "modern" or "new") from long-term memory.
5. Apply orthographic rules to correctly spell the retrieved word in written form.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. Synonym-for-Antonym Bug: Student provides a word with the same meaning (e.g., "old," "very old") due to confusing the meta-linguistic labels "antonym" and "synonym."
2. Association Bug: Student provides a word related to the context of "ancient" but not its opposite (e.g., "history," "Egypt," "olden days").
3. Phonetic Spelling Bug: Student retrieves "modern" but writes "modren" or "morden" due to Hindi-influenced phonetic processing (schwa insertion/metathesis).
4. Translation Bottleneck: Student knows the concept in Hindi ("Prachin" vs. "Adhunik") but cannot bridge the "Adhunik" -> "Modern" lexical gap in English.
5. Positive-Negative Bug: Adding a prefix blindly to the stimulus (e.g., "unancient," "disancient") as a systematic rule for creating opposites.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students from economically weaker sections in Indian government schools often encounter "ancient" in Social Science (History) textbooks, but rarely in conversational English. While "new" is basic, "modern" is the academic expected counterpart. The open-ended format removes the scaffolding of recognition (multiple choice), making retrieval failure highly likely for second-language learners with limited vocabulary breadth.
