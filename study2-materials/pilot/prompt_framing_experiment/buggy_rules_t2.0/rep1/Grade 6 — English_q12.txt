Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Decode Lexical Item (L2 to L1):** Translate the English word "opposite" into the functional concept of contrast (Hindi: "vilom" or "ulta").
2. **Retrieve Semantics:** Identify the directional meaning of the anchor word "up" (Hindi: "uupar").
3. **Lexical Retrieval (Target):** Locate the English equivalent of "neeche" in long-term memory.
4. **Graphemic Encoding (Spelling):** Correctly sequence the letters 'd', 'o', 'w', 'n' to produce the written output.

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules" (Systematic procedural errors)
*   **The Synonym Swap:** Identifying a related word rather than the contrast (e.g., writing "high" or "above").
*   **Phonetic Spelling/L1 Interference:** Writing the word based on Hindi phonology (e.g., "daun" or "daon").
*   **The Translation Trap:** Providing the answer in the L1 (e.g., writing "नीचे").
*   **Association Over-Extension:** Providing a word that completes a common phrase rather than the opposite (e.g., "up... stair" or "up... side").

Step 3: Target student population considerations
*   **Recall vs. Recognition:** Unlike a multiple-choice question, this is open-ended. Students must retrieve the spelling from scratch, increasing the cognitive load.
*   **Language Barrier:** For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the word "opposite" itself is often the primary barrier to entry, rather than the concept of "up/down."
*   **Status of L2:** In Grade 6, while basic directions are taught, spelling fluency for silent 'w' or diphthongs like 'ow' remains inconsistent.
