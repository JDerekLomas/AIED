Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of the question in English (recognizing "mean to" as a query for significance, not a definition).
2. Retrieve the relevant narrative information from long-term memory (Anika's internal relationship with art).
3. Distinguish between the superficial action (hobby) and the deep function (expression of feelings) as per the rubric's specific "more than" contrast.
4. Construct a grammatically coherent sentence in English using "because," "was," or "meant" to link the subject to the abstract concept of self-expression.
5. Translate internal thoughts from Hindi/L1 into English while maintaining the nuances of "expressing thoughts and feelings."

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules" (Procedural/Cognitive Errors)
1. Keyword Matching Bug: Students find the word "drawing" in the text and copy the nearest sentence, regardless of whether it explains the "meaning" (significance).
2. Definitional Bug: Interpreting "What did... mean" literally as a request for a dictionary definition (e.g., "Drawing means making pictures with a pencil").
3. Surface-Level Recall Bug: Stating what Anika draws (objects/people) instead of why she draws (the emotional significance).
4. Subject-Verb Agreement/Tense Transfer: Using "Anika drawing is..." or "Anika mean..." which, in strict rubrics, may fail to "convey ideas clearly."
5. Hobby-Satiation Bug: Stopping after "It was a hobby," failing to execute the "more than" comparison required for the full point.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 8 students in this context often face a "threshold effect" where their conceptual understanding (in L1) far exceeds their expressive English capability. The requirement for a specific dual-part answer (not a hobby + self-expression) in an open-ended format is a high cognitive load for students with limited English exposure, as there are no "recognition" cues provided by multiple-choice options.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
Given the transition from "learning to read" to "reading to learn" by Grade 8, many students will understand the story's sentiment but struggle to articulate the abstract contrast required by the rubric. The gap between vernacular thinking and English writing, combined with the "Buggy Rule" of copying the nearest context sentence, significantly reduces the probability of a "fully correct" response according to the specific rubric requirements.
