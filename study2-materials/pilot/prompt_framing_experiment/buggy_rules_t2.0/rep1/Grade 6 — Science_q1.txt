Step 1: Procedural Steps
1.  **Decoding and Translation:** Accessing the English vocabulary ("North pole," "brought near") and translating it into a mental model (often in Hindi, i.e., *same dhruv*).
2.  **Visualization of Spatial Orientation:** Mapping the written description onto the physical properties of a bar magnet.
3.  **Retrieval of Magnetic Law:** Recalling the rule: Like poles repel; opposite poles attract.
4.  **Application:** Correcting matching the "North-North" condition to the "Like poles" category.
5.  **Output Generation:** Recalling and correctly spelling the English technical term ("repel") or a functional description ("push away").

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
*   **The "Attraction Default":** A general bias that magnetism *only* means things sticking together (ignoring repulsion).
*   **The "Magnetic Flip" Error:** Misidentifying North and South as "positive" and "negative," then incorrectly applying electrical charges or simple arithmetic rules.
*   **Term Swap:** Systematic confusion between the definitions of "repel" and "attract" while understanding the physical concept.
*   **Semantic Overgeneralization:** Assuming all magnets behave like household stickers or fridge magnets (which usually orient themselves to stick).

Step 3: Population Considerations (Grade 6, Hindi-medium background, EWS)
*   **English as a Barrier:** While the concept (repulsion) is physically intuitive, producing the specific English terms "repel" or "push away" in an open-ended format is a significant cognitive load compared to a multiple-choice format.
*   **Concept Stability:** At Grade 6, many students may have seen magnets but lack the systematic vocabulary to distinguish between poles during a written assessment.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the linguistic barrier of an open-ended English response combined with the common "Attraction Default" bug, a significant portion of the student body will struggle to provide the exact technical response required by the rubric, even if they have an intuitive grasp of the physical phenomenon.
