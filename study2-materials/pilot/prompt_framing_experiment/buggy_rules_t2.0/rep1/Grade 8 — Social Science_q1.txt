Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Search long-term memory for the specific category "Fundamental Rights" (distinct from Duties or general laws).
2. Discrimination: Isolate specific items (e.g., Right to Equality, Right to Liberty) from other civics concepts (e.g., Secularism, Democracy).
3. Retrieval/Production: Recurse the memory to recall the exact phrasing or key identifiers for at least two rights.
4. Translation/Encoding: Map the internalized Hindi concept (e.g., समानता का अधिकार) to the English equivalent (Right to Equality), or produce a simplified English version as per the rubric.
5. Verification: Check that the two retrieved items are "distinct" and satisfy the count of "two."

Step 2: Identified "Buggy Rules" (Systematic procedural errors)
1. Category Displacement (Concept Swap): Providing "Fundamental Duties" (e.g., respecting the flag) or "Preamble Keywords" (e.g., Justice, Liberty, Fraternity) instead of Rights.
2. The "Single-Right" Halt: Providing only one correct right and stopping (error in count processing).
3. The "Broadening" Bug: Using overly generic terms (e.g., "Right to live," "Right to vote") that do not map to the constitutional list of Fundamental Rights.
4. Language Interference Bug: Producing a phonetic or mangled English string that loses the "core" meaning, failing the rubric’s simplification allowance (e.g., writing "Equal to all" which might be accepted, vs "Human Right").
5. List Integration Bug: Listing the names of leaders (Ambedkar) or the year the Constitution was formed instead of the content of the Constitution.

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often rely on rote memorization (cramming). While "Fundamental Rights" is a core "high-frequency" topic in the NCERT/State curriculum, the shift from recognition (Multiple Choice) to recall (Open-Ended) significantly increases cognitive load. English as the medium of examination for Hindi-medium heritage students acts as a high barrier for retrieving technical legalistic terms.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the topic is heavily emphasized, the combination of category confusion (Rights vs. Duties), the recall format, and the language barrier creates a significant "bug" rate.
