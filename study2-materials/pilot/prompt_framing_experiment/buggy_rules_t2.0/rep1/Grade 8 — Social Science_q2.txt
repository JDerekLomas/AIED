Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the English sentence to identify the topic (Harappan Civilization) and the specific constraint (Urban Planning).
2. Retrieve relevant semantic data from long-term memory regarding the Indus Valley.
3. Filter general history (e.g., "they grew barley") to isolate "urban planning" features.
4. Translate the internal conceptual model (likely held in Hindi/native tongue) into a coherent English sentence structure.
5. Transcribe the sentence correctly to meet rubric requirements.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. "Generalization Bug": Providing a general fact about the civilization (e.g., "It was very old") instead of a specific planning feature.
2. "Category Error": Confusing "Urban Planning" (infrastructure) with "Culture" or "Economy" (e.g., "They used seals" or "They worshipped Pashupati").
3. "Translation Deadlock": Student knows the concept (e.g., *Nalli* for drainage or *Int* for bricks) but cannot retrieve the English terminology (*drainage*, *baked bricks*).
4. "The Recognition/Recall Gap": Since the test is open-ended, students lack the "scaffold" of a multiple-choice list, leading to "null responses" or "associative interference" (writing everything they know in a "word vomit" that fails to answer the prompt).

Step 3: Population considerations:
In Grade 8 Indian govt. schools, high-stakes memorization is common, but English proficiency acts as a significant bottleneck. Urban planning is a staple of the NCERT curriculum, but expressing it in a second language without cues is a high-cognitive-load task for students from economically weaker sections with limited out-of-school literacy support.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis:
While the content is "high-frequency" in curriculum, the transition from recognition to written production in English—compounded by "Category Error" bugs—will lead to a high failure rate despite the students knowing "what" the civilization was.
