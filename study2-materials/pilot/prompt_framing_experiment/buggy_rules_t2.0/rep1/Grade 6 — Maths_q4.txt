Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall the conceptual meaning of LCM or a specific algorithm (Common Division Method or Prime Factorization).
2. For Common Division: Correct setup of the division ladder with all three numbers (12, 15, 20).
3. Identify the smallest prime factor (2) that divides at least two numbers.
4. Execute division: Correctly divide 12 and 20, and crucially, carry down the 15 unchanged.
5. Iterate division: Continue dividing by primes (2, 3, 5) until all quotients are 1.
6. Multiply all prime factors on the left side of the ladder ($2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5$).
7. Perform the multi-digit multiplication correctly to reach the product (60).

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- "Divide All or None": Students attempt to find a divisor that goes into all three numbers (HCF logic) and get stuck because no prime divides 12, 15, and 20 simultaneously.
- "The Remainder Trap": Instead of bringing 15 down when dividing 12 and 20 by 2, students might try to divide 15 and write a remainder or a decimal.
- "Multiplication over Addition": Students find the factors correctly but add them ($2+2+3+5=12$) instead of multiplying them.
- "Partial Factorization": Stopping the process once all numbers are prime but not yet reduced to 1.
- "Fact Family Interference": Misrecalling basic multiplication/division facts (e.g., $12 \div 2 = 8$ due to cognitive load).

Step 3: Student Population Context
Grade 6 students in this demographic often face "language-switching" overhead where terms like "Least" and "Common" are learned by rote rather than conceptual mapping. The open-ended format removes the "recognition" safety net. For students from economically weaker backgrounds, a lack of consistent "drill and kill" practice or personalized feedback on "buggy" division steps often leads to high error rates in multi-step procedures.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While LCM is a core part of the Grade 6 curriculum, the necessity of executing at least four error-free divisions and one multi-term multiplication—coupled with the common confusion between LCM and HCF procedures—creates multiple "failure points."
