Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the word problem and identify the relationship (distance per unit volume).
2. Map the problem to the correct mathematical operation: Multiplication ($10 \times 5 \frac{3}{4}$).
3. Convert the mixed fraction $5 \frac{3}{4}$ into an improper fraction $\frac{23}{4}$ (requires: $5 \times 4 + 3$).
4. Set up the multiplication: $10 \times \frac{23}{4}$ (or $10 \times 5.75$).
5. Execute the arithmetic: $230 \div 4$ or $10 \times 5 + 10 \times \frac{3}{4}$ (requires simplification or decimal division).
6. Provide the final numerical value ($57.5$).

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
- Translation Bug: Using addition ($10 + 5 \frac{3}{4}$) or division ($10 \div 5 \frac{3}{4}$) because "how far" is incorrectly associated with the wrong operator.
- Improper Fraction Conversion Bug: Adding the whole number to the numerator and keeping the denominator ($5 + 3 = 8 \rightarrow \frac{8}{4}$) or multiplying the whole number by the numerator instead of the denominator.
- Partial Distribution Bug: Multiplying $10 \times 5$ and ignoring the fraction, or multiplying $10 \times \frac{3}{4}$ and ignoring the whole number.
- Multiplication/Addition Confusion: $10 \times 5 \frac{3}{4}$ interpreted as $10 + 5 \frac{3}{4}$.
- Decimal Conversion Bug: $5 \frac{3}{4}$ incorrectly converted to $5.3$ or $5.34$.

Step 3: Population Factors
The student population faces a linguistic barrier where the English word problem might obscure the underlying math. Students from economically weaker sections often have high proficiency in "street mathematics" (addition/scaling) but struggle with the formal school algorithms involving fractions. Grade 7 students in these contexts often struggle significantly with rational numbers and formal fraction multiplication compared to whole number operations.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
While the operation is a simple scaling multiplication, the mixed fraction serves as a significant "barrier" element. Many students will either attempt to solve it through repeated addition (and lose precision at the fraction step) or make a procedural error during the mixed-to-improper conversion. In many government school assessments, fraction-related questions see a steep drop-off in accuracy compared to integer-based questions.
