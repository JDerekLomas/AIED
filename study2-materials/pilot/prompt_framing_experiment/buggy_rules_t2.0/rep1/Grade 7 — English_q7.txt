Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Read the sentence "We ran around" and the prompt, identifying that "around" is the target word for analysis.
2. **Grammatical Categorization**: Retrieve the definition and functional constraints of "Parts of Speech."
3. **Functional Mapping**: Analyze the relationship between "around" and "ran" (verb) to determine it modifies the action/direction without a trailing object.
4. **Differentiation**: Distinguish "around" as an adverb from its common role as a preposition (which would require a noun phrase following it).
5. **Technical Recall & Encoding**: Correct English spelling of the word "adverb" in an open-ended format.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" (Procedural Errors)
1. **Word-Class Rigidity (Static Labeling)**: Applying a fixed label to a word regardless of context (e.g., "around" is *always* a preposition because it appears in lists of prepositions).
2. **Object Requirement Bias**: Assuming all words indicating spatial relationship must be prepositions, failing to recognize when the object is omitted/implied.
3. **The "-ly" Heuristic**: Operating under the rule "Adverbs must end in -ly." If it doesn't end in -ly, it cannot be an adverb.
4. **Position-Based Tagging**: Mapping "around" as a noun because it follows a verb in a manner similar to "We ran [the race]."
5. **Translingual Interference**: Applying Hindi grammatical structures (where postpositions operate differently) to English syntax.

Step 3: Target population considerations
- **Grade 7**: Transitional phase where the nuance between adverbs and prepositions is typically introduced but rarely mastered.
- **English Language Learners (ELL)**: Limited English proficiency makes identifying functional relationships (how a word *works* in a specific sentence) much harder than memorizing vocabulary.
- **Open-ended recall**: Lack of multiple-choice options eliminates the "elimination strategy," requiring the student to retrieve the specific term "adverb" from long-term memory.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
Given that "around" is a classic "pivot word" that defaults to "preposition" in most rote-learning environments, and given the lack of an object in this sentence, most students will either default to "preposition" or "verb" (associating it with movement). The specific distinction required here is a high-level syntactic nuance.
