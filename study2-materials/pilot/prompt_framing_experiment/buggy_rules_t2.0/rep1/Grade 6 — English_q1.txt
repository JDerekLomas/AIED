Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate and comprehend the question "Where did she find...?" (recognizing 'where' as a request for location and identifying the subject/object).
2. **Contextual Retrieval**: Recall the specific details from the previously read passage (associating "old book" with a specific location).
3. **Information Mapping**: Isolate the correct prepositional phrase/noun ("in the attic" vs. other mentioned locations like "school" or "bookshelf").
4. **Encoding/Production**: Produce a written response in English that matches the semantic requirement of the rubric.

Step 2: Common "Buggy Rules" and Systematic Errors
1. **The "Who" for "Where" Bug**: Misinterpreting the WH-question word; responding with a person (Margie/Tommy) instead of a location.
2. **Text-Matching Bug**: Identifying any sentence in the text containing the word "book" or "found" and copying that entire sentence, regardless of whether it answers "where."
3. **Literal Translation Gap**: If the student thinks in Hindi (*Voh purani kitab kahan mili?*), they may struggle with the English syntax and leave it blank or use a native-language word for "attic" (like *atari* or *chhat*) if the English vocabulary isn't internalized.
4. **Memory Decay/Confusion**: Confusing "attic" with "school" because the book is *about* school, a common conceptual proximity error in Reading Comprehension.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students in this demographic often face "The Fourth-Grade Slump" in second-language literacy. While "The Fun They Had" (the likely source text) is a standard curriculum piece, "attic" is a low-frequency tier-3 vocabulary word for Hindi-medium students. The open-ended format removes the "recognition" safety net of Multiple Choice Questions. Students may remember the location but be unable to recall or spell the specific English word "attic."

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the reliance on a specific vocabulary word ("attic") that is not commonly used in the daily lives of students from economically weaker sections, and the hurdle of shifting from Hindi to English retrieval, there is a high probability of "copy-paste" errors from the text or incorrect WH-word processing.
