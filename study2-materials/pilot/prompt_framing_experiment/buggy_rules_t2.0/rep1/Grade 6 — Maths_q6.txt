Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Retrieve and apply the formula for the area of a rectangle ($L \times W$).
2. Perform the multiplication: $5 \times 4 = 20$.
3. Retrieve and apply the formula for the area of a square ($S \times S$ or $S^2$).
4. Perform the multiplication: $5 \times 5 = 25$.
5. Perform a comparative operation (comparison of magnitude) to identify which is greater ($25 > 20$).
6. Calculate the difference (subtraction): $25 - 20 = 5$.
7. Provide the final answer in a sentence/phrase format including the unit ($sq. cm$).

Step 2: Buggy Rules and Systematic Errors
- Area/Perimeter Confusion: Applying $2(L+W)$ or $4S$ instead of multiplication.
- Linear Measurement Bias: Comparing lengths or sides ($5=5$) rather than areas.
- Over-generalization of Square Formula: Applying $L \times W$ for rectangle but potentially using $S \times 4$ for square.
- Computational "Slips": Common in the $5 \times 4$ vs $5+4$ or $5 \times 5$ vs $5 \times 2$ (doubling instead of squaring).
- Language-based Retrieval Failure: Difficulty parsing the English prompt "by how much," leading to only providing the comparison (identifying the square) without the subtraction step.

Step 3: Student Population Context
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often experience "Matthew Effects" in math, where gaps in foundational multiplication facts persist. For Hindi-medium students, the transition to English math terminology (length, width, area, square) introduces a cognitive load that competes with mathematical processing. Since this is an open-ended recall task, students lack the scaffolding provided by multiple-choice distractors.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the 1-point rubric (all-or-nothing), the requirement to perform two different area calculations and a subtraction correctly is high. The "by how much" phrasing is a frequent linguistic barrier for students with limited English proficiency.
