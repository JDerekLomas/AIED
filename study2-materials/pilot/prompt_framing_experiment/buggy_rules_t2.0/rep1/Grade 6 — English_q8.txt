Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Syntax Recognition: Identify the components of the sentence (Subject, Helping Verb, Verb+ing, Determiner, Object).
2. Schema Retrieval (SVO): Access the English syntactic rule for declarative sentences (Subject + Verb + Object).
3. Continuous Tense Alignment: Correctly place the helping verb "is" before the present participle "reading."
4. Article Placement: Place "a" before the noun "book" rather than before the verb or at the start of the sentence.
5. Linear Execution: Transcription of the words without omitting any of the five components.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules"
1. L1 Transfer Bug (Hindi Word Order): Arranging words as Subject-Object-Verb (He a book reading is) because Hindi follows SOV.
2. Nominal Predicate Bug: "He book reading a is" or "Reading a book he is" (treating "is" as a sentence-final marker like "hai" in Hindi).
3. Determiner Displacement: Placing "a" at the end of the sentence or before the verb ("He is a reading book") due to a lack of understanding of its function as an adjective/article.
4. Capitalization/Punctuation Neglect: Though the rubric focuses on SVO, students may lose marks or focus if they cannot identify the starting word (often the one with a capital letter, but here none are provided).

Step 3: Population considerations
1. Open-ended vs. Multiple Choice: Without the scaffold of options, students cannot use "recognition" to eliminate incorrect patterns.
2. English Language Proficiency: In Hindi-medium, low-SES contexts, "is reading" (Present Continuous) is a frequent site of fossilized errors (e.g., omitting "is").
3. Working Memory: Processing five distinct units into a foreign syntax is a high-load task for Grade 6 learners with limited exposure.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the sentence is semantically simple, the conflict between Hindi SOV and English SVO syntax creates a high probability of structural "bugs."
