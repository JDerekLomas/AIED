Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the specific literary text ("The Squirrel" by Mildred Bowers Armstrong).
2. Lexical retrieval: Isolate the specific vocabulary word "tail" within the stored memory of the poem.
3. Identify the figurative imagery associated with that noun (metaphor/simile of a "question mark").
4. Translate the mental image into a written English sentence or phrase.
5. Apply English syntax and spelling to communicate the descriptive attribute accurately according to the rubric.

Step 2: Common "buggy rules" (Systematic procedural errors)
1. **Keyword Match-mismatch:** Students may find the word "tail" but associate it with the wrong adjective (e.g., "grey" or "furry") because they prioritize literal sensory descriptions over the specific figurative one taught in the curriculum.
2. **Schema-driven Substitution:** Students replace the poem's specific imagery with their real-world knowledge of squirrels (e.g., "it is bushy," "it is long") rather than extracting the information from the text.
3. **Translation Gap:** Students may remember the shape but only know the term in Hindi (*prashna chinnh*), failing to bridge the English vocabulary for "question mark."
4. **Graphological/Syntax Bug:** Forgetting the possessive or the required noun-adjective relationship, resulting in unintelligible English fragments that fail the rubric’s requirement for accuracy.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Memory Decay:** Grade 7 students often struggle with open-ended recall of poetry imagery unless the poem was recently rehearsed.
2. **ESL Constraints:** Limited English proficiency makes producing the abstract noun phrase "question mark" significantly harder than selecting it in a multiple-choice format.
3. **Economic/Resource Factors:** In under-resourced schools, there is often an emphasis on rote memorization; if the specific "question mark" phrase wasn't rote-learned, the student's ability to "describe" in a second language is severely limited.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
The item requires both high-level retrieval of a specific literary metaphor and the linguistic ability to encode that metaphor in English. Given the demographic (low-income, Hindi-medium transition, ESL), the "bug" of substituting literal descriptions for the poetic one, and the difficulty of open-ended recall versus recognition, a significant portion of the cohort will likely provide a literal description (bushy, soft, grey) or fail to retrieve the specific English phrase "question mark."
