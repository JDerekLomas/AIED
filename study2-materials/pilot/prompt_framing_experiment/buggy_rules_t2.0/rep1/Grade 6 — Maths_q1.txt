Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall the definition of "factor" (the concept of divisibility).
2. Systematic searching/testing for divisibility (1 to $\sqrt{n}$): testing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
3. Execution of mental or written long division for each test (68 ÷ 2, 68 ÷ 4, etc.).
4. Identifying pairs ($1 \times 68, 2 \times 34, 4 \times 17$).
5. Final list compilation, ensuring no omissions or addition of non-factors (multiples).

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- Confusion between Factors and Multiples: Listing 68, 136, 204...
- Partial Listing/Premature Stop: Stopping after finding (1, 2, 4) and assuming there are no more, or forgetting 1 and 68.
- Multiplication/Division Slip: Mistaking $17 \times 3$ or $17 \times 4$ results due to poor mastery of tables beyond 12.
- Odd Factor Blindness: Overlooking 17 because 68 is even; students often focus on dividing by small primes (2, 3, 5).
- Language Trigger: Hindi-medium students may translate "factors" to "गुणनखंड" (Gunankhand), but English phrasing in an English-instruction context can cause conceptual retrieval failure.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 6 students at this socioeconomic level often have "shaky foundations" in multiplication tables beyond 10x10.
- Identifying 17 as a factor of 68 is a high-order task for this cohort, as 17 is a larger prime not commonly found in memorized basic arithmetic.
- The open-ended format requires retrieval and exhaustive searching, which is significantly harder than a multiple-choice "Which of these is a factor?" question.

Step 4: Final Estimate
Considering the requirement for 100% accuracy to earn the single mark, the likelihood of missing the number 17 or 34 is extremely high for this specific population.
