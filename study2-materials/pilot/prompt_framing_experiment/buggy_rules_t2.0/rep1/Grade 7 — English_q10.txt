To analyze this item through the lens of systematic procedural errors (bugs):

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. **Clause Linkage:** Identify the reporting verb and introduce the subordinator "that" (or handle the transition from comma/quotation marks).
2. **Pronominal Shift:** Identify the speaker ("She") and map the first-person pronoun "I" to the third-person "she" (Deictic center shift).
3. **Tense Backshifting:** Identify the reporting verb tense (Past) and apply the sequence of tense rule, shifting "am reading" (Present Continuous) to "was reading" (Past Continuous).
4. **Syntactic Integration:** Remove quotation marks and maintain word order without creating a "double-anchor" (keeping both present and past elements).

**Step 2: Systematic "Bugs" (Errors)**
*   **The "Static Pronoun" Bug:** Retaining the original pronoun ("She said that I was reading...") because the student treats the quoted text as a rigid block.
*   **The "Tense Persistence" Bug:** Failing to backshift ("She said that she is reading...") due to the psychological "now" of the action described.
*   **The "Double Marker" Bug:** Keeping the comma or quotation marks while adding "that."
*   **The "Copula Omission" Bug:** In Hindi-English transfer, students may omit the auxiliary verb ("She said she reading...") or misuse "was" (e.g., using "were" for singular "she").

**Step 3: Student Population Context**
For Grade 7 students in Indian government schools (often "Low-Stakes/High-Barrier" English learners), this is a high-load task. Unlike multiple-choice questions (recognition), this requires production (recall). In many Hindi-medium contexts, direct-to-indirect speech is taught as a series of abstract transformation rules that are frequently conflated. The pronominal shift "I $\rightarrow$ she" and the tense shift "am $\rightarrow$ was" represent two distinct failure points that must both be navigated perfectly for a score of 1.

**Step 4: Holistic Estimate**
Given that a failure in *any* of the three primary sub-procedures results in a score of 0, and considering the compounding effect of the "Tense Persistence" and "Static Pronoun" bugs common at this developmental stage:
