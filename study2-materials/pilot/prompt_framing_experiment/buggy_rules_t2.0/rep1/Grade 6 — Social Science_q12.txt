Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic decoding: Understand that "lions" refers to the specific imagery on currency (recall/recognition of the symbol).
2. Historical/Fact retrieval: Retrieve the specific origin of the symbol (The Lion Capital of Ashoka at Sarnath).
3. Symbolic linking: Connect the image to its political/official function (The National Emblem of India).
4. Translation/Composition: Express these two distinct facts in English (or the required language of instruction) using causative syntax ("They are shown because...").

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. Over-generalization of Purpose: Students may assume the lion is there to show "bravery," "strength," or "the king of the forest" rather than historical lineage (Social-Realism bug).
2. Name Confusion: Attributing the symbol to a different ruler (e.g., Akbar or Gandhi) or a general "ancient India" era without specificity.
3. Categorical Slip: Identifying it as the "National Animal" (the Tiger) instead of the National Emblem.
4. Recall-to-Recognition failure: Without a word bank or multiple-choice cues, the student may recall the image but fail to retrieve the technical terms "Ashoka" or "Emblem."

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 6 is the transitional year for Civics/History. In Indian government schools, especially those with limited English proficiency, students often rely on rote memorization. An open-ended "Explain" question requires both the historical fact and the nomenclature. While many students recognize the lion, correctly identifying the Sarnath connection and the term "National Emblem" in a non-native language presents a high cognitive barrier.
