Step 1: Specific Procedural Steps
1. Comprehension: Translate/decode the English prompt "Imagine you are a bird."
2. Perspective-Taking (Deicteic Shifting): Adopt the first-person ("I") instead of describing a bird ("It/The bird").
3. Content Generation: Retrieve a bird-specific verb (fly, chirp, eat) from long-term memory.
4. Syntax Assembly: Formulate a Subject + Verb + (Object/Adjunct) structure in English.
5. Morphological Encoding: Apply subject-verb agreement and correct tense (usually present or past).
6. Orthographic Execution: Apply capitalization and terminal punctuation (full stop).

Step 2: Identified "Buggy Rules"
1. Third-Person Default: Instead of "I am flying," the student writes "Bird is flying" (Failure to map "Imagine you are" to first-person pronoun).
2. Code-Switching/Hinglish Substitution: Writing the sentence in Hindi or using Hindi nouns with English verbs (e.g., "Main sky mein ud raha hoon").
3. Subject-Verb Mis-agreement: "I flies high" (Generalizing the "s" suffix to all singular subjects).
4. Omission of Auxiliary/Copula: "I flying in sky" (Transferring L1 grammar where the "am" is omitted or placed differently).
5. Translation Overextension: Translating the prompt literally instead of answering it (e.g., "Imagine bird one sentence").

Step 3: Target Population Constraints
1. Low English Exposure: Limited vocabulary makes "bird" and "sentence" accessible, but "imagine" and "perspective" are high-level abstract tasks.
2. Recall vs. Recognition: The lack of a word bank or template increases cognitive load exponentially for L2 learners.
3. Transliteration Errors: Students often think in Hindi and translate word-for-word, leading to incorrect syntax.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the prompt is simple, the combination of perspective-shifting (math equivalent of a word problem transformation), grammatical synthesis, and vocabulary retrieval creates a high probability of at least one "bug" (e.g., missing "am," third-person usage, or spelling failures). Given the strict rubric ("grammatically correct"), minor "bugs" common in this demographic will result in a 0.
