To analyze this item through the lens of systematic procedural errors and mathematical cognition models, we must deconstruct the cognitive load required to achieve the full score.

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. **Semantic Decoding:** Decoding the academic vocabulary (e.g., "significance," "reign," "aspects") across a language barrier (English proficiency).
2. **Knowledge Retrieval:** Accessing the schema for the Maurya Empire/Ashoka from long-term memory.
3. **Filtering/Categorization:** Distinguishing between biographical facts (Kalinga War) and "significance" (systemic impact/transformation of kingship).
4. **Structural Synthesis:** Organizing the recall into a coherent causal statement (Point A led to Change B).
5. **Output Verification:** Ensuring at least two distinct "aspects" are mapped to the rubric’s requirement for "overall impact."

**Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)**
*   **The "Narrative Default" Bug:** Instead of explaining *significance*, the student provides a chronological narrative (e.g., "He fought a war, he saw blood, he became sad").
*   **The "Keyword Trigger" Bug:** Students see "Ashoka" and "history" and dump all stored facts regardless of the prompt’s specific constraint (e.g., mentioning he was Chandragupta’s grandson).
*   **The "Isolated Fact" Bug:** Providing two facts without the connecting tissue that explains their historical significance (missing the "So what?" required by the rubric).
*   **The "Linguistic Substitution" Bug:** Because "reign" and "significance" are high-register Tier 2/3 words, students from limited English backgrounds often misinterpret the prompt as simply "Who was Ashoka?"

**Step 3: Population Considerations**
In Grade 7 Indian government school contexts, Social Science is often taught via rote memorization of "Question-Answer" pairs. Open-ended synthesis questions are difficult for students used to recognition-based tasks (MCQs) or direct recall. The linguistic gap (Hindi to English) acts as a high-pass filter that excludes students who understand the concept but cannot articulate the "significance" using the required academic syntax.

**Step 4: Holistic Estimate**
The mismatch between the high cognitive demand of "explaining significance" and the systemic reliance on rote memorization, compounded by the language barrier, suggests a low success rate for the "fully correct" response (as defined by the rubric's requirement for transformation/impact).
