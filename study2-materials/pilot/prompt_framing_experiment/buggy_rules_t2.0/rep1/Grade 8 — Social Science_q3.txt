Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decipher the English prompt and identify "factor" as a causative element and "soil formation" as the central geological process.
2. Access the long-term memory schema for "Geography - Resources and Development" (NCERT Grade 8, Chapter 2).
3. Select one of the five specific technical terms from the list (Parent Rock, Relief, Climate, Time, Organism).
4. Translate the internal conceptual understanding into the correct English nomenclature.
5. Transcribe the term onto the answer sheet.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. Semantic Over-generalization: Confounding "factors that influence soil formation" with "types of soil" (e.g., answering "Alluvial" or "Black Soil").
2. Contextual Misalignment: Answering with factors that cause soil erosion (e.g., "Wind" or "Running water") instead of formation, due to the word "soil" triggering a general "soil problems" schema.
3. Vernacular Interference: Mapping the Hindi concept "Chattan" (Rock) to "Stone" or "Mountain," which may be marked wrong if the rubric is strictly technical.
4. Nominal Error: Remembering the concept but using vague terminology (e.g., "Weather" instead of "Climate," or "Plants" instead of "Flora/Organisms").

Step 3: Target population considerations
The "Parent Rock" and "Relief" concepts are cognitively abstract for many students. For English Language Learners (ELLs) from EWS backgrounds, the term "influence" is often a high-frequency distractor/barrier in reading comprehension. However, the NCERT curriculum emphasizes this specific list repeatedly, making it a high-utility rote-memorization item.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the question is "simple," the shift from Hindi medium to English medium in Grade 8 and the tendency to confuse "formation factors" with "soil types" or "erosion agents" significantly degrades performance in open-ended recall compared to multiple-choice.
