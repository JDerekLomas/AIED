Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Visual Pattern Recognition: Identify the relationship between the given angle ($80^\circ$) and $x$ (Vertically Opposite Angles).
2. Justification (Procedural): State the geometric property correctly.
3. Solve for $x$: Equate $x = 80^\circ$ (Direct identification).
4. Linear Pair Recognition: Identify that $x$ and $y$ (or $y$ and $180-80$) form a linear pair/supplementary relationship on a straight line.
5. Algebraic Execution: Set up the equation $x + y = 180^\circ$.
6. Subtraction: Calculate $180 - 80$ to find $y = 100^\circ$.

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
- "Corresponding Confusion": Treating $x$ and $80$ as supplementary instead of equal because they "look" like they should add up to a round number.
- "Variable Substitution Error": Finding $x$ correctly but failing to use the value of $x$ to find $y$.
- "Subtraction Bug": Borrowing errors when calculating $180 - 80$, or "Small-from-Large" errors if different numbers were involved.
- "Definition Mixing": Using "linear pair" to describe vertically opposite angles due to English language interference/term confusion.
- "Visual Bias": Estimating the angle based on the "acuteness" or "obtuseness" of the drawing rather than applying theorems.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Hindi-English Language Gap: The student might know the concept in Hindi (शीर्षाभिमुख कोण) but fail to "state the reason" in English as per the rubric requirements.
- Open-ended Format: No options (MCQs) are provided to trigger recognition; the student must recall the 180-degree property and the "Vertically Opposite" rule from scratch.
- Socio-economic Factors: Limited access to remedial support and potential gaps in geometry foundation from lower grades.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that the rubric requires both the correct numerical answer and the "reason and calculation," the threshold for a full mark is high. Many students will likely find $x = 80^\circ$ but fail to provide the written justification or perform the subsequent step for $y$ accurately.
