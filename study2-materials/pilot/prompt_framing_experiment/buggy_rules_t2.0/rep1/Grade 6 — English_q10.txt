Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decipher the English sentence structure (S-V-C) and identify the sentence as declarative/affirmative rather than interrogative or negative.
2. Recall the grammatical rule for quantifiers: "some" is generally used for affirmative statements, while "any" is used for questions and negatives.
3. Identify "apples" as a plural countable noun to ensure compatibility (though both words work here, this is part of the cognitive check).
4. Map the selected rule to the provided parenthetical options.
5. Select and record the chosen word.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" (Cognitive errors)
1. **The "Sound" Rule:** Students often choose based on what "sounds right" based on fragmented exposure. Since "any" is frequently taught in early-level caution sentences (e.g., "Do you have any...?"), students may over-generalize it to all plural contexts.
2. **Negative Priming:** In Hindi-medium backgrounds, the distinction between "some" and "any" does not map 1:1 to Hindi (where "kuch" can serve both roles). Students may treat "any" as a generic plural marker.
3. **The Indeterminacy Bug:** Thinking "any" applies whenever the exact number of objects is unknown/not specified.
4. **Binary Swap:** Misremembering the rule and associating "some" with questions and "any" with statements.

Step 3: Target population considerations
- Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often have high "word-gap" issues and limited naturalistic exposure to English outside the classroom.
- Rote memorization of grammar rules without functional application leads to high error rates when the rule isn't perfectly recalled.
- "Some/Any" is a notorious "stumbling block" concept in English as a Second Language (ESL) curricula.
