Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Semantic Decoding:** Interpret the English keywords "colonial rule," "tribal communities," and "distinct examples" despite limited English proficiency.
2. **Knowledge Retrieval:** Recall specific historical facts regarding 19th-century British policy (e.g., Forest Acts, Jhum cultivation bans, or the moneylender system).
3. **Causal Reasoning:** Link a specific British policy to a specific life-impact (e.g., forest laws leading to loss of livelihood).
4. **Synthesis and Evidence:** Formulate a coherent response that identifies the general impact while satisfying the constraint of "two distinct examples."
5. **English Translation/Output:** Translate Hindi-based mental concepts into written English sentences that satisfy the rubric requirements.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. **Generic Attribute Bias:** Providing a general "British were bad" statement without specific examples (answering the prompt but ignoring the constraint).
2. **Fact-Example Disconnect:** Providing two facts that are essentially the same (e.g., "they took land" and "they took forests") failing the "distinct" requirement.
3. **Keyword Matching Error:** Identifying "British rule" but writing about the independence movement or urban settings instead of tribal contexts.
4. **Literal Translation Glitch:** Writing "Jungle law" or "Forest people" using Hindi syntax that may obscure the logical connection for an English-medium grader.
5. **Instructional Neglect:** Providing a long list of grievances without an overarching "explanation" of the general impact, as required by the first part of the rubric.

Step 3: Target Student Population
The grade 8 level is a transition period for abstract historical reasoning. However, for EWS students in Hindi-to-English transition, the cognitive load of simultaneous historical recall and English synthesis is high. Open-ended recall is significantly harder than recognition-based tasks (MCQs), and "two distinct examples" creates multiple points of failure for a 1-mark question.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the historical content is a staple of the NCERT curriculum, the combination of English language barriers, the requirement for "distinct" examples for only one mark, and the necessity of written recall reduces the success rate significantly among the most vulnerable students.
