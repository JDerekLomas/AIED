Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Decoding and Comprehension**: Read the English text and translate the physical scenario (spoon in tea) into a mental model of thermal energy.
2.  **Domain Categorization**: Recognize this as a "Change in Heat" problem and identify the medium (solid metal/steel).
3.  **Retrieval (Terminology)**: Access the specific scientific term "Conduction" (Convection and Radiation being the distractors in the retrieval set).
4.  **Language Encoding**: Correctly spell or identify "Conduction" in English, ensuring the term isn't confused with "Conductor."
5.  **Causal Reasoning (Part b)**: Formulate an explanation involving particle-to-particle vibration or kinetic energy transfer without citing bulk movement of matter.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules" / Procedural Errors
*   **Medium-Process Mismatch**: Applying "Convection" to solids (the most common bug where students associate "liquid tea" with the transfer method, ignoring the "spoon").
*   **The "Conductor" Label Bug**: Providing the property ("It is a conductor") rather than the process ("Conduction"), a common noun-category error.
*   **The "Direct Heating" Bug**: Attributing the heat to the steam/vapor touching the handle rather than the internal transfer through the solid.
*   **Hindi-to-English Retrieval Gap**: Remembering the concept in Hindi (*Chalan*) but failing to retrieve the specific English phonemes for "Conduction," leading to phonetic inventions or leaving it blank.

Step 3: Target population considerations
*   **Low-Stakes Vocabulary**: In Hindi-medium backgrounds, technical English vocabulary often remains "dormant" (recognized but not recalled). 
*   **Score Discrepancy**: The question asks for two parts (a and b) but the rubric provided only mentions (a) and assigns a very low weight (0.5). This often signals to students that a detailed explanation is not required, potentially leading to incomplete answers.
*   **Socio-economic context**: Limited exposure to English outside of the textbook reduces the "fluency" of scientific retrieval under test pressure.
