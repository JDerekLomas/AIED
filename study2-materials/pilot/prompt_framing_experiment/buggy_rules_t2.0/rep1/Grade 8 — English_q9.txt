Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the terms "Synonym" and "Antonym" (knowing which means 'same' and which means 'opposite').
2. Recall the semantic meaning of the target word "quiet."
3. Access lexical memory to retrieve a word with a similar meaning (e.g., "silent").
4. Access lexical memory to retrieve a word with the opposite meaning (e.g., "noisy").
5. Execute the orthographic production (spelling) of both retrieved words correctly.
6. Map the correct retrieved word to the corresponding category (avoiding a "swap").

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. Category Swap: Providing an antonym in the synonym slot and vice-versa (highly common when terms are learned as a pair).
2. "Same-Sense" Bug: Providing two synonyms or two antonyms because the distinction between the Greek-root labels is not solidified.
3. Translation Gap: Understanding "quiet" in Hindi (शांत्त) but failing to retrieve the specific English Tier 2 vocabulary required for the answer.
4. Spelling Interference: Attempting a correct word like "noisy" or "silent" but failing the rubric due to phonetic spelling (e.g., "noicy").
5. Definition vs. Lexeme: Writing a phrase (e.g., "no sound") instead of a single-word synonym/antonym.

Step 3: Population Considerations
For Grade 8 students in this context, the primary hurdle is the linguistic "double shift": they must understand the metalanguage (Synonym/Antonym) which is often not used in their home environment, and then recall words without the aid of a word bank (recognition is much easier than the recall required here). "Quiet" is a familiar word, but the technical requirement of providing both a synonym and an antonym for 1 mark creates a high "all-or-nothing" threshold.
