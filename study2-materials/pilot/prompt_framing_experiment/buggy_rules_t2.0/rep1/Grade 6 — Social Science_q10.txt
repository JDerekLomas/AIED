Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the specific geographic region (Rajasthan) and distinguish it from national or other state festivals.
2. Retrieve at least two specific names of fairs/festivals associated with that region.
3. Transcribe/spell those names in English (given the English medium test format).
4. Select one of the two names and recall a specific fact regarding its "main attraction" or "significance."
5. Formulate a syntactically correct English sentence that links the specific festival to its descriptive attribute.
6. Verify the answer meets the "one sentence" constraint and contains two distinct items to satisfy the rubric.

Step 2: Identify "buggy rules"
1. **Mis-categorization of Scope:** Students frequently cite Pan-Indian festivals (Diwali, Holi) because they are celebrated in Rajasthan, failing to identify "important fairs/festivals" that define Rajasthan specifically (e.g., Pushkar Fair, Gangaur).
2. **Category Substitution:** Providing two festivals but zero fairs, or vice versa, under the assumption they are mutually exclusive or that only one category is needed.
3. **Recall-to-Recognition Mismatch:** Students can recognize "Pushkar" but fail to recall it without a prompt; they may substitute a local village fair that is not "important" in the context of the curriculum.
4. **Description Nullification:** Naming two items but skipping the "one sentence" description because the cognitive load of English sentence construction exceeds the student's current proficiency.
5. **Topic Drift:** Writing a sentence about the festival that describes its timing (e.g., "It is in March") rather than its "attraction" or "significance."

Step 3: Student population considerations
The requirement to describe a significance "in one sentence" in a non-native language (English) for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds is a significant barrier. While the recall of two names (Pushkar, Teej, Gangaur) is practiced, the articulation of significance is often a "bottleneck" step. The open-ended nature of the recall (vs. multiple choice) significantly increases the probability of omission or partial answers.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While students might know the content in Hindi, the transition to English production—coupled with the multi-part nature of the question (Recall X2 + Select + Synthesize Description)—suggests high attrition at the description stage. Furthermore, the 1-point rubric is unforgiving (it implies an all-or-nothing score, or very tight margins for partial credit, though the prompt asks for a fully correct answer estimate).
