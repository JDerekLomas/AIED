Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English terms "weeds" and "weeding" into the mental schema of *khonpa/khonp* (unwanted plants).
2. **Concept Retrieval**: Access the biological definition of weeds from long-term memory.
3. **Reasoning/Justification**: Formulate the logical causal link between weed growth and resource competition (nutrients, space, light).
4. **Encoding/Writing**: Construct a coherent English sentence that conveys both the definition and the "why" to satisfy the rubric's single-point requirement.

Step 2: Potential "Buggy Rules"
- **"Keyword-Only Rule"**: Providing the Hindi translation (*Ghaas/Kharpatwar*) without the functional definition (unwanted/competitive).
- **"Partial Requirement Bug"**: Defining weeds correctly but omitting the "why" (agricultural importance) because the rubric phrasing implies the definition is the primary metric.
- **"Synonym Error"**: Defining weeds as "small plants" or "wild plants" rather than "unwanted" plants, failing to capture the contextual agricultural definition.
- **"Language Interference"**: Grammatically incorrect sentence structure that obscures the causal relationship (e.g., "Weeds remove because important").

Step 3: Population Considerations
- **High Recall Burden**: Unlike multiple-choice questions (MCQs), this requires active retrieval and English production.
- **English Proficiency Gap**: Students may understand the concept in Hindi but fail to produce a "correct" definition in English that aligns with school rubrics.
- **Resource Deprivation**: Lack of supplemental reading often limits students to rote memorization of textbook definitions, making any deviation in question phrasing a barrier to retrieval.
