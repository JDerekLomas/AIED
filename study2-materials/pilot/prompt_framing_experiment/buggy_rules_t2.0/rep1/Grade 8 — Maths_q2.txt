**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1.  **Selection of distributive strategy:** Distributing each term of the first binomial over the second (FOIL or horizontal/vertical method).
2.  **Scalar and Variable Multiplication (4 instances):**
    *   $3a \cdot 2a = 6a^2$
    *   $3a \cdot 3b = 9ab$
    *   $-2b \cdot 2a = -4ab$
    *   $-2b \cdot 3b = -6b^2$
3.  **Signed Number Arithmetic:** Managing the negative sign attached to the $2b$ during distribution across two terms.
4.  **Identifying Like Terms:** Recognizing $9ab$ and $-4ab$ as combinable.
5.  **Simplification:** Combining coefficients $(9 - 4 = 5)$ to reach the final expression $6a^2 + 5ab - 6b^2$.

**Step 2: Known Buggy Rules**
*   **Partial Distribution:** Distributing only the first terms of each binomial (resulting in $6a^2 - 6b^2$).
*   **Variable Exponent Errors:** Adding variables instead of multiplying ($3a \cdot 2a = 6a$ or $5a^2$).
*   **Sign Slippage:** Ignoring the negative sign in the second term of the first binomial (treating $-2b$ as $+2b$).
*   **The "Freshman's Dream" Variation:** Mistaking the product of binomials for the sum or applying a squared binomial formula incorrectly.
*   **Like-Term Conflation:** Incorrectly combining non-like terms (e.g., $6a^2 + 5ab$ becoming $11a^3b$).

**Step 3: Population Considerations**
In the Indian Grade 8 context, "Product of Binomials" is a standard curriculum item. However, students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds often rely on rote memorization of algorithms. While they may be proficient at the "FOIL" mechanical motion, the combination of signed integers and literal coefficients (a, b) introduces high cognitive load. Since the rubric requires a single "correct expansion," minor sign errors or calculation slips result in zero marks. The language barrier may also affect the initial comprehension of the word "product" if the instruction is not translated.

**Step 4: Holistic Assessment**
The necessity of executing four error-prone multiplications and one signed-integer addition without a single slip makes the "1 or 0" scoring quite punishing. While the procedure is standard, the compounding probability of a single "bug" (especially the negative sign or the squared variable) significantly lowers the success rate in a non-multiple-choice format.
