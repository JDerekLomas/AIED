Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Decode Scenario:** Interpret the visual/textual data (green to dark patches over time) as a biological transformation rather than physical dirt or chemical burn.
2. **Retrieve Domain-Specific Terminology:** Access the long-term memory store for the specific biological category responsible for food spoilage (Microorganisms/Fungi/Mould).
3. **Linguistic Encoding (Translation):** Map the conceptual understanding (often held in Hindi/local language, e.g., 'Ullu' or 'Phapund') to the English terminology required by the Science curriculum.
4. **Distinguish Cause from Effect:** Correctly attribute the "cause" to the organism rather than the "condition" (e.g., moisture, heat, or "bad air") or the "process" (e.g., rotting/decay).

Step 2: Common "Buggy Rules" and Systematic Errors
1. **Effect-as-Cause Bug:** Students identify what happened (it rotted) rather than the agent (fungus).
2. **Abiotic Attribution Bug:** Identifying environmental triggers (moisture/water/humidity) as the *source* rather than the catalyst.
3. **Common Language Interference:** Using "Germs" (a catch-all term) which may not meet strict rubric criteria for microorganisms or fungi at the Grade 8 level.
4. **Visual Association Bug:** Attributing the green color to "plants" or "algae" because of color-matching logic.

Step 3: Target Student Population Considerations
1. **Language Barrier:** English-medium testing for ESL (English as a Second Language) learners creates a "bottleneck" where the science is known but the vocabulary (e.g., "mould") is unretrievable.
2. **Recall vs. Recognition:** Open-ended questions lack the scaffolding of multiple-choice options; without the "Mould" or "Fungi" cue, students often resort to descriptive daily language ("spoiled," "smelly") which may be marked incorrect in rigid scoring systems.
3. **Formal Instruction vs. Informal Experience:** While students see bread mold frequently, they may not have mapped the specific academic term "Fungi" to that everyday occurrence.
