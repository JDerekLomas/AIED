Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decipher the English prompt: Correctly interpret "contribute" and "expansion" (abstract academic vocabulary).
2. Retrieve chronological data: Link 1757 specifically to the Battle of Plassey and the transition from trade to political authority.
3. Establish causality: Move beyond describing the event to explaining the *result* (political control/dominance).
4. Synthesize concept: Connect the defeat of Siraj-ud-daulah to the mechanism of the "puppet nawab" (Mir Jafar) and the acquisition of Diwani rights or revenue control.
5. Produce English output: Construct a coherent sentence in English that aligns with the specific rubric requirements.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. Narrative over-generalization: Describing the fight itself (Who won? Who lost?) instead of addressing the "how" of power expansion.
2. Temporal displacement: Mixing up the consequences of Plassey (1757) with Buxar (1764) or general 1857 narratives.
3. Synonym substitution error: Misunderstanding "expansion" as literal geographical growth rather than the structural/political takeover described in the rubric.
4. "Keywords only" bug: Listing "Mir Jafar" or "Robert Clive" without explaining the *contribution* to British power.
5. Translation bottleneck: Reverting to Hindi-medium conceptual frameworks but failing to find the English vocabulary to articulate "political dominance" or "puppet."

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face a "threshold effect" where their historical knowledge is present, but their ability to articulate cause-and-effect in an L2 (English) is severely limited. Recall (as opposed to multiple-choice recognition) significantly lowers performance in high-poverty, English-as-additional-language settings.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
Considering the requirement to move from descriptive recall to analytical causal explanation in a second language, a significant majority of students will fail to hit the specific "political dominance/puppet nawab" nuance required by the rubric.
