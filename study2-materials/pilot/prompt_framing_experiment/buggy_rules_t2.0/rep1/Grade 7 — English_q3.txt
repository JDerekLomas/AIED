Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Decode the syntax of the prompt**: The student must navigate the "Why + [statement]" structure (which contains a common "Why + Subject + Verb" error in the prompt itself) to understand it is an inquiry into causality.
2. **Retrieve content from long-term memory**: Access the specific logic from the text (Leo Tolstoy's *Three Questions*).
3. **Identify three specific variables**: Isolate "the right time," "the right people," and "the right action" as the components of the king’s "failure-proof" plan.
4. **Construct an explanatory sentence in English**: Synthesize the "if-then" logic (If I know these three things, then I will be successful).
5. **Apply English grammatical rules**: Conjugate verbs correctly (e.g., using the past tense "knew" or "wanted" to match the prompt's frame).

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **Syntactic Overgeneralization**: Applying Hindi-English literal translation (L1 interference), resulting in "King thinking that..." or "Because king wanted..." which may be penalized depending on the strictness of the grader.
2. **Key-Word Matching Bug**: Identifying "king," "fail," and "questions" and simply copying a random sentence from the passage that contains these words without explaining the causal link.
3. **Fragment-Completion Bug**: Providing only the three things (time, people, action) without explaining *why* they lead to not failing.
4. **Conditional Logic Bug**: Struggling to articulate the abstract concept of "certainty" or "infallibility," leading to a circular argument (e.g., "He will not fail because he knows everything").

Step 3: Target population considerations
- Grade 7 students at this level often have "functional" literacy but struggle with "productive" literacy.
- In EWS/Hindi-medium contexts, the transition from decoding to independent sentence construction is a significant hurdle. 
- An open-ended recall question is significantly harder than a multiple-choice question for this cohort, as they cannot rely on recognition.
- The prompt itself is grammatically non-standard ("Why the king felt..." instead of "Why did the king feel..."), which can trigger "input-matching" bugs where the student mirrors the incorrect syntax.
