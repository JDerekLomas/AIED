Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English text and isolate the three specific constraints: Identify two monuments, select one for elaboration, and identify its specific city/location.
2. Search long-term memory for "Rajasthan" + "History" category (e.g., Amer Fort, Hawa Mahal, City Palace, Chittorgarh).
3. Verify that both chosen monuments are indeed within Rajasthan (avoiding confusion with neighboring Delhi or Agra).
4. For one monument, retrieve the specific city (e.g., identifying that Hawa Mahal is in Jaipur, not Udaipur).
5. Retrieve the specific attribute of significance (architectural features, who built it, or a specific event).
6. Encode the answer in English or mixed code within the provided space.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. **The "List Only" Bug**: Providing only the two names and omitting the location and reason for fame (cognitive overload causing the student to ignore the second sentence).
2. **The "Vicinity Confusion" Bug**: Mapping a famous monument like the Taj Mahal or Qutub Minar to Rajasthan because they are taught in the same unit of "Historical Monuments."
3. **The "Categorical Shift" Bug**: Naming a city (Jaipur) or a person (Maharana Pratap) instead of a specific monument.
4. **The "One-for-All" Bug**: Applying the location or reason to both monuments collectively or mixing the city of one with the name of the other (misaligned retrieval).
5. **The "Generic Attribution" Bug**: Providing a circular or generic reason for fame (e.g., "It is famous because it is old") which may not meet the implicit criteria of "why it is famous."

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Language Barrier**: English-language prompts often lead students with low proficiency to pick out "keywords" (e.g., "Rajasthan," "historical monuments") and ignore functional modifiers (e.g., "For one of them...").
2. **Recall vs. Recognition**: Unlike multiple-choice questions (MCQs), the open-ended format requires generative retrieval, which is significantly harder for students whose academic exposure is intermittent.
3. **Instructional Mismatch**: In many under-resourced schools, rote memorization focuses on one-to-one pairings. The compound nature of this question (naming two but describing one) exceeds the typical task-schema students are practiced in.
4. **Scoring Rigidity**: Since the maximum score is 1, any partial error (e.g., naming two monuments correctly but missing the "why") results in a score of 0, making the threshold for success very high.
