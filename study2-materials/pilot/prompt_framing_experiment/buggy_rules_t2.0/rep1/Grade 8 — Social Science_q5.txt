Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Decoding/Translation: Correct interpretation of the abstract English terminology ("biodiversity," "sustainable development," "importance").
2.  Recall of Interconnectedness: Accessing the conceptual link between biological variety and "services" (soil, air, food).
3.  Defining the Link: Explaining *why* one supports the other (not just defining the terms separately).
4.  Linguistic Synthesis: Constructing a coherent sentence in English that aligns with the specific rubric requirements (ecosystem services).

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1.  The "Term-Switching" Bug: Confusing biodiversity with generic environmentalism (pollution/trees) or climate change.
2.  The "Circular Definition" Bug: Writing "Biodiversity is important because it is sustainable for development," mimicking the prompt without adding content.
3.  The "Listing" Bug: Listing animals or plants without explaining their functional role in the ecosystem as requested by the rubric.
4.  The "Translational Bottleneck": Having the correct conceptual mental model in Hindi but being unable to bridge to the English "Ecosystem Services" technical terminology.

Step 3: Target population analysis
Grade 8 students from these backgrounds often struggle with high-lexical-density terms. "Sustainable development" is a complex, multi-layered concept. Because the rubric specifically looks for "ecosystem services"—a technical concept—the gap between general environmental awareness and the specific scientific requirement is wide. The open-ended format eliminates the possibility of "clue-hunting" from options.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the reliance on English proficiency to explain a highly abstract relationship, and the specific requirement of the "ecosystem services" link in the rubric, a significant majority will likely produce "common sense" answers (e.g., "we need plants to live") that may not meet the technical threshold of the rubric.
