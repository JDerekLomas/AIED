Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate "Goldsmith," "Zone of flame," and "Give reason" from academic English to conceptual equivalents (e.g., *Sunar*, *Jwalamukhi bhag*, *Karan*).
2. **Fact Retrieval**: Recall the structure of a flame (inner, middle, outer) and their corresponding temperature properties.
3. **Functional Application**: Match the professional requirement of a goldsmith (melting high-melting-point metals like gold/silver) with the physical property of the flame (highest heat).
4. **Identification**: Specify the "outermost" or "non-luminous" zone.
5. **Causal Explanation**: Articulate the reasoning (it is the hottest part/undergoes complete combustion) in written English or scientific Hindi.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" or cognitive errors
1. **The Visibility Bias**: Students often associate "brightness" with "heat," leading them to choose the middle (luminous/yellow) zone because it looks the "strongest" or most like a typical "fire."
2. **Center-Targeting Bug**: Heuristic that the "core" or center of a thing is its most intense part, leading to the selection of the innermost zone.
3. **Vocabulary Mismatch**: Confusing "luminous" (bright) with "non-luminous" due to the counter-intuitive nature that the invisible/blue part is hotter than the bright yellow part.
4. **Reasoning-Assertion Gap**: Providing the correct zone (luck/recognition) but failing to provide the physical reason (complete combustion/maximum temperature), which results in a 0 score under many rubrics requiring the "reason."

Step 3: Target population considerations
- Grade 8 is the transition point where abstract chemical principles (combustion) are formalized. 
- For Hindi-medium/ESL students, "Goldsmith" is an archaic English term often not used in daily conversation, creating a barrier to even understanding whose perspective they must adopt.
- Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice for students with limited English literacy.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account the counter-intuitive physics (outer is hotter), the language barrier regarding the term "Goldsmith," and the requirement for a dual-part answer (Zone + Reason) without cues:
