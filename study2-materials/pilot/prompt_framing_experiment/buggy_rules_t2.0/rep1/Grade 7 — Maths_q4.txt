Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recognize that the divisor contains a decimal.
2. Multiply both the dividend and divisor by 10 (or shift the decimal point) to create a whole-number divisor (80 ÷ 72).
3. Set up the long division or fraction reduction.
4. Execute the division: Recognize that 72 goes into 80 one time.
5. Handle the remainder: Subtract 72 from 80 to get 8, then place a decimal in the quotient and bring down a zero.
6. Recognize the repeating pattern ($1.11...$) or provide a fraction/rounded response based on classroom norms.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- **Decimal Placement Bug:** Placing the decimal point in the quotient directly above its position in the original divisor (7.2) rather than the adjusted divisor (72), resulting in $11.1$ or $0.11$.
- **Divisor/Dividend Swap:** Treating the problem as $7.2 \div 8$ because it "fits" better mentally, resulting in $0.9$.
- **Ignore the Decimal:** Simply dividing 8 by 72 or 72 by 8 and ignoring place value ($1.1$ vs $11$ vs $9$).
- **Smaller-from-Larger Subtraction:** Errors during the long division subtraction steps.
- **Rounding/Termination Bug:** Stopping at "1 remainder 8" and not knowing how to proceed with decimal expansion.

Step 3: Contextual Factors
- **Language Barrier:** While the numbers are universal, "Find the value of" may be less familiar than "Divide" or "हल करें" (Solve) for Hindi-medium students.
- **Complexity:** This item involves a whole number divided by a larger decimal value, which is counter-intuitive for students used to dividing larger integers by smaller ones.
- **Rubric Constraint:** 0.5 marks suggests a "binary" or very strict grading scale, giving no credit for partially correct reasoning if the final "value" is incorrect.

Step 4: Estimation
Given that dividing by a decimal is one of the highest-error procedures in Grade 7 arithmetic, and the dividend is smaller than the divisor's significant digits ($8 < 72$), a majority of students in this demographic will likely struggle with the multi-step adjustment required.
