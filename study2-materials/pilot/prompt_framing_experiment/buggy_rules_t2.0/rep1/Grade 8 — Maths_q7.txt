Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Understand the semantic phrasing "minimum number of chocolates required" in the context of rounding up to the next multiple (constrained by the "equal quantity" rule).
2. Execute division: 300 ÷ 80 to find the quotient and remainder.
3. Identify the shortfall (80 - 60 = 20) and add to the total (300 + 20 = 320).
4. Identify the student count per class: 80 ÷ 8 = 10 students.
5. Calculate chocolates per class: (320 ÷ 80) * 10 or 320 ÷ 8 = 40 chocolates.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. **Division bug (Remainder Dropout):** Student calculates 300 ÷ 80 = 3 and ignores the remainder, concluding 240 is the answer (rounding down instead of up).
2. **"Find the Remainder" bug:** Student interprets "minimum number required" as a request for the remainder itself (60).
3. **Lexical/English Barrier:** Students may confuse "equal quantity" with simply sharing what is available (dividing 300 by 80 and stopping at 3).
4. **Step Omission:** Completing the first part (320) but failing to execute the second part of the prompt (chocolates per class) due to cognitive load or reading fatigue.
5. **Constant Partitioning:** Dividing 300 (original) by 8 instead of 320 (calculated) for the second part.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Language:** "Minimum number... required" is linguistically complex for English-as-a-second-language learners; they often interpret this as finding a remainder or subtracting.
2. **Context:** Economically weaker section (EWS) students often have high proficiency in "street math" (sharing) but struggle with the formalizing of remainders into "next multiple" logic without scaffolding.
3. **Open-ended:** The 2-part question increases the chance of a "partial success" that yields 0 marks under a binary (1-point maximum) rubric.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
The item requires navigating a "non-standard" division word problem (finding the ceiling instead of the floor), followed by a multi-step logic chain. For a Grade 8 student in this specific demographic, the leap from the remainder (60) to the requirement (320) is a high-level inference. Most will provide "3" or "240" or "60".
