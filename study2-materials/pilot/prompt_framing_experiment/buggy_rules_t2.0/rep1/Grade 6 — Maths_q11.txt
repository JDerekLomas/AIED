Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Textual decoding and keyword mapping (mapping "maximum value" and "exact number of times" to the concept of HCF).
2. Prime factorization of 75 (recognizing 75 is divisible by 3 and 5).
3. Prime factorization of 69 (recognizing 69 is divisible by 3 and 23).
4. Identifying common factors between the two sets (the intersection of $\{3, 5, 5\}$ and $\{3, 23\}$).
5. Calculating the product of common factors (in this case, just 3).

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- Keyword Over-reliance: Students may see "maximum" and "two bags" and mistakenly apply a "greater implies Addition or Multiplication" heuristic.
- Division Bugs: Students often struggle with divisibility rules for 3; a common bug is assuming any odd number ending in 9 is prime (treating 69 as prime) or assuming it is divisible by 7 or 9.
- HCF/LCM Confusion: Systematic "operation interference" where the student executes the procedure for Least Common Multiple instead of HCF.
- Prime/Composite Error: Attempting factorization but stopping at composite numbers (e.g., $75 = 5 \times 15$ and not further reducing).

Step 3: Population Considerations
The 0.5 mark weight is extremely low for the cognitive load required (multi-step HCF), which may lead students to spend less time checking work. For ESL/Hindi-medium students, the phrase "measure... an exact number of times" is linguistically complex and not a high-frequency phrase in standard Hindi-to-English literal translations, often leading to a failure at the initial decoding stage. Prime factorization of 69 is particularly difficult for Grade 6 students because 23 is a "hidden" prime.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
Given the complexity of the prime 23, the linguistic barriers to identifying the HCF operation, and the systematic tendency for students to confuse HCF with LCM, only a small portion of the target demographic—typically those who have memorized this specific textbook example—will succeed.
