Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Retrieve magnitude product**: Identify the absolute values $|-3|$ and $|-4|$ and perform the basic multiplication $(3 \times 4)$.
2.  **Retrieve integer sign rule**: Recall the specific rule for the product of two negative numbers (negative × negative = positive).
3.  **Apply sign rule**: Attach the positive sign (or omit for standard notation) to the magnitude product.

Step 2: "Buggy rules" and systematic errors
-   **Operation Confusion (Addition Rule vs. Multiplication Rule)**: Students often use the rule for addition ("Two negatives make a larger negative") and conclude the answer is $-12$.
-   **Rule of Magnitude/Absolute Value**: Some students ignore the signs entirely, which is correct here for magnitude but coincidental, or they might think the "stronger" number's sign wins (though both are negative).
-   **Negative as Subtraction**: Treating `(-3) x (-4)` as `-3 - 4`, resulting in $-7$.
-   **Sign Oversight**: Performing the multiplication correctly but failing to account for the second negative sign, resulting in $-12$.

Step 3: Target population considerations
-   **Grade 7 Context**: This is often the year integers are formally introduced. Procedural fluency is still fragile.
-   **Recall vs. Recognition**: The open-ended format is harder than multiple-choice. Without "12" and "-12" as options to trigger memory, students are more likely to apply a faulty procedure (like $-7$ or $-1$).
-   **Language/Socio-economic context**: While arithmetic is universal, instructions in English ("Find the value of") can be a minor barrier, though the mathematical symbols are the primary stimuli. The most significant factor is the quality of foundational drilling in under-resourced schools.

Step 4: Holistic analysis
While multiplication of single digits is easy, the "negative × negative" rule is one of the most consistently swapped or confused rules in early algebra. In high-pressure or under-resourced environments, the "negative + negative = negative" rule heavily interferes with the multiplication rule.
