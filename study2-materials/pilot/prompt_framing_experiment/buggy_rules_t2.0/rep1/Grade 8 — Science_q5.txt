Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the term "Rabi" and its defining temporal attributes.
2. Retrieve the categorical association between "Wheat" and the "Rabi" category.
3. Access the conceptual link between "Rabi" and the "winter" season.
4. Correctly map the specific example (Wheat) to the correct category name (Rabi) in writing.

Step 2: Buggy rules:
- **Language Interference Bug**: Confusing the word "Wheat" with "Rice/Paddy" due to code-switching or limited English vocabulary (reversing the mapping).
- **Rhyming/Acoustic Heuristic**: Associating "Rabi" with "Rainy" because they both start with the letter 'R' (a very common phonological interference bug).
- **Phonetic Encoding Bug**: Spelling "Rabi" as "Rabi" but incorrectly associating it with the Kharif cycle because "Paddy" is more commonly discussed in rural monsoonal contexts.
- **Cycle Confusion**: Misidentifying the harvest season for the sowing season.

Step 3: Population factors:
The students are Grade 8 from EWS backgrounds. While "Wheat" (Gehun) and "Rabi" are household terms, the academic task requires formal English retrieval. "Paddy" is a specific term that often confuses students who primarily use the word "Rice" or "Dhan." The rubrics provided are binary (all or nothing for the 0.5 points), leaving no room for partial credit if they identify the season but miss the category name.
