Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic decoding of the prompt (specifically "Vedic period," "main occupation," and "describe").
2. Contextual retrieval of the Early/Later Vedic periods (as students must bridge the transition from pastoralism to agriculture).
3. Selection of one valid occupation according to the rubric.
4. Production of a descriptive sentence in English (or semi-functional English) explaining a "key aspect" (e.g., cattle as wealth, or the use of iron plows).
5. Integrating both components into a single response as required for the 1-mark credit.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. "The One-Part Trap": Providing the name of the occupation but ignoring the instruction to "Describe one key aspect," resulting in a zero-point score based on the rubric's "Describe" requirement.
2. "Period Conflation": Confusing Vedic occupations with Indus Valley (trade/urban) or modern contexts.
3. "Translation Freeze": Knowing the answer in Hindi (Pashupalan/Krishi) but lacking the English vocabulary to "describe" an aspect, leading to an empty or fragmented response.
4. "The Sole-Task Error": Identifying the secondary occupation (hunting/gathering) instead of the "main" one.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 is the entry point for more rigorous disciplinary literacy. Students from economically weaker sections often experience "limited English proficiency," which acts as a significant bottleneck for open-ended "Describe" tasks compared to multiple-choice tasks. The transition from Early (pastoral) to Later (agricultural) Vedic periods is a frequent source of cognitive interference for 11-year-olds.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the content is foundational, the multi-part nature of the question ("Identify" + "Describe") combined with the English language barrier and the shift from recognition to recall suggests a high failure rate in producing a fully correct answer.
