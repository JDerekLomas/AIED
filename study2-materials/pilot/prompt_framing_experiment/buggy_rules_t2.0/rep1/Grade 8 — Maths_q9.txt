To analyze this item through the lens of mathematical cognition and systematic errors for Grade 8 students in this specific context:

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. **Identify and Interpret Terminology:** Distinguish between Marked Price (MP), Selling Price (SP), and Cost Price (CP) within a multi-step word problem.
2. **Calculate Discounted SP:** Apply the percentage formula: $SP = MP - (Discount\% \times MP)$, or $1200 \times 0.90$.
3. **Link SP to CP via Profit:** Recognize that the SP derived in step 2 is also equal to $CP \times (1 + Profit\%)$.
4. **Isolate and Solve for CP:** Execute the algebraic division: $CP = 1080 / 1.08$.

**Step 2: Buggy Rules and Cognitive Obstacles**
*   **The "Subtract the Percent" Bug:** Students often subtract the numerical value of the percent from the price (e.g., $1200 - 10 = 1190$).
*   **Linear Addition Bug:** Assuming Profit % + Discount % = Total Margin.
*   **Base Value Confusion:** Calculating the 8% profit on the MP (1200) instead of the CP (unknown) or the SP (1080).
*   **Multi-step "Early Termination":** The rubric gives full credit for just the first half of the problem (finding SP = 1080), but a student following the prompt's final question ("What was the CP?") may fail at the more difficult second stage (inverting the profit formula).
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, terms like "Marked Price" (Ankit Mulya) and "Discount" (Chhoot/Batta) may not immediately translate in an English-medium assessment, leading to misidentification of variables.

**Step 3: Population Factors**
Grade 8 students in this demographic often rely on rote memorization of formulas. When two formulas are nested (Discount then Profit), the cognitive load increases significantly. Because the question is open-ended, there are no distractors to provide "hints" via recognition; students must generate the procedure from scratch. The transition from arithmetic thinking to algebraic "working backward" to find the CP is a common failure point in middle-school numeracy.

**Step 4: Holistic Assessment**
While the rubric is surprisingly generous (awarding a point for only completing the first half of the process), the combination of linguistic barriers, the complex mapping of "108% = 1080," and the high prevalence of base-value bugs suggests a high failure rate.
