Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the terms "autotrophic" and "heterotrophic" (mapping Greek roots *auto/hetero* to their meanings).
2. Retrieve the defining characteristic of autotrophs (internal synthesis of organic molecules from inorganic sources/sunlight).
3. Retrieve the defining characteristic of heterotrophs (dependence on external consumption).
4. Translate these biological concepts into English/scientific academic language.
5. Formulate a comparative structure (differentiation).
6. Recall and provide a taxonomically accurate example for autotrophs (e.g., green plants).
7. Recall and provide a taxonomically accurate example for heterotrophs (e.g., humans, animals).

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules" / Cognitive errors
1. **The Over-generalization Bug:** "Plants are autotrophs because they stay in one place, animals move."
2. **The Lexical Confusion Bug:** Mixing up "auto" and "hetero" prefixes (recalling the concept but swapping the labels).
3. **The Simple Consumption Bug:** Defining heterotrophs as "things that eat food" but failing to specify the *source* as other organisms.
4. **The Example-only Bug:** Providing examples (Lion/Rose) instead of the required conceptual differentiation (often happens due to linguistic barriers in English).
5. **The Spelling/Transcription Bug:** Students know the concept in Hindi (Swapo-shi/Parpo-shi) but cannot reliably produce the English academic terms.

Step 3: Population considerations
The 1-point rubric is highly "all-or-nothing" despite requiring four distinct pieces of information (two definitions, two examples). Grade 7 students in EWS/Hindi-medium contexts often struggle with the transition to abstract biological Greek-root terminology. While "autotroph" is a foundational term, the English "Differentiate between" is a higher-order cognitive task compared to a simple definition or fill-in-the-blank.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
Given that the student must hit four criteria (definition A, definition B, example A, example B) without swapping labels or reverting to colloquialisms, and doing so in a second language, the "error surface" is high.
