Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Concept Identification: Recall that turmeric and hibiscus extract act as pH indicators.
2. Preparation/Application: Create a solution or indicator paper with the powder and extract (or apply them directly to the unknown liquid).
3. Execution/Test: Add the unknown liquid to both indicators (or vice-versa) to observe color changes.
4. Interpretation (Acid): Correctly recall that turmeric stays yellow/does not change and hibiscus turns dark pink/magenta.
5. Interpretation (Base): Correctly recall that turmeric turns red and hibiscus turns green.
6. Communication: Synthesize these procedural steps and color observations into a coherent English sentence.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
- "All indicators turn red in acid": Students often generalize that acid = red (likely due to Litmus) and assume all indicators follow this.
- "Mixing Bug": Mixing turmeric and hibiscus together first before adding to the liquid, thinking indicators "work better" when combined.
- "Base-only bias": Associating "indicators" only with "Base" detection (specifically turmeric turning red) and failing to define the acid test.
- "Language-Swapping": Confusing "red" with "pink" or "orange" in translation, or using "change" vs "no change" incorrectly.

Step 3: Student Population & Format
- Recall vs. Recognition: This is an open-ended "How" question. Students must retrieve facts from memory rather than choosing from options.
- Language Barrier: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle to structure the conditional "If [Action], then [Color]" syntax in English.
- Concept Overload: Hibiscus and turmeric have different color scales; memorizing the specific results for both for both conditions (acid and base) without a mnemonic leads to high interference.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
The item requires multi-step retrieval (two different indicators) and complex conditional logic. For a 7th grader in a resource-constrained environment with a language barrier, the probability of error in either the chemical "map" (colors) or the linguistic "map" (writing the explanation) is very high.
