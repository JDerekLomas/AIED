Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Decode linguistic cues:** Translate the English term "adaptations" into the conceptual equivalent in Hindi (*anukoolan*) and identify the specific context (*marusthali paudhe*).
2. **Retrieve domain-specific knowledge:** Access mental schemata regarding specific physical features (stems, leaves, roots) of cacti or other desert flora.
3. **Map function to feature:** Connect a structural feature (e.g., "thorns") to its physiological purpose ("saving water" or "protection").
4. **Construct semantic output:** Synthesize the retrieved fact into a coherent English or bilingual sentence that satisfies the "Explain" command (moving beyond mere labeling).

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **The Label-is-Explanation Bug:** Students provide a one-word noun (e.g., "Cactus" or "Thorns") believing the identification of an object constitutes an explanation of its adaptation.
2. **Reverse Causality/Teleological Bug:** Stating that the plant "chose" to change (e.g., "Plant decided to not have leaves") rather than describing a structural trait.
3. **Generic "Healthy" Bug:** Attributing survival to general factors (e.g., "It gets sun") rather than desert-specific adaptations.
4. **The Synonym Trap:** Translating "adaptations" as "changes" and describing a plant moving or changing shape in real-time rather than evolutionary/structural traits.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 is a transitional year where students move from environmental studies to formal science. For students from EWS backgrounds in Indian government schools, the shift from "recognition" (multiple choice) to "recall and explain" (open-ended) is a significant hurdle. Limited English proficiency often results in "frozen phrases" (memorized definitions) that break down if the student forgets a single key word. The "1-mark" constraint often leads students to be overly brief, failing the rubric's requirement to describe the *how* or *why*.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account the linguistic barrier of the word "adaptations" and the procedural difficulty of constructing a functional explanation in a second language:
