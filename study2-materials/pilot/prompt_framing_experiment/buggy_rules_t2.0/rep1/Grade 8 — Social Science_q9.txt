Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Decoding and Translation:** Access the mental lexicon to translate "Parliament" (Sansad), "Necessary" (Zaroori), and "Democracy" (Loktantra) from English to the primary language of thought.
2.  **Concept Retrieval:** Recall the functions of Parliament from memory (Law-making, representation, accountability) rather than recognizing them from a list.
3.  **Synthesis:** Connect the concept of "People’s Will" to the functional structure of the "Parliament."
4.  **Language Encoding:** Formulate an English sentence that grammatically conveys a causal relationship (e.g., "Because it makes laws" or "People choose it").
5.  **Output Alignment:** Ensure the written response matches the specific criteria in the rubric (Legislate or Represent).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1.  **Semantic Blur:** Confounding "Democracy" with "Independence/Freedom" (e.g., "It is necessary because we are free").
2.  **Functional Overgeneralization:** Attributing the role of the Executive to the Legislature (e.g., "Parliament builds roads and helps the poor").
3.  **The "Keyword Trigger" Bug:** Identifying "Democracy" and writing a rehearsed but irrelevant definition (e.g., "Democracy is of the people, by the people").
4.  **Syntax Barrier:** Ability to recall the concept in Hindi but failing to construct a valid English sentence, leading to incoherent fragments.
5.  **Role Confusion:** Attributing the "representative" role only to the Prime Minister or President rather than the institution.

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 8 students in this context face a "double burden": they are transitioning to higher-order civic concepts (abstract institutions) while simultaneously navigating a language barrier. The open-ended format is significantly more difficult than a multiple-choice question because it requires active recall and structural synthesis under linguistic constraints. For many, the lack of exposure to "functioning" democratic spaces in daily life makes these concepts feel purely academic.
