Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the specific sequence of the "rock cycle" (transitioning from igneous to sedimentary).
2. Recall/Associate "igneous" with "solid rock" and "sedimentary" with "particles."
3. Identify the causal process of breakdown (Weathering/Erosion).
4. Identify the causal process of accumulation/compaction (Deposition/Lithification).
5. Translate these geological concepts from native Hindi conceptual understanding into English prose.
6. Construct a causal "if-then" sentence structure to meet the "Explain" command.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. "The Linear Cycle Bug": Believing rocks only change in one direction (e.g., magma → igneous → sedimentary → metamorphic) rather than a cycle.
2. "Category Confusion": Confusing the names of the rocks (treating sedimentary as the starting point and igneous as the result).
3. "The Magical Transformation Bug": Explaining that one rock "turns into" another without specifying a physical process (omitting weathering/erosion).
4. "Pressure-Heat Bias": Applying "High pressure/High heat" (the process for metamorphic rocks) to all rock transformations regardless of the type.
5. "Linguistic Approximation Bug": Using "Breaking" or "Dusting" instead of the academic term "Sediment/Weathering," which may not satisfy rigid rubrics.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 7 students in this demographic often struggle with "Explain" prompts compared to "Define" prompts. The linguistic barrier is significant; students often understand that rocks "break," but the procedural recall of the specific sequence required by the rubric (Igneous → Sediment → Transport → Sedimentary) is high-order. In a Hindi-medium context, "igneous" (आग्नेय) and "sedimentary" (अवसादी) are distinct, and switching to English often results in cognitive overload where the student knows the science but cannot retrieve the English vocabulary for the rubric.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account that this is an open-ended recall question (no word bank), requires multi-step causality, and involves high English-language cognitive load for this specific population:
