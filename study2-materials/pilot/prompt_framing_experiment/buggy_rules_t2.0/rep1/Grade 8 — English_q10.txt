Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Identify the adjective/adverb that follows "very" (weak).
2. Substitute the intensifier "very" with the adverb "too."
3. Identify the infinitive action in the second sentence (walk).
4. Remove the redundant subject and modal negation (He cannot).
5. Insert the marker "to" before the base verb to create the "too [adjective] to [verb]" structure.
6. Synthesize the components into a single coherent sentence without doubling the negative (avoiding "too...not to").

Step 2: Common "buggy rules" (Systematic procedural errors)
1. **Redundant Negative Bug:** Retaining the negative particle from the second sentence (e.g., "He is too weak to not walk" or "He is too weak to cannot walk").
2. **Double Subject Bug:** Failing to delete the second pronoun (e.g., "He is too weak he to walk").
3. **Connectivity Bug:** Using "that" instead of "to," confusing the rule with "so...that" constructions (e.g., "He is too weak that he cannot walk").
4. **Tense/Inflection Bug:** Retaining markers on the verb (e.g., "too weak to walks" or "too weak to walking").
5. **Intensifier Misplacement:** Keeping "very" alongside "too" (e.g., "He is too very weak to walk").

Step 3: Population considerations
Students in Grade 8 from low-resource, Hindi-medium backgrounds often face a "transition gap." The "too...to" construction is idiomatic and lacks a direct word-for-word syntactic parallel in Hindi (which uses *itna...ki* similar to *so...that*). Because the item is open-ended (recall) rather than multiple-choice (recognition), students cannot rely on visual cues to eliminate buggy versions. Linguistic interference (L1 to L2) significantly increases the likelihood of the "Redundant Negative Bug."
