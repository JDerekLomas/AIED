Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English question ("What," "three questions," "king").
2. Retrieve the specific narrative schema from the text *Three Questions* by Leo Tolstoy.
3. Access long-term memory to isolate three distinct variables (Time, People, Action).
4. Translate mental concepts (likely stored in L1/Hindi) into L3 (English) syntax.
5. Synthesize three separate clauses into a single grammatical sentence structure.
6. Map retrieved information against the strict three-part rubric.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. **Keyword-Matching Bug:** Students search the text for "king" and "questions" and copy the entire introductory paragraph instead of distilling the specific answers.
2. **Cardinality Neglect:** Listing only one or two items instead of all three, triggered by the cognitive load of English composition.
3. **Concept Blurring:** Merging "right people" and "right time" into a generic "everything at the right time," losing the specific categories required by the rubric.
4. **L1 Interference (Syntax Bug):** Attempting to translate "Kaun sa samay" directly, leading to "Which time king want?" which may be penalized by strict graders despite semantic proximity.
5. **Surface-Level Recall:** Remembering the story involves a hermit and a king but failing to retrieve the philosophical abstract nouns required (time/people/occupation).

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Language Barrier:** English-medium testing for Hindi-medium background students often results in "silent failure," where the student knows the story but cannot bridge the expressive gap.
2. **Open-Ended vs. MCQ:** Without "recognition" cues, the generative demand is high. Students often revert to copying large chunks of text (The "Copying-until-it-fits" strategy).
3. **Strict Rubric:** The rubric requires all three components; missing one (the "people" or "work") results in zero marks in many rigid grading systems.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that this is a "recall" task in a foreign language requiring three distinct points of data, a significant majority will struggle with the cognitive load of simultaneously managing English grammar and specific content retrieval.
