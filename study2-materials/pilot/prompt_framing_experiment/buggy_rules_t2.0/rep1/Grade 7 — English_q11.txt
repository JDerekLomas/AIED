Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object-Adverbial).
2. Recall the definition of "adjective" (a word describing a noun).
3. Identify the nouns in the sentence (bird, nest, balcony).
4. Evaluate potential modifiers for these nouns.
5. Select the specific word "tiny" as the modifier for "bird."
6. Provide the answer in written format.

Step 2: Systematic procedural errors ("Buggy Rules")
1. **Definition Overgeneralization:** Identifying any word that comes before a noun as an adjective (e.g., identifying "a" or "its" as the adjective).
2. **Noun-as-Modifier Error:** Selecting "balcony" or "nest" as the adjective because they provide "extra information" about the setting.
3. **Position Bias:** Assuming the adjective must be the first word of the sentence or immediately adjacent to the verb.
4. **Adverbial Confusion:** Identifying "in our balcony" as the descriptive element because it provides visual detail, despite it being a prepositional phrase.
5. **Language Transfer Interference:** Applying Hindi syntax rules where adjectives might be processed differently or confused with possessive markers.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Concept-Rubric Mismatch:** The question asks for an "adjective phrase" (typically "a tiny bird" or a multi-word phrase), but the rubric only accepts the single word "tiny." This "bug" in the test design will cause higher-performing students who actually understand phrases to be marked wrong, while students with a lower-level "single word" schema will be marked correct.
2. **ESL/English Proficiency:** Students may know the concept in Hindi (विशेषण) but fail to map the English label "adjective" to the correct word category.
3. **Recall vs. Recognition:** Without a multiple-choice list, students must correctly spell and isolate the word.
