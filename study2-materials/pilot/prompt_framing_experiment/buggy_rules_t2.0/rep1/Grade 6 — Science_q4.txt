Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English question into conceptual meaning (Summer = Garmi; Cotton = Suti; Preference = Choice).
2. **Contextual Retrieval**: Recall the specific physical sensation of wearing cotton in heat vs. synthetic fibers.
3. **Scientific Mapping**: Link the sensation (dryness/coolness) to a specific material property (absorption/porosity).
4. **Encoding/Articulation**: Formulate a response in English that accurately names the property (using terms like "absorb," "sweat," or "pores").

Step 2: Common "Buggy Rules" / Systematic errors
1. **The "Utility for Property" Bug**: Describing what the material *does* for the person instead of a *property* of the material (e.g., "Cotton makes us feel cool" – this misses the "Explain... by describing one property" constraint).
2. **The "Inverted Causality" Bug**: Reversing the relationship (e.g., "Cotton creates water to cool the body").
3. **The "Common Word" Substitution**: Using non-scientific synonyms that may not meet rubric criteria (e.g., "Cotton is thin" or "Cotton is soft").
4. **Vocabulary-Retrieval Gap**: Understanding why cotton is better but lacking the English term "absorb" or "porous," leading to an empty or fragmented response.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with open-ended science questions in English. While they may intuitively know the answer ("pasiina sokhta hai"), the jump from "It sucks sweat" to a formal property like "Good absorber of water" is high. In EWS contexts, rote memorization often replaces conceptual articulation, and any variation in phrasing from the textbook may trigger an inability to construct the sentence.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that this is an open-ended recall task (not MCQ) requiring both English proficiency and the identification of a specific "property" (a formal scientific concept), many students will likely provide descriptive but non-scientific answers or struggle to translate their intuition into the required format.
