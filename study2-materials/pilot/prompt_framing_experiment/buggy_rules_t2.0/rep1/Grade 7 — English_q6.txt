Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the meta-linguistic command "Describes the poet's writing style" from English to L1 (Hindi/regional) to understand that a characteristic—not a plot summary—is required.
2. **Abstract Categorization**: Move from the literal meaning of the poem to the abstract concept of "style" (the *how* vs. the *what*).
3. **Lexical Retrieval**: Recall specific English adjectives related to literary analysis (e.g., "simple," "formal") from long-term memory.
4. **Vocabulary Mapping**: Match the tone/structure of the poem to the retrieved adjective correctly.
5. **Syntactic Encoding**: Output the word in a way that fulfills the question’s prompt.

Step 2: "Buggy rules" and systematic errors
*   **Topic-Style Confusion (Bug)**: Students describe what the poem is *about* (the theme/noun) instead of *how* it is written (the adjective). E.g., if the poem is about a tree, the student writes "Nature."
*   **The "Story" Heuristic (Bug)**: Applying narrative conventions to poetic analysis; describing the poet as "a good man" or the poem as "a story."
*   **The "Positive Value" Bias (Bug)**: Selecting a generic positive adjective like "good," "nice," or "beautiful" because they lack the specific vocabulary of "style."
*   **Keyword Extraction Failure**: Repeating words found within the poem text itself rather than an external descriptor of the text's properties.
*   **Translation-Error Loop**: Translating "style" to a Hindi synonym that may imply "fashion" or "way of doing," leading to irrelevant responses.

Step 3: Student Population & Format
Grade 7 students in this context are at a developmental stage where abstract literary criticism is just beginning. In an open-ended recall format (as opposed to multiple-choice), students cannot rely on elimination or recognition. Given the English proficiency barriers and the move from concrete to abstract reasoning, the cognitive load is significantly high.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
The gap between the simplicity of the rubric (1 mark for a single word) and the complexity of the "meta-cognitive" demand (analyzing style) is wide. Most students will likely respond with a thematic noun or a generic "good/bad" evaluation rather than a stylistic adjective.
