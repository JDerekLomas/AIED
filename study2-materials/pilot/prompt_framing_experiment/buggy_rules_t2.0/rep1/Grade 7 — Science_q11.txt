Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Scan the table to identify the variable "Time Taken" across three categories (A, B, C).
2. Quantitatively compare the values in the "Time" column to identify the minimum value (shortest time).
3. Coordinate the concept of "fastest" with the numerical value of "lowest time" (an inverse relationship).
4. Identify the corresponding Liquid label (Liquid A or Petrol) associated with that minimum value.
5. Translate the identified category into a written response in English.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. Magnitude Bug: Interpreting "Fastest" as "Largest Number." Students may look for the maximum value (e.g., 2 hours for Salt Solution) because "more time = bigger = faster."
2. Nominal-Value Confusion: Ignoring the numerical data and selecting the most familiar substance (e.g., Water) or the one perceived as "strongest."
3. Labeling Error: Misaligning the row/column, providing the name of the time instead of the liquid name.
4. Linguistic Interference: In Hindi-medium contexts, the concept of "fast" (tezz) is often associated with intensity or higher magnitude, reinforcing the selection of the highest number.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 7 students from EWS backgrounds often struggle with English-medium word problems involving data interpretation. While the comparison of numbers (e.g., 5 min vs 20 min vs 120 min) is procedurally simple, the conceptual inversion (Fast = Small) is a significant cognitive hurdle in early science education. Furthermore, the shift from "identifying" to "writing" (even if brief) can lead to non-responses among low-literacy students.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the "magnitude bug" (selecting the highest number) and the language barrier regarding the term "evaporate" vs. "time taken," many students will likely select Liquid C as the "fastest" because it has the "most" time.
