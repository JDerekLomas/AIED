Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English prompt and identify the semantic constraint ("My favorite season").
2. Retrieve the English vocabulary word corresponding to a specific season (Winter, Summer, Monsoon/Rainy, Spring).
3. Transcribe/spell the target season correctly.
4. Distinguish the season name from related weather concepts (e.g., writing "rain" instead of "monsoon" or "cold" instead of "winter").
5. Write the response in a way that allows the evaluator to identify the "named" season, even if the surrounding sentences (about food/clothes) are grammatically weak.

Step 2: Systematic procedural "bugs"
1. Translation Loop Bug: Thinking of the season in Hindi (e.g., "Sardi") but being unable to map it to the English equivalent ("Winter"), resulting in a blank or a Hindi transliteration.
2. Category-Property Confusion: Substituting the property for the name (e.g., "I like Cold" or "I like Rain" instead of naming the season).
3. Semantic Narrowing: Identifying only a month (e.g., "June") or a holiday instead of a season.
4. Over-simplification/Gist error: Providing a list of items (mango, ice cream) but omitting the actual name of the season required for the 1 mark.

Step 3: Target population analysis
Grade 6 students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds often have "low-stakes" exposure to English. While "My favorite season" is a classic pedagogical trope, the requirement to produce the name via recall (rather than selecting from a list) is a high cognitive load for students with limited lexical fluency. However, the rubric is extremely generous (only 1 mark for naming the season, regardless of the paragraph quality). This disconnect—a high-demand task (writing a paragraph) paired with a low-demand rubric (naming one word)—means many students who fail the paragraph may still trigger the 1 mark if they manage to produce the specific keyword.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Despite the difficulty of writing a full paragraph, the 1-mark requirement is purely nomenclatural. Most students in Grade 6 will have memorized at least one season name ("Summer" or "Winter") even if they cannot construct the supporting 6-8 lines of syntax correctly.
