Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Identification: Identify the subject (the wind), verb (blew), and object (the leaves) in the active sentence.
2. Transposition: Move the object (the leaves) to the subject position and the subject (the wind) to the agent position (by the wind).
3. Tense Identification: Recognize "blew" as Past Simple.
4. Auxiliary Selection: Select the correct form of "to be" matching the new subject's number (plural) and the original tense (past) -> "were".
5. Participle Conversion: Recall the irregular past participle of "blow" -> "blown".
6. Syntactic Assembly: Integrate the particle "away" correctly within the new verb phrase.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. Object-Subject Confusion: Using "The wind" as the subject again.
2. Subject-Verb Agreement Bug: Using "was" instead of "were" because "the wind" (singular) is still fresh in working memory, or treating "leaves" as a collective singular.
3. Over-generalization of "-ed": Producing "blowed" instead of the irregular "blown."
4. Tense Shifting Bug: Treating voice change like reported speech and shifting to Past Perfect ("had been blown").
5. Preposition Omission: Dropping "away" or misplacing it ("The leaves were blown by the wind away").
6. Auxiliary Omission: Writing "The leaves blown away..." (Common in EL2 learners).

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students from Hindi-medium backgrounds face significant "surface feature" interference. In Hindi, passive structures are often used differently or use the auxiliary "jaana" (to go), which does not map directly to English. Limited English proficiency increases the likelihood of "blowed" (morphological bug) and "was" (agreement bug). Since it is a recall task (open-ended) rather than a recognition task (multiple choice), students cannot rely on visual cues to correct their "bugs."

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the sentence is short, the combination of an irregular verb (blew/blown), a plural subject (leaves), and the phrasal particle (away) creates multiple failure points for a student still mastering the foundational "Be + Past Participle" syntax.
