Step 1: List the specific procedural steps:
1. Identify the process (Decomposition/Composting) occurring in the pit.
2. Observe and describe the physical change (waste turns into manure/dark humus-like substance).
3. Explain the mechanism (Action of microorganisms/bacteria/fungi breaking down organic matter).
4. Connect the process to soil health (Increase in nutrients/fertility/water retention).
5. Formulate a multi-part argument in English, moving from observation to evaluation.

Step 2: Identify "buggy rules" or systematic errors:
1. **The "Disappearance" Bug:** Belief that matter simply "rots away" or vanishes, failing to account for the transformation into manure.
2. **Language Mapping Bug:** Substituting precise scientific terms (Decomposition/Nutrients) with vague descriptors (Dirty/Bad smell/Cleaning) due to English language barriers.
3. **Teleological Bug:** Stating it is beneficial because "it helps plants grow" without identifying *why* (nutrient recycling), missing the evaluation criteria.
4. **All-Waste-is-Equal Bug:** Failure to distinguish between biodegradable (collected) and non-biodegradable waste in a broader environmental context.

Step 3: Consider target population:
Grade 8 students from this demographic often have the conceptual knowledge of "Khad" (manure) but struggle with the multi-clause English construction required for an open-ended "evaluate" prompt. The lack of scaffolding (compared to a Multiple Choice Question) significantly increases cognitive load. The extremely low rubric weight (0.5 marks) compared to the complexity of the "give reasons and evaluate" command may also lead students to provide incomplete, one-sentence answers.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
