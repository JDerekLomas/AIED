Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Decoding/Translation: Correctly translate "differentiate," "living/non-living," and "characteristics" from English to functional Hindi equivalents.
2.  Recall of Semantic Knowledge: Access stored facts from the "Characteristics of Living Beings" chapter (respiration, movement, growth, etc.).
3.  Mapping and Sorting: Attribute specific traits to the correct category (Living vs. Non-Living).
4.  Linguistic Output: Construct sentences in English or hybrid "Hinglish" that communicate a valid distinction (as per the rubric requiring "key characteristics").
5.  Comparative Formatting: Structuring the response to show difference rather than just listing facts about one category.

Step 2: Systematic procedural errors ("Buggy rules")
1.  Attribute Over-extension: Categorizing non-living things as "living" if they show one proxy of life (e.g., "Clouds are living because they grow/move"; "Fans are living because they move").
2.  False Dichotomy: Assigning a trait to living things but failing to realize the non-living version doesn't "not do it" in the way expected (e.g., saying "Living things move" but ignoring that cars move).
3.  Term-Confusion: Confusing "living" with "natural" (e.g., labeling sun/water as living).
4.  Surface-level Mapping: Using synonymous traits (Breathing and Respiring) as two "different" characteristics.
5.  Response Inhibition: Providing only one characteristic instead of the two requested due to cognitive load in translating English instructions.

Step 3: Target student population analysis
Sixth graders in these settings often possess the conceptual knowledge (life vs. non-life) but struggle with the "Differentiate" command in a second language. The open-ended recall format is significantly harder than multiple-choice for students with limited English literacy. Furthermore, the 0.5-mark maximum for two characteristics suggests a high-stakes/low-reward precision requirement that often penalizes students who lack technical vocabulary despite having the underlying concept.

Step 4: Final estimate
While the core concept is foundational, the combination of a foreign language prompt, the "bug" of misidentifying moving non-living objects as living, and the requirement for four distinct pieces of information (two for each) for a very small point value typically results in high error rates in systemic assessments.
