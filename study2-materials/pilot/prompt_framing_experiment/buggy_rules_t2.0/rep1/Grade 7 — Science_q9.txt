Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Semantic Mapping**: Decipher the English phrase "special mode of nutrition" and map it to the conceptual category of heterotrophic/specialized nutrition.
2.  **Retrieval**: Access the specific scientific term "insectivorous" (or "carnivorous") from long-term memory.
3.  **Spelling/Production**: Encode the retrieved term into written English.
4.  **Logical Reasoning**: Synthesize the "paradox" (green/photosynthetic vs. trapping insects) to explain nitrogen deficiency in soil.
5.  **Relational Retrieval**: Identify a different species (e.g., Venus flytrap) to provide a second example.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
*   **The "Function Over Label" Bug**: Describing *how* it eats (e.g., "it eats insects") instead of providing the "mode" name (insectivorous) as required by the rubric.
*   **The "Photosynthesis Priority" Bug**: Believing that because a plant is green, it cannot have another mode of nutrition, leading to a "cannot compute" error for part (b).
*   **The "Vague Category" Bug**: Providing "Heterotrophic" (too broad) or "Parasitic" (misidentifying the type of specialized nutrition).
*   **Vocabulary-Retrieval Interference**: Confusing "insectivorous" with "herbivorous" or "omnivorous" due to phonetic similarity.
*   **Syntax-Translation Bug**: Misinterpreting "Why does it still need..." as "How does it...", leading to a description of the trap rather than the reason (nitrogen).

Step 3: Population Considerations
*   **Language Barrier**: "Mode of nutrition" is academic jargon that Hindi-medium students often struggle to translate if not explicitly rote-memorized in English.
*   **Open-ended Demand**: Recall is significantly harder than recognition (MCQ). Students might know the concept in Hindi ("कीटभक्षी") but fail the English production.
*   **Complex Synthesis**: Part (b) requires a multi-clause explanation (nitrogen-poor soil) which is a high-cognitive load task for EWS students with limited English support.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept of the pitcher plant is a "classic" Science lesson, the multi-part requirement—combined with the necessity of producing specific academic English terminology—presents a high barrier. Many students will give partial or descriptive answers that fail the "mode of nutrition" naming requirement or fail to explain the nitrogen aspect correctly.
