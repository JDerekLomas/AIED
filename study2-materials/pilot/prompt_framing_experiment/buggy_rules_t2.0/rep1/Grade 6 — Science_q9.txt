Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the English sentence structure "Why are X called Y?", necessitating an understanding of the relationship between nutrient categories and their functions.
2. Retrieve the specific definition of "protective foods" from semantic memory (connecting vitamins/minerals to disease prevention/immunity).
3. Recall two distinct examples: one specific Vitamin-Deficiency pair (e.g., Vitamin A - Night Blindness) and one Mineral-Deficiency pair (e.g., Iron - Anaemia).
4. Distinguish between the categories "Vitamin" and "Mineral" to ensure the examples are not both from the same category.
5. Translate internal conceptual understanding into a written English response.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- The "Lumping" Bug: Grouping all micronutrients together and failing to distinguish between vitamins and minerals when naming deficiencies (e.g., providing two vitamins).
- The "Positive Association" Bug: Stating what the nutrient *does* (strengthens bones) instead of naming the *disease* (Rickets), or confusing a "symptom" with a "disease name."
- The "Functional Fixation" Bug: Defining "protective" as physical protection (like skin or calcium for bones) rather than immunological protection.
- Linguistic "Code-Switching" Failure: The student knows the concept in Hindi ("bimariyon se ladna") but lacks the English vocabulary ("immunity," "prevention," "deficiency") to satisfy the rubric.

Step 3: Student Population Context
Grade 6 is a transitional year where students move from general observation to technical classification. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, an open-ended English-medium question creates a "double burden" of content retrieval and linguistic encoding. While "protective foods" is a rote-memorized term in many Indian curricula, the multi-part nature of the question (Explanation + Vitamin example + Mineral example) increases the "surface area" for a procedural slip, and the 1-point rubric is often unforgiving (all-or-nothing).
