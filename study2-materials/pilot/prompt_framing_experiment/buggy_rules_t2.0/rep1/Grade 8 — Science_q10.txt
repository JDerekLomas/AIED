Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the specific sequence of operations: Heating followed by sudden/rapid cooling.
2. Recall the specific medium (milk).
3. Connect the process to the intended outcome (killing microbes/preservation).
4. Translate internal understanding into English sentences (as per the medium of instruction).

Step 2: Common "buggy rules" / systematic errors
1. Order Inversion: Suggesting cooling happens before heating or simultaneously.
2. Conceptual Conflation: Conflating "Pasteurization" with "Boiling" (the bug is assuming standard boiling until evaporation/thickening).
3. The "Boiling Bug": Stating milk must be boiled for a long duration rather than the "flash" heating method (high temp, short time).
4. Omission of the Cooling Phase: Treating the process as merely a heating ritual and neglecting the necessity of rapid cooling for thermal shock.
5. Vocabulary Displacement: Using local terms or "boiling" (ubalna) which lacks the specific technical distinction required for "pasteurization."

Step 3: Student population considerations
1. Grade 8 transition: Students are moving from concrete observations to technical definitions.
2. Language barrier: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle to articulate the two-part procedural nature of the definition in English, often losing the "rapid cooling" step in translation.
3. Resource constraints: Lack of lab demonstrations or visual aids in low-resource settings makes this a rote-memorization task rather than a conceptual one.
4. Rubric leniency vs. Recall: While the rubric is lenient on numbers, the open-ended nature requires active recall of a three-part sequence (Heat -> Cold -> Result).

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is common in Indian NCERT textbooks, the requirement to explain both the "process" (two steps) and the "purpose" (preservation) in a second language for students from disadvantaged backgrounds creates significant "step-omission" bugs.
