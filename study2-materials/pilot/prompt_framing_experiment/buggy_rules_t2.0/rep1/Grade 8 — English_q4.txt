Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of the phrase "a light wind" in the prompt.
2. Skim/scan the provided reading passage to locate potential synonyms.
3. Discriminate between related terms in the text (e.g., distinguishing "breeze" from "storm," "gale," or "air").
4. Map the identified word from the text back to the definition provided.
5. Transcribe the word "breeze" accurately onto the answer sheet.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. **Keyword Match Error:** Students look for the word "light" or "wind" in the text and extract the word immediately preceding or following it, regardless of meaning.
2. **Contextual Guessing:** Students provide a word they know (e.g., "air," "fan," or "cool") that fits the general theme of the passage but is not present in the text.
3. **Literal Translation Bug:** For Hindi-medium students, they may translate "light wind" to *hawa* (air) and then attempt to find the English word for *hawa* rather than seeking the specific synonym "breeze" in the text.
4. **Copying Error:** Identifying the word "breeze" but misspelling it (e.g., "breage," "breze") in a way that the rubric might reject.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often struggle with vocabulary-specific "find-the-word" tasks because they require active scanning and lexical retrieval rather than passive recognition (multiple choice). Limited English proficiency (LEP) significantly narrows the "mental lexicon" available to match synonyms. If the word "breeze" is not already in their productive vocabulary, the cognitive load of the search task increases exponentially.

Step 4: Holistic estimation
While the task is a standard comprehension item, the combination of specific synonym retrieval, the requirement to extract it from a passage (open-ended), and the English-Hindi language gap for a technical atmospheric term suggests a high error rate.
