Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Decoding/Translation: The student must translate the English technical terms ("Equality," "Guaranteed," "Constitution") into a conceptual understanding (likely in Hindi/Bilingual thought process).
2.  Recall: Retrieve the constitutional definition of equality (e.g., Article 14, "everyone is equal before the law").
3.  Application/Synthesis: Bridge an abstract legal principle with a concrete, observable scenario from their environment.
4.  Communication/Encoding: Express this relationship in English (the medium of examination) using appropriate syntax.

Step 2: Systematic procedural "bugs"
1.  Keyword-Matching Bug: Providing a definition of a related but different civic term (e.g., "Democracy" or "Right to Vote") because it is stored in the same mental "Civics" schema.
2.  Concrete-only Bug: Providing a specific example (e.g., "everyone eats together") without linking it to a legal or constitutional framework, though the rubric's "OR" clause helps mitigate this.
3.  Language-interference Bug: Translating "Equality" too narrowly (e.g., as "everyone being the same" rather than "equal treatment under law").
4.  Scaffolding Collapse: Identifying a violation of equality (e.g., "discrimination at a well") rather than the *concept as guaranteed* (the protection/right).

Step 3: Population factors
1.  Recall vs. Recognition: This is a high-demand recall task. Grade 7 students often struggle to retrieve specific constitutional phrasing without multiple-choice cues.
2.  Medium of Instruction: Students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds often face a "literacy-gap" where they understand the concept intuitively but cannot produce the written English required to secure the point.
3.  The Rubric: The "OR" structure (Concept OR Example) significantly lowers the barrier for a 1-point award, as a simple anecdote (e.g., "waiting in a line for a vote") is sufficient even without the legal theory.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is central to the curriculum, the requirement for written English expression in an open-ended format for EWS/Hindi-medium transition students typically leads to high omission rates or incoherent responses. However, the generous "OR" rubric allows for "Street-level" knowledge (the example) to carry students through.
