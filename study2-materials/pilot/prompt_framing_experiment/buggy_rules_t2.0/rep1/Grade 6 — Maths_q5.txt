To analyze the cognitive demands of this item for a Grade 6 student from a low-income, Hindi-medium background, we break it down as follows:

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1.  **Linguistic Decoding:** Translating English terms "sum," "difference," "smallest," and "largest" into mathematical operations, while simultaneously understanding the definition of a "5-digit palindrome."
2.  **Number Construction (Smallest):** Identifying that a 5-digit number cannot start with 0, hence $1\textunderscore\textunderscore\textunderscore 1$. Filling the middle digits with zeros to ensure it is the "smallest," resulting in $10,001$.
3.  **Number Construction (Largest):** Identifying the largest single digit is 9, resulting in $99,999$ (all 5-digit numbers ending and starting with the same digits are palindromes, but the largest uses all 9s).
4.  **Arithmetic Execution (Sum):** Correctly adding $10,001 + 99,999$ with multiple carries.
5.  **Secondary Execution (Difference):** Though not required for the specific rubric point, the question asks for the "difference" ($99,999 - 10,001$), creating a dual-task demand.

**Step 2: Buggy Rules and Misconceptions**
*   **The "Same-Digit" Bug:** Students often confuse "palindrome" with "repetition of the same digit" (e.g., $11,111$). 
*   **0-as-Start Bug:** Constructing $00,000$ or $01,010$ as the smallest 5-digit number.
*   **The "n+1" Digit Error:** Students may provide 10,000 (smallest 5-digit) or 9,999 (largest 4-digit) because the constraint "palindrome" is overwritten by the more familiar "smallest 5-digit" rote-learned fact.
*   **Carry-Over Forgetting:** Failing to carry the 1 multiple times when adding $9+1$.
*   **Linguistic Barrier:** In many Indian government schools, "palindrome" is a high-level vocabulary word not commonly found in vernacular-to-English transitional instruction.

**Step 3: Target Population Analysis**
Grade 6 students in economically weaker sections often experience "Matthew Effects" in literacy. If the word "palindrome" was not explicitly drilled in the week prior, the success rate drops significantly. Furthermore, the rubric only rewards the sum ($110,000$), but the prompt asks for two separate tasks (sum and difference). Students often stop after the first calculation or provide both, risking a mistake in the specific one required by the rubric.

**Step 4: Holistic Estimate**
The requirement to construct two specific numbers based on a geometric/pattern property (palindromes) and then perform multi-step addition makes this a high-difficulty item. For this demographic, the vocabulary "palindrome" is the primary gatekeeper, followed by the "carrying" mechanics of the addition.
