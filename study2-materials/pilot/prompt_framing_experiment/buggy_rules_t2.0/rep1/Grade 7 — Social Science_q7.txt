Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Decoding complex verbs:** Correctly interpret "Analyze" and "Evaluate" as prompts for multi-dimensional reasoning rather than simple identification.
2.  **Semantic Translation:** Map the English terms "economic development" and "digital money" to known concepts, potentially translating from Hindi mental models.
3.  **Knowledge Retrieval (Role of Money):** Recall specific functions (medium of exchange, store of value) and link them to macro concepts (trade, investment, growth).
4.  **Knowledge Retrieval (Digital Money):** Recall current trends (UPI, net banking, mobile wallets).
5.  **Critical Synthesis:** Formulate an argument evaluating the "use" (pros/cons or impact) of digital currency.
6.  **Syntactic Construction:** Output the thoughts in coherent English sentences as required by the medium of instruction.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1.  **"Keyword Matching" Bug:** Identifying the word "money" and writing a general definition or a personal anecdote about having no money, ignoring "economic development."
2.  **"Procedural Replacement" Bug:** Substituting the difficult command "Analyze/Evaluate" with the simpler "Define/List" (e.g., just listing types of coins).
3.  **"Language Scaffolding" Bug:** Writing phrases in "Hinglish" or using grammatically incorrect structures that obscure the logic required by the rubric.
4.  **"Recency/Concrete Bias":** Focusing entirely on the ATM or local shop transactions while failing to link it to the abstract "economic development."

Step 3: Population Considerations
- **High Linguistic Barrier:** The gap between conversational English and academic verbs ("Evaluate") is massive for ESL students in EWS contexts.
- **Abstract Leap:** Grade 7 students are developmentally transitioning from concrete to formal operational thought; "economic development" is highly abstract.
- **High Stakes/Single Mark:** The cognitive load of a two-part complex prompt for only 1 mark often leads to student fatigue or under-effort.
