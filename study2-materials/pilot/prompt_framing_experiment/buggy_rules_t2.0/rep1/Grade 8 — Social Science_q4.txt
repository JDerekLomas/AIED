Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Decoding/Translation: Correctly translate the academic English vocabulary ("primary," "role," "system") into internal conceptual meaning (likely in Hindi/local language).
2.  Retrieval: Access the schema for "Panchayati Raj" from long-term memory.
3.  Differentiation: Distinguish the specific function of the local level from Central or State government functions.
4.  Conceptual Mapping: Identify "local self-governance" or "village development" as the central/defining feature rather than peripheral features (e.g., elections or judicial power).
5.  Encoding: Express the abstract concept back into English or a coherent written response.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1.  Attribute Substitution: Substituting a specific visible entity for an abstract role (e.g., "The Sarpanch" or "Building roads" instead of "Self-governance").
2.  Category Conflation: Equating the Panchayati Raj solely with "Voting" or "Democracy" broadly, failing to specify the "local/village" tier.
3.  Linguistic Scaffolding Error: Understanding the concept but being unable to formulate the phrase "local self-governance" or "grassroots level" in English, leading to an incomplete or unintelligible answer.
4.  Formal Overgeneralization: Assigning all government roles (e.g., "making laws for the country") to any mentioned governing body.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1.  English Proficiency: The distance between "primary role" and "local self-governance" is high for ESL/Hindi-medium learners; recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice recognition.
2.  Conceptual Abstractness: "Self-governance" is an abstract social science term that is difficult to reproduce compared to concrete examples (e.g., "water," "roads").
3.  Environment: Large class sizes often lead to rote memorization of keywords, which might be "village" but may lack the "governance" framework required by the rubric.

Step 4: Estimate
The gap between recognizing the word "Panchayat" and correctly articulating its "primary role" in an open-ended format is wide for this demographic. While students will recognize the topic, the combination of linguistic barriers and the precision required for the rubric will likely result in a majority of partially correct but technically incomplete or conceptually "buggy" responses.
