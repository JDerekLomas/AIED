Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Decode Lexicon:** Understand specific vocabulary words ("stunted," "yellowing," "infer," "evidence").
2. **Translate Observation to Physiological Need:** Connect "stunted growth" to a lack of building materials (minerals) and "yellowing" to a lack of sunlight or nutrients (nitrogen/magnesium).
3. **Synthesis of Inference:** Identify the cause-effect relationship where physical symptoms signify a deficit in external inputs.
4. **Draft Response in English:** Formulate a sentence structure in a non-native language to explain the causal link.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **Keyword-to-Schema Mapping Error:** Interpreting "plant needs" as an instruction to list the four basic needs (Water, Air, Sunlight, Soil) rather than selecting the specific deficiency indicated by the evidence.
2. **Tautological Reasoning:** Answering "The plant is not growing well" (restating the symptom as the cause).
3. **Translation Displacement:** Misunderstanding "stunted" as "stopped" or "dried," leading to an inference of only water deficiency (the most common mental model for plant failure in this demographic).
4. **Syntactic Collapse:** Knowing the answer (nutrients) but being unable to formulate the English explanation, leading to a blank or fragmented response.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds often have "common sense" knowledge of agriculture but lack the academic English vocabulary required for "infer" and "evidence." The open-ended nature requires active recall of the word "nutrients" or "minerals," which is linguistically harder than "water" or "sun." The heavy reliance on specific academic English in the prompt acts as a barrier to demonstrating underlying scientific conceptualization.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account that "Water" is a valid rubric answer (which is a high-frequency guess) but "inferring" and "evidence" are high-level academic prompts that often result in cognitive overload for this specific demographic:
