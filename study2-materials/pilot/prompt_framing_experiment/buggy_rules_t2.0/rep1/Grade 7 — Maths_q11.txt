To analyze the cognitive demands of this item:

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. Identify and draw perpendicular axes (X for classes, Y for number of students).
2. Label axes appropriately (titles and categories).
3. Determine a suitable scale based on the data range (e.g., 10, 20, or 25).
4. Map data values to coordinate points on the Y-axis.
5. Draw bars of consistent width and equal spacing.
6. Interpret the visual data to identify the highest and lowest values (Part B).

**Step 2: "Buggy Rules" and Systematic Errors**
*   **Inconsistent Scale (Scaling Bug):** Changing the interval value mid-axis (e.g., jumping from 0 to 100, then using intervals of 10).
*   **Origin Displacement:** Starting the first numerical value at the origin (0) rather than at the first unit mark.
*   **The "Categorical-as-Numerical" Bug:** Treating the classes (numbers 1-6 or labels) as quantitative values to be plotted on both axes rather than independent categories.
*   **Baseline Misalignment:** Drawing bars that do not start at the X-axis (zero-line).
*   **Reading Accuracy:** Errors in rounding values to fit a self-chosen scale.

**Step 3: Population Factors**
Grade 7 students from these backgrounds often face a "dual-burden." Language proficiency may hinder the interpretation of "appropriate scale," a high-order command. While identifying the maximum/minimum (Part B) is cognitively simpler, the rubric for Part A requires precision in representation. In economically weaker sections (EWS) schools, access to graph paper is often inconsistent; drawing graphs on plain or lined paper significantly increases the probability of measurement and scaling errors.

**Step 4: Holistic Analysis**
While identifying the "max" and "min" is a high-success task, the requirement for a "fully correct" answer according to the rubric—specifically selecting a consistent scale and correctly labeling both axes—is a high bar. The transition from arithmetic to representational geometry in Grade 7 is a frequent site of student struggle.
