Step 1: List the specific procedural steps a student must execute correctly.
1. Recall the conceptual definition of "archaeological sources" (physical/material remains).
2. Recall the conceptual definition of "literary sources" (written/textual records).
3. Synthesize these into a comparative format (differentiation).
4. Recall a specific, valid example for archaeological sources.
5. Recall a specific, valid example for literary sources.
6. Translate these internal concepts into English sentences that satisfy the rubric requirements.

Step 2: Identify known "buggy rules" (systematic procedural errors).
1. "Categorical Collapse": Treating all history sources as a single category, providing two examples of any kind without distinguishing the type.
2. "Language Mirroring": Writing the same generic definition for both because the student knows they are "old things" (e.g., "Arch source is old," "Lit source is old").
3. "Example-as-Definition": Providing an example in place of a definition (e.g., "Archaeological is coins") without explaining what the category represents.
4. "The Bilingual Lag": Understanding the concept in Hindi (पुरातात्विक/साहित्यिक) but being unable to map those to the English terms provided in the prompt.
5. "One-Sided Completion": Defining one type correctly but ignoring the second half of the comparison.

Step 3: Consider the target student population.
Grade 6 is a transitional year where students move from general observation to formal classification. In Indian government schools, "Literary" and "Archaeological" are high-syllable, academic English words that often lack phonetic cues for non-native speakers. Because the item is open-ended (recall) rather than multiple-choice (recognition), the barrier of active retrieval is significantly higher.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate.
Given the 1-point rubric (all or nothing) and the requirement for four distinct pieces of information (two definitions + two examples) across a language barrier, the probability of failure at any single node is high.
