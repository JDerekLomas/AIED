Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Decode the English text:** Convert the written symbols of the question into semantic meaning, identifying the interrogative ("What") and the subject/verb relationship.
2. **Retrieve/Locate information:** If from a passage, scan the text for keywords "Riya" and "evening" to locate the specific detail. If from memory (recall), search the mental model of the story.
3. **Parse Tense and Aspect:** Recognize "did... love" as a past tense inquiry requiring a corresponding transformation in the response (subject + loved).
4. **Formulate a syntactic response:** Select a phrase or sentence that aligns with the rubric's required content ("read books").
5. **Transliterate/Translate thought to text:** Bridge the gap between their primary language (Hindi) and English syntax while maintaining correct spelling.

Step 2: Systematic procedural errors ("Buggy rules")
1. **The Keyword Match Bug:** Students look for any sentence containing "Riya" and copy the entire sentence, regardless of whether it answers "what she loved to do" or simply describes her actions.
2. **The "Did" Retention Bug:** Constructing a sentence as "Riya did love to..." or "Riya love to..." (failing to inflect the verb "loved" because the "did" in the question is misunderstood as a placeholder rather than an auxiliary indicating past tense).
3. **The Hindi-to-English Word Order Bug:** Mentally translating from Hindi (Subject-Object-Verb) which can lead to fragmented or unintelligible English phrasing.
4. **The Spelling Phonetics Bug:** Spelling "read" as "reed" or "story" as "is-tory" based on local phonetic pronunciations common in Hindi-medium backgrounds.
5. **The Information Omission Bug:** Writing only "Evening" or "Riya" because they identify the keywords in the question but cannot formulate the action.

Step 3: Target population analysis
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often have significant gaps in English exposure. In Hindi-medium contexts, English is often taught as a set of rules rather than a communicative tool. The "open-ended" nature of the task is significantly harder than a Multiple Choice Question (MCQ), as it requires productive rather than receptive language skills. While the rubric is lenient (accepting "read books"), the barrier is not just knowing the answer, but the "procedural hurdle" of writing it in English without losing the meaning.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Considering the cumulative probability of failure at the decoding, retrieval, and syntax formation stages—compounded by the transition from Hindi to English medium—only a segment of the class will successfully navigate all procedural steps without triggering a "bug."
