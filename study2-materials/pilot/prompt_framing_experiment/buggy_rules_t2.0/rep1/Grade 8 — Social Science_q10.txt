Step 1: List procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the complex English sentence structure (relative clauses) into a mental representation of the task.
2. **Concept Retrieval**: Recall specific historical information regarding the 17th-18th century transition of the British East India Company.
3. **Procedural Execution**: Select the specific starting point required by the rubric (origin as traders) and map the chronological transition.
4. **Output Composition**: Formulate a written response in English that matches the semantic requirements of the rubric.

Step 2: Identify systematic "buggy rules"
1. **Keyword Overgeneralization**: Students see "East India Company" and "rulers" and write a rote-learned fact (e.g., "The British won the Battle of Plassey") instead of addressing the specific transformation process requested.
2. **Language Switching/Interference**: Attempting to translate "Vyapari" (traders) or "Karkhana" (factories) into English but using incorrect terms or abandoning the sentence due to lexical gaps.
3. **Constraint Ignore (Topic Drift)**: Starting the answer about trade but immediately drifting into a list of grievances against the British or descriptions of modern India.
4. **Premature Termination**: Mentioning only the end state (becoming rulers) while omitting the initial state (traders) required by the 1-point rubric.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
The population faces a "double burden": Grade 8 cognitive transition to cause-and-effect reasoning, compounded by a linguistic barrier. In a government school setting with Hindi-medium backgrounds, an open-ended English-language question acts as a test of English proficiency as much as a test of historical knowledge. Since the rubric specifically requires mentioning they "arrived as traders," students who jump straight to the "conflict" phase (a common focus in rote-memorized notes) will fail despite having the "correct" general knowledge.

Step 4: Estimated proportion of students producing a fully correct answer
