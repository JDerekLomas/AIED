Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Capitalize the first letter of the first word ("riya" → "Riya").
2. Recognize "meena" as a proper noun and capitalize it ("meena" → "Meena").
3. Recognize "sunday" as a proper noun/day of the week and capitalize it ("sunday" → "Sunday").
4. Maintain correct spelling and spacing of all intermediate words.
5. Identify the end of the declarative sentence and add a period/full stop (".").

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. **Sentence-initial-only capitalization:** Applying the rule "sentences start with a capital" but failing to recognize mid-sentence proper nouns.
2. **Proper noun blindness (Meena):** Students may recognize Western names as proper nouns in textbooks but treat local names as common nouns in English transcription.
3. **Phonetic mapping (Riya/Meena):** For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the focus remains on spelling (e.g., using "i" vs "ee"); they may prioritize orthographic accuracy over punctuation.
4. **The "Sunday" Exception:** Treating days of the week as common objects (like "market") rather than proper nouns.
5. **Full stop omission:** Viewing the task as "correcting letters" rather than "ending a sentence," common in L2 learners who don't see the period as a functional part of the meaning.

Step 3: Population/Context considerations
Grade 6 students from EWS backgrounds in Indian government schools often struggle with "functional English" versus "rote English." While they may know these rules in isolation, the cognitive load of applying four distinct punctuation/capitalization rules in a single sentence is high. In an open-ended format (recall) without multiple-choice cues, the probability of missing at least one element (especially "Meena" or "Sunday") is very high.

Step 4: Holistic estimation
This item is "multi-hazard." To get the 1 mark, the student must be 100% accurate. A student who misses even one of the four changes receives 0. In this demographic, "Sunday" and the full stop are the most frequent points of failure.
