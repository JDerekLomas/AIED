Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Calculate the elapsed time between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm (converting 12-hour clock cycles or counting hours).
2. Calculate the total temperature change by multiplying the elapsed time (6 hours) by the rate of increase (2°C/hour).
3. Add the total temperature increase (12°C) to the initial temperature (30°C) to find the final result (42°C).

Step 2: Potential "Buggy Rules" / Systematic Errors
1. Elapsed Time Calculation (The "Subtraction Bug"): Students may subtract 4 from 10 to get 6 by accident, but many will struggle with the 12-hour transition. A common bug is $4 - 10 = 6$ (treating it as an absolute difference) or $10 - 4 = 6$, arriving at the correct hour by flawed logic.
2. 12-hour Clock Reset Bug: Students may fail to account for the transition past 12:00, leading them to calculate 4 hours (from 12 to 4) or 2 hours (10 to 12).
3. Multiplicative Neglect: Adding the rate ($30 + 2$) instead of multiplying by the time ($30 + 2 \times 6$).
4. Units/Language Confusion: For ESL students, "per hour" (प्रति घंटा) may be misinterpreted as a one-time addition.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Grade 6 level: Rational numbers and basic operations are known, but multi-step word problems remain a high cognitive load.
2. Linguistic barrier: Transitioning from Hindi-medium thinking to English-medium questions often results in "keyword picking" (e.g., picking 10, 30, 2, and 4) and applying a random operation rather than situational modeling.
3. Open-ended format: No multiple-choice options to trigger "recognition" of the correct temporal span.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
While the arithmetic is simple (10, 6, 2, 30), the coordination of three distinct logical steps (elapsed time + rate multiplication + initial value addition) creates a high probability for a breakdown in any one segment. For this specific demographic, the transition from 10 am to 4 pm is the most frequent site of error.
