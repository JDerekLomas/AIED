Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Decoding and Translation:** Access the mental lexicon to translate "ruminant" and "digestive system" from English to the student's primary language (likely Hindi) while distinguishing it from general "eating."
2.  **Concept Retrieval:** Recall the specific biological anatomy of the cow’s stomach (four chambers) versus the human stomach (one chamber).
3.  **Establishing Causality:** Connect the anatomical difference to the dietary requirement (cellulose/grass vs. complex human diet).
4.  **Linguistic Synthesis:** Encode the complex scientific concept back into a coherent English sentence (or semi-coherent English) that satisfies the specific rubric requirement of naming the structure (rumen/multi-chamber).

Step 2: "Buggy rules" and systematic errors
*   **The "General Function" Bug:** Providing a generic functional difference (e.g., "Cow eats grass, human eats roti") instead of an anatomical one, failing to realize the rubric requires "how" (system) not just "what" (diet).
*   **Vocabulary Over-generalization:** Labeling any part of the animal's interior as "stomach" without the technical distinction of "four sections" or "rumen."
*   **The "Literalism" Bug:** Interpreting "different" as an invitation to list physical appearances (cows have big mouths/teeth) rather than internal systems.
*   **English Production Block:** Understanding the concept in Hindi (jugali/pachan) but failing to retrieve the technical English terms "rumen" or "chambers."

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students in EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds often face a "language-content gap." While the biology is a standard curriculum point, the shift from rote recognition (MCQs) to open-ended recall in a non-native language introduces high cognitive load. Students may possess the "fact" but fail the "systematic explanation" required by the rubric.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
Given the high vocabulary barrier ("ruminant"), the requirement for recall rather than recognition, and the linguistic challenge of expressing biological structure in English for L2 learners, the success rate is likely to be low. Many will provide the "Dietary" half of the answer (grass vs. food) but miss the "System" requirement (rumen/four chambers) mandated by the rubric.
