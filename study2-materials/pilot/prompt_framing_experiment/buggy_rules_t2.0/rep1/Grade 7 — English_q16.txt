Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decipher the English prompt: Translate and map the semantic requirements (miss grandmother, request visit).
2. Code-switch/Retrieve vocabulary: Access internal lexicon for relational terms ("Grandmother/Dadi"), emotive verbs ("miss/love"), and temporal requests ("visit/come/soon").
3. Apply syntactic rules: Construct sentences following Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order, which differs from Hindi’s Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) structure.
4. Manage orthography and mechanics: Correct spelling and basic punctuation to ensure the message is legible and coherent.
5. Filter constraints: Ensure both specific required elements of the rubric (missing her + asking to visit) are present.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. Translation Symmetry Bug: Translating directly from Hindi/Urdu syntax to English (e.g., "Grandmother soon come" instead of "Please visit soon").
2. Phonetic Spelling Bug: Spelling English words based on Hindi phonetics (e.g., "soon" as "sun", "visit" as "vijit").
3. Semantic Substitution Bug: Using a general verb for a specific one (e.g., "I see you" instead of "I miss you") due to limited vocabulary.
4. Omission Bug: Fulfilling one requirement of the prompt but forgetting the second (e.g., saying "I miss you" but failing to ask her to visit).
5. The "Dear" Loop: Successfully writing a salutation but being unable to bridge to the generative sentence construction.

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 7 students in this context are in a transitional phase where "Functional English" is often taught via rote memorization rather than generative composition. An open-ended task (recall/production) is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice (recognition). Given the EWS background, the "hidden curriculum" of domestic English usage is likely absent, making school the only exposure point.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric is binary (0 or 1), the cognitive load of producing two distinct functional sentences in a second language—navigating both syntax and vocabulary—presents a high barrier. Many students will produce fragments that may not meet the threshold of "clearly express" or will omit one of the two mandatory thematic components.
