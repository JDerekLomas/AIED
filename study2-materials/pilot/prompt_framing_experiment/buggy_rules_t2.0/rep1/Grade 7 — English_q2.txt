Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. **Decoding/Translation**: Decipher the English interrogative ("Why"), the subject ("the king"), and the key verb/action ("announce a reward").
2. **Contextual Retrieval**: Locate the specific narrative episode in memory (The "Three Questions" story).
3. **Causal Reasoning**: Isolate the intent behind the action (the king didn't just want answers; he wanted them to guide his conduct).
4. **Syntactic Encoding**: Formulate a response in English using appropriate word order (Subject + Verb + Infinitive/Prepositional phrase).
5. **Morphological Mapping**: Manage verb tense (changing "announce" to "announced" or using "wanted to find").

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
1. **The "Copy-Paste" Bug**: Looking for the word "reward" in the text and copying the entire sentence containing it, even if it doesn't answer the "Why."
2. **The "Tense-Shift" Bug**: Retaining the base form of the verb from the question ("The king announce...") due to interference from the auxiliary "did."
3. **The "L1 Interference" Bug (Hinglish)**: Mapping Hindi syntax to English, resulting in: "The king reward gave because he questions answer wanted."
4. **The "Keyword Association" Bug**: Answering "3 questions" without a linking verb or purpose, failing the "Why" demand.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
The students are 7th graders from low-resource settings. In such contexts, "English" is often taught through translation or rote memorization of "question-answers." An open-ended "Why" question is cognitively more demanding than "What" or "Who" because it requires expressing causality (logic) rather than just identifying an entity (recall). The language barrier significantly increases the "execution gap"—a student might know the reason in Hindi but fail to produce a grammatically coherent sentence that satisfies a formal rubric.

Step 4: Final Estimate
Considering the shift from recognition to production and the high probability of linguistic "bugs" in syntax and tense among Hindi-medium learners, many students will provide a partially correct or incoherent answer that may not meet the full criteria for the score.
