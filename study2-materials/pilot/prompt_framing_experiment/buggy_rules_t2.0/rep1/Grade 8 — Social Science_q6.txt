Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the English sentence to understand that two factors are required (Translation).
2. Access long-term memory to retrieve the specific historical period (19th-century Europe) and the concept of "Nationalism" (Recall).
3. Select at least two distinct variables from a list of interrelated causes (Discrimination/Selection).
4. Synthesize the selected variables into a written English explanation (Composition).
5. Ensure the response meets the technical criteria for a "factor" as defined by the rubric (Verification).

Step 2: Buggy rules:
1. "Temporal Dislocation": Confusing 20th-century decolonization (Indian independence) with 19th-century European nationalism.
2. "The Keyword Matching Bug": Writing anything related to the French Revolution because the term "Nationalism" or "Europe" triggered a keyword match, without addressing "growth."
3. "The List-to-Explanation Failure": Providing a single word (e.g., "language") without the "brief explanation" required by the rubric for a full mark.
4. "The L1-L2 Translation Gap": Thinking of the concept in Hindi but being unable to find the English vocabulary (e.g., "sovereignty" or "middle class"), leading to an omission or incorrect word substitution.

Step 3: Population factors:
1. Grade 8 is the transition point for higher-order abstract reasoning, but economic and linguistic barriers often limit active vocabulary.
2. The question requires recall (active memory) rather than recognition (multiple choice), which significantly lowers performance in high-poverty contexts with limited literacy resources.
3. In many government school contexts, Social Science is often taught via rote memorization of "back of the chapter" questions; if this specific question wasn't highlighted, students will struggle to synthesize it.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis:
The requirement for two factors, plus an explanation, plus the language barrier, creates a high cognitive load. Many students will provide one factor or a vague general statement that misses the rubric's specific requirement for an explanation.
