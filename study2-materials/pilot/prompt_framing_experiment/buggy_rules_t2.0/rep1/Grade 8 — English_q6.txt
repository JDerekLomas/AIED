Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Accessing the specific definition of "fable" from long-term memory (distinguishing it from folk tales, myths, or short stories).
2. Synthesis: Organizing the three required components (short story, animal characters, moral lesson) into a coherent structure.
3. Linguistic Encoding (L2): Translating the concept from a likely L1 (Hindi) cognitive framework into English syntax.
4. Written Production: Manually writing the definition with correct vocabulary ("imparts," "moral," "typically") as per the rubric's specific constraints.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. The "Generic Narrative" Bug: Defining a fable simply as "a story" (failing to include specific attributes like animals or morals).
2. The "Functional Equivalence" Bug: Confusing the term with similar genre labels (e.g., defining a fable as "a fairy tale" or "a true story").
3. The "Concrete Example" Bug: Providing an example (e.g., "The Tortoise and the Hare") instead of a formal definition.
4. The "Translation/Syntax" Bug: Using Hindi-English hybrid structures or incorrect word forms (e.g., "story give lesson" or "moral is there") which may fail the formal rubric.
5. The "Partial Retrieval" Bug: Including one element (animals) but omitting the other (moral), or vice versa.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face a "literacy gap" where their conceptual understanding exceeds their expressive English capability. The "open-ended" nature of "Define..." requires active recall and sentence construction, which is significantly more difficult than "recognition" (multiple choice) for ESL learners.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
Given that the rubric requires a multi-component definition (short, animals, moral) in a second language, even students who understand what a fable is are likely to omit one specific requirement or fail to articulate it in a way that matches a strict "correct" marking scheme in a government school context.
