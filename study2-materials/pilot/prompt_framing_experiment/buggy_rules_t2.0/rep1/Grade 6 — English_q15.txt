Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Recall: Retrieve specific attributes/traits of a real individual (friend).
2. Translation: Mentally translate Hindi descriptors (e.g., "Mera dost achha hai") into English.
3. Syntax Construction: Apply Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) rules in English (e.g., placing the verb 'is' correctly).
4. Morphological Selection: Choose correct pronouns (He/She vs His/Her) and subject-verb agreement (is/has).
5. Lexical Encoding: Spell high-frequency but irregularly spelled English words (friend, school, play).
6. Orthographic mechanics: Execute capitalization at the start of both sentences and punctuation (full stops) at the end.

Step 2: Common "Buggy Rules"
1. Literal Translation Bug: Using Hindi syntax in English (e.g., "My best friend Ramesh is" - omitting the predicate or using Hindi SOV order).
2. The "Is/Has" Fusion Bug: Using 'is' for possessions or 'has' for states (e.g., "He is 10 years" or "He has good").
3. Spelling/Phonetic Bug: Mapping Hindi phonology to English letters (e.g., writing "frand" or "bestu").
4. Pronoun Mixing Bug: Using 'He' and 'She' interchangeably or using the possessive 'His' as a subject.
5. Punctuation Omission: Treating the two sentences as a single continuous run-on string without markers.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students in this context are often transitioning from basic decoding to productive writing. Since the task requires "recall" (generation) rather than "recognition" (multiple choice), it demands a high level of cognitive load. For ESL/EFL learners in economically disadvantaged contexts, English is often a "third language" (L3) with limited environmental exposure. The rubric's requirement for "grammatically correct" sentences is a high threshold, as even one minor error (missing a full stop or a singular/plural mistake) results in a score of zero according to a binary 0/1 rubric.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While many students can convey meaning, the strict requirement for two *grammatically correct* sentences—compounded by English spelling irregularities and Hindi-to-English syntax interference—creates a high "failure" rate on a binary rubric.
