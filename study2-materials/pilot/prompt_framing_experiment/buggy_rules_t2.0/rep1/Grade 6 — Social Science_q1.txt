Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decipher the English prompt: Translate the carrier language into the mental concept of "geographic features."
2. Domain constraints: Filter the internal mental map to "India" (excluding international ranges like the Andes/Alps).
3. Category selection: Identify specific "Mountain Ranges" (excluding individual peaks like Mt. Everest or K2, and river systems).
4. Recall/Retrieval: Access at least two specific names from long-term memory.
5. Production: Write/Transliterate the names into the target language (English or Hindi).

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
1. Peak-for-Range Bug: Identifying an individual mountain (Mt. Everest) as a "range" because they belong to the same semantic field.
2. Boundary Error: Naming ranges near but outside India (Karakoram or Hindu Kush) due to imprecise geopolitical mapping.
3. Feature Misidentification: Providing names of major rivers or states instead of mountains (the "General Geographic Feature" bug).
4. Insufficient Quantity Bug: Providing only one name despite the prompt "Name any two" (often seen in students with limited processing speed or attention to prompt constraints).
5. Transliteration Barrier: Knowing the name (e.g., Aravalli) but failing to produce a recognizable spelling in English.

Step 3: Population Considerations
In Grade 6, Indian students are transitioning from primary social studies to discrete Geography. Students from EWS backgrounds often rely on rote memorization from textbooks (NCERT). While "Himalayas" is a near-universal association, identifying a *second* range and correctly distinguishing it from a peak (like Everest) or a state name is a significant cognitive jump for students with lower literacy levels.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the Himalayas provide a "safe" first answer, the requirement for a second distinct range, the potential to name a peak (Everest) instead, and the language barrier for spelling or comprehension lead to a significant drop in full accuracy.
