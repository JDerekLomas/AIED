Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English text to understand the request ("Which condition," "most favourable").
2. Scan the rows/columns of the data table (Condition vs. Height/Growth).
3. Compare numerical values or descriptions across the three conditions to find the maximum growth value.
4. Map the maximum value back to the label (e.g., "Full Sunlight").
5. Encode the answer in written English or a recognizable label.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "Last Entry Bias": Picking the final data point in the table regardless of value.
2. "Label-Value Mismatch": Correctly identifying the highest number but writing down the numeric value instead of the condition name.
3. "Common Sense Override": Selecting "Water" or "Soil" based on prior general knowledge even if the data shows "Full Sunlight" as the variable.
4. "Comparison Failure": Comparing only the first and second items, failing to scan the entire data set.
5. "Linguistic Misinterpretation": Interpreting "favourable" as "least" or confusing the word with "favorite."

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. English proficiency: In a Hindi-medium/EWS context, the word "favourable" is a high-threshold vocabulary word.
2. Tabular Literacy: Grade 6 students from disadvantaged backgrounds often lack systematic exposure to row-column correspondence.
3. Expressive vs. Receptive: While students might understand the concept of light helping plants, translating that to a specific data-mining task in a second language adds a high cognitive load.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that the rubric only asks for (a), the task is simpler than the full three-part question. However, the linguistic barrier and the transition from intuitive to data-based reasoning in Grade 6 are significant hurdles for this specific demographic.
