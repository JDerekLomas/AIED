To analyze this item through the lens of systematic procedural errors (buggy rules) in a second-language acquisition context:

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. **Retrieval/Recognition:** Recalling a specific line from a poem (recall) or identifying it from text (if provided).
2. **Preference Mapping:** Assigning a subjective value ("like") to a specific linguistic string.
3. **Linguistic Encoding (Syntax):** Structuring a sentence in English using the correct word order (Subject-Verb-Object).
4. **Causal Reasoning (Logic):** Formulating a justification for the preference.
5. **Causal Encoding (Connectives):** Linking the preference to the reason using the conjunction "because" or "and."

**Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)**
*   **Literal Translation Bug:** Students apply Hindi syntax to English (e.g., "The line me like because...")
*   **The "Identify-Only" Bug:** Students correctly perform Step 1 (writing the line) but skip the justification entirely because they lack the "why" vocabulary, resulting in partial credit but not "fully correct" status according to the rubric.
*   **The "Because" Loop:** Using "because" as a sentence starter without a preceding clause, or ending the sentence with "because it is nice," which often fails to meet higher-order rubric expectations for "mentioning why."
*   **Spelling-Sense Drift:** Copying the line from the text but making transcription errors that change the meaning, rendering the "preference" nonsensical.
*   **Tautological Reasoning Bug:** Reasoning that repeats the prompt (e.g., "I like it because I like it").

**Step 3: Population Considerations**
In Grade 6 (EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds), English is often treated as a decoding exercise rather than a communicative one. An "open-ended" prompt is significantly more cognitively taxing than "recognition" (multiple choice) because it requires active synthesis of vocabulary and grammar. The 1.5-mark weighting suggests a low-stakes item where many students might provide a minimalist answer that fails the two-part rubric (Identify + Explain).

**Step 4: Holistic Analysis**
While many students will manage to copy a line (procedural success in Step 1), the "Why" component acts as a high-friction barrier. The intersection of limited English proficiency with the abstract demand of "aesthetic justification" leads to a high frequency of "buggy" sentences or incomplete responses.
