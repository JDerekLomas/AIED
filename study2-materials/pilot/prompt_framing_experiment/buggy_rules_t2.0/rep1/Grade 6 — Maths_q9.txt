Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Identify the relevant geometric properties in the figure (typically involving a linear pair and/or the triangle sum property).
2. Recognize that the sum of angles on a straight line is 180° to find an interior angle, or that the sum of interior angles of a triangle is 180°.
3. Set up a subtraction or addition equation: $180 - (\text{given angle})$.
4. Execute the arithmetic (multi-digit subtraction, potentially involving regrouping).

Step 2: Buggy rules:
- **Linear Pair Confusion:** Using 90° or 100° instead of 180° as the base for supplementary angles.
- **"Smaller from Larger":** When subtracting (e.g., $180 - 100$), if regrouping is needed in other contexts, the student subtracts the top digit from the bottom digit.
- **Angle Misidentification:** Confusing interior vs. exterior angles or selecting the wrong vertex based on visual orientation rather than geometric logic.
- **Operation Choice:** Adding given values (e.g., $100 + 80 = 180$) but failing to isolate the specific variable `x`.

Step 3: Population factors:
- **Grade 6 Context:** Students are transitioning from concrete arithmetic to formal Euclidean geometry.
- **Language/Socio-economic barrier:** High "semantic noise." Students often struggle to decode "Find the angle x" if they haven't internalized the symbolic vocabulary of geometry.
- **Lack of partial credit:** The rubric is "all or nothing" for 0.5 points, meaning even a minor arithmetic slip (e.g., $180 - 100 = 70$) results in 0 marks.

Step 4: Estimation:
Given the specific demographic (EWS/Hindi-medium transitioning to English-coded math) and the requirement of a multi-step recall process without multiple-choice scaffolding, the error rate in arithmetic or the initial "translation" of the figure is historically high.
