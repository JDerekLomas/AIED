To analyze this item through the lens of mathematical cognition and systematic errors (Buggy-rule theory), we must break down the task within the specific socio-linguistic context of the student population.

### Step 1: Procedural Steps
1.  **Linguistic Decomposition:** Interpret the prompt to identify a proportional relationship.
2.  **Unit Rate Calculation:** Divide total distance by fuel ($55 \div 5$) to find the mileage (11 km/L).
3.  **Proportional Application:** Multiply the unit rate by the new fuel volume ($11 \times 12$).
4.  **Secondary Task Address:** Specifically identify and label the "mileage" as requested in the second part of the prompt.
5.  **Multi-digit Multiplication:** Execute the $11 \times 12$ algorithm correctly.

### Step 2: Potential "Buggy Rules" and Cognitive Obstacles
*   **Keyword Strategy Bug:** Students may see "5" and "55" and instinctively divide, but seeing "12" and "55," they might attempt to subtract if they cannot decode the English context, or simply multiply the two largest numbers ($55 \times 12$).
*   **The "Additive Bug":** Students in this developmental stage often apply additive reasoning to proportional problems (e.g., $12 - 5 = 7$ extra liters, so $55 + 7 = 62$ km).
*   **Calculation Slip (Carry Bug):** In $11 \times 12$, students often fail to hold the place value in the second line of multiplication, resulting in $11 + 22 = 33$ or $110 + 2 = 112$.
*   **Semantic Noise:** The word "average" or "mileage" may be unfamiliar in English; students may calculate 132 km but fail to provide the second answer, or conversely, find 11 km/L and stop, assuming the "how much" refers to the rate.

### Step 3: Population Factors
The item is open-ended (constructed response), which removes the possibility of "back-solving" from options. For students in Indian government schools, the shift from local language (Hindi) to English medium in math often creates a "translation bottleneck." While "mileage" is a common loanword in India, the phrasing "Find how much mileage... the car is giving" is idiomatic and can be confusing. Additionally, the rubric awards 1 point for 132 km but mentions "Correctly finds distance," potentially penalizing students who find the mileage but fail the multi-step scaling.

### Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While the numbers (55 and 5) are "friendly" and likely to trigger the correct initial division, the two-part nature of the question (distance vs. mileage) increases the cognitive load. Systematic errors in multiplication and the tendency to apply additive strategies in proportional reasoning significantly prune the success rate. For this demographic, linguistic barriers often mask underlying mathematical competence.
