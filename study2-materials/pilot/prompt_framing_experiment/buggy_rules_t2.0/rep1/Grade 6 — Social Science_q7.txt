Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Retrieval/Search: Recall specific geographical data categorized as "natural resources" specifically for the state of Rajasthan (distinguishing from man-made or general resources).
2. Selection: Filter for two distinct resources that meet the rubric's criteria.
3. Causal Linking: Identify one of the two resources and associate it with a socio-economic impact (human-environment interaction).
4. English Encoding/Translation: Convert conceptual knowledge (likely stored in Hindi/L1) into English sentences that satisfy both the naming and the explanatory requirements.
5. Synthesis: Integrate these into a coherent written response within the constraints of the 1-mark value.

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
- "Categorical Drift": Providing a city name or landmark (e.g., Jaipur) instead of a resource, or naming a crop (cultural/agricultural) instead of a natural mineral/resource.
- "The Lone Labeler": Listing the two resources but omitting the explanation (treating the question as a "List" rather than "Mention and Explain").
- "Undifferentiated Impact": Providing a generic explanation that applies to all of India (e.g., "it is used for work") rather than one specific to the resource and the geography of Rajasthan.
- "Language-Cognition Mismatch": Understanding the impact but being unable to formulate the "influence" in English, leading to an abandoned or incomplete response.
- "Partial Completion": Naming one resource and explaining it, but forgetting the requirement to name two.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 6 represents a transition where "Explain" questions are relatively new compared to simple recall.
- Economically weaker sections (EWS) often have limited access to the visual/supplementary materials (atlases, documentaries) that make geographic resources concrete.
- Language barrier is high: A student may know "Baalu" (sand) or "Pathar" (stone) but struggle to translate "Sandstone" or "Gypsum," or fail to explain "influences" in formal English.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
The item is deceptively difficult for a 1-mark question. It requires three distinct cognitive tokens: Resource A, Resource B, and Explanation C. The multi-part nature of the prompt increases the likelihood of a "buggy" execution where the student stops after the first successful retrieval. In many government school settings, while students may identify "water" or "copper," the explanation of "influence" in English acts as a significant barrier for the majority of the bottom two quartiles.
