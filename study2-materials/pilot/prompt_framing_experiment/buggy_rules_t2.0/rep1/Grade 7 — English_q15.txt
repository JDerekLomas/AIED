Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Correctly interpreting the prompt words "Hobby," "When," and "Why."
2. Content Generation: Selecting a valid hobby and formulating reasons in the first language (L1/Hindi).
3. Syntactic Translation: Converting thoughts from Hindi grammar (SOV) to English grammar (SVO).
4. Morphological Execution: Applying tense markers (Present Simple) and subject-verb agreement.
5. Paragraph Formatting: Organizing 4-5 distinct sentences into a cohesive block rather than a list.
6. Orthographic Accuracy: Correct spelling and capitalization.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. "Literal Translation" bug: Using Hindi syntax (e.g., "My hobby cricket is") or direct translations (e.g., "I like because play gives happiness" - omitting subject).
2. "Point-Wise list" bug: Writing a numbered list (1, 2, 3) instead of a "short paragraph" as instructed.
3. "Over-generalization of 'ing'" bug: Using "My hobby is playing" for every verb regardless of context (e.g., "I am playing hobby in Sunday").
4. "The Missing Link" bug: Providing the "what" and "when" but failing to articulate "why" due to limited vocabulary for abstract emotions.
5. "Indefinite Pronoun" bug: Forgetting the pronoun/subject in subsequent sentences (e.g., "Is very fun").

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students from EWS backgrounds in Hindi-medium settings often face "Cumulative Language Deficit." While they may understand the concept of a hobby, the production requirement (recall/recall) is significantly harder than recognition (MCQs). The transition from single-word answers to multi-sentence syntax is a major bottleneck.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
A "fully correct" score requires satisfying every rubric constraint (paragraph format, all three prompts addressed, grammatical coherence). While many students will attempt the question and write 1-2 broken sentences, the systemic bugs in syntax and the inability to synthesize "why" into a cohesive paragraph at this grade level and demographic suggest a low mastery rate for a "1/1" score.
