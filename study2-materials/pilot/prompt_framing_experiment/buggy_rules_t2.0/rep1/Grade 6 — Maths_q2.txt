To analyze the cognitive demands for this Grade 6 item:

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. **Linguistic Decoding:** Recognize "place value" as a mathematical term distinct from "face value."
2. **Positional Identification:** Count or identify positions from right to left (0=ones, 6=tens, 5=hundreds).
3. **Value Calculation:** Translate the position (hundreds) into its numerical weight ($5 \times 100$) or label.
4. **Encoding/Writing:** Formulate the answer as "500" or "Hundreds."

**Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)**
*   **Face Value Substitution:** Reporting "5" (the digit itself) instead of its positional value.
*   **Directional Reversal:** Counting positions from left to right (7=ones, 5=tens), resulting in an answer of "50" or "Tens."
*   **Column Index Error:** Incorrectly mapping the name to the position (e.g., calling the third digit "thousands").
*   **Linguistic Confusion:** Mistaking "place value" for "place name" (e.g., writing the digit's location but failing to multiply) or confusing English terminology (Place vs. Face) common in ESL/Hindi-medium transitions.

**Step 3: Population Considerations**
In Grade 6 (Indian Govt. Schools), place value is a foundational concept taught early, but English-language assessments pose a significant barrier. For many students, the word "Place" might trigger the digit (Face Value) due to rote-learning interference. The open-ended format removes the "cueing" effect of multiple-choice options.

**Step 4: Holistic Estimate**
While a core concept, the combination of linguistic interference (English terminology) and the "Face Value" bug typically results in significant attrition in this specific demographic.
