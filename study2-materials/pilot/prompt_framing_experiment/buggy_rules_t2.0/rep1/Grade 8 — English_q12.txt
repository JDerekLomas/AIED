Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Visual Literacy:** Decode a sequence of images to identify the core narrative arc (the fox, the fall, the physical trap of the well).
2. **Lexical Retrieval:** Recall specific L2 (English) vocabulary for the visual elements ("fox," "well," "jump/fall," "climb," "escape/get out").
3. **Syntactic Encoding:** Construct sentences using past tense markers (essential for storytelling) or basic SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structures.
4. **Logical/Causal Linking:** Explicitly state the relationship between the fox’s actions and the inability to exit (as per the rubric’s requirement for "how" and "why").
5. **Transliteration/Translation:** Bridge the gap between the thought in Hindi and the output in English while managing limited vocabulary.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **The "Tense-Shift" Bug:** Using present tense or mixing tenses ("The fox fall in well") instead of narrative past.
2. **The "Native-Phonetic" Spelling Bug:** Spelling "fox" as "poks" or "vocks," and "well" as "vell," based on regional phonetic interference.
3. **The "Hindi-Syntax" Bug:** Translating SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) logic into English (e.g., "Fox well in fell").
4. **The "Preposition-Drop" Bug:** Omitting directional prepositions necessary for the rubric ("Fox fell well" instead of "fell into").
5. **The "Literal Labeling" Bug:** Writing single words for images rather than the narrative relationship required by the rubric.

Step 3: Target population considerations
The requirement for productive recall (writing) vs. receptive recognition (multiple choice) is a high cognitive load for ESL students from economically weaker sections. Grade 8 students in this context often face "functional illiteracy" in English, where they can read alphabet sets but cannot compose original narrative paragraphs. The rubric is specific (requiring the *process* of the fall and the *state* of being trapped), making partial credit-style failures likely.
