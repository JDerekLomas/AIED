Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Language Decoding: Decode the English prompt "Suggest," "transparency," and "governance."
2. Conceptual Retrieval: Access the abstract concept of 'transparency' from long-term memory (Social Science/Civics schema).
3. Strategy Generation: Formulate a concrete policy or action (e.g., RTI, digitalization, public hearings) that correlates with the abstract concept.
4. Linguistic Encoding: Translate the thought into a written English sentence or phrase that communicates "relevance" to an evaluator.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
- The "Synonym Bug": Confounding "transparency" with "honesty" or "hard work," leading to answers like "Leaders should be good people."
- The "Action Bug": Suggesting ways to improve *government* generally (e.g., "build more roads") rather than *transparency* specifically.
- The "Linguistic Interference Bug": Inability to recall the specific English term "Right to Information," leading to vague or circular definitions (e.g., "Government should show everything").
- The "Output Constraint Bug": Students may understand the concept in Hindi but produce an unintelligible English string that the rubric (or grader) fails to recognize as "plausible."

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 7 students in this demographic are transitioning from concrete to abstract operational thought. "Transparency" is a high-lexile, Latinate academic word. In many low-resource contexts, Civics is taught via rote memorization of textbook questions. If this specific question was not a "back-of-chapter" exercise memorized verbatim, the "cold" retrieval of the concept in a second language is a high-difficulty task.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric is generous (only one way needed), the barrier is the vocabulary. Without the prompt being in Hindi or a word bank being provided, many students will fail at Step 1 or Step 2.
