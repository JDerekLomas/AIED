Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the specific term "Rights of Children" (likely from Civics chapters on Fundamental Rights or the UNCRC).
2. Distinguish "child rights" (e.g., Right to Education, Protection from Labor) from general "Fundamental Rights" (e.g., Freedom of Speech).
3. Select and name two distinct rights accurately.
4. Translation/Language Processing: Decode the prompt (English) into the concepts learned (often Hindi/Bilingual instruction).
5. Identify one of the selected rights and generate a causal explanation regarding its social or individual "importance."
6. Synthesize these steps into a coherent written response in English.

Step 2: Common "Buggy Rules"
1. The "List-only" Bug: Providing names of rights but skipping the "explanation" component (a common error in multi-part prompts).
2. The "Duties/Rights Swap": Confusing a "right" with a "duty" (e.g., saying a right of a child is to "study hard" or "obey parents").
3. The "Generic Importance" Bug: Providing a circular explanation (e.g., "The Right to Education is important because children should be educated") rather than an explanation of impact.
4. The "Language Attrition" Bug: Attempting to translate "Bal Shram" (Child Labor) or "Shiksha" (Education) and losing the formal "Right" nomenclature, leading to ambiguous phrasing that doesn't meet the rubric.
5. The "Recall Saturation" Bug: Successfully naming one right but failing to recall a second distinct one, resulting in a half-answer.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 6 is a transitional year where students move from simple identification to "explaining" concepts. For students in economically weaker sections (EWS) with limited English proficiency, the requirement to "explain importance" in English is a significant barrier. While many may know they have a right to go to school (RTE), formalizing this into two distinct legal points with an explanation is cognitively demanding. Furthermore, the 1-point maximum score is "all-or-nothing," meaning any single "bug" (e.g., naming two rights but failing to explain) results in a zero.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the "all-or-nothing" rubric (1 point for multiple steps), the linguistic barrier for Hindi-medium backgrounds, and the procedural complexity of recall plus explanation:
