Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Identify the geometric properties of a parallelogram relevant to the figure (e.g., opposite angles are equal, consecutive angles are supplementary).
2.  Relate angle $x$ to its corresponding or opposite angle based on the provided numerical value in the diagram.
3.  Perform the arithmetic subtraction ($180 - \text{given angle}$) if using the supplementary property, or direct assignment if using opposite angles.
4.  Formulate a written explanation in English or a mix of Hindi/English justifying the value of $x$.
5.  Repeat the process for angle $y$ (though the rubric specifically focuses on $x$ for the score).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1.  **"All angles equal" bug:** Students often assume all interior angles of any quadrilateral are equal (assigning $x=90$ or $x = \text{given angle}$ regardless of position).
2.  **"Linear pair confusion":** Attempting to subtract the given angle from 90 instead of 180.
3.  **Property Misalignment:** Using the "opposite angles" rule for adjacent angles and vice versa.
4.  **Language/Explanation Block:** Students may correctly calculate $x=110$ but fail to provide a verbal/written explanation due to limited English proficiency or lack of familiarity with formal "Reasons" columns in proofs.
5.  **Transcription Error:** Calculating $x$ correctly but mislabeling it as $y$ due to the multi-part nature of the prompt.

Step 3: Population Considerations
*   Grade 8 students are transitioning from concrete to formal operational thinking; multi-step geometry proofs are a significant cognitive load.
*   The requirement for an "explanation" is a high-bar hurdle for students with limited English proficiency (LEP), as they may have the mathematical intuition but lack the academic vocabulary (e.g., "supplementary," "transversal," "adjacent") to satisfy a rubric.
*   In economically weaker section (EWS) contexts, "open-ended" recall questions generally yield significantly lower success rates than multiple-choice questions due to the "blank page" effect.

Step 4: Final Estimate
Taking into account that the student must execute both the calculation and the linguistic explanation correctly to receive the 1 mark, the failure rate on the "explanation" component typically halves the success rate of the "calculation" component in this demographic.
