Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Textual decoding/translation: Comprehend "stunted growth" and "yellowing" as clinical symptoms of nutrient deficiency.
2. Conceptual retrieval: Connect symptoms to specific soil science concepts (specifically the role of NPK).
3. Strategic mapping: Identify "fertilizers/manure" as the external intervention needed to restock soil nutrients.
4. Linguistic production: Synthesize an English response using technical vocabulary (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, fertilizers) within a grammatical framework.

Step 2: Buggy Rules/Systematic Errors
1. Over-generalization of "Water/Pesticide": A common bug where students associate all "plant problems" with a lack of water or the presence of pests/insects, regardless of the prompt’s mention of "nutrient deficiency."
2. The "Keyword Association" bug: Seeing "farmer" and "soil" and providing a rote-learned but irrelevant procedure (like "ploughing" or "crop rotation") because the term "nutrient" isn't prioritized over "farmer."
3. Spelling/Recall hurdles: Students may understand the concept but fail to recall the specific English spelling of "Phosphorus" or "Fertilizers," leading to a null response or vague language that fails the rubric's requirement for a "correct essential nutrient."
4. Recognition vs. Recall gap: In an open-ended format, the absence of multiple-choice distractors often causes "Retrieval Failure" for technical terms.

Step 3: Target Population Constraints
Grade 7 students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds face a significant "translinguistic" burden. While they might understand the concept of "khaad" (manure/fertilizer), translating this into a technical English sentence with specific chemical names (N-P-K) increases the cognitive load significantly, leading to higher error rates.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
The multi-step requirement (identify solution + name specific nutrient) combined with the open-ended English-only output requirement makes this item difficult for this specific demographic. While "fertilizer" is a common term, the specific naming of a nutrient like Nitrogen or Phosphorus is a high hurdle for learners still building technical vocabulary.
