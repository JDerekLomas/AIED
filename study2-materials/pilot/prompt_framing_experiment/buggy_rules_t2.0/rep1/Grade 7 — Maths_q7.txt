Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Interpret the linguistic operator "of" as the mathematical operation of multiplication ($1/2 \times 3/4$ and $2/5 \times 2/3$).
2. Execute fraction multiplication for the first pair: Multiply numerators ($1 \times 3$) and denominators ($2 \times 4$).
3. Execute fraction multiplication for the second pair: Multiply numerators ($2 \times 2$) and denominators ($5 \times 3$).
4. Compare two fractions with unlike denominators ($3/8$ vs $4/15$).
5. Determine a common denominator (e.g., $120$) or use cross-multiplication ($3 \times 15 = 45$; $8 \times 4 = 32$).
6. Formulate the final comparison and identify which original expression is greater.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- Operator Misinterpretation: Treating "of" as addition or division, or simply ignoring it and comparing $1/2$ to $2/5$ directly.
- Multiplication Bug: Adding the numerators and multiplying denominators (or vice versa).
- "Whole Number" Comparison: Comparing denominators only ($15 > 8$, so $4/15$ is greater) or comparing numerators only ($4 > 3$, so $4/15$ is greater).
- Cross-multiplication Placement: Successfully cross-multiplying but attributing the product to the wrong fraction.
- "Gaps" Bug: Judging fractions based on the numerical distance between numerator and denominator.

Step 3: Student Population & Context
- Language Barrier: The English word "greater" and the phrasing "of" may be less familiar than "multiply" or "bada" (Hindi).
- Recall vs. Recognition: The open-ended format prevents students from using "guess-and-check" strategies possible in multiple-choice questions.
- Concept Density: This problem is a multi-step composite task; failure in any one of the three phases (interpret, calculate, compare) results in a zero score based on the strict rubric.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the cumulative probability of failure across at least three distinct procedural phases (multiplication, finding common denominators, and logical comparison), and the common tendency for Grade 7 students in this demographic to struggle with the abstract nature of fraction magnitudes:
