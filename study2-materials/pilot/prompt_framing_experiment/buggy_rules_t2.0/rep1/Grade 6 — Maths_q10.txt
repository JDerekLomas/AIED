To analyze this task within the framework of mathematical cognition and "buggy rules" for Grade 6 students in this specific demographic:

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. Draw a baseline (initial ray) using a ruler.
2. Align the protractor’s origin (crosshair) exactly on the vertex.
3. Align the 0° line (baseline) of the protractor perfectly with the drawn ray.
4. **Cognitive Selection:** Choose the correct scale (inner vs. outer) based on the orientation of the ray.
5. Mark the point at 110°.
6. Remove the protractor and use a straightedge to connect the vertex to the mark.

**Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules**
*   **The "Outer-Scale" Bug:** Regardless of where the 0° line lies, the student always reads the numbers on the outermost rim. For 110°, this frequently results in drawing a 70° angle (the supplementary angle).
*   **The "Standard Orientation" Bug:** Students often only know how to draw angles facing right. If they draw the ray to the left, they cannot reconcile the scale reading.
*   **The "Alignment Displacement" Bug:** The student aligns the bottom edge of the physical plastic protractor with the ray rather than the printed 0°/180° line.
*   **The "Parallax/Precision" Bug:** Inaccurate marking leads to results ±5°, which often fails binary rubrics.

**Step 3: Demographic Factors**
The language barrier (English instruction) can lead to confusion between the instrument ("protractor") and the action. However, the primary obstacle is the 110° angle itself. Obtuse angles are "bug-magnets" because students have a strong intuition for acute angles; when they see "110" on a scale that also shows "70," they often subconsciously choose the smaller, "easier" looking gap. In many resource-constrained schools, communal or low-quality geometry boxes with scratched markings further increase physical execution errors.

**Step 4: Holistic Assessment**
While 40° is frequently successful, 110° is a high-error item. Because the rubric requires 110° for the point, the "Supplementary Angle" bug (drawing 70°) typically accounts for 30-40% of failures alone. When combined with alignment errors and lack of access to precision tools, the success rate drops significantly for this specific population.
