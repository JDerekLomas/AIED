Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Semantic Decoding:** Decipher the English-medium question into a conceptual framework (likely translating mental concepts from Hindi to English).
2. **Concept Retrieval (Heat):** Recall the scientific principle that light colors are poor absorbers/good reflectors of radiant heat.
3. **Concept Retrieval (Moisture/Fabric):** Identify the property of cotton regarding sweat absorption and evaporation (though the rubric focuses on color, the prompt asks for "two scientific reasons" related to properties of the "fabric").
4. **Differentiation:** Isolate the "light-colored" variable from the "cotton" variable as requested.
5. **Syntactic Encoding:** Formulate an English sentence that uses causal connectors (e.g., "because," "due to") to link the property to the preference.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules" (Conceptual & Procedural)
1. **The "Topic Matching" Bug:** Students provide a correct fact about cotton (e.g., "it absorbs sweat") but fail to address the specific "light-colored" requirement of the rubric.
2. **The "Direct Experience" vs. "Scientific Language" Bug:** Using colloquial descriptions ("it feels cool") instead of "properties" or "scientific reasons" (e.g., "reflection," "absorption").
3. **The "Double-Requirement" Error:** The prompt asks for "two reasons" but the rubric allows for "a plausible reason." Students may stop after one or become confused by the mismatch between the prompt's complexity and their vocabulary.
4. **Translation-mediated Loss:** Attempting to translate "paravartan" (reflection) or "avshoshan" (absorption) and failing to find the English equivalent, leading to an abandoned or vague response.

Step 3: Population Considerations
*   **Medium Shift:** Grade 7 is often a transition point where technical vocabulary in English becomes a barrier.
*   **Open-ended Retrieval:** Unlike multiple-choice, this requires active recall of specific terminology.
*   **Rubric vs. Prompt:** The prompt is cognitively more demanding (two reasons, specific fabric properties) than the rubric implies, which often leads to "under-answering" by students who are unsure of the second reason.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept (light colors are cooler) is intuitive and taught early, the requirement to explain it "scientifically" in a second language, coupled with the systematic error of focusing only on "cotton/sweat" rather than "light-colored/heat reflection," significantly reduces the success rate for this specific demographic.
