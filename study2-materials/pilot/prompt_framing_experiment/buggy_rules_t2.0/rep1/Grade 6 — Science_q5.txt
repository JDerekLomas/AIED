Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the specific chemical reagent required (Iodine solution).
2. Describe the application (putting drops on the cut surface of the potato).
3. Identify the specific color change indicative of a positive result (blue-black).
4. Translate these scientific observations into English sentences (or coherent phrases).

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
- Reagent Confusion: Substituting "Iodine" with more common liquids (water, lemon juice) or other lab chemicals (acid, "medicine").
- Process Inversion: Suggesting the potato should be boiled or peeled as the primary action, skipping the chemical test.
- Color Bug: Naming a common color (red, blue, or black) instead of the specific "blue-black" or "dark blue."
- Observation vs. Conclusion Bug: Stating "it turns different" without naming a color, or stating "it turns starch" (using the substance as the result).

Step 3: Population factors
Grade 6 is the entry point for formal laboratory chemistry in the Indian curriculum. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle to recall the English word "Iodine" even if they understand the concept. Open-ended recall is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice recognition. Given the "Economically Weaker Section" (EWS) context, many students may have seen the experiment as a demonstration only, rather than performing it hands-on, leading to lower retention of the procedural sequence.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric is quite lenient (accepting just "putting iodine"), the "Describe the procedure" and "state the final observation" prompts require a multi-part retrieval. For a 6th-grade student in an under-resourced environment, the jump from "recognizing the potato experiment" to "correctly naming iodine and the color change in English" is a significant hurdle.
