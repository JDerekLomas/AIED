Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English text to identify the key descriptor ("beaten into thin sheets") and the example ("aluminium foils").
2. Retrieve the specific domain-specific scientific term from long-term memory that corresponds to this physical property.
3. Discriminate between related properties (malleability vs. ductility) which are often taught together.
4. Correctly transcribe/spell the term "Malleability" (or a phonetically recognizable version if the grader allows, though formal rubrics often demand precision).

Step 2: Buggy rules and systematic errors
- **Concept Substitution (Ductility/Malleability Swap):** A very common "bug" where students associate "property of metal" with the two terms but apply them to the wrong action (sheets vs. wires).
- **Phonological Mapping Bug:** Students may know the concept but, due to limited English proficiency, cannot retrieve the specific word, leading to "word on the tip of the tongue" or substituting common descriptors like "flexible" or "softness."
- **Overgeneralization:** Using the term for the product ("sheetability" or "foliation") instead of the scientific property.
- **Interference from L1 (Hindi):** Searching for the Hindi equivalent (*Aghatvardhaniyata*) and failing to translate it back to the specific English technical term required by the rubric.

Step 3: Student population considerations
- Grade 8 is the stage where these terms are formalized in the NCERT/State curriculum.
- Open-ended recall (producing the word) is significantly harder than recognition (multiple choice) for students with limited English fluency.
- The term "Malleability" is orthographically complex for non-native speakers.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While this is a fundamental curriculum fact, the combination of the retrieval demand (recall vs. recognition), the high linguistic interference for EWS/Hindi-medium students, and the common confusion with "ductility" creates significant hurdles.
