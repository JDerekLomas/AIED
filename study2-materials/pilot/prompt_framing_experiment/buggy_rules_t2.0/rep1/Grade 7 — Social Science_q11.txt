Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Lexical Decoding: Translate and comprehend "evaluate," "public vs private," and "healthcare" in an English-medium context.
2. Conceptual Retrieval: Recall the structural differences (cost, ownership, infrastructure) from the "Health" unit.
3. Comparative Mapping: Organize information into a comparative framework (A vs B).
4. Evidence Synthesis: Formulate one specific "valid argument or example" for each, as per the prompt's constraint.
5. Language Encoding: Construct a written response that satisfies the "mentions two features" rubric while overcoming English expression barriers.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" or procedural errors
1. Over-generalization Bug: Providing two features of the same system (e.g., two public sector traits) instead of the requested "differences" between both.
2. Binary Attribute Bug: Assuming if public is "good/free," private must be "bad/expensive," failing to identify specific systemic features (e.g., waiting times).
3. Substitution Bug: Providing a personal anecdote (e.g., "The doctor was nice") instead of a systemic "valid argument or example."
4. Prompt-Weight Neglect: Meeting the "evaluate" requirement but forgetting the "one valid argument or example" constraint, or vice versa.
5. Language Interference Bug: Using Hindi logic in English syntax that results in ambiguous meaning, causing the examiner to mark it incorrect under strict rubrics.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students from economically weaker sections often have first-hand experience with public health systems but may struggle to articulate this in an English-medium test format. Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice recognition for this demographic, especially when the rubric requires a specific structure (two features). The mismatch between home language (Hindi) and test language (English) often leads to high omission rates.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Considering the complexity of the command "Evaluate" (High Bloom’s taxonomy level), the multi-step requirement of the rubric, and the language barrier for ESL/Hindi-medium learners:
