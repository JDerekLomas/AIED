Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Visually decode the provided image to identify key cultural icons (idols of Isar and Gangaur).
2. Retrieve the specific name of the festival from long-term memory (Gangaur).
3. Translate the internalized concept into the required language of instruction (English or Hindi).
4. Compose a descriptive sentence explaining the celebration (ritual bathing, singing, processing, or offering prayers).
5. Align the written output with the narrow requirement of the rubric despite the low point value.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. Visual Misidentification: Generalizing all Rajasthan festivals involving idols to "Teej" (over-generalization based on similarity).
2. Category Substitution: Naming a general religious holiday (e.g., Diwali or Holi) because the concept of a "regional festival" is cognitively substituted by a "global festival" rule.
3. Language Barrier Bug: Attempting to describe the festival in English but failing to produce a coherent sentence, leading to an incomplete answer despite knowing the name.
4. Rubric Devaluation: Skipping the "description" part of the question because the 0.5 point weight signals to the student that only the name is necessary (Efficiency Bug).

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds face high cognitive load when switching from visual recognition to English-language production. Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice recognition. The discrepancy between the complex two-part question and the tiny point value (0.5) creates a mismatch that often discourages effort or leads to "Satisficing" (providing only the simplest part of the answer).
