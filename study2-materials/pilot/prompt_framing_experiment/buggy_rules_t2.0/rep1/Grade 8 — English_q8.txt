Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Identify the Subject (The chef), Verb (prepared), and Object (a delicious meal).
2. Move the Object to the Subject position.
3. Determine the tense of the active verb (Simple Past).
4. Select the correct form of the auxiliary "be" matching the tense and new subject (was).
5. Convert the main verb into Past Participle form (prepared).
6. Add the agent using the preposition "by."
7. Move the original Subject to the Object position.

Step 2: Buggy rules:
1. **Tense Inconsistency:** Using "is" instead of "was" (applying present passive rule to past tense).
2. **Missing "Be" Verb:** Writing "A delicious meal prepared by the chef" (treating "prepared" as the main verb without the auxiliary).
3. **Perfective Confusion:** Influenced by Sentence B, using "has been" or "was been" in Sentence A.
4. **Subject-Object Mapping Error:** Keeping "The chef" as the subject but changing the verb form.
5. **V3 Conversion Error:** Misidentifying the past participle of irregular or even regular verbs (though "prepared" is stable).

Step 3: Population factors:
1. **L1 Interference:** Hindi-medium students often struggle with the "be + V3" English structure as passive voice is constructed differently in Hindi (using "jaana"/to go).
2. **English Proficiency:** In low-resource settings, English is often taught as a set of rote rules; switching between Simple Past (A) and Present Perfect (B) within the same item increases cognitive load and trigger-word confusion.
3. **Open-ended Recall:** Without a word bank or multiple-choice options, students must recall the specific auxiliary "was," which is a frequent point of failure.

Step 4: Holistic analysis:
While "The chef" is a relatively simple sentence, the transition to passive voice is one of the most error-prone areas for Grade 8 ESL learners. Systematic errors in tense selection (is vs. was) and the frequent omission of the "be" verb significantly reduce the success rate.
