Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Recall the formula for the area of a triangle ($A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$).
2. Substitute the values 8 and 6 into the variables $b$ and $h$.
3. Perform the calculation (either $\frac{1}{2} \times 48$, or $(\frac{1}{2} \times 8) \times 6$, etc.).
4. Assign the correct unit ($\text{cm}^2$).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
*   **Formula confusion (Overgeneralization):** Using the formula for the area of a rectangle ($A = b \times h$) by omitting the $1/2$. This is the most common "bug" in triangle geometry.
*   **Fractional processing bug:** Treating $\frac{1}{2}$ as a constant to be added rather than multiplied, or miscalculating the product ($8 \times 6 = 42$ or $48/2 = 12$ through division errors).
*   **Concept substitution:** Adding the base and height ($8 + 6$) or calculating perimeter ($8+6+?$ or $8+8+6+6$).
*   **Unit omission:** Writing 24 without the required area unit, though the rubric suggests a focus on the numerical value/formula.

Step 3: Population considerations:
*   **Recall vs. Recognition:** Grade 7 students often struggle to recall formulas compared to selecting them in multiple-choice formats.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the terms "base" (आधार) and "height" (ऊंचाई) are familiar, but if the instruction is exclusively in English, processing the prompt introduces a secondary cognitive load.
*   **Instructional context:** In many low-resource settings, procedural memorization is high, but the distinction between $b \times h$ and $1/2 \times b \times h$ is a frequent point of failure.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While the numbers are simple (multiples of 2), the "forgetting the $1/2$" bug and multiplication/division errors among weaker students typically result in a significant portion of the cohort failing to provide a fully correct answer in an open-ended format.
