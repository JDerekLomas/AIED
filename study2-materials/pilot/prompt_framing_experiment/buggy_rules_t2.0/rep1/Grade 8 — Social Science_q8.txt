Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Language Decoding: Translate the English prompt into Hindi/native conceptual framework.
2. Domain-Specific Retrieval: Search long-term memory for the specific "civics" schema related to "Indian Constitution."
3. Filtering/Constraint Satisfaction: Distinguish "key features" (structural principles) from general "history" (e.g., BR Ambedkar, 1950) or "rights" (though Rights are a feature).
4. Selection: Identify one specific term that satisfies the rubric's categorical requirements.
5. Translation/Encoding: Re-encode the concept into an English term (or recognizable phonetic approximation) for the written response.

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
1. Association Bug: Providing a name/date associated with the Constitution instead of a structural feature (e.g., "B.R. Ambedkar" or "26 January").
2. Component-for-Whole Bug: Defining what the Constitution *is* (a book of rules) rather than its *features*.
3. Language Encoding Bug: Incorrectly translating a known concept (e.g., knowing the concept of "all religions are equal" but being unable to retrieve the technical English term "Secularism").
4. "List-making" vs. "Feature" Bug: Students often confuse the preamble’s opening words with the features of the document.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Economically Weaker Section (EWS) Context: Limited access to supplementary reading or academic English at home.
2. English Medium Transition: For Hindi-medium background students in an English-instruction system, technical vocabulary (Federalism, Judiciary) acts as a high barrier compared to conceptual understanding.
3. Open-Ended Format: No scaffolding or options (recognition vs. recall) significantly lowers performance compared to multiple-choice.
4. Rubric Generosity: The rubric only requires *one* feature, which mitigates the difficulty of the open-ended format.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is central to the Grade 8 curriculum, the linguistic leap and the necessity of recalling a specific technical term without cues in a second language poses a significant challenge for this demographic. However, the popularity of the "Fundamental Rights" answer usually serves as a safety net.
