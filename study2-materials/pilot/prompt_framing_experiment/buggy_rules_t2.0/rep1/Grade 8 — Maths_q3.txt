Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the English text to identify set quantities (4 black, 6 white).
2. Calculate the sample space size ($n(S)$) by adding favorable and non-favorable outcomes ($4 + 6 = 10$).
3. Identify the number of favorable outcomes ($n(E) = 4$).
4. Apply the probability formula ($P(E) = \frac{n(E)}{n(S)}$).
5. (Optional but common) Reduce the fraction or convert to decimal ($4/10 = 2/5 = 0.4$).

Step 2: Buggy Rules/Systematic Errors:
1. **Ratio Error (Odds for vs. Probability):** Using $4/6$ (favorable/unfavorable) instead of $4/10$.
2. **"Larger as Whole" Bias:** Using $6/10$ simply because 6 is the larger number in the prompt.
3. **Denominator Neglect:** Providing the answer as "4" (treating probability as frequency).
4. **Operation Confusion:** Multiplying quantities ($4 \times 6 = 24$) or subtracting ($6 - 4 = 2$) due to lack of conceptual anchor.

Step 3: Population Considerations:
- **Language Barrier:** English-medium questions for Hindi-medium learners often lead to "keyword picking" (picking the first/last number mentioned) rather than deep structural comprehension.
- **Cognitive Load:** In an open-ended format without a provided formula, students often default to additive thinking rather than proportional reasoning.
- **Resource Constraints:** In low-SES government school contexts, probability is often taught last in the curriculum and may be rushed or skipped, leading to weak recall.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment:
While the math is basic (addition and division), the shift from discrete counting to ratios is a significant hurdle in Grade 8. Language interference and the common "Odds" bug (4/6) significantly reduce the success rate.
