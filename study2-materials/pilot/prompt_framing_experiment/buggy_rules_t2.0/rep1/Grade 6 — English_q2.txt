Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the syntax and vocabulary of the question ("Who", "lived", "inside").
2. Retrieve the specific narrative detail from memory (long-term memory or reading passage).
3. Formulate a conceptual answer (Identifying the subject: "fairy").
4. Translate the conceptual answer into English.
5. Apply English syntax and morphological rules (subject-verb agreement or sentence structure).
6. Encode the orthography (spelling "magical" and "fairy").

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules" (Systematic procedural errors)
1. Semantic Over-generalization: If "fairy" is unknown, substituting a known supernatural entity (e.g., "ghost," "angel").
2. L1-L2 Mapping Error: Transferring Hindi syntax (Subject-Object-Verb) to the answer, resulting in word-order confusion.
3. Orthographic approximation: Phonetic spelling of English words (e.g., "fary", "fairi", "majical") which might be marked wrong depending on the strictness of the teacher, despite conceptual accuracy.
4. "Key-word Matching" Bug: If the student sees "lived," they may search the text/memory for any noun associated with "living," potentially selecting a setting (the shelf) or the owner of the book (the child).
5. Literalism/World Knowledge Interference: Thinking logically about what is usually inside books (words, pictures) rather than the fictional context.

Step 3: Target population considerations
The students face a "double burden": retrieving a specific narrative fact (recall vs. recognition) while simultaneously navigating a language barrier. English as a second/third language introduces significant friction between having the correct idea and expressing it in the format the rubric demands. Grade 6 students from economically weaker backgrounds often have gaps in spelling and academic vocabulary.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
The reliance on recall rather than multiple choice, combined with the low English proficiency and specific spelling requirements for "fairy," suggests a significant drop-off in "fully correct" responses. While many might know the answer is a fairy, the procedural hurdles of spelling and English sentence construction will filter out many students.
