Step 1: Procedural Steps
1.  **Cross-multiplication**: Multiply the numerator of the left side by the denominator of the right side, and vice versa.
2.  **Setting up the Equality**: Correctly placing the equals sign between $5(x-5)$ and $3(x-3)$.
3.  **Distribution**: Applying the distributive property correctly to both sets of parentheses ($5 \cdot x$ AND $5 \cdot -5$; $3 \cdot x$ AND $3 \cdot -3$).
4.  **Variable Isolation/Transposition**: Moving $x$ terms to one side and constants to the other (requires correct sign changes during the "bridge" crossing).
5.  **Arithmetic Simplification**: Performing $25 - 9$ (or equivalent) and $5x - 3x$.
6.  **Division**: Dividing the constant by the coefficient of $x$ to find the final value.

Step 2: Potential "Buggy Rules"
*   **Incomplete Distribution**: $5(x-5) \rightarrow 5x - 5$. (Commonly called "forgot to multiply the second term").
*   **Sign Errors during Transposition**: Changing $5x - 3x = 25 - 9$ to $5x + 3x = 25 - 9$ or $5x - 3x = -9 - 25$.
*   **Reciprocal Error**: Solving $2x = 16$ and concluding $x = 2/16$ instead of $16/2$.
*   **Operation Confusion**: Cross-adding or cross-subtracting instead of multiplying.
*   **Equality Misplacement**: Removing the fraction bars but maintaining two separate expressions without an equality link.

Step 3: Population Considerations
*   **EWS/Language Barrier**: In Hindi-medium or low-resource contexts, "cross-multiply" is often taught as a rote trick (the "Vajra-gunan" method). If the student forgets the visual pattern, they lack the conceptual backing of "multiplying both sides by the LCD" to recover.
*   **Open-ended Format**: There are no cues or options to nudge the student toward the correct range, increasing the likelihood that an arithmetic slip results in a "0" score.
*   **Complexity**: This specific item has symmetry (the numbers 3 and 5 are reused), which can lead to "pattern interference" where students mix up which number goes with which side.

Step 4: Estimation
Given the high cumulative probability of "tripping" over one of the 4–5 procedural hurdles (especially the distribution over the binomial), a significant portion of the cohort will likely produce a "buggy" result despite knowing the initial step.
