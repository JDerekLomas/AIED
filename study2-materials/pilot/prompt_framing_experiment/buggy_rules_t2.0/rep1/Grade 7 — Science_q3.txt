Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English sentence into conceptual meaning (identifying "green," "leaves," and "photosynthesis" as the core triggers).
2. **Conceptual Retrieval**: Access the specific scientific term from long-term memory associated with these triggers.
3. **Phonetic-to-Orthographic Mapping**: Convert the recalled word (likely stored phonetically) into the specific English written string.
4. **Transcription/Execution**: Correctly write the term "Chlorophyll" according to the rubric's specific spelling requirement.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **Semantic Approximation**: Producing a related but incorrect concept (e.g., "Chloroplast" instead of "Chlorophyll," or "Stomata" as a general leaf part).
2. **Phonetic Spelling/Transliteration**: Mapping the Hindi phonetic understanding to English letters inaccurately (e.g., "Klorofil," "Clorofill," "Chlorophyl").
3. **Keyword Matching Bug**: Identifying "photosynthesis" and providing the input/output rather than the catalyst (e.g., answering "Sunlight," "Water," or "Carbon dioxide").
4. **Translation Gap**: Failing to bridge the gap between the Hindi "harit lavak" (chloroplast/pigment context) and the English technical term.

Step 3: Student population context
Grade 7 students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds face high friction in step 3 and 4. While the concept is taught early, the open-ended nature of the question removes "recognition" (where they might pick the correct spelling from a list). The complex spelling of "Chlorophyll" (ch, ph, y, double l) is a high-hurdle task for English Language Learners (ELL).

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that the rubric typically demands a "correct name" and many students will struggle with the specific English spelling or confuse the pigment with the organelle (Chloroplast), a significant portion of students who understand the concept will still fail to produce the precise technical term in English.
