Step 1: The mathematical concepts and skills required are null. This is an English Literature/Reading Comprehension item. To solve it, a student must exercise logical extraction of a central theme from a text and qualitative evaluation of "importance."

Step 2: While no mathematical misconceptions apply, common cognitive/literacy misconceptions include:
- "Literalism": Looking for the exact word "important" in the poem rather than inferring the theme (leads to incorrect or blank answers if the word isn't there).
- "Personal preference vs. textual evidence": Answering what is important to the student personally rather than the poet (leads to incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The rubric is extremely generous, awarding full marks for a general theme without requiring textual evidence. For students from economically weaker sections, the concept of "friendship" or "blessings" is culturally familiar and socially significant.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- Language barrier: ESL/Hindi-medium background makes interpreting poetic English significantly harder than prose. 
- Open-ended format: No cues or options to guess from.
- Subjective phrasing: "Most important" requires higher-order synthesis.
- Fractional scoring: The 1.5-mark weight suggests it is viewed as a medium-difficulty interpretive task.

Step 5: Given the lenient rubric which accepts general thematic mentions, many students will gain marks if they can identify one positive keyword from the poem. However, the language barrier for Hindi-medium students remains the primary obstacle to basic comprehension.
