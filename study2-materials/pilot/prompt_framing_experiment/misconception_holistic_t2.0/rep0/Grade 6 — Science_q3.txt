Step 1: The question is labeled as "Science," but the underlying analytical skill involves categorization, comparison, and structured presentation (differentiation). Students must retrieve scientific facts from memory and organize them into a comparative framework.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Equating "living" solely with movement (leading to classifying vehicles as living).
- Missing "unseen" processes (believing plants don't breathe because they don't have noses).
- Classifying once-living items (wood/leather) as currently living or as a third category. 
- These misconceptions would lead to incorrect answers if the student uses "movement" for a non-living car or fails to identify a valid characteristic for plants.

Step 3: Ease factors:
- The context is highly familiar; this is a foundational topic taught since primary grades.
- The rubric is extremely lenient, requiring only *one* valid characteristic of living things for full marks despite the prompt asking for two of each.
- In Hindi-medium contexts, the concepts of "Sajeiv" (Living) and "Nirjeiv" (Non-living) are deeply ingrained culturally.

Step 4: Hardness factors:
- English language barrier: "Differentiate" and "characteristics" are Tier-2 academic vocabulary that may confuse ESL learners.
- Open-ended format requires sentence construction rather than recognition (MCQ).
- The "two key characteristics for each" instruction in the prompt is significantly more cognitively demanding than the rubric suggests.

Step 5: While the prompt asks for four points of data (2+2), the rubric only scores one point. Given the leniency of the scoring guide and the fundamental nature of the topic, even with language barriers, a large majority of students will be able to identify at least one characteristic like "growth" or "breathing."
