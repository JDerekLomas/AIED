Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, the "mathematical" reasoning involved relates to logical categorization and proportionality. Students must understand the set "All citizens" and the operator "Equality" (Identity property), meaning treatment $(x)$ should be applied equally regardless of variables like caste, gender, or religion.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Equality as Sameness (Numerical Equality):** Thinking everyone must get exactly the same outcome regardless of need (e.g., giving a tall person and a short person the same height stool). On this item, this might lead to a correct but simplistic answer.
*   **Legal vs. Social Reality:** Confusing what the law *guarantees* with what happens in reality. If a student describes inequality they see daily, they might fail to define the *constitutional* principle.
*   **Conflation with Reservations:** Thinking equality means "extra help" for specific groups only (Equity vs. Equality). This might lead to an answer that misses the universal guarantee.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Generous Rubric:** The rubric is very lenient; students only need *either* an explanation *or* an example to get the full point. This "OR" logic significantly lowers the bar for success.
*   **Familiar Context:** Equality (Sabka Saath, Equality in voting/Mid-day meals) is a heavily emphasized theme in Grade 7 NCERT textbooks.
*   **No Multi-step Calculation:** There is no arithmetic or complex symbolic logic required.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** The instruction "guaranteed in the Indian Constitution" uses complex academic English which may intimidate Hindi-medium students.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options (MCQ), students must recall and construct a sentence, which is difficult for those with limited English proficiency.
*   **Abstract Reasoning:** Moving from a concrete example to a constitutional principle requires higher-order thinking.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
The leniency of the rubric (allowing a simple daily life example like "everyone stands in the same line for voting" to earn full credit) compensates for the linguistic challenges. Grade 7 students in Indian government schools are frequently exposed to the "Right to Equality" as a core pillar of Civics.
