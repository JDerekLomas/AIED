Step 1: Identify the linguistic and cognitive skills required.
To answer this question, a student must possess synonym recognition skills (associating "shining brightly" with "glowing"), contextual reading ability (scanning the text for specific meaning), and vocabulary retrieval. While the prompt asks for "mathematical concepts," in the context of a Grade 6 English item for these specific learners, the "math" is the logic of one-to-one mapping between a definition and a target word.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Contextual Over-reliance:** Students may pick any word related to light (e.g., "sun," "lamp") rather than the adjective/verb describing the action. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Morphological Confusion:** Students might find the word "glow" but not "glowing," or choose a word with a similar suffix but wrong meaning.
*   **Translation Gap:** For Hindi-medium students, the mental translation of "shining brightly" (चमकदार) might lead them to look for "bright" or "shine" rather than the synonym "glowing" if that word is less familiar in their vernacular English.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier:
*   The phrase "shining brightly" uses high-frequency, simple words that most Grade 6 students recognize.
*   The word "glowing" is often taught in elementary nature or science lessons.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   **Language Barrier:** For students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, "glowing" is a tier-2 vocabulary word that may not be used in daily conversation.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without a multiple-choice list, the student must successfully scan and extract the word independently.
*   **Specific Rubric:** The rubric is strict ("glowing"); if the student finds "shining" or "bright" within the passage (even if those words are also present), they may be confused by the task of finding a *synonym* versus a *repetition*.

Step 5: Holistic estimate:
Given the specific demographic (economically weaker sections, Hindi-medium background), "glowing" acts as a significant vocabulary hurdle. While the prompt is simple, the retrieval of a specific synonym from a text without choices is a high-level task for English Language Learners (ELL).
