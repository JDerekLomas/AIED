Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required:
*   Understanding the place value system up to five digits.
*   Conceptual understanding of a "palindrome" (symmetry in digits).
*   Ability to construct specific numbers based on multiple constraints (smallest/largest + 5-digit + palindrome).
*   Addition and subtraction of five-digit numbers involving carrying and borrowing.
*   Careful reading to ensure both "sum" and "difference" are addressed.

Step 2: Common misconceptions:
*   Smallest 5-digit number: Students often confuse 10,000 with 10,001 (as 10,000 is not a palindrome). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   Place value errors in subtraction: Standard errors in "borrowing" across multiple zeros. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   Confusion with "0": Some might think 00000 is the smallest or that a 5-digit number can start with 0.

Step 3: Factors that make it easier:
*   The concept of "Largest" 5-digit number (99,999) is highly practiced and is also a palindrome, making half the problem straightforward.
*   Basic operations (addition/subtraction) are well-rehearsed by Grade 6.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder:
*   Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, the word "palindrome" is a technical term that might not be used frequently in colloquial English or basic textbooks without its Hindi equivalent (*vipsyaya* or *anulom-vilom sankhya*).
*   The "hidden" step: Students must generate the numbers themselves before performing operations; no numbers are provided in the prompt.
*   The multi-part requirement: The question asks for both sum and difference, but the rubric provided only allocates 1 mark and mentions the sum, which might confuse students regarding how much work is needed for "full" credit.
*   Threshold logic: Finding 10,001 requires checking 10,000 and realizing it isn't a palindrome, then moving to 10,101 or 10,001 (finding the minimal change).

Step 5: Holistic estimation:
While the operations are simple, the vocabulary ("palindrome") and the requirement to self-generate two specific 5-digit numbers create significant hurdles for students with limited English and conceptual gaps in number theory. Many will provide only one part of the answer or fail to identify 10,001 correctly.
