Step 1: The item is a Social Science (Geography) question, not a mathematical one. However, in terms of cognitive skills, it requires identifying a process of transformation (cause and effect) and logical sequencing.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include the idea that rocks are "dead" and never change, or that changes only occur through heat (volcanoes) rather than the "cold" process of weathering. In this specific item, many students might believe rocks must melt to change form, leading to an incorrect focus on metamorphic or igneous processes rather than sedimentation.

Step 3: Ease factors: The topic "Rock Cycle" is a core, repeated part of the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum. The rubric is generous, requiring only two key steps (breaking down and moving) for full credit.

Step 4: Hardness factors: 
- Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students, technical terms like "igneous" and "sedimentary" are phonetically difficult and hard to distinguish in English. 
- Format: It is an open-ended "Explain" question requiring sentence construction, which is a major barrier for students with limited English proficiency.
- Concept density: "Weathering" and "Erosion" are often conflated by students.

Step 5: While the concept is foundational, the combination of an open-ended format and the technical English terminology required for economically disadvantaged/Hindi-medium students makes this a challenging item for high-quality production, though many may earn partial credit if the rubric is applied leniently by teachers.
