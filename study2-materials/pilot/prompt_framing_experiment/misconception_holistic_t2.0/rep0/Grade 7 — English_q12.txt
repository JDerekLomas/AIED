Step 1: Identify the linguistic and grammatical concepts and skills required.
*   Identification of Subject (The wind), Verb (blew), and Object (the leaves).
*   Knowledge of the past participle form of the irregular verb "to blow" (blown).
*   Knowledge of the auxiliary verb "were" to match the plural object "leaves" in the past tense.
*   Structural transformation: Object + be-verb + V3 + by + Subject.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions/errors students at this grade level hold.
*   **Verb Tense/Form:** Using "blowed" instead of "blown" (Irregular verb confusion). **Incorrect answer.**
*   **Subject-Verb Agreement:** Using "was" instead of "were" with "leaves". **Incorrect answer.**
*   **Tense mismatch:** Using "are blown" (present) instead of "were blown" (past). **Incorrect answer.**
*   **Inversion failure:** Keeping the subject at the start. **Incorrect answer.**
*   **Vocabulary/Translation:** For Hindi-medium students, the passive "by the wind" doesn't always translate naturally to their spoken syntax.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier:
*   The sentence is short and contains high-frequency vocabulary (wind, leaves).
*   "Away" is a common adverbial particle that usually stays at the end, making the structure relatively straightforward.
*   Active to Passive is a heavily drilled topic in the Class 7 curriculum.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   **Irregular Verb:** "Blew/Blown" is more difficult than regular verbs (e.g., played/called). Many students will write "blowed."
*   **No Scaffolding:** There are no options (MCQs) to prompt the correct verb form or auxiliary choice.
*   **Plurality:** Students often default to the singular "was," forgetting that the new subject ("the leaves") is plural.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, identifying the object vs. the adverbial "away" can be confusing.

Step 5: Weighing factors holistically.
Given the reliance on irregular verb forms (blown) and subject-verb agreement (were), many students in these contexts will provide a "near-miss" answer (e.g., "The leaves was blowed away"). Strict rubric adherence for a 1-mark item usually results in a lower success rate in government school settings.
