Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a reading comprehension task based on the NCERT textbook story "The Three Questions." While labeled "English," in a cross-curricular or foundational literacy context, it requires logical sequencing (cause and effect) and extracting information from a text. 

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Literalism vs. Inference: Students may confuse "what" happened (he offered gold) with "why" it happened (the need for answers). On this item, it likely leads to an incomplete but perhaps partially correct answer.
*   Misunderstanding "Reward": In an EWS context, students may equate rewards solely with material wealth rather than the intent behind the gesture.
*   Language barrier: Translating the thought "answers sought" from Hindi to the English phrase "to answer his three questions" is a high cognitive load for ESL learners.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   Familiar Context: "The Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy is a standard, highly emphasized story in Grade 7 Hindi-medium and English-medium government schools.
*   Keywords: The word "reward" is a high-frequency vocabulary word in school contexts.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Language Barrier: As mentioned, expressing the reason in English is difficult for Hindi-medium students.
*   Open-ended format: No multiple-choice options to trigger recognition; requires active recall and sentence construction.
*   Rubric Rigidity: If the evaluator looks for specific English phrasing ("to find someone who could..."), many students may lose marks due to grammar errors despite knowing the story.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
The story is central to the curriculum, and even with low English proficiency, most students will recognize the plot point. However, the requirement to produce an English sentence independently reduces the success rate.
