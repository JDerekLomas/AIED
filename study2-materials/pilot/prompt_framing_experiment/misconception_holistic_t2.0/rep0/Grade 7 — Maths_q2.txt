### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Variable Isolation:** Understanding that $x$ represents an unknown quantity that must be isolated on one side of the equation.
*   **Inverse Operations:** Applying subtraction (inverse of addition) and division (inverse of multiplication).
*   **Arithmetic Proficiency:** Basic subtraction ($10 - 2$) and division ($8 \div 4$).
*   **Procedural Knowledge:** The correct sequence of operations (shifting the constant before the coefficient).

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Order of Operations Error:** Some students might try to divide by 4 before subtracting 2. *Effect on this item:* Leads to an incorrect answer ($10 \div 4 - 2$ or similar).
*   **Operator Confusion:** Adding 2 to both sides instead of subtracting ($4x = 12$). *Effect on this item:* Incorrect answer ($x=3$).
*   **Concatenation Misconception:** Treating $4x$ as $4+x$. *Effect on this item:* Incorrect answer.
*   **Right-Side Neglect:** Performing the operation only on the left side. *Effect on this item:* Incorrect answer.

### Step 3: Factors Making the Item Easier
*   **Simple Whole Numbers:** The result of each step ($10-2=8$ and $8\div4=2$) yields a small, positive integer. No fractions or negative numbers are involved.
*   **Familiar Structure:** The "linear equation in one variable" is a standard Chapter 4 topic in Grade 7 NCERT/State Board textbooks.
*   **Minimal English:** The phrase "Solve the following equation" is highly repetitive and likely taught as a "trigger phrase" in Hindi-medium or low-English-proficiency classrooms.

### Step 4: Factors Making the Item Harder
*   **Open-ended Format:** There are no multiple-choice options to help students "back-solve" by plugging in numbers.
*   **Two-Step Process:** Unlike $x + 2 = 10$, this requires two distinct logical steps. For students from weaker sections, lack of consistent practice on multi-step logic can be a barrier.

### Step 5: Holistic Weighting
While the multi-step nature introduces potential for error, this specific item is the most "friendly" version of a two-step equation. The numbers are deliberately chosen for "perfect" divisibility, which provides a psychological cue to the student that they are on the right track. In many Indian government school settings, this exact format is heavily drilled as a fundamental skill.
