Step 1: This is a Social Science (History) question. While not mathematical, it requires cognitive skills in chronological sequencing, identifying cause-and-effect relationships, and articulating historical transitions. 

Step 2: Common misconceptions include the belief that the British military invaded India all at once rather than through a gradual commercial-to-political shift, or confusing the British Crown directly with the East India Company. However, given the specific rubric requires only mentioning that they "arrived as traders" to get the 1 mark, most misconceptions about the *wars* would not prevent a correct answer here.

Step 3: This is a core narrative taught repeatedly in Grade 8 History (NCERT/State boards). The context is highly familiar as the "Trade to Territory" chapter is foundational. The rubric is extremely generous; students only need to identify the starting point (traders/factories) to earn the maximum 1 point, even if they fail to describe the full "process."

Step 4: The English-language phrasing ("Describe the process") and open-ended format are significant hurdles for Hindi-medium/ESL students. Describing a complex historical transition is difficult; however, the rubric significantly lowers the barrier by only requiring a mention of their initial status.

Step 5: Despite language barriers, the specific requirement of the rubric is low enough that a student with even basic memorization of the chapter title or introductory paragraph can score the point.
