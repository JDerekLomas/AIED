**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Properties of Parallelograms:** Understanding that opposite angles are equal ($x = 110^\circ$) and consecutive/adjacent angles are supplementary ($x + y = 180^\circ$ or $110^\circ + y = 180^\circ$).
*   **Angle Sum Property:** Alternatively, knowing the total sum of angles in a quadrilateral is $360^\circ$.
*   **Algebraic computation:** Simple subtraction ($180 - 110 = 70$) to find $y$.
*   **Communication:** Providing a written explanation/reasoning (e.g., "Opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal").

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Confusing Parallelograms with Rectangles:** Assuming all angles must be $90^\circ$. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Misidentifying Relationship:** Thinking adjacent angles are equal instead of supplementary. (Would lead to $y=110$).
*   **Linear Pair confusion:** Using $180$ for opposite angles. (Would lead to $x=70$).
*   **Visual Guessing:** Estimating based on how "sharp" or "wide" the angle looks rather than using geometric properties.

**Step 3: Factors making the item easier**
*   **Simple Numbers:** $110$ is a "friendly" number to work with; subtraction from $180$ is a standard drill.
*   **Standard Shape:** The parallelogram is a foundational shape in Grade 8 geometry in India (NCERT curriculum).
*   **Visual cues:** In most diagrams, the relationship between $110$ and $x$ as opposite is visually intuitive.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the phrase "Please find the angles... for point B and C" might be confusing if the diagram is not clearly labeled with these vertices.
*   **Requirement of Explanation:** The rubric requires an "explanation." Students from economically weaker sections often struggle with formal mathematical "proof language" in English, even if they know the numerical answer.
*   **Double Requirement:** Finding both $x$ and $y$ correctly within a 1-point limit makes the item "all or nothing," increasing the difficulty compared to a multiple-choice question.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
While the calculation is straightforward, the combination of providing a written explanation in a second language and the high probability of mixing up "opposite" vs. "adjacent" properties among Grade 8 students leads to a moderate success rate.
