Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science/Civics item, not a mathematical one. However, the cognitive skills required include logical reasoning (cause and effect), understanding hierarchical structures (Citizen -> Parliament -> Law), and the ability to synthesize abstract political concepts into a written explanation.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **The Prime Minister/President makes all laws:** Students often believe a single leader has total authority. This would lead to an incorrect answer as it bypasses the role of Parliament.
*   **Parliament is just a building:** A literal interpretation rather than a functional one. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **The Police/Court makes laws:** Confusion between the legislature, executive, and judiciary. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Voting is the only part of democracy:** Focusing solely on the act of elections without understanding the representative body it creates.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Core Curriculum:** The relationship between democracy and parliament is a central pillar of the Grade 8 NCERT syllabus.
*   **High Frequency:** This is a "standard" question often practiced in classroom sets and previous exams.
*   **Flexible Rubric:** The rubric allows for "law-making" OR "representation," giving two pathways to a correct answer.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, articulating "representation" or "legislative functions" in English is a significant hurdle. They may understand the concept but lack the specific English vocabulary to satisfy the rubric.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options to choose from (MCQ), students must generate the technical terms from memory.
*   **Abstract Reasoning:** Moving from the concrete "I vote" to the abstract "Parliament represents the collective will" is cognitively demanding for 13-14 year olds.

Step 5: Estimate of correct responses.
Given the English proficiency constraints and the open-ended nature of the response, many students will provide partial or circular answers (e.g., "It is necessary for democracy to run"). However, since "making laws" is a memorized fact for many, a fair portion will succeed.
