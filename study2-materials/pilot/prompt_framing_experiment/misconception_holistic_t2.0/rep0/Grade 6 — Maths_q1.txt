### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Definition of Factors:** Understanding that a factor is a number that divides 68 without leaving a remainder.
*   **Divisibility Rules:** Knowledge of rules for 2 (even numbers) and 4 (last two digits).
*   **Multiplication/Division Fluency:** Proficiency in basic facts and mental math.
*   **Systematic Listing:** The ability to find factor pairs ($1 \times 68, 2 \times 34$, etc.) to ensure no factors are missed.
*   **Handling Composite Numbers:** Identifying 68 as an even, composite number.

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Confusing Factors with Multiples:** Students may list $68, 136, 204...$ (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Incomplete Search:** Finding $1, 2, 68$ but stopping before identifying 17 or 34. (Leads to 0 marks per rubric).
*   **Prime Number Confusion:** Assuming all "difficult" looking numbers are prime. Some might assume 17 is a factor but fail to see $17 \times 4$.
*   **Multiplication Errors:** Mistakenly believing $4 \times 16 = 68$ or similar. (Leads to incorrect answer).

### Step 3: Factors that make the item easier
*   **Even Number:** 68 is even, so 1, 2, and 68 are immediately accessible to most Grade 6 students.
*   **Standard Wording:** The phrase "Write all the factors of..." is standard textbook language and highly practiced in Indian classrooms.
*   **Small Absolute Value:** 68 is not an excessively large number, making long division or trial multiplication feasible on rough sheets.

### Step 4: Factors that make it harder
*   **"Hidden" Factors (17 and 34):** 17 is a prime number that many students haven't memorized the multiplication table for. Most students stop testing after 10 or 12.
*   **Strict Rubric:** 1 mark for the *full* list with no partial credit for an incomplete list. This is the biggest hurdle; missing just the number "17" results in a score of 0.
*   **Open-ended:** No options to prompt their memory or guide their logic.
*   **Language Barrier:** While "Factor" is "गुणनखंड" (Gunankhand) in Hindi, students in English-medium or transitional govt schools may mix up "factor" and "multiple."

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is foundational, the specific number 68 is tricky because it relies on the 17-times table, which is poorly mastered. In a government school setting where rote memorization often misses these middle-tier prime factors, many students will provide an incomplete list ($1, 2, 34, 68$).
