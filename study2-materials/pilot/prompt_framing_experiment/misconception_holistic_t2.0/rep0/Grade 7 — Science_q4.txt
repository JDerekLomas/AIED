Step 1: Identify the mathematical/scientific concepts and skills required.
*   **Scientific Principles:** Understanding the properties of light and heat—specifically, that light colors reflect radiant heat while dark colors absorb it.
*   **Logical Reasoning:** Establishing a cause-and-effect relationship between fabric property (reflectivity) and human comfort (temperature regulation).
*   **Linguistic Expression:** Communicating technical observations in English, which involves translating "absorb" vs. "reflect" into a second language.

Step 2: List the common misconceptions.
*   **Misconception 1: Light colors "contain" coolness.** Students might think the fabric itself is inherently cold rather than reflecting external heat. This might lead to an answer, but perhaps one lacking "scientific reasons."
*   **Misconception 2: Heat vs. Light.** Confusion between solar radiation (light) and temperature (heat). This generally doesn't prevent a correct answer but may lead to imprecise phrasing.
*   **Misconception 3: Breathability vs. Color.** Students often conflate the properties of "cotton" (sweat absorption) with the properties of "color." Since the question asks for properties related to the *fabric* (plural), they might only focus on sweat, missing the color aspect required by the prompt.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** Wearing light cotton in the Indian summer is a daily reality for these students; the context is highly relatable.
*   **Low Linguistic Barrier for the Answer:** The rubric allows for informal phrasing ("bounce off," "don't get as hot"), which lowers the threshold for students with limited English.
*   **Open Rubric:** The requirement for a "plausible reason" is relatively generous.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier (Input):** While the answer can be simple, the question itself contains academic vocabulary ("preference," "stating," "properties") which may intimidate ESL learners.
*   **Requirement for TWO reasons:** If the student only provides one reason (e.g., only mentioning sweat absorption), they fail according to the strict wording of the prompt, even if the rubric only mentions color.
*   **Productive Language:** Because it is not multiple-choice, students must construct a sentence. Hindi-medium students often struggle with English sentence structure even if they understand the science.

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.
While the science is intuitive and part of daily life, the requirement to produce a two-part written explanation in English is a significant barrier for Grade 7 students from Hindi-medium, economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Many will know *why* (it's cooler/sweat), but struggle to frame "scientific reasons related to properties."
