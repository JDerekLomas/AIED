### Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required
*   **Conversion:** Converting mixed fractions (mixed numbers) into improper fractions.
*   **Multiplication Algorithm:** Multiplying two fractions (multiplying numerators and denominators separately).
*   **Simplification/Reconversion:** Converting the resulting improper fraction back into a mixed fraction.
*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Knowledge of multiplication tables (specifically 2, 3, 4, and 13).

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Additive Strategy:** Students might add the whole numbers and then multiply the fractions ($1 \times 3$ and $1/2 \times 1/4 = 3\ 1/8$). **Leads to incorrect answer.**
*   **Component Multiplication:** Multiplying the whole number by the whole number, and numerator by numerator ($1 \times 3$, $1 \times 1$, $2 \times 4$). **Leads to incorrect answer.**
*   **Ignoring Conversion:** Treating the whole number as a separate multiplier for only one part of the fraction. **Leads to incorrect answer.**
*   **Computational Error in Reconversion:** Correctly reaching $39/8$ but failing to divide correctly to reach $4\ 7/8$. **Leads to incorrect answer.**

### Step 3: Factors making the item easier
*   **Simple Numbers:** The integers involved (1, 2, 3, 4) are small and familiar; most students know the $13 \times 3$ multiplication fact or can calculate it quickly.
*   **Standard Procedural Task:** This is a "bread and butter" problem type in Grade 7 Indian textbooks (NCERT), making it highly practiced.
*   **Direct Language:** Even with limited English proficiency, the command "Multiply" is one of the most recognized math terms for Hindi-medium students.

### Step 4: Factors making the item harder
*   **Three-Step Process:** The student must successfully execute conversion $\rightarrow$ multiplication $\rightarrow$ reconversion without a single arithmetic slip.
*   **Format:** It is an open-ended/constructed-response item. There are no options to "cue" the student or allow for working backward.
*   **"Mixed Fraction" phrasing:** If a student provides $39/8$ (an improper fraction), the rubric suggests a score of 0 because it specifies expressing the answer as a mixed fraction. This specific constraint often leads to point loss even if the "math" of multiplication was understood.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the calculation is simple, the requirement to perform a three-step transformation (mixed to improper, multiply, then back to mixed) is where many students from disadvantaged backgrounds stumble due to "leaky" procedural fluency or lack of attention to the final format required by the prompt.
