Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
Strictly speaking, this is a Social Science/History-Culture item, not a mathematical one. However, it requires skills in pattern recognition (visual cues in the image), retrieval of factual data, and linguistic articulation. In the context of a student from an economically weaker background, the "mental computation" involved is identifying cultural signifiers.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
A common misconception at this level is conflating similar-looking festivals (e.g., Teej vs. Gangaur). Because both involve processions, traditional Rajasthani attire, and idols of Gauri, students might identify the wrong regional festival. Since the rubric specifically looks for "Gangaur" or "Dhinga Gavar," an answer of "Teej" would lead to an incorrect result.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
Context familiarity: For students in Rajasthan, Gangaur is a highly visible, public cultural event. The "cultural capital" of the students compensates for any lack of formal academic language.
Visual prompt: A picture provides a direct stimulus that bypasses some English-language reading hurdles.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
Linguistic barrier: Students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds may struggle to "describe how people celebrate it" in English, even if they recognize the image. 
Subjective scoring vs. Rubric: While the rubric identifies the name of the festival, the question asks for a description. If a student identifies it correctly in Hindi but cannot write the description in English, they may lose marks depending on the grader's flexibility. 
Low reward: The maximum score of 0.5 for a two-part question (identify + describe) is demotivating and high-effort for a very small return.

Step 5: Holistically, while many students will recognize the festival due to cultural proximity, the requirement to describe the process (likely in English) for a very small fraction of a point creates a significant barrier.
