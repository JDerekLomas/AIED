Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science (Geography) item, the cognitive skills involve classification and identifying causal variables. In a mathematical sense, it requires understanding the concept of a "factor"—a single independent variable that contributes to a specific outcome (soil formation).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Mixing up Soil Layers and Factors:** Students often confuse soil profile (layers like Topsoil, Subsoil) with the factors that form them. (Likely incorrect)
*   **Environmental Action vs. Factor:** Students might describe a process (e.g., "rain hitting rocks") rather than naming the formal factor ("Climate"). (Might be marked correct if the examiner is lenient, but technically incorrect based on strict rubric terminology).
*   **Confusing Soil Erosion with Formation:** Students often substitute factors like "deforestation" or "wind" (causes of erosion) for formation factors. (Incorrect)

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Direct Rote Learning:** This is a classic "fill-in-the-blank" style memory question heavily emphasized in Indian NCERT textbooks.
*   **Short Answer:** Only one word (e.g., "Time" or "Rock") is required, which mitigates the English language barrier.
*   **High Familiarity:** Soil formation is a core topic in Grade 7 and 8 Geography in India.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Vocabulary:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may know the concept (e.g., *samay* for Time) but struggle to recall the specific English term required in an English-medium test.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options (MCQ), students must recall the term from scratch rather than recognizing it.

Step 5: Proportion of correct answers.
Given the emphasis on rote memorization in the Indian curriculum and the simplicity of the single-word answers (especially "Time" or "Climate"), many students will be able to provide at least one factor.
