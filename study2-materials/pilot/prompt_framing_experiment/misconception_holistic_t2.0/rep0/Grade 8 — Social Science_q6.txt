Step 1: The question is labeled as "Subject: Social Science," but the task instructions ask to identify "mathematical concepts." Strictly speaking, there are no mathematical concepts. However, from a cognitive load perspective, the task requires categorical classification and causal reasoning (identifying $A+B \rightarrow C$).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include conflating "Nation" with "Government," confusing the timeline of the French Revolution with the 19th-century movements, or misidentifying nationalist sentiment as religious fervor. On this specific item, these would lead to incorrect answers as they violate the "19th century" or "Europe" constraints.

Step 3: Ease factors: The French Revolution is a pillar of the Grade 8 Social Science curriculum in India. The "liberty and equality" keywords are highly rehearsed. 

Step 4: Hardship factors: 
- **Language Barrier:** "Nationalist sentiment" and "contributed" are sophisticated vocabulary for ESL/Hindi-medium students. 
- **Recall vs. Recognition:** As an open-ended question without options, it requires active retrieval, which is harder than recognition.
- **Syntactic Complexity:** The structure of the sentence may confuse students with low English proficiency.
- **Double Requirement:** The prompt asks for *two* factors, but the rubric mentions explaining *one* to get the mark, and the maximum score is only 1. This inconsistency can lead to incomplete responses.

Step 5: For students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency, the barrier is rarely the history itself, but the ability to articulate complex sociopolitical abstract concepts in written English. Many students will know the "French Revolution" as a phrase but may struggle to explain *how* it contributed in English.
