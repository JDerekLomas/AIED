Step 1: Identifying the linguistic concepts and skills required.
1. Identification of Subject, Verb, and Object (SVO) in two different tenses: Simple Past and Present Perfect.
2. Understanding of the passive voice structure: Object + auxiliary verb "to be" (in the correct tense) + Past Participle (V3) + by + Subject.
3. Specific mastery of "was/were" for Simple Past and "has/have been" for Present Perfect.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold.
1. Subject-Object confusion: Difficulty identifying "A delicious meal" or "The true Successor" as a single unit to move to the front. (Applicable here).
2. Tense preservation error: Using "is" instead of "was" in Sentence A, or omitting "been" in Sentence B. (Applicable here).
3. Incorrect V3 form: Forgetting that "prepared" and "found" stay the same or change according to participle rules. (Applicable here).
4. Direct translation: Trying to translate word-for-word from Hindi/vernacular, which follows a different passive structure. (Applicable here).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
1. Common vocabulary: "Chef," "meal," and "king" are standard textbook vocabulary.
2. Structure: These are "standard" sentences with clear SVO patterns.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
1. Linguistic background: For Hindi-medium students, the distinction between active and passive is often taught through rote formulas rather than conceptual understanding, making the transition difficult.
2. Complexity of Sentence B: The Present Perfect tense ("has found") is significantly harder for Grade 8 students to convert than the Simple Past.
3. Open-ended/Production format: There are no options to choose from; the student must generate the entire sentence structure from memory.
4. Language Barrier: For economically weaker sections, exposure to English syntax outside of limited school hours is minimal.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
The rubric requires a "maximum score" for Sentence A, but implies Sentence B is also part of the item. Even if only Sentence A is graded for 1 point, the requirement to produce the correct auxiliary verb ("was") and maintain word order without cues is a significant barrier for students with limited English proficiency.
