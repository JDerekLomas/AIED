### Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required
*   **Knowledge of Formulas:** Recalling the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle ($P = 2 \times (l + b)$) and the area of a rectangle ($A = l \times b$).
*   **Algebraic Manipulation/Reverse Calculation:** Ability to set up an equation or work backward from the perimeter to isolate the unknown width ($w$).
*   **Multi-step Arithmetic:** Executing two distinct operations—finding the width first, then using that result to calculate the area.
*   **Unit Literacy:** Understanding and correctly labeling units ($cm$ for width and $cm^2$ for area, though the rubric is lenient on units).

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Perimeter-Area Confusion:** Students often confuse the two formulas. They might divide the perimeter by the length to find the width. *This would lead to an incorrect answer.*
*   **The "Half-Perimeter" Error:** Students might forget to divide the perimeter by $2$ before subtracting the length (i.e., $32 - 10 = 22$). *This would lead to an incorrect answer ($w = 22$).*
*   **Formula Misapplication:** Adding all given numbers ($32 + 10$) because "perimeter" implies addition. *This would lead to an incorrect answer.*
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the English terms "Perimeter" and "Width" if they are more accustomed to "Parimap" (परिमाप) and "Chaudai" (चौड़ाई).

### Step 3: Factors making it easier
*   **Simple Numbers:** The integers are small and easy to divide/subtract (32 is even, 10 is a base-10 number).
*   **Standard Context:** A rectangle is the most familiar geometric shape.
*   **Calculable even with errors:** Even if a student misses the algebraic setup, they can use "guess and check" (10 + 10 + ? + ? = 32) relatively easily.

### Step 4: Factors making it harder
*   **Multi-step Requirement:** The student must reach an intermediate answer (width) before they can find the final answer (area). Many students stop after the first step.
*   **Language Barrier:** For ESL learners, "Find its width and the area" requires parsing a compound sentence.
*   **Rubric Rigidity:** The maximum score is only 1 point. In many Indian government school contexts, if a student finds the width ($6$) but fails to find the area, they receive $0$ marks under a "1 or 0" binary rubric, which significantly lowers the success rate compared to partial credit.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
Given that the item requires a two-step process (Perimeter $\to$ Width $\to$ Area) and the rubric is "all or nothing" for 1 mark, many students will provide a partial answer or stumble on the algebraic reversal. For students in this specific demographic, the leap from a memorized formula to an inverse operation is a frequent pain point.
