Step 1: Identify the mathematical/scientific concepts and skills required.
*   Understanding the properties of magnets, specifically the law of magnetic poles (like poles repel, unlike poles attract).
*   Knowledge of the cardinal naming conventions of a bar magnet (North and South).
*   Translating a physical interaction into a descriptive term ("repel" or "push away").

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   "All magnets stick together": Students often believe any two magnets will attract regardless of orientation. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   Confusion of terminology: Confusing "North" with "Negative" or thinking North attracts North because they are "the same" (likening it to matching pairs). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   Confusion between magnetism and gravity: Thinking the magnets must fall or move toward each other. This would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   Context: Playing with magnets is a common physical experience even for students from economically weaker sections.
*   Directness: The question asks about a single, fundamental rule of magnetism taught early in the curriculum.
*   Rubric flexibility: Allowing "push away" instead of the scientific term "repel" lowers the language barrier for Hindi-medium and limited-English-proficiency students.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Language barrier: Even with "push away" allowed, the student must process the English question ("brought near," "observe," "another").
*   Format: It is an open-ended recall question, not multiple choice, meaning there is no visual cue to prompt the correct answer.
*   Abstraction: While physical magnets are concrete, "North pole" is an abstract label that must be correctly mapped to the rule of repulsion.

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.
While the concept is foundational, the lack of options (open-ended format) and the English language barrier for this specific demographic often result in students either leaving it blank or using the more common-sense (but wrong) answer that magnets "stick." However, because magnetism is a highly demonstrative and memorable part of the Grade 6 Science syllabus, many will remember the physical "pushing" sensation.
