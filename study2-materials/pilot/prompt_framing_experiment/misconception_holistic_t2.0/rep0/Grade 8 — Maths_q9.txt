Step 1: The item requires calculating the Selling Price (SP) using the Discount percentage and Marked Price (MP), and subsequently calculating the Cost Price (CP) using the Profit percentage and the derived SP. This involves multiple steps: applying the formula $SP = MP - (\% \text{ of } MP)$ and $CP = (SP \times 100) / (100 + \% \text{ Profit})$.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
*   Mixing up Profit % and Discount % (treating them as the same operation on the same base).
*   Calculating the Profit % on the MP instead of the CP. (Leads to an incorrect answer).
*   Applying the discount twice or applying profit as a discount. (Leads to an incorrect answer).
*   Difficulty understanding that "Discount" is subtracted from MP while "Profit" is added to CP.

Step 3: Ease factors: The context (shopping/shopkeeper) is highly familiar and relevant to real life. The numbers ($1200$, $10\%$, $8\%$) are relatively simple to manipulate, and the calculations for the first step ($10\%$ of $1200$) are very intuitive.

Step 4: Hardness factors: For a Hindi-medium student with limited English, terms like "Marked Price," "Discount," and "Profit" might be confusing if the test is in English. Most significantly, it is a two-step process requiring backward reasoning to find the CP. In many Indian classrooms, rote memorization of formulas is common, but identifying which formula to use in a combined context (Profit/Loss + Discount) is a high-level cognitive task for 8th graders. The open-ended nature (non-MCQ) prevents guessing.

Step 5: While the arithmetic is simple, the linguistic barrier combined with the need to link two different conceptual formulas (Discount/MP and Profit/CP) makes this a challenging multi-step word problem for this specific demographic.
