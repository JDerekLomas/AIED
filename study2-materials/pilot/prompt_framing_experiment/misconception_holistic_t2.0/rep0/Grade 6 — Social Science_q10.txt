Step 1: This is a Social Science item, not a mathematical one. However, the underlying skills include retrieval of factual knowledge, categorization (festivals belonging to a specific state), and descriptive writing in a specific format.
Step 2: Common misconceptions include conflating regional festivals with national ones (e.g., naming Diwali/Holi which are celebrated everywhere but not unique "Rajasthan" fairs) or misattributing festivals from neighboring states. On this item, providing a national festival might result in a loss of points depending on the strictness of "of Rajasthan."
Step 3: Factors making it easier: The context is highly familiar to students in Northern India. Fairs (Melas) and festivals are part of the lived experience and oral tradition, reducing the reliance on textbook rote memorization.
Step 4: Factors making it harder: The open-ended format requires recall rather than recognition. The English language requirement is a significant barrier for Hindi-medium students; while they may know the festivals (e.g., Pushkar Mela), describing the "main attraction" in a complete English sentence is linguistically demanding for this specific demographic.
Step 5: While the content knowledge is high, the linguistic barrier of describing significance in a second language and the multi-part nature of the question (name two AND describe one) will lower the success rate.
