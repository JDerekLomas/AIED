Step 1: Identify mathematical concepts and skills.
Students must interpret a data table and compare decimal numbers representing units of time. They need to understand the inverse relationship between the "speed" of a process and the "duration" recorded; specifically, that the smallest numerical value in the time column represents the "fastest" rate of evaporation.

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
The most significant misconception is the "Higher Number = Faster/Better" fallacy. Many students at this level associate the highest number (90 minutes) with being the "fastest" because "90 is more than 10." Additionally, for EWS students with limited English, the term "evaporates" or the phrasing "fastest" versus "longest time" might be confusing. The misconception that the largest number equals "most" would lead to an incorrect answer for (a).

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
The context of water and salt solution is highly familiar and observable in daily life. The numbers provided (10, 45, 90) are "friendly" benchmarks (fractions of an hour) and do not involve complex decimals or scientific notation, making the data comparison straightforward.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
The open-ended format for part (b) is particularly challenging for students with limited English proficiency. Explaining "why" (impurities/solutes elevating boiling point or interfering with surface molecules) requires high-level scientific reasoning and the vocabulary to express it. While part (a) is a simple identification, part (b) requires synthesizing chemical knowledge with data analysis, which is difficult for 7th graders.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
While many students will correctly identify Liquid A for part (a) by intuition or basic table reading, part (b) will be a significant barrier due to the English language requirement and the conceptual depth of "solute-solvent interactions." For an EWS cohort in Grade 7, the bridge from data identification to scientific explanation is steep.
