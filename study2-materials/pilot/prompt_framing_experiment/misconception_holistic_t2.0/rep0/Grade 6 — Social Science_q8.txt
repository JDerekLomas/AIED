Step 1: Although the subject is Social Science, the implicit mathematical/logical skills include categorizing items into a set (Rights), quantifying the set (exactly two), and hierarchical reasoning (linking an abstract concept to a practical justification/importance).

Step 2: 
- Concept of "Rights" vs. "Wishes": Students often confuse rights with things they want (e.g., "right to play video games"). This leads to an incorrect answer.
- Identifying "Children's Rights" vs. "Adult Rights": Students might list general rights (Right to Vote) not applicable to their age group. This leads to an incorrect answer.
- Redundancy: Listing "Right to go to school" and "Right to education" as two different rights.

Step 3: 
- Context: Education (Right to Education) is a lived experience for these students and is frequently discussed in school assemblies and classrooms.
- Simple Constraint: The number "two" is a small, manageable quantity.

Step 4: 
- Language Barrier: The instruction "explain the importance" requires high-level English sentence construction, which is a major hurdle for Hindi-medium students with limited English proficiency.
- Question Density: It is a two-part task (Identify + Explain) for only 1 mark. Students may miss the second part.
- No Scaffolding: Being open-ended with no options makes it significantly harder for students who lack the specific vocabulary to express "protection," "exploitation," or "development."

Step 5: While students may know their rights in Hindi, the combination of the open-ended format, the demand for a written explanation in English, and the 1-point rubric (likely requiring both parts to be correct for any credit) will result in a low success rate.
