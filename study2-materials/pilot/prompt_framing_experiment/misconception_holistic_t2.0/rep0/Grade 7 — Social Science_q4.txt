Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science question, not a mathematical one. However, the cognitive skills required include understanding cause-and-effect in systems, evaluating civic structures, and articulating a procedural recommendation.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
1. Confusing "Transparency" with "Honesty": Students often think transparency just means "being a good person," leading to vague answers like "don't lie." This would likely lead to an incorrect or non-plausible answer.
2. Equating transparency with "visibility": Thinking it means literally being able to see into an office rather than access to information/data.
3. Government as a Monolith: Believing the government is one person (the PM or CM) rather than a system of rules. This leads to answers like "the leader should watch everyone," which misses systemic transparency.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
The rubric is extremely lenient, requiring only *one* plausible way to earn full marks. Concepts like "using the internet," "RTI (Right to Information)," or "CCTV cameras" are frequently discussed in Indian classrooms and news media, making the context somewhat familiar even if the terminology is formal.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
1. Language Barrier: The term "Transparency" and "Governance" are high-level academic English terms. For Hindi-medium/ESL students, "Pardarshita" and "Shasan" are more familiar; the English vocabulary acts as a significant barrier.
2. Abstract Nature: Unlike a direct question (e.g., "What is RTI?"), this requires a generative suggestion.
3. Writing constraint: Students from economically weaker sections often struggle with "open-ended" prompts in a second language due to limited expressive vocabulary, even if they understand the concept.

Step 5: Holistic estimate:
While the rubric is generous, the linguistic density of the words "transparency" and "governance" will likely result in a large portion of students leaving the item blank or providing irrelevant "moral" advice (e.g., "everyone should work hard") rather than systemic improvements.
