Step 1: Although the subject is English, the linguistic "mechanics" involve algorithmic thinking and rule-based logic similar to mathematical transformations. The task requires: 1) Identification of the speaker (pronoun mapping), 2) Identifying the reporting verb tense (Past), 3) Applying the "Backshift" rule of tenses (Present Continuous to Past Continuous), and 4) Structural integration using the conjunction 'that'.

Step 2: Common misconceptions/errors:
- **Tense Persistence:** Many students believe the reported action stays in its original tense because "it is a fact" or they forget the "backshift." This leads to an incorrect answer: *She said that she is reading...*
- **Pronoun Confusion:** Misunderstanding the relationship between the speaker and the subject. Result: *She said that I was reading...*
- **Omission of the Conjunction:** Forgetting "that," though the rubric allows minor variations, this is less likely to lose the mark.
- **Literal Translation:** Hindi-medium students often think in "Direct" terms (using 'ki' but keeping the original tense). This frequently leads to keeping the "am."

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The sentence is short and uses high-frequency vocabulary (she, said, reading, novel).
- "She said" is the most common, "textbook" intro to indirect speech.
- The pronouns do not involve a listener (like "said to me"), simplifying the conversion to "told."

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- **No multiple choice:** In the absence of options, students must recall every grammatical rule (tense shift, pronoun change) simultaneously without cues.
- **Limited English Proficiency:** Students from economically weaker sections/Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the "feel" of auxiliary verb changes (am $\rightarrow$ was).
- **English as a Second Language:** For these students, direct speech is more intuitive; the mechanical rules of "Reported Speech" are often among the hardest topics in Grade 7 grammar.

Step 5: Holistic estimation: Given the shift from "is/am" to "was" is a standard drill, about one-third of students in this specific demographic typically master the multiple simultaneous changes (I $\rightarrow$ she, am $\rightarrow$ was) required for a full mark.
