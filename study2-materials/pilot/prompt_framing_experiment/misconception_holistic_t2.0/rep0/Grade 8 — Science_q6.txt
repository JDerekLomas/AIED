Step 1: The question primarily assesses observation and cause-and-effect reasoning within Environmental Science. The core "mathematical" logic involves identifying a trend (deforestation) and predicting future impacts (sustained consequences). Skills required include visual pattern recognition and correlating human action with environmental degradation.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- "Global warming means only heat": Students might overlook related consequences like flooding or habitat loss. (Irrelevant to the binary scoring here).
- "Plants just grow back instantly": Students may not understand the "sustained" long-term impact. (Could lead to an incorrect answer for part b).
- Generalization: Thinking one tree doesn't matter. (Might lead to an incorrect answer if they don't identify it as "deforestation").

Step 3: Ease factors: 
- High context familiarity: Rural or low-income urban students in India are often highly aware of wood being used for fuel and tree-cutting activities.
- Simple visual: An axe and a fallen tree are universal symbols. 
- Low technical vocabulary needed: Simple Hindi-influenced English words like "Tree cutting" or "Flood" suffice.

Step 4: Difficulty factors:
- English Proficiency: Expressing "consequences" and "sustained" in English is very difficult for students from Hindi-medium/ESL backgrounds.
- Two-part question for only 1 mark: To get the full mark, they must satisfy both (a) and (b). If they understand the image but cannot explain the long-term impact (soil erosion, no rain) in English, they fail.
- Open-ended: No prompts to guide their thinking.

Step 5: Holistic estimation: While the visual is very clear, the linguistic demand of the word "consequences" and the "sustained" timeframe—coupled with the requirement to answer two parts for a single mark—will act as a significant barrier for students with limited English.
