Step 1: Identify the linguistic and mechanical skills required.
Students must recognize that a sentence starts with a capital letter, proper nouns (Riya, Meena) require capitalization, and specific days of the week (Sunday) require capitalization. Additionally, they must identify the end of the sentence to place a full stop.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Case Sensitivity:** Students often believe capital letters are only for the very first word of a sentence. This would lead to leaving "meena" and "sunday" in lowercase.
*   **Visual Similarity:** In cursive or hurried handwriting common in under-resourced settings, 's' and 'S' or 'm' and 'M' may be treated as interchangeable, leading to errors in formal punctuation.
*   **The "And" Rule:** Some students believe the word "and" acts as a barrier that restarts lowercase conventions.
*   **Transfer Error:** In Hindi (the students' likely primary language), there is no concept of capitalization for proper nouns or sentence starts. This makes applying English case rules an additional cognitive load.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   The vocabulary is basic (market, friend, Sunday) and likely familiar from early primary English.
*   The sentence structure is simple (S-V-O).
*   The rubric allows for a binary "correct/incorrect" score which is straightforward.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Interference:** Since Hindi lacks a case system, remembering to capitalize three internal words (Riya, Meena, Sunday) requires active switching of grammatical frameworks.
*   **Multi-Point Failure:** This is a "strict" item. Missing even one capital (e.g., Sunday) or the full stop results in 0 marks. There are five distinct punctuation points to address (R, M, S, and the period).
*   **Open-ended:** No options are provided to nudge the student's memory regarding proper nouns.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the background of the students (Hindi-medium, economically weaker sections) and the strictness of the rubric requiring all five changes for a single point, many will fail on "Sunday" or the internal proper noun "Meena."
