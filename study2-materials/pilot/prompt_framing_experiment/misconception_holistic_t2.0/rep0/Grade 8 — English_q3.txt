Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is an English Language Arts (ELA) reading comprehension item, not a mathematics item. It requires identifying a character’s internal motivation/perspective from a text, synthesizing implicit information (that it was "more than a hobby"), and articulating it in writing.

Step 2: List common misconceptions/errors.
In this context, students often struggle with:
- Literalism: Thinking a "hobby" is just something one does for fun, missing the deeper "expression of feelings" aspect.
- Vocabulary Confusion: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the nuance of words like "expressing" or "thoughts" versus simpler terms like "talking" or "drawing pictures."
- Text-search error: Copying a sentence from the text that mentions drawing but does not explain its significance.
These errors would lead to an incorrect answer on this item.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
The context (drawing/hobbies) is familiar and relatable. The concept of "feelings" is universal.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Language Barrier: For English Language Learners (ELLs), articulating abstract concepts like "expressing thoughts" is significantly harder than answering a factual "who/where" question.
- Open-ended Format: Without multiple-choice options, students must construct their own syntax and spelling, which increases the cognitive load and the likelihood of partial/incorrect responses.
- Rubric Rigidity: The rubric requires two distinct points (more than a hobby + expression of feelings) or a clear combination; many students might provide only one (e.g., "She likes it") which would fail to meet the maximum score criteria.

Step 5: Estimate.
Given the background of the students (economically weaker, Hindi-medium transition, Grade 8 English levels in government schools), while many will understand the story, formulating a response that meets both criteria of the rubric in written English is a significant hurdle.
