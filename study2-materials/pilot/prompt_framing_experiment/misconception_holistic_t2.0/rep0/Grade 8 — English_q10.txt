Step 1: The core linguistic "mechanics" required include understanding clausal synthesis and the grammatical transformation of "very" into the intensifier "too," followed by the reduction of the second clause into an infinitive phrase ("to walk").

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Over-inclusion: Students often keep the negative "not" (e.g., "He is too weak not to walk"), believing the sentence must explicitly remain negative. This leads to an incorrect answer.
- Structural mismatch: Using "too...that" or "very...to." This leads to an incorrect answer.
- Subject redundancy: Writing "He is too weak to he walk." This leads to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Ease factors: The vocabulary is extremely basic ("weak," "walk," "he"). The structure "too...to" is a staple of the Class 8 grammar curriculum in India and is heavily drilled in textbook exercises. The sentence provided is the most "standard" example of this rule.

Step 4: Hardship factors: The item is open-ended (supply-type), requiring productive rather than receptive skills. For students with limited English proficiency, shifting from two simple sentences to one complex structure requires a leap in syntactical processing. Students may struggle to remember which "to/too" goes where.

Step 5: Given that this is a "rote" grammar transformation frequently practiced in Indian government schools, even students with low English fluency often memorize the pattern "Replace very with too, remove the period and 'he cannot', add to." However, the lack of multiple-choice options will filter out those who haven't mastered the specific syntax.
