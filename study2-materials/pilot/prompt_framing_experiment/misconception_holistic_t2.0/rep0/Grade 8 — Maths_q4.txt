**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Understanding Rational Equations:** Recognizing that the expression represents two ratios in an equality (a proportion).
*   **Cross-Multiplication:** Applying the property that if $a/b = c/d$, then $ad = bc$.
*   **Distributive Property:** Correcting multiplying the constant by both terms in the binomial, i.e., $5(x - 5) = 5x - 25$.
*   **Transposition/Isolation:** Shifting terms across the equals sign and changing signs to isolate $x$.
*   **Integer Arithmetic:** Working with negative numbers.

**Step 2: Common Misconceptions**
*   **Incomplete Distribution:** Multiplying $5 \cdot x$ but forgetting to multiply $5 \cdot 5$. (Would lead to an incorrect answer).
*   **Sign Errors:** Changing $-25$ to $+25$ incorrectly when moving it across the equals sign. (Would lead to an incorrect answer).
*   **"Cancelation" Error:** Attempting to "cancel" the numbers (e.g., trying to simplify the 5s and 3s across the equals sign) before multiplying. (Would lead to an incorrect answer).
*   **Additive Inverse Confusion:** Subtracting $x$ from one side but adding it to the other. (Would lead to an incorrect answer).

**Step 3: Factors making the item easier**
*   **Simple Numbers:** The use of 3 and 5 is very accessible; there are no large or complex numbers.
*   **Symmetry:** The structure $(x-a)/b = (x-b)/a$ is a very common "textbook" pattern that many students have practiced repeatedly through rote drill.
*   **Limited Language Load:** For Hindi-medium students, the mathematical notation is universal. The English command "Solve the equation" is a standard phrase they are usually taught to recognize regardless of their English proficiency.

**Step 4: Factors making the item harder**
*   **Constructed Response:** Without options to plug back into the equation, students must rely entirely on their procedural accuracy.
*   **Multiple Failure Points:** A mistake in any one of the three steps (cross-multiply, distribute, transpose) results in 0 marks according to the binary rubric.
*   **Bracket Awareness:** Students often forget that $(x-5)$ acts as a single unit; failing to visualize or write the brackets during cross-multiplication is the primary hurdle for Grade 8 students.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
While the math is standard, students from economically weaker backgrounds often experience "procedural gaps" due to inconsistent schooling. However, because this specific "cross-multiplication" pattern is heavily emphasized in the Indian NCERT curriculum (Chapter 2, Linear Equations in One Variable), most students recognize the "trick" required even if their arithmetic fails them later. The binary "Maximum score: 1" rubric is harsh, as it likely requires the final $x$ value to be correct, though the rubric snippet provided focuses on the setup.
