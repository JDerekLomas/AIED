Step 1: Skills include data interpretation, determining an appropriate scale (ratio/proportion), spatial reasoning for bar construction, and labeling axes.
Step 2: Common misconceptions include inconsistent intervals on the Y-axis (e.g., 10, 20, 50, 100), starting the axis at a non-zero value without a break, and confusing the X and Y variables. These would lead to a loss of the single mark according to the rubric.
Step 3: Ease factors include a very familiar context (school classes) and clear superlatives (maximum/minimum) which are easy to identify even without the graph.
Step 4: Harder factors include the limited English proficiency making the phrase "appropriate scale" difficult to decode, the multi-step nature of construction (drawing, labeling, scaling), and the "all or nothing" rubric (Maximum score 1 for multiple tasks).
Step 5: While many students can identify the max/min, constructing a perfect graph with a consistent scale is a significant hurdle for Grade 7 students, especially with the language barrier and the high standard of the rubric.
