Step 1: Identify the concepts and skills required.
Though the question is labeled "Science," the underlying skills include:
- Scientific classification (Mode of nutrition).
- Causal reasoning (Understanding why a producer might still consume insects).
- Recalling terminology and examples (Venus flytrap/Sundew).
- Language proficiency: Students must comprehend "trap-like structure" and "mode of nutrition" and articulate their answers in English.

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
- Misconception 1: If a plant is green/photosynthetic, it must be an autotroph only and cannot "eat" animals. This leads to confusion in (b).
- Misconception 2: These plants eat insects for "energy" rather than for nitrogen. This leads to incorrect reasoning in (b).
- Misconception 3: Difficulty with the specific term "insectivorous." Students may use colloquial terms or "heterotrophic," which might not match the specific rubric requirement.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
- Context: The pitcher plant is a iconic, "hero" example in Class 7 Science (NCERT curriculum) and is usually well-illustrated in textbooks.
- Question (c): Students often memorize "Venus flytrap" as a paired example.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Language Barrier: The term "mode of nutrition" is technical. Hindi-medium students might know the concept (कीटभक्षी / Keet-bhakshi) but struggle to spell or recall "insectivorous" in English.
- Question (b): This requires constructing a logical sentence explaining nitrogen deficiency, which is cognitively demanding for students with limited English.
- Rubric: The rubric is strictly looking for "insectivorous," leaving little room for descriptive but correct phrasing in a student's second language.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
The item relies heavily on vocabulary recall and scientific reasoning. Given the demographic (EWS, Hindi-medium transition to English), students often grasp the concept of "bug-eating plants" but struggle to produce the precise technical English terminology and the "nitrogen" justification required for a full score.
