**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Unitary Method:** The ability to find the value of one unit (distance per 1 liter) before calculating the value for multiple units (12 liters).
*   **Division and Multiplication:** Performing basic arithmetic operations ($55 \div 5 = 11$ and $11 \times 12 = 132$).
*   **Proportional Reasoning:** Understanding the direct relationship between fuel consumed and distance covered.
*   **Vocabulary/Contextual Knowledge:** Understanding the term "mileage" (average) and how it relates to the given units.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Additive vs. Multiplicative reasoning:** A student might think $12$ liters is $7$ more than $5$, so they add $7$ to $55$ ($62$ km). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Incorrect Division Order:** Attempting $5 \div 55$. While less common with these numbers, it results in a fraction that complicates the problem.
*   **Misinterpreting "Mileage":** Students may find 132 km but fail to explicitly recognize 11 km/l as the mileage, or vice versa. Since the rubric only credits the 132 km, a student who stops at "11" will fail.

**Step 3: Factors that make it easier**
*   **Simple Numbers:** $55$ and $5$ are extremely "friendly" numbers for division. The multiplication $11 \times 12$ is a common table for Grade 7 students.
*   **Familiar Context:** Car distance and petrol is a standard "real-world" scenario used in Indian textbooks (NCERT).
*   **Direct Proportion:** The relationship is straightforward with no hidden constants or inverse proportions.

**Step 4: Factors that make it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds may struggle with the word "mileage" or "covers." The phrase "How much mileage (average) the car is giving?" is phrased in a way that mimics Hinglish (Indian English), which might actually help, but the word "mileage" itself is often more academic than "average" (औसत).
*   **Multi-step Requirement:** The question asks for two things: the distance for 12 liters AND the mileage. The rubric, however, only scores the 132 km. A student might get confused about which answer to provide as the "final" one.
*   **Constructed Response:** Without options (MCQ), there is no opportunity for back-calculation or guessing.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
The numbers are very simple, and the Unitary Method is a core focus of Grade 6 and 7 in the Indian curriculum. However, the requirement to perform two steps and the potential for linguistic confusion regarding "mileage" among EWS/Hindi-medium students will cause a significant portion to stumble or provide incomplete work.
