**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Elapsed Time Calculation:** Understanding the duration between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm.
*   **Rate Multiplication:** Calculating total increase (Rate $\times$ Time), i.e., $2^\circ\text{C} \times 6\text{ hours}$.
*   **Arithmetic Addition:** Adding the total increase to the initial temperature ($30 + 12$).
*   **Time Notation Conversion:** Moving from the 12-hour clock (am/pm) to a linear understanding of hours elapsed.

**Step 2: Common Misconceptions**
*   **Simple Subtraction Error:** Students may see "10" and "4" and perform $10 - 4 = 6$, accidentally arriving at the correct number of hours but via flawed reasoning.
*   **Miscounting Hours:** Starting the count from 1 instead of 0 (counting 10 am as the first hour), leading to 7 hours.
*   **Additive Rate:** Adding the rate only once ($30 + 2$) or failing to account for the cumulative change over time.
*   **Language Interference:** For Hindi-medium students, "am/pm" notation is often less intuitive than 24-hour time or descriptive phrases like "subah/shaam," potentially causing confusion in calculating the interval across the 12:00 noon threshold.

**Step 3: Factors making the item easier**
*   **Familiar Context:** Temperature change is a real-world scenario students encounter.
*   **Simple Integers:** The numbers (30, 2, 10, 4) are small and easy to manipulate.
*   **Predictable Pattern:** The concept of an "increase per hour" is a standard problem type in Grade 6.

**Step 4: Factors making the item harder**
*   **Multi-step Process:** Students must find elapsed time *before* calculating temperature, and there is no intermediate prompt.
*   **12-Hour Transition:** Crossing the "12:00 noon" mark is a notorious "stumbling block" for students from economically weaker sections who may use "1, 2, 3..." interchangeably in daily life without strict am/pm rigor.
*   **Language Barrier:** Terms like "per hour" or "increases by" might be misinterpreted by students with limited English proficiency.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options, there is no opportunity for "reverse engineering" or recognition-based solving.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
While the math is simple, the transition from 10 am to 4 pm is a high-error zone for 6th graders in this demographic. Many students will struggle with the "12 to 1" jump or misinterpret the total duration, even if they understand the concept of adding 2 degrees.
