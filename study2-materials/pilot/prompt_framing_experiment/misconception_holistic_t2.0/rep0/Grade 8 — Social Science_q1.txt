Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science (Civics) question rather than a Mathematics question. However, applying a "mathematical" framework to the task involves categorization and recall of a discrete set (6 rights). The primary skill is retrieval of factual knowledge and set-subset identification (identifying specific elements within the set of Fundamental Rights).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Mixing Fundamental Rights with Duties:** Students may list things like "protecting public property." (Result: Incorrect)
*   **Mixing with General Human Rights/Welfare:** Students may list "Right to Food" or "Right to Housing" which are not specifically part of the core constitutional list. (Result: Incorrect)
*   **Language Barrier Confusion:** Translating "Samanata ka Adhikar" to English correctly might lead to phrasing issues, though the rubric is flexible. (Result: Likely correct due to rubric).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **High Familiarity:** This is one of the most heavily emphasized topics in the Indian Civics curriculum.
*   **Flexible Rubric:** Accepting "simplified phrasing" accommodates Hindi-medium backgrounds and limited English proficiency.
*   **Simple Retrieval:** No complex reasoning is required; it is a basic "recall" task.
*   **Multiple Options:** Since there are 6 rights, the student only needs to remember any 2, increasing the probability of success.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no options to choose from, requiring active recall.
*   **English Language Proficiency:** While the rubric is lenient, the mental hurdle of translating from Hindi/Local dialect to English under test conditions is present for EWS students.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given that Fundamental Rights are taught repeatedly from Grade 6-8 and are core to the syllabus, most students (even from EWS backgrounds) can recall "Right to Equality" and "Right to Freedom" or their approximate English equivalents.
