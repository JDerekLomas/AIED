Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, the underlying skills involve logical categorization, comparison (forming a 1:1 correspondence between service types and attributes), and evaluation of quality versus cost—a qualitative form of optimization.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Equating "Public" only with "Free" (not accounting for nominal registration fees or rural reach), which could lead to a correct answer.
- Thinking "Private" means "better for everyone" (ignoring the accessibility/cost barrier).
- Difficulty distinguishing between a "feature" and an "opinion." Most misconceptions would actually lead toward a partially correct answer rather than a complete failure, as long as they can cite a basic difference like cost.

Step 3: Ease factors: The context is highly familiar; even students from economically weaker sections have direct experience with "Sarkari" (Government) hospitals versus private clinics. The concepts of cost and wait times are part of their daily reality. The rubric is surprisingly lenient—requiring only "two features of public healthcare" to earn the 1 mark, despite the prompt asking for a comparison.

Step 4: Harder factors: The question is open-ended. The academic vocabulary ("Evaluate," "Valid argument," "Healthcare services") is likely above the English proficiency level of Hindi-medium students. The gap between the complex phrasing of the question and the simple requirement of the rubric creates a "linguistic barrier." Students may know the answer in Hindi but struggle to articulate a "valid argument" in English.

Step 5: While the concept is familiar, the mismatch between the high-level English prompt and the students' proficiency, combined with the open-ended nature of the response, will suppress scores. However, the very generous rubric (accepting basic descriptive features) allows many students to scrape the single point available.
