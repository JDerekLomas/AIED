Step 1: Identify the concepts and skills required.
This is a history question requiring factual recall of the Vedic Period’s economic structure. Key skills include distinguishing between the Early Vedic (primarily pastoral) and Later Vedic (primarily agrarian) periods, though the rubric accepts either. The second part requires descriptive language skills to explain an aspect of that occupation (e.g., cattle as wealth, or use of the plow).

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
1. Chronological confusion: Students often conflate the Harappan civilization (urban/trade) with the Vedic period (rural/pastoral).
2. Generalized "Olden Days": A common misconception that all ancient people were "hunters and gatherers." This would lead to an incorrect answer.
3. Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students, the term "Vedic period" is "Vaidik Kaal" and "Occupation" is "Vyavasay." If the question is presented only in English, students may understand the history but fail to decode the vocabulary of the prompt.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
The rubric is very generous, accepting both "Pastoralism" and "Agriculture" as correct. This covers both the Early and Later Vedic phases, significantly increasing the chance of a "correct" identification. Cattle rearing is a familiar concept in rural/semi-urban Indian contexts.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
The open-ended format ("Describe one key aspect") is much harder for students with limited English proficiency than a multiple-choice question. Even if they know the answer is "Gai" (Cow) or "Kheti" (Farming), they may struggle to construct a descriptive sentence in English to satisfy the second half of the prompt. The two-part nature of the question for only 1 mark increases the "threshold of success."

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
While the factual content is foundational, the English language production required for the description and the lack of multiple-choice cues will hinder many students from this specific demographic. However, since the rubric is highly flexible regarding the specific stage of the Vedic period, it mitigates some of the historical difficulty.
