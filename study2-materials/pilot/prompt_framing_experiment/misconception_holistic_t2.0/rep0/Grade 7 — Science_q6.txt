Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
(Note: Although the item is from a Science paper, analyzing the underlying cognitive/logical skills). The student must utilize categorical logic (Classification) to compare two biological systems based on a single variable (dietary fiber/cellulose). They must perform a 1-to-1 mapping between a physical structure (the stomach/rumen) and a functional necessity (digesting grass).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **The "Smaller/Larger" misconception:** Students often believe organs are just scaled versions of each other rather than structurally different. *Likely to lead to an incorrect/incomplete answer.*
*   **Purpose of "chewing the cud":** Students often think cows chew repeatedly because they are "lazy" or "tasty" eaters rather than for chemical breakdown. *Could lead to an incorrect answer if they focus on behavior rather than the system/structure.*
*   **Generalizing "Human-like" anatomy:** Assuming all mammals have the same internal layout. *Directly leads to failure on this item.*

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar context:** Students from rural or economically weaker sections in India often have high proximity to cattle (cows/buffaloes) and are familiar with the sight of "chewing the cud."
*   **Low Linguistic Barrier (Structure):** The rubric accepts a simple naming of "multiple stomachs" or "rumen," which are high-frequency terms in Grade 7 Science NCERT/State textbooks.
*   **Single-point requirement:** Only "one key difference" is needed.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options, students with limited English proficiency (from Hindi-medium backgrounds) may struggle to articulate "cellulose" or "ruminant" even if they understand the concept.
*   **Functional Linking:** The question requires connecting the *system* (structure) to the *diet* (cause). Explaining the "Why" is harder than naming a part.
*   **Terminology:** The term "Ruminant" is academic and may not be the word used in daily Hindi-influenced English (where "grazing animal" is more common).

Step 5: Holistically, while the concept is culturally familiar, the requirement to explain the "Why" and provide a "Key difference related to diet" in English creates a significant hurdle for students transitioning from vernacular mediums or struggling with expressive writing.
