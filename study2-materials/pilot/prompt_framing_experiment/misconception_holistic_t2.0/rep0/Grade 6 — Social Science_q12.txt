Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
Though this is a Social Science item, the cognitive skills required include recall of historical facts, associating symbols with national identity, and cause-and-effect reasoning. No specific mathematical operations are required, but logical classification (symbol vs. meaning) is essential.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Misconception 1: Lions are on the notes simply because they are the "National Animal" (confusing the Tiger with the Lion). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   Misconception 2: Lions are there to show that India is powerful/strong (general reasoning without historical context). This would likely fail the rubric's specific requirement.
*   Misconception 3: Direct visual association (lions represent the jungle/nature). This would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors that make it easier:
*   Contextual familiarity: Students handle currency notes frequently, making the visual stimulus recognizable.
*   Cultural significance: National symbols are taught repeatedly in lower grades and through school assemblies/patriotic programs.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder:
*   Language barrier: Translating complex historical terms (e.g., "Sarnath," "Mauryan Empire," "National Emblem") from Hindi/vernacular thought into English is a significant hurdle.
*   Open-ended format: No cues or options are provided to nudge the student toward "Ashoka" or "Emblem."
*   Specific Rubric: The rubric requires two specific connections (Ashoka's capital and the status of the National Emblem) for 1 point. A vague answer about "history" will not score.

Step 5: Holistically weighing the factors.
For students from economically weaker backgrounds with limited English proficiency, the barrier is twofold: they may know the answer in Hindi ("Ashok Stambh") but struggle to formulate it in English, or they may lack the specific historical nuance required by the rubric beyond just saying "it's our sign."
