Step 1: This is a Social Science (Civics/Political Science) item, not a mathematics item. The cognitive skills required involve recall of factual knowledge, conceptual understanding of governance structures, and vocabulary retrieval.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include confusing "Fundamental Rights" with "Fundamental Duties," or conflating "Federalism" with "Democracy." In this specific item, if a student lists a "Duty" instead of a "Feature/Right," they would be marked incorrect. However, since the rubric accepts *any* correct feature, the threshold for a correct response is low.

Step 3: Ease factors: The topic of the Constitution is a core pillar of the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum. Familiarity with the term "Fundamental Rights" (Maulik Adhikar) is high, even for Hindi-medium students, as these concepts are often reinforced through posters and assemblies. The rubric is extremely generous (only 1 feature required).

Step 4: Difficulty factors: The primary barrier is English language proficiency. A student may know the concept in Hindi (e.g., "Dharmnirpekshta") but struggle to produce the English term "Secularism." The open-ended format (supply vs. select) increases the difficulty compared to a multiple-choice question, as it requires active recall and spelling.

Step 5: Given that "Fundamental Rights" is a very common and highly practiced answer, and the rubric only requires one correct term for full credit, a significant majority of students—even from disadvantaged backgrounds—will likely be able to recall at least one keyword from their civics lessons.
