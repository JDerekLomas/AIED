Step 1: The mathematical concepts required are null. This is an English language/reading comprehension task. The cognitive demand involves scanning a text, identifying auditory descriptions (sensory details), and inferring the sound based on a situational context (sunset/birds returning).

Step 2: While there are no mathematical misconceptions, linguistic misconceptions include:
- Literalism: Looking for the word "sound" in the text rather than descriptive verbs like "chirping" or "rustling."
- Narrative projection: Answering based on personal experience (e.g., "church bells") rather than textual evidence.
Neither directly stems from mathematical misunderstanding but would lead to an incorrect answer here.

Step 3: Ease factors include the familiar setting (birds and sunset are universal themes in standard Indian curriculum) and the likely brevity of the passage used for a 1-mark Grade 8 question.

Step 4: Harder factors include the open-ended nature (no options provided), the requirement to construct an English phrase for a student from a Hindi-medium/limited-English background, and the need to connect "birds returning to nests" with the specific auditory "sounds" requested by the prompt. The language barrier is the most significant hurdle.

Step 5: Given the English proficiency barrier and the open-ended format, many students may understand the concept in Hindi but struggle to express it correctly in written English as per the rubric.
