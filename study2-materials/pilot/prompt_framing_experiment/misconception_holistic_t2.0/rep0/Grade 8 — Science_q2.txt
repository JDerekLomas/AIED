Step 1: The question is a Biology (Science) item rather than a Mathematics item. However, the cognitive skills required are factual recall and classification.
Step 2: Common misconceptions include the belief that all bacteria are "germs" or harmful, or confusing the process of fermentation with fungal growth (yeast). If a student thinks only fungi are useful, they may misidentify the category. Some may confuse the bacterium *Lactobacillus* with the protein *casein*.
Step 3: Ease factors: Making curd from milk is a universal daily experience in Indian households. The term "Lactobacillus" is a high-frequency vocabulary word in the Grade 8 Science NCERT curriculum and is often memorized as a single-word fact.
Step 4: Hardship factors: The English spelling of "Lactobacillus" is difficult for Hindi-medium students/limited English speakers. The rubric only allows 0.5 marks for naming the microorganism, but the question asks for two things: the name AND the category (Bacteria). If the rubric strictly only rewards the name, the category requirement adds cognitive load without point value. The open-ended format prevents guessing.
Step 5: Given that this is a "staple" question in Indian examinations and highly emphasized in rote learning patterns common in government schools, many students will recognize the name even if they struggle with spelling.
