**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Multiplication and mental math:** Multiplying whole numbers by denominations (10x10, 5x20, 16x50).
*   **Unit conversion:** Knowledge that 100 paise = 1 Rupee.
*   **Multi-step calculation:** Summing individual totals and then performing a final division or grouping by the target denomination (Rupee 5).
*   **Problem-solving:** Distinguishing between the *value* of the coins and the *number* of coins.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Decimal misplacement:** Treating 50 paise as 0.5 or 50. In this item, if students add 10, 20, and 50 directly (ignoring "coins of"), they fail.
*   **Mixing count and value:** Confusing the quantity (e.g., "16 coins") with the value (800 paise). This is very likely for English Language Learners (ELL) who might struggle with the "X coins of Y paise" syntax.
*   **Unit neglect:** Calculating the total as 1000 paise but failing to convert to Rupees, leading to an answer of "200" or similar.
*   **Inverse operation:** Calculating the total value (Rs 10) but stopping there instead of dividing by the target coin (Rs 5).

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Familiar context:** Currency (Paise and Rupees) is a culturally grounded concept in Indian households, even for economically weaker sections.
*   **Friendly numbers:** 10x10 and 5x20 both equal 100 (1 Rupee), and 16x50 is a common calculation (half of 16). The total sums to a clean "10," which is easily divisible by 5.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** The phrasing "How many Rupee 5 coins can be made from..." is syntactically complex for Hindi-medium students. The use of "made from" is slightly abstract.
*   **Multi-step process:** This is not a "plug-and-chug" question; it requires three multiplications, one addition, and one final division.
*   **Obsolete Currency:** While 50 paise is still technically legal tender, 10 and 20 paise coins have been out of circulation for years. Students may lack physical intuition for these denominations.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
The math itself is accessible, but the combination of multi-step logic and the language barrier for ELL students will cause significant "filtering." Many students will correctly find the total value (10 Rupees) but may provide "10" as the answer rather than "2" because they miss the final instruction to find the number of 5-rupee coins.
