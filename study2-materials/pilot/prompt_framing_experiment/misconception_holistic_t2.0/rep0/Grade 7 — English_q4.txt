Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a reading comprehension/critical thinking item, not a mathematical one. However, applying the logic of analysis: the task requires identifying a sequence (priority of actions), categorizing entities (importance of people), and logical reasoning (cause and effect). 

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Literalism: Students may believe there is only one "textbook" answer and fail to provide their own reason.
*   Confusion of variables: Misunderstanding the "Three Questions" (When/Who/What) leads to an incoherent reason.
On this item, these lead to incorrect or incomplete responses.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   Familiar Narrative: "The Three Questions" by Tolstoy is a staple of the Grade 7 curriculum (NCERT/State boards).
*   Subjective Rubric: The rubric allows for "any valid reason," providing a low floor for entry.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Language Barrier: Hindi-medium students often struggle to formulate original sentences in English (syntax/grammar).
*   Open-ended Format: No scaffolding or options increases cognitive load.
*   Abstract Reasoning: Moving from the literal plot to "real life" application is a high-level Bloom’s Taxonomy skill (Evaluation).
*   Economically Weaker Context: Limited exposure to extracurricular reading makes articulating "why" in a second language difficult.

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.
While the story is well-known, the combination of English-language production requirements and the abstract leap to "real-life importance" poses a significant barrier for students with limited English proficiency. Many will provide a fragmented or circular response.
