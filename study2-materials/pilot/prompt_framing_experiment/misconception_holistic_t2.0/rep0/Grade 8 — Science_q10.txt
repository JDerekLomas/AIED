**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Measurement and Thresholds:** Understanding specific numeric parameters (70°C for 15-30 seconds) and the concept of a "delta" (sudden change) in temperature.
*   **Sequencing:** Chronological ordering of events (Heating $\rightarrow$ Holding $\rightarrow$ Cooling).
*   **Cause and Effect:** Correlating a physical process with a biological outcome (preservation).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Pasteurization vs. Boiling:** Students often believe pasteurization is simply boiling milk to kill germs. On this item, that might lead to an incomplete description (missing the rapid cooling step).
*   **Heating = Preservation:** The idea that heat alone preserves, neglecting the "chilling" phase that prevents surviving spores from germinating. This would result in an incorrect or partial answer.
*   **Language Interference:** In Hindi-medium backgrounds, technical terms like "pasteurization" are often transliterated rather than translated, leading to confusion if the phonetic memory fails.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Context:** Milk is a staple in households of all economic backgrounds. Students are likely familiar with "Amul" or dairy packets that mention pasteurization.
*   **Rubric Leniency:** The fact that specific temperatures and times are not required makes the bar for a "correct" description significantly lower.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options (MCQ), students must retrieve information and construct English sentences, which is difficult for English Language Learners (ELL).
*   **Multi-part requirement:** The student must provide both a *description* and an *explanation*. Many students provide one but forget the other, resulting in a 0 since the rubric requires both for a single mark.
*   **Academic Language:** Words like "preserving" and "process" may be barriers for students with limited English proficiency.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
Given the open-ended nature and the English language barrier, many students will provide a partial answer (mentioning only heating). However, because the rubric is lenient regarding numerical values, a student with a basic conceptual grasp of "heat then cool" will succeed. In Indian government school contexts, this is a standard "memorize and repeat" textbook question, which slightly boosts the success rate despite language hurdles.
