Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a science item, the underlying logical structure involves "cause and effect" reasoning and categorical properties. In the context of Grade 6 science in India (NCERT curriculum), the skill required is retrieving factual knowledge about fiber properties and articulating a single-step functional explanation.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Insulation vs. Absorption:** Students might think cotton is "cool" because it generates coldness rather than absorbing sweat. This leads to a vague answer ("It is cold") rather than a property.
*   **Color vs. Material:** Many students confuse the preference for *light-colored* clothes in summer with the *material* property of cotton. If they focus only on color (reflecting sunlight), it would be marked incorrect according to this specific rubric which asks for a property of *cotton*.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **High Familiarity:** The context is deeply relatable to students' daily lives, especially in a tropical climate like India.
*   **Single-attribute requirement:** The rubric only requires identifying *one* property.
*   **Direct Instruction:** "Fibre to Fabric" is a core chapter in Class 6 Science, and this exact question is a standard textbook exercise.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, expressing "porous" or "absorption" in English can be daunting. They might know the concept but lack the English vocabulary to satisfy the "Describe" command.
*   **Open-ended format:** Unlike multiple-choice questions, students must generate the term themselves.
*   **Vague phrasing:** Economically disadvantaged students often use colloquial language (e.g., "cotton is good") which may not meet the scientific "property" requirement of the rubric.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given that this is a standard, frequently practiced textbook question and the context is highly culturally relevant, most students will know the "why." However, the requirement to name a specific property in English for students with limited proficiency will cause significant drop-off.
