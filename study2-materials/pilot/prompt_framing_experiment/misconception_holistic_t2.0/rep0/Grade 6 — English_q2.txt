Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a reading comprehension item rather than a mathematical one. However, in the context of analyzing test items for this demographic, the cognitive skills required involve extracting specific information from a text, identifying a subject (Who), and mapped retrieval of a noun phrase.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
In an English assessment for Hindi-medium/EWS students, "misconceptions" are usually linguistic interferences:
- Subject-Object Confusion: Confusing the book with the protagonist. (Incorrect answer)
- Literal Translation Error: Using Hindi syntax (e.g., "Inside book fairy lived"). (Correct per rubric)
- Vocabulary Gap: Not knowing the word "inside" or "lived." (Incorrect answer)

Step 3: Factors making the item easier:
- Simple retrieval: "Who" questions are the most basic form of comprehension.
- One-word rubric: The rubric is lenient, allowing "fairy," which bypasses complex grammatical requirements.
- Common imagery: "Fairy" is a cross-culturally recognized concept (Pari).

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- Language barrier: For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, decoding the question itself is the primary hurdle.
- Open-ended: No options (MCQs) to provide context clues.
- Context-dependency: Success depends entirely on whether they have read the specific passage provided with the test.

Step 5: Holistic estimate:
Since the question asks for a single noun and the rubric allows for a one-word answer ("fairy"), the barrier is lower than for a grammar-heavy item. However, limited English proficiency among EWS students in Grade 6 often results in difficulty with open-ended comprehension if they cannot decode the question "Who lived inside...".
