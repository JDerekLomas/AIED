**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   Understanding the definition of an angle and its measurement in degrees.
*   Physical dexterity and coordination to align a protractor (vertex alignment and baseline adjustment).
*   Ability to read a dual-scale protractor (inner vs. outer scale).
*   Knowledge of angle classification (identifying 110° as obtuse and 40° as acute).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Inner/Outer Scale Confusion:** Students often read the wrong scale. For 110°, a student might mark 70° (the supplementary angle). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Incorrect Vertex Placement:** Not aligning the "center mark" of the protractor with the endpoint of the ray. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Measurement from 180°:** Starting the count from the left side of the protractor regardless of ray orientation.
*   **Concept of "Size":** Believing the length of the rays affects the angle degree. (Likely not an issue for *drawing*, but for interpreting).

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Familiar Tool:** The protractor is a standard part of the geometry box mandated in Grade 6.
*   **Direct Instruction:** "Use a protractor to draw" is a standard procedural task heavily practiced in Indian classrooms.
*   **Standard Values:** 40° and 110° are "friendly" multiples of 10, clearly marked on all protractor models.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** While the word "protractor" and "angle" are common, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the English phrasing if the instruction isn't translated.
*   **Precision Errors:** Students from economically weaker sections may use poor-quality or broken geometry tools (scratched/cloudy protractors, blunt pencils), leading to inaccuracies exceeding the ±2° tolerance usually allowed.
*   **The "Obtuse" Trap:** 110° is significantly harder than 40° because it requires navigating past the 90° mark, where scale confusion is most prevalent.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
In many government school settings, students are proficient at rote procedural tasks but struggle with precision and scale selection. While 40° is often drawn correctly, the 110° angle (the specific requirement for the 1-mark rubric) is a common "trap" due to the supplementary 70° mark on the inner scale. Given the resource constraints and English proficiency factors, roughly half of the students will likely fall into the "wrong scale" or "alignment" trap.
