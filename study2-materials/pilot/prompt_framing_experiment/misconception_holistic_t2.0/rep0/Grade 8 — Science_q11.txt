Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   **Data Interpretation:** Reading and interpreting information presented in a tabular format.
*   **Comparing Values:** Understanding numerical hierarchy (identifying the "greatest" or "most" in a set of data).
*   **Logical Deduction:** Connecting scientific principles (thermal expansion) to real-world applications (railway tracks).
*   **Decision Making based on Properties:** Analyzing multiple properties (not just expansion) to select an appropriate material for a specific function (conductivity vs. expansion for wires).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Expansion as 'Growth':** Students often think materials gain mass or volume without limit when heated, rather than a specific coefficient. *Effect:* Minimal on part (a), but might lead to confusion in (b).
*   **Conductivity vs. Expansion:** Students might believe the metal that expands most is the best conductor. *Effect:* Could lead to choosing Aluminium for part (c) for the wrong reason, though Aluminium is used for wiring.
*   **Magnitude Confusion:** In Hindi-medium contexts, the technical terms for "expands" (प्रसार/phailna) might be confused with "melting" (pighalna). *Effect:* High potential for incorrect answers.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** Railway tracks are a standard, textbook example used in Indian curriculum (NCERT).
*   **Simple Identification:** Part (a) only requires looking for the highest number/value in a list (assuming the table is clear).
*   **Common Knowledge:** Many students know from general knowledge that copper/aluminium are used for wires.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the English phrasing "recommend for" and "expansion" may be challenging to decode.
*   **Open-ended Structure:** There are no options (MCQs), requiring students to construct sentences in English.
*   **Complexity vs. Rubric:** The rubric only awards 1 mark for identifying Aluminium, but the question has three parts (a, b, and c). This creates a "bottleneck" where a student might answer (b) and (c) correctly but lose the mark if they miss (a).
*   **Synthesis Requirement:** Part (c) requires evaluating two different properties (expansion vs. conductivity) which is a high-level cognitive task for Grade 8.

Step 5: Holistically, while part (a) is straightforward, the combination of linguistic barriers, the multi-part requirement for a single mark, and the need for English sentence construction for (b) and (c) will significantly lower the success rate in this specific demographic.
