Step 1: Identify the scientific concepts and skills required.
The item requires knowledge of thermal physics, specifically heat transfer in solids. Key skills include identifying the process of "conduction" and explaining it at a molecular level (vibration of particles transferring energy to neighbors without the bulk movement of the material).

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
1. Heat as a substance (Caloric theory): Students may think heat "flows" like a liquid through a hollow spoon. This would lead to a correct identification but a flawed explanation.
2. Confusion between Conduction, Convection, and Radiation: Many students mix these up. In this specific item, it would lead to an incorrect answer in part (a).
3. "Cold" moves: Some may think the coldness of the handle is "pushed out," leading to an incorrect explanation.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
1. Familiar context: Most students from economically weaker sections in India interact with steel spoons and tea/hot liquids daily.
2. Language: The English used in the prompt is relatively simple and direct, which helps those with limited English proficiency.
3. Rote Learning: "Steel spoon = Conduction" is a standard textbook example often memorized for exams.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
1. Explanation required: Part (b) requires verbalizing a process. Hindi-medium students may know the concept (चालन) but struggle to articulate the mechanism in English.
2. Spelling: If the teacher is strict about the rubric, misspelling "Conduction" could lead to a loss of marks.
3. No Scaffolding: Being open-ended rather than multiple-choice makes it significantly harder for students who lack confidence in their technical vocabulary.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
Given the heavy emphasis on rote memorization of standard textbook examples in the Indian government school system and the familiarity of the "spoon in tea" scenario, many students will correctly identify "Conduction." However, the descriptive requirement in part (b) will be a significant hurdle for those with limited English proficiency and lower literacy levels.
