Step 1: The question is labeled as "Science" rather than Mathematics. The cognitive skills required involve identifying a cause-effect relationship (nutrient deficiency to crop health) and applying knowledge of soil chemistry (enrichment through organic or inorganic additives).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include the belief that "water is food" for plants (ignoring soil minerals), that plants "eat" soil (rather than absorbing ions), or a confusion between fertilizers (chemicals) and manure (organic). These misconceptions could lead to incorrect answers like "watering more" or "spraying pesticides."

Step 3: Ease factors: The context of farming is highly familiar to students from rural or economically weaker backgrounds. "Yellowing leaves" is a common sight. The term "Nitrogen" (N-P-K) is frequently used in agricultural contexts in India.

Step 4: Hardship factors: The item is open-ended, requiring the student to recall specific terminology (Nitrogen, Potassium, Phosphorus). The Hindi-medium background makes "stunted growth" and "deficiency" difficult vocabulary hurdles. English phrasing like "address this issue" may be confusing for students with limited English proficiency.

Step 5: While the context is relatable, the linguistic barrier and the requirement to recall specific chemical terms in English for an open-ended response significantly lower the expected success rate.
