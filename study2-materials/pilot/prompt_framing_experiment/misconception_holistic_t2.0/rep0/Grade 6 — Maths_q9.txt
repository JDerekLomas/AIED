**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Angle Sum Property of a Triangle:** Understanding that the interior angles of a triangle sum to 180°.
*   **Arithmetic/Subtraction:** Calculating $180 - (50 + 50)$ or $180 - 100$.
*   **Geometric Notation:** Interpreting the vertex labels (A, B, C) and the symbol $x$ representing the unknown angle.

**Step 2: Common Misconceptions**
*   **Angle Sum is 90° or 360°:** Some students confuse the triangle sum with right angles or quadrilaterals. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Visual Prototyping:** If the triangle looks equilateral, a student might guess 60°. If it looks isosceles, they might correctly guess 80°, but for the wrong reason.
*   **Misidentifying Interior/Exterior:** If the diagram includes an external angle (often a distraction in grade 6 items), students may apply the wrong rule. On this specific item (finding interior angle C), it is a direct application of the rule.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Simple Numbers:** In Grade 6, students usually encounter multiples of 10 or 5. $50 + 50 = 100$ is an extremely simple computation, reducing the "cognitive load" of arithmetic.
*   **Familiar Shape:** The triangle is the most practiced polygon for angle sum properties in the Indian NCERT curriculum for Grade 6.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds might struggle if the question contains complex English phrasing, though "Find the angle $x$" is relatively standard.
*   **Abstract Reasoning:** It requires two steps: addition of known angles and then subtraction from 180.
*   **Rubric Constraint:** The rubric specifically awards points for identifying Angle C. If the student makes a calculation error but knows the method, they get 0 in this 0.5-mark scheme.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
In Indian government school contexts, the "Angle Sum Property" is a "rote-drilled" concept. While many students struggle with abstract geometry, the simplicity of the numbers ($50, 50, x$) makes this specific item highly accessible even to students with lower English proficiency. However, the lack of multiple-choice options (distractors) usually lowers the success rate compared to MCQ formats.
