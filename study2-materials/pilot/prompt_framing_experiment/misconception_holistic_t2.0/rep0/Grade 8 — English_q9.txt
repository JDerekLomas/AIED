Step 1: The question asks for synonyms (words with similar meanings) and antonyms (words with opposite meanings). Key skills include vocabulary recall, understanding semantic relationships, and English-to-Hindi/Hindi-to-English translation.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Swapping the terms: Providing an antonym where a synonym is requested and vice versa. This leads to an incorrect answer here.
- Partial definition: Providing a rhyming word instead of a semantic match (e.g., "quite" or "diet").
- Hindi-English interference: Knowing the concept in Hindi ("shant" vs "shor") but being unable to retrieve the specific English orthography.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: "Quiet" is a high-frequency, "Tier 1" vocabulary word used often in classrooms ("Keep quiet"). The concept is concrete and commonly practiced in primary grades.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: The open-ended format (supply vs. select) is significantly harder than multiple choice for students with limited English proficiency. Spelling errors (e.g., "silence" instead of "silent" or "noice" instead of "noise") may occur, though rubrics for this demographic often overlook minor spelling mistakes if the meaning is clear.

Step 5: While "quiet" is a familiar word, the dual requirement of providing both a synonym and an antonym without a word bank increases the cognitive load for Hindi-medium students. Many will provide one correctly but struggle to recall a formal English antonym like "noisy" or "loud" on the spot.
