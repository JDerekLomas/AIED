Step 1: Identify the skills required.
Though categorized as an English item, the underlying cognitive skills involve scanning/skimming a text, vocabulary decoding (synonym identification), and context-clue processing. For a Hindi-medium student, this requires translating the mental concept of "hawa" (wind) or "pawan" into the specific English nuances of intensity.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
A common misconception at this level is that any word related to weather or wind is a synonym. Students might pick "wind" itself (circular reasoning), "storm" (lack of intensity nuance), or "air" (generic noun). Given the Hindi background, the distinction between "breeze" and "wind" is often not taught until later stages of English acquisition. This misconception directly leads to an incorrect answer here.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
The context ("a light wind") is a concrete physical phenomenon. If the passage is a simple story or a descriptive poem, the word "breeze" might appear in a sensory context that aids identification. The sentence structure of the prompt is short and uses high-frequency words.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
The open-ended format (Supply type) is significantly harder than a multiple-choice item. For ESL/Hindi-medium learners from economically weaker sections, active recall of the spelling "breeze" is a hurdle. Limited English exposure means "breeze" is often a "Tier 2" vocabulary word that they may recognize but not independently identify as a synonym for a specific phrase.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
In an Indian government school context, synonym identification in an unseen passage is a high-difficulty task for Grade 8 students with limited English proficiency. While "breeze" is common in textbooks, the jump from "light wind" to a specific target word without options will lead to many blank answers or the repetition of the word "wind."
