### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Knowledge of Formula:** Recall the formula for the area of a triangle ($A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$).
*   **Substitution:** Identifying "base" as 8 and "height" as 6 and plugging them into the formula.
*   **Computation:** Performing multiplication ($8 \times 6 = 48$) and division/multiplication by a fraction ($48 / 2 = 24$).
*   **Unit Awareness:** Understanding that area is measured in square units ($cm^2$), though the rubric focuses on the numerical result for the 1-mark score.

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Rectangle Error:** Multiplying base $\times$ height without dividing by 2 ($8 \times 6 = 48$). This is very common at this level and **would** lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Additive Reasoning:** Adding the dimensions instead of multiplying ($8 + 6 = 14$ or $8+6+8+6$). This **would** lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Perimeter Confusion:** Thinking "area" means the distance around the shape. Without a third side provided, students might stall or guess.
*   **Misidentifying Height:** In diagrams, students often mistake a slanted side for height. However, since this is a word problem where "height" is explicitly labeled, this misconception is bypassed.

### Step 3: Factors making the item easier
*   **Direct Language:** The question uses standard keywords ("base," "height," "area") which are common in both Hindi and English mediums (*aadhar*, *uchai*, *kshetrafal*).
*   **Friendly Numbers:** 8 and 6 are single-digit, even numbers. Dividing their product by 2 is mentally straightforward.
*   **Single-Step Application:** This is a "plug-and-chug" problem requiring no rearrangement of the formula or unit conversion.

### Step 4: Factors making it harder
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students with limited English, "whose" or "height" might be speedbumps, though "Base" and "Triangle" are usually recognizable.
*   **No Visual Aid:** The lack of a diagram means the student must mentally construct the relationship or rely entirely on formula recall.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options (MCQs), there is no "hint" that the product needs to be halved (e.g., if 48 and 24 were both choices).

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
In the context of Indian government schools, this is a "Knowledge/Recall" level question. While the math is simple, the transition from Grade 6 (area of rectangles) to Grade 7 (area of triangles) often sees a significant number of students forgetting the $1/2$ factor. However, because the numbers are small and the terminology is standard, a majority of students who have attended classes on Mensuration will succeed.
