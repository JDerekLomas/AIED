Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, it involves categorization, sets (listing items in a group), and basic descriptive communication. No complex numerical operations are required.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
A common conceptual confusion is between "occupation" and "activity" or "crops." Students might list specific crops (e.g., "wheat") instead of the occupation (Agriculture). In this specific item, if a student lists "growing wheat" instead of "farming," the rubric might be interpreted strictly, leading to a loss of marks, though usually, scorers are lenient in this context.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
The context is highly familiar (situated in Rajasthan). Agriculture and Animal Husbandry are visible, day-to-day realities for students in rural areas or those from economically weaker sections. The requirement to list "any one" in brief allows for personalization based on what the student knows best.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
Language barrier is the primary obstacle. Explaining an occupation "in brief" in English is difficult for Hindi-medium students with limited English proficiency. The open-ended format requires recall and sentence construction rather than recognition. The rubric requires two names plus a description for just 1 mark, which is a high cognitive load for the reward.

Step 5: Holistically, while the content is very familiar, the English language proficiency required to "describe in brief" will act as a significant filter for this specific demographic. Many will name the occupations (in Hindi or English) but fail the descriptive part or fail to provide two distinct occupations.
