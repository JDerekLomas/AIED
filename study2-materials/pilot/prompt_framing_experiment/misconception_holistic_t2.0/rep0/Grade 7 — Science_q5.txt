Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Science item, it requires cognitive classification skills. Students must use logic to categorize organisms based on a binary rule (internal production vs. external consumption) and retrieve specific examples that fit these categories.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
1. "Plants eat soil/water": If a student thinks plants "eat" like animals, they may struggle to define autotrophy as "making food." (Likely to lead to an incorrect answer).
2. "Heterotrophs only eat meat": A student might define heterotrophs too narrowly, excluding herbivores. (May still result in a correct mark if the general dependency is mentioned).
3. Linguistic confusion: Given the Hindi-medium background, students often confuse the terms *Swaposhi* (autotroph) and *Viswamposhi/Parposhi* (heterotroph) when transitioning to English terminology.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- Familiarity: This is a fundamental, high-frequency topic in the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum.
- Rote memorization: The definitions are often taught as a pair of contrasting "scripts" which students from these backgrounds are practiced at memorizing.
- Simple examples: "Green plants" and "Human/Lion" are very common, well-practiced examples.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- English Proficiency: The term "Differentiate" is a complex instructional verb for ESL students. Writing two definitions plus examples in a second language is a high literacy burden.
- Open-ended format: No cues or options are provided to nudge their memory.
- Rubric Rigidity: 1 mark for both definitions and two examples is a high bar for a single point; any one error results in zero.

Step 5: Weighing all factors holistically.
The familiarity of the topic is very high, but the linguistic barrier for a descriptive 1-mark question in English—combined with the need for four distinct pieces of information (two definitions and two examples)—lowers the success rate significantly for students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds.
