Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science item, not a Mathematics item. However, it requires cognitive skills such as categorization (monuments vs. other landmarks), spatial association (matching a monument to a specific city), and descriptive reasoning (identifying historical significance).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
1. **Confusing State vs. City:** Students may list a city as a monument (e.g., "Jaipur" instead of "Hawa Mahal"). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
2. **Geographical Displacement:** Associating a monument with the wrong state (e.g., Qutub Minar in Rajasthan). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
3. **Generalization:** Providing a vague reason for fame (e.g., "It is very beautiful") rather than a historical or architectural reason. Depending on strictness, this might result in a partial loss of credit.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
The context is highly familiar to students in Indian government schools, especially those in or near Rajasthan. Monuments like the Hawa Mahal, Amer Fort, or Chittorgarh Fort are often featured in textbooks and cultural discourse. The requirement is low (only two names).

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
1. **Multi-part prompt:** The question asks for three things: names of two monuments, a city, and a reason. 
2. **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, articulating "why it is famous" in English can be a significant barrier even if they know the facts.
3. **Writing burden:** Unlike multiple-choice, this requires recall and sentence construction.
4. **Scoring Constraint:** The rubric provides 1 mark for the names but the prompt asks for more; if the 1 mark is "all or nothing," small errors in the description part could lead to zero points.

Step 5: Estimate the proportion of students who would produce the fully correct answer.
While the content knowledge is generally high, the combination of English language constraints for EWS/Hindi-medium students and the multi-part nature of the written response lowers the expected success rate for a "fully correct" answer.
