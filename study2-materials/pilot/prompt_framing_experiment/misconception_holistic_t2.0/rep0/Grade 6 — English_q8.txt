Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a language item, it requires logical sequencing and an understanding of syntactic structure (Subject-Verb-Object). In a cognitive sense, it requires "Permutation and Combination" logic—sorting five elements to find the one combination that satisfies the rule of meaningfulness.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Direct Translation Misconception:** In Hindi (SOV), the structure is "He a book reading is" (*Vah ek kitab padh raha hai*). This would lead to "He a book reading is," which is incorrect for this item.
*   **Verb-Subject Inversion:** Confusion with question forms (Is he reading a book?). If punctuated with a period, it might be marked wrong depending on strictness.
*   **Ignoring Determinants:** Placing "a" incorrectly (e.g., "A he is reading book"). This leads to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **High-Frequency Vocabulary:** "Book," "reading," and "he" are among the most common words taught in early English modules in Indian government schools.
*   **Familiar Context:** The act of reading a book is a standard classroom activity mentioned in textbooks.
*   **Simple Structure:** This is a basic Present Continuous sentence, which is a staple of Grade 4–6 curricula.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Linguistic Interference:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds naturally think in Subject-Object-Verb order, making the English SVO order feel "backwards."
*   **Low English Exposure:** Students from economically weaker sections often have little exposure to English outside of school, meaning they lack "ear" for the language to know if a sentence "sounds right."
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no options to choose from, requiring the student to generate the syntax entirely on their own.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given that this specific sentence is a prototypical "textbook example" and uses very high-frequency vocabulary, most Grade 6 students who have attended school regularly will have memorized this pattern, despite their limited overall English proficiency.
