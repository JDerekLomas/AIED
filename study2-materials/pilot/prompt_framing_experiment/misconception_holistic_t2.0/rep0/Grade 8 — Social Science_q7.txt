**Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.**
This is a History/Social Science item rather than a Mathematics item. However, the cognitive skills required include understanding **causality** (how event A led to outcome B), **chronological sequencing** (the year 1757 as a turning point), and **scale** (transitioning from a trading company to a political power).

**Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.**
*   **The "Whole India" Fallacy:** Students often believe the British took over the entire country instantly after one battle. While technically a "misconception" regarding the nuances of sovereignty, this might actually help them answer correctly that British power "expanded."
*   **Company vs. Crown:** Students may not distinguish between the East India Company and the British Government. This is unlikely to affect the score on this item.
*   **Battle vs. Treaty:** Confusing Plassey with the Battle of Buxar or the Treaty of Allahabad. This could lead to an incorrect answer if they credit the "Diwani rights" solely to 1757.

**Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.**
*   **Familiarity:** The Battle of Plassey is one of the most emphasized topics in the Grade 8 Indian NCERT curriculum.
*   **Rote Memorization:** Keywords like "Puppet Nawab" (Mir Jafar) are often memorized as a standard response to this question in government school settings.
*   **Clear Causality:** The link between 1757 and the start of British rule is a fundamental pillar of Indian history teaching.

**Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.**
*   **Language Barrier:** The phrase "contribute to the expansion" is academic English. For students from Hindi-medium or economically weaker backgrounds with limited English exposure, "expansion" and "contribute" might be difficult to decode.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options, students must construct a sentence in English. A student might understand the concept but lack the vocabulary to write "political dominance" or "puppet nawab" in English.
*   **Contextual Complexity:** Understanding the "puppet" mechanism requires an abstract understanding of political control without direct annexation.

**Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.**
While the topic is heavily taught and central to the syllabus, the requirement to produce an English explanation (open-ended) is a significant barrier for students with limited English proficiency. Many students will know "Mir Jafar" and "Siraj-ud-daulah" but may struggle to articulate the *process* of expansion required by the rubric.
