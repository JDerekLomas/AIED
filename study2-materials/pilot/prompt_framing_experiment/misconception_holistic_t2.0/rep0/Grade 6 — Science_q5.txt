Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Science question, the underlying "mathematical" logic involves procedural sequencing (first A, then B) and observation-inference modeling (If X color appears, then Y is present).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Reagent confusion:** Students may confuse iodine with other chemicals like copper sulfate or caustic soda (used for protein tests). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Result confusion:** Students may remember the test but forget the specific color change (blue-black), perhaps thinking it turns red or pink. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Language interference:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may know the concept but struggle to recall the English terms "iodine" or "observation," leading to an incomplete or incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar context:** Potatoes are a staple food in India, and the starch test is one of the most basic, commonly demonstrated experiments in Class 6 Science (NCERT).
*   **Simple procedure:** It is a single-step physical application (dropping liquid on a slice).
*   **High repetition:** This specific test is a high-frequency exam question in Indian government schools.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no options to prompt memory; students must retrieve the vocabulary ("iodine", "blue-black") from scratch.
*   **Language Barrier:** The requirement to "Describe" and "State" in English is a significant hurdle for students with limited English proficiency. Many might know the answer but fail to construct the sentence correctly.
*   **Two-part requirement:** The rubric requires both the reagent and the final observation for a single mark.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
The item is conceptually simple and a "core" fact taught early in the year. However, for economically disadvantaged students in Hindi-medium transitions, the subjective English writing requirement acts as a filter. Many will provide "Iodine" but fail to "Describe" or state the "Blue-black" observation clearly in English.
