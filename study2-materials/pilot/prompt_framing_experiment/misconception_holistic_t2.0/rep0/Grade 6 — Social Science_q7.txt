Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, the implicit "mathematical" logic involves classification (identifying a subset of "natural resources" within the set of "things found in Rajasthan"), logical conjunction (Resource A AND Resource B), and cause-and-effect reasoning (Mapping Resource X → Human Impact).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Conflating "Natural" vs. "Man-made":** Students might list "temples" or "forts." This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Narrow definition of "Resource":** Students often think resources are only liquids (water) or precious metals (gold), missing sunlight or stone.
*   **Category confusion:** Identifying a crop (Bajra) as a natural resource rather than an agricultural product. This is common at Grade 6 and leads to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier:
*   **Familiar Context:** For students in or near Rajasthan, minerals (like stone for houses) and the scarcity of water are lived experiences.
*   **Low Linguistic Barrier in naming:** Students can use simple nouns (Water, Sun).

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   **Language Barrier:** The prompt is in English. Hindi-medium students may struggle to understand "Mention," "Influences," or "Natural Resources."
*   **Compound Task:** It is a three-part task (Identify 1 + Identify 2 + Explain Impact) for only 1 mark. Failure on any part results in 0.
*   **Expressive Language:** The "explain" part requires constructing an English sentence, which is significantly harder for this demographic than a multiple-choice question.
*   **Open-ended:** No scaffolding or options are provided to trigger memory.

Step 5: Holistically weighing factors:
The requirement to write an original explanation in English, combined with the strict "all-or-nothing" rubric for a three-step task, creates a high barrier for Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency, even if they possess the underlying geographical knowledge.
