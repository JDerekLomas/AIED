Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, it involves functional numeracy related to currency, digital transactions (abstract versus physical value), and the macroscopic movement of wealth (economic development). It requires understanding the shift from physical to digital denominations and the velocity of money.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include the idea that money is only "real" if it is physical cash, the confusion between "cost" and "value," and the belief that banks have an infinite supply of money. For this item, viewing digital money only as "fake" or "non-existent" money (due to a lack of physical medium) would prevent an "Evaluation" of its use today.

Step 3: Factors making it easier include the high visibility of "Digital India" and UPI (Unified Payments Interface) in Indian daily life. Even in economically weaker sections, students are likely exposed to QR codes at local tea stalls or shops, providing a concrete familiar context.

Step 4: Factors making it harder include:
- Language Barrier: Words like "Analyze," "Economic Development," and "Evaluate" are high-level academic English commands that may be incomprehensible to Hindi-medium students with limited English.
- Question Structure: It is a double-barreled question requiring two distinct higher-order thinking tasks (Analysis and Evaluation) for only 1 mark.
- Cognitive Demand: Grade 7 students are developmentally transitioning from concrete to abstract reasoning; "economic development" is a highly abstract macro-concept.

Step 5: Given the significant language gap and the requirement to perform high-level synthesis (Analyze/Evaluate) for a single point, most students will struggle to articulate a rubric-compliant answer in English, despite their real-world experience with digital payments.
