Step 1: Identify mathematical concepts and skills.
The item requires basic multiplication (thrice means ×3), multi-step arithmetic reasoning, and an understanding of the properties of age (linear aging). Specifically, students must find the father's current age (36) and then either find their future ages (17 and 41) to subtract them, or realize that the age difference remains constant.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **The "Age-Addition" Misconception:** Some students believe that because people age at the same rate, the *ratio* stays the same, or conversely, they add the "5 years" only to one person.
*   **Constant Difference Ignorance:** Students often fail to realize the age difference is invariant. They may try to add 5 to the result of the first step (36 + 5 = 41) and stop there.
*   **"Thrice" Translation:** For Hindi-medium students, the word "thrice" might be less familiar than "three times" (गुना). This would lead to an incorrect answer or skipping.
*   **Final Goal Misidentification:** Students might calculate the father's age (36) or his future age (41) and stop, thinking they have solved the "hard" part. Given the rubric awards the mark for just calculating 36, this actually helps them here, even if their logic is incomplete.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Simple Numbers:** 12 and 3 are very easy to multiply.
*   **Familiar Context:** Age problems are a staple of Indian Grade 8 curricula (NCERT Chapter 2).
*   **Rubric Lenience:** The provided rubric is extremely generous. It awards the maximum score (1) for merely calculating the father's current age (36), rather than the actual final answer (24). This significantly raises the "correct" rate.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** "Thrice" and "age difference" may be linguistically challenging for students with limited English proficiency.
*   **Multi-step logic:** Even if the math is easy, remembering to perform the second operation is a common hurdle for students from economically weaker sections who may have had disrupted schooling.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Because the rubric only requires the first step (3 × 12 = 36) to get the point, the item becomes significantly easier than if it required the final answer (24). Most Grade 8 students in this demographic can identify that "thrice" relates to "three" and perform basic multiplication, even if they struggle with the concept of invariant age differences.
