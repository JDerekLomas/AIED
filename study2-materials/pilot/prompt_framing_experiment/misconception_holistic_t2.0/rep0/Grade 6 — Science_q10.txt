Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
- Data interpretation: Reading and comparing values in a table.
- Identifying maximum and minimum values (Ordinality).
- Correlating variables (Condition vs. Growth).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
- Misinterpreting "favourable": Some may think the middle value is "best" rather than the highest (Leads to incorrect answer).
- Height vs. Growth rate: Confusing total height with change in height (May not affect (a) but affects understanding).
- Confusing data points: Looking at day 1 instead of day 10 (Leads to incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
- Visual clarity: Most tables show a clear trend (e.g., Full sunlight = highest number).
- Familiar context: Plants and sunlight are basic concepts taught early in primary grades.
- Linguistic "clue": "Most" usually points to the largest number in a data set.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
- Language barrier: Terms like "observed," "favourable," "hindered," and "biological process" are high-level vocabulary for students from Hindi-medium/ESL backgrounds.
- Open-ended explanations: Part (b) and (c) require specific terminology (photosynthesis) which is often a hurdle in second-language acquisition.
- Inference vs. Observation: Part (c) requires external knowledge not found in the table.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
While many students can correctly identify "Full Sunlight" from the table (Part a), the requirement for a "fully correct answer" (all parts) significantly drops the success rate due to the English vocabulary required for the "Explain" and "Name" sections.
