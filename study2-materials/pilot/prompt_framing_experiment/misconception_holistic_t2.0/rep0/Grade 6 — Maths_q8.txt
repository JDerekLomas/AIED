Step 1: Identify mathematical concepts and skills.
Students must know the definition of a rectangle, identify "length" and "breadth" as the two distinct dimensions, recall the formula for Area ($L \times B$) and Perimeter ($2 \times (L+B)$), and perform basic multiplication and addition.

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
1. Area vs. Perimeter Confusion: Students often swap the formulas. This would lead to an incorrect answer here since both are required.
2. Conceptualizing units: Confusing linear units (cm) with square units (cm²). Since the rubric specifically looks for "120 sq. cm," a student who writes just "120" or "120 cm" might lose the point.
3. Semi-perimeter error: Calculating $L + B$ (23) instead of $2 \times (L + B)$.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
The numbers (15 and 8) are simple and within basic multiplication table range. The terms "length" and "breadth" are standard vocabulary in Indian NCERT textbooks.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
1. Language barrier: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the English terms "length" and "breadth" if they are more accustomed to *lambai* and *chaudai*.
2. Dual requirement: The question asks for both Area AND Perimeter, but the rubric provided only mentions Area. If a student calculates the area correctly but fails on the perimeter (or forgets to calculate it), they may technically fail the "item" depending on the strictness of the teacher.
3. No scaffolding: It is a constructed-response item, meaning no options to guide the student's thinking.

Step 5: Estimation.
In the context of Indian government schools, while the math is foundational, the combination of two calculations in one question and the English language transition usually results in a significant number of errors related to formula confusion or omission of one of the parts.
