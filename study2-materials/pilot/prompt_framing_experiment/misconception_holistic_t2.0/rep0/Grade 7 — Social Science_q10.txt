Step 1: This is a Social Science (History) question, not a mathematical one. However, applying a structured analysis: the student requires historical knowledge retrieval, causal reasoning (impact/significance), and English-language expressive skills.

Step 2: Misconceptions/Barriers:
- Chronological confusion: Confusing Ashoka with other Maurya or Gupta rulers (Leads to incorrect answer).
- Concept of "Significance": Students may provide facts (e.g., "He fought the Kalinga war") without explaining the *impact* or *significance* (Leads to partial or incorrect answer based on rubric).
- Conflating Dhamma with strictly Buddhist conversion: Failing to see it as an ethical/governance framework.

Step 3: Ease factors:
- Familiarity: Ashoka is a central, highly emphasized figure in the Grade 6/7 NCERT/State Board curricula in India.
- Iconic narrative: The Kalinga war story is a common cultural touchstone, even for those with lower academic proficiency.

Step 4: Difficulty factors:
- Language barrier: Expressing abstract concepts like "ethical governance" or "transformation of kingship" in English is highly challenging for Hindi-medium students.
- Question structure: The "explain the significance" prompt requires higher-order thinking beyond simple recall.
- Scoring rubric: Requiring two key aspects for only 1 mark makes the scoring threshold high relative to the effort.
- Open-ended format: Requires sentence construction rather than selecting a name.

Step 5: Given the English proficiency barrier and the requirement for structural explanation over simple identification, many students will know *who* Ashoka was but struggle to "explain his significance" according to the rubric's specific demands.
