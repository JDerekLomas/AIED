**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Division of Whole Numbers by Decimals:** Understanding that dividing by a number less than 1 (if it were $0.72$) or greater than 1 ($7.2$) follows specific rules.
*   **Decimal Placement/Equivalent Fractions:** The ability to convert the divisor into a whole number (shifting the decimal) and applying the same transformation to the dividend ($8 \div 7.2 = 80 \div 72$).
*   **Fractional Representation/Simplification:** Recognizing $8/7.2$ as $80/72$ and simplifying it to $10/9$ or performing long division to find a recurring decimal ($1.11...$).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Commutativity Misconception:** Students often divide the larger number by the smaller number regardless of order ($7.2 \div 8$ instead of $8 \div 7.2$). **Effect: Incorrect.**
*   **"Division makes numbers smaller":** Students might expect the answer to be smaller than 8 and struggle when they realize it’s actually close to 1. **Effect: Confusion/Incorrect.**
*   **Decimal Ignorance:** Treating the problem as $8 \div 72$ or $8 \div 7$ and ignoring the decimal point entirely. **Effect: Incorrect.**
*   **Alignment Errors:** In long division, placing the first digit of the quotient in the wrong place value. **Effect: Incorrect.**

**Step 3: Factors that make the item easier**
*   **Small numbers:** The numbers are single or double digits, which reduces the cognitive load of multiplication tables.
*   **Procedural nature:** If the student has been drilled in the specific "shift the decimal" algorithm, it becomes a mechanical task rather than a conceptual one.

**Step 4: Factors that make it harder**
*   **Divisor is larger than the dividend (conceptually):** In $8 \div 7.2$, once the decimal is moved, it becomes $80 \div 72$. However, $7.2$ being so close to $8$ often leads to "estimate-based" errors or 1 being written with no remainder handled.
*   **Non-terminating result:** $80 \div 72 = 1.111...$ In a Grade 7 Indian context, students are often taught to stop at two decimal places or use fractions. Without a specific instruction on where to round, students may stop at "1 remainder 8" and not know how to proceed to a final "value."
*   **Language Barrier:** While the symbols are universal, if the instruction "Find the value of" is not translated or understood, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may hesitate.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
This item is deceptively difficult for Grade 7 students in this demographic. While the numbers are small, the resulting recurring decimal ($1.11...$) and the initial setup (moving the decimal from a whole number dividend) are frequent stumbling blocks for students who rely on rote memorization of whole-number division.
