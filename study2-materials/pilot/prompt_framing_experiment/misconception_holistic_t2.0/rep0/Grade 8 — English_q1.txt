Step 1: Although this is categorized as an "English" item, the cognitive skills involve extracting specific visual data from a text (likely a reading comprehension passage) and translating sensory observations into descriptive language. Syntactically, it requires understanding the past tense "did... look" and providing an attributive description.

Step 2: Misconceptions/Errors: 1) Over-reliance on prior knowledge (answering "blue" because the sky is usually blue), leading to an incorrect answer. 2) Vocabulary mismatch (not knowing "sunset" or colors like "pink/orange"). 3) Structural errors (answering "Sunset look sky," which may be penalized depending on the strictness of the "English" rubric, though the content may be correct).

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The context is highly familiar and concrete; sunset is a universal experience. The question structure is a standard "How + Verb" format common in Indian lower-grade textbooks.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: For Hindi-medium/ESL learners, the transition from reading "orange and pink" in a text to writing it as a full English sentence is a barrier. The rubric's requirement for *both* colors (per the "both colors" instruction) adds a level of specificity that students who only provide one descriptor might miss. Limited English proficiency makes "painted in shades of" (the rubric example) extremely difficult to produce, though the rubric allows for "similar descriptions."

Step 5: Holistically, while the concept is simple, the requirement to produce specific descriptors in a second language and the potential for linguistic interference in economically disadvantaged contexts will lower the success rate.
