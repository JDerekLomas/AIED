**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Concept recognition:** Identifying that the "maximum value" and "exact number of times" signifies a greatest common divisor problem.
*   **Factorization:** Finding the prime factors or divisors of 75 and 69.
*   **HCF Calculation:** Determining the Highest Common Factor (HCF).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Confusion between HCF and LCM:** This is the most common error. Students see "measure... in both bags" and may think of a larger multiple rather than a divisor. This leads to an incorrect answer (1725).
*   **Key-word dependency:** Students might see the word "maximum" and correctly guess HCF, but they may fail to understand *why* HCF is used.
*   **Arithmetic errors:** Errors in prime factorization (e.g., thinking 69 is prime). This leads to an incorrect answer.

**Step 3: Factors making the item easier**
*   **Context:** The context of shopkeepers and weights is a standard "real-world" example used in NCERT textbooks.
*   **Operation:** HCF is a major focus of Grade 6 curriculum in India.
*   **Numbers:** 75 and 69 are relatively small and familiar.

**Step 4: Factors making the item harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the phrase "exact number of times" is syntactically complex in English. Phrases like "measure... exactly" are easier; "measure the weight... an exact number of times" is more abstract.
*   **Format:** It is an open-ended word problem, which requires constructing the logic rather than recognizing a result.
*   **Nuance:** The number 69 is often mistaken for a prime number by students, as $3 \times 23$ is not a common multiplication table fact practiced in lower grades.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
While the concept is central to the curriculum, the linguistic complexity for English Language Learners and the specific numbers (69 often being misidentified as prime) create significant hurdles. However, "Maximum" is a strong trigger word for students trained in test-taking strategies to apply HCF.
