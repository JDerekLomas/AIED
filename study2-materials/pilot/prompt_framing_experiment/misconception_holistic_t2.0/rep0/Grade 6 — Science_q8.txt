Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a science item, the underlying logical skills involve **causal reasoning** and **proportional reasoning** (the relationship between input—nutrients/light—and output—growth/health). It requires "inferring" based on observed data points (stunted growth + yellowing), which is a form of qualitative data interpretation.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **The "Soil as Food" misconception:** Many Grade 6 students believe plants eat soil like humans eat food, rather than understanding minerals as components. *This might help them arrive at "lack of soil/nutrients."*
*   **The "Water is everything" misconception:** Students often attribute any plant ailment solely to a lack of water. *This would lead to a correct answer under this specific rubric.*
*   **Difficulty with "Inference":** Students often describe what they see (restating the prompt) rather than inferring the cause. *This would lead to an incorrect answer.*

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** Students from economically weaker backgrounds, especially in semi-urban or rural Indian settings, are often exposed to farming or home gardening. The visual of a "dying plant" is culturally universal and familiar.
*   **Lenient Rubric:** The rubric accepts multiple diverse answers (nutrients, light, OR water), making it highly likely for a student to hit at least one correct cause.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** The words "stunted," "growth," and "infer" are high-level English vocabulary. For Hindi-medium students with limited English, "stunted" and "infer" may be incomprehensible, preventing them from even accessing the question.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options, students must retrieve "deficiency" or "minerals" from memory and formulate a sentence in English, which is significantly harder for this demographic than a multiple-choice item.
*   **Conceptual Abstractness:** "Nutrients" and "minerals" are abstract concepts compared to "water."

Step 5: Holistically estimate the proportion of students who would produce a fully correct answer.
While the science is basic, the language demands of "stunted" and "infer" combined with the requirement to construct an English sentence will exclude many students who understand the science but cannot navigate the English phrasing. However, the generous rubric (accepting "water") allows those who grasp even a tiny part of the prompt to score.
