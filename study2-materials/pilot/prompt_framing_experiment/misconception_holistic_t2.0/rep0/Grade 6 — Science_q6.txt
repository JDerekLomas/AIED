Step 1: The primary concepts involve understanding biological structures (roots, leaves, stems) and their functions in resource conservation. Students must identify a causal link between an anatomical feature and survival in a specific climate (Desert/Xeric conditions).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include the belief that plants "choose" to grow certain parts out of "willpower" rather than evolutionary adaptation. Some students believe cacti have no leaves at all (rather than modified spines). While these misconceptions exist, they often lead to *correct* functional answers for this specific item (e.g., stating they have "no leaves to save water" would likely be awarded the point).

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The desert (Rajasthan context) is highly familiar to Indian students. Concepts like "storing water" and "long roots" are taught as core "Science" facts in early grades. The rubric is very generous, requiring only one example for a full point.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: The English prompt ("Explain," "Adaptations") uses academic vocabulary that may be challenging for ESL/Hindi-medium learners. An open-ended "Explain" question requires sentence construction, which is harder for this demographic than a multiple-choice or "name one" format. Many students might know the fact but struggle to express the "how" or "why" in English.

Step 5: Given the familiarity of the topic in the Indian curriculum and the low threshold for success (only one way required), but accounting for the language barrier in writing a full explanation, approximately 55% of students are expected to provide a qualifying answer.
