Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
Though this is a Science question, it requires linguistic and structural logic. Students must provide a two-part response: a definition (category + property) and a functional justification (cause-effect reasoning regarding resource competition).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   Misconception: All wild or non-flower plants are weeds. (May lead to a vague answer, but likely acceptable for a 1-mark rubric).
*   Misconception: Weeding is done only for aesthetic reasons. (Leads to an incorrect justification).
*   Misconception: Weeds are "harmful" like pests/insects rather than plants. (Might lead to incorrect reasoning about why they are removed).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   Context: Extremely familiar to students from rural or economically weaker backgrounds who may have personal experience with farming or kitchen gardens.
*   Curriculum: This is a core "Kharif and Rabi" chapter concept emphasized heavily in Indian government school textbooks (NCERT).
*   Vocabulary: "Weeds" (Khapartwar in Hindi) is a common term.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
*   English Proficiency: For Hindi-medium students, explaining "agricultural practice" and "removal" in English is a significant hurdle. They might know the concept but fail to articulate it.
*   Open-ended format: No cues or options to trigger memory.
*   Two-part demand: The question asks "What" and "Why" but only offers 1 mark, which might lead students to provide only a partial answer.
*   Rubric mismatch: The rubric asks for a definition, but the question asks for both a definition and a reason. If the teacher follows the rubric strictly, partial English might be penalized.

Step 5: Holistically weighing factors.
The agricultural context is a strong advantage for this demographic, but the requirement to explain the "Why" in English—combined with the limited 1-mark rubric—creates a bottleneck. While many students will know what a weed is, formulating the importance of weeding (competition for nutrients/light) in English is a complex task for this specific student profile.
