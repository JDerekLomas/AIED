Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
Though this is a Social Science item, it involves spatial reasoning, understanding of geometric layouts (grid patterns), architectural proportions (standardized bricks), and hierarchical classification (division into lower/upper sections).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Anachronism:** Believing ancient people lacked "advanced" technology. (Likely to lead to vague or incorrect answers).
*   **Scaling/Spatial Layout:** Difficulty visualizing a "grid" versus organic growth. (May lead to incorrect descriptions).
*   **Terminology Confusion:** Mixing up "Citadel" with religious or modern political structures. (Could lead to incorrect answers).

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Curricular Emphasis:** Harappan Civilization is a foundational, highly emphasized topic in the NCERT/State Board Grade 6 and 8 syllabus.
*   **Visual Nature:** The concept is often taught with strong visual aids (maps/diagrams of Great Baths/Grids) which transcends language barriers.
*   **Low Threshold:** The rubric accepts multiple diverse answers; the student only needs to recall *one* feature.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds may struggle to translate technical terms (e.g., "citadel," "drainage," "grid") into English.
*   **Open-Ended Format:** No options provided to trigger memory; requires active recall and sentence construction.
*   **Abstract Concepts:** "Urban planning" is a sophisticated term that may be difficult to conceptualize in a second language.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given that this is a "core" topic frequently repeated in Indian classrooms and the rubric is generous (accepting several different answers), a significant portion of students will recall a keyword like "drains," "bricks," or "streets," even if their English syntax is poor.
