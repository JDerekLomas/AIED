Step 1: Identify mathematical concepts and skills.
Students must understand the decimal place value system, specifically identifying the value of a digit based on its position (units, tens, hundreds, thousands). They must differentiate between "face value" (5) and "place value" (500).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Face Value Confusion:** Treating the digit as its standalone value. (Leads to incorrect answer: 5).
*   **Column Misidentification:** Counting from left to right instead of right to left, or skipping a place. (Could lead to 50 or 5000).
*   **Additive/Position Error:** Writing "3rd place" or "2nd place" instead of the value.
*   **Language Interference:** Confusing "tens" and "tenths" (though less likely with whole numbers) or struggling with the English term "Place Value" vs. Hindi "Sthaniya Maan."

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   The number (7560) is relatively small (within thousands).
*   The digit 5 is in a "clean" position (Hundreds) without the complexity of zeros or decimals.
*   Place value is a core topic introduced in early primary and heavily drilled in Indian government curricula (NCERT Grade 3-5).

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Medium of Instruction:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds might know the concept but fail if they don't recognize the English term "place value."
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options (A, B, C, D), students must recall the term or calculate the value without prompts, increasing the chance of simple recall errors or "face value" responses.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given that this is a fundamental, heavily practiced competency in Grade 6, and "500" is a very intuitive answer for students who have even a basic grasp of numbers, a majority of students will answer correctly despite language barriers. However, the confusion with "face value" is the most significant distractor for this demographic.
