Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
There are no mathematical concepts or skills required. This is an English Language Arts literacy task involving reading comprehension, extracting specific details from a narrative text (*Three Questions* by Leo Tolstoy), and synthesizing those details into a short-written explanation.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
While not mathematical, common misconceptions or errors for this specific task include:
- **Literal vs. Inferential confusion:** Students might struggle to distinguish between the "what" (the three questions) and the "why" (the king's belief in his own success).
- **Misinterpretation of "fail":** Students might associate "fail" only with school examinations rather than general success in life/governance.
Given the English-learner context, the phrasing "if he knew the answers" may be misinterpreted as the king seeking answers for a specific test rather than universal principles. This would lead to an incorrect or incomplete answer on this item.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier:
- **Narrative context:** The story of the three questions is a classic and very commonly taught text in Indian Grade 7 English (NCERT curriculum), making the context highly familiar.
- **Specific rubric:** The rubric is lenient, allowing "any valid reason," which lowers the bar for a "fully correct" response.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder:
- **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the grammatical construction "Why the king felt..." (which is also technically missing an auxiliary verb "did") can be confusing to process and respond to in English.
- **Constructed Response:** Requiring 2-3 full sentences is a significant hurdle for students with limited English proficiency; they may know the answer but be unable to write it correctly.
- **Question Phrasing:** The question contains a complex conditional structure ("would never fail if he knew...").

Step 5: Holistic estimate:
While the story is well-known, the requirement to produce 2-3 original sentences in English is the primary barrier for students from economically weaker sections with limited English exposure. Many will likely provide one-word answers or fragmented phrases (e.g., "to be a good king") rather than the multi-sentence explanation required.
