**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Vocabulary-Operation Mapping:** Understanding that the word "of" signifies the operation of multiplication in the context of fractions.
*   **Fraction Multiplication:** Knowing the algorithm for multiplying fractions (numerator $\times$ numerator / denominator $\times$ denominator).
*   **Comparison of Unlike Fractions:** Determining which of two fractions is larger by finding a common denominator (e.g., LCM of 8 and 15 is 120) or converting them to equivalent fractions ($45/120$ vs. $32/120$).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Additive "of":** Some students might add the fractions instead of multiplying ($1/2 + 3/4 = 5/4$). *Result: Incorrect.*
*   **Cross-Multiplication Error:** Students often confuse the rule for *dividing* fractions or *comparing* fractions with the rule for *multiplying* them.
*   **Whole Number Bias:** Looking at denominators ($8 < 15$) and assuming $4/15$ is greater because 15 is a larger number, or vice versa. *Result: Incorrect.*
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may not immediately associate "of" with "का" (kā), leading to confusion about which operation to perform.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Simple Numbers:** The numerators and denominators are small (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which keeps the mental load of the multiplication itself low.
*   **Standard Curriculum:** This specific type of problem is a staple in NCERT textbooks for Class 7, meaning it is a highly "practiced" item type.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Multi-Step Process:** The student must multiply (twice), then find a common denominator (LCM calculation), then convert, then compare. There are many points where a calculation error can occur.
*   **Abstract Format:** The lack of a real-world context makes it harder for students to use intuition (e.g., visualizing "half of three-quarters of a pizza").
*   **No Multiple Choice:** Since there are no options to guess from, the student must rely entirely on their procedural knowledge.
*   **Limited English:** While the math is standard, the phrase "Which is greater" requires specific linguistic decoding.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
In government school contexts where many students are still bridging English terms and where fraction comparisons are a known hurdle, many students will succeed at the multiplication step but fail at the comparison step (failing to find a common denominator).
