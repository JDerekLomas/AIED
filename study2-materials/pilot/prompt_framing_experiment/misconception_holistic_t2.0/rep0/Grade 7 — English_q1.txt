Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a language arts (English) comprehension item based on a narrative text. It requires literal retrieval of information from a passage, sequential memory, and English sentence construction. No mathematical concepts are involved.

Step 2: List common misconceptions and their impact.
In the context of English language learners (ELL):
1. **Misinterpreting the prompt:** Students might confuse "What were the three questions" with "Who gave the answers." This would lead to an incorrect response.
2. **Translation error:** Hindi-medium students might understand the story in L1 but fail to translate the "who/what/when" structure into correct English, potentially losing marks depending on rubric strictness.
3. **Lack of specific detail:** Students may answer "the king wanted to know how to be a good ruler," which is the theme but not the literal "three questions" required by the rubric.

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
The text ("Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy) is a staple of the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum in India. Most students would have practiced this specific question in class. The context of a "King" is a familiar storytelling trope.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
The open-ended format requires writing a full sentence in English, which is difficult for students with limited proficiency. The rubric requires three distinct points (time, people, thing); missing even one would likely result in a zero if the score is binary (0 or 1).

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
Since this is a foundational, frequently tested textbook question, rote memorization helps many students. However, the requirement to produce an English sentence without the aid of multiple-choice options, combined with the low English proficiency of the target demographic, creates a significant barrier.
