Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is an English language item based on the poem "The Squirrel" by Mildred Bowers Armstrong, the mathematical concept embedded in the description is **shape recognition** and **analogical geometry**. Students must map the physical curvature of an object to a known symbolic shape (a question mark).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- **Symbol vs. Object Confusion:** Students may struggle to equate a punctuation mark (a linguistic symbol) with a physical geometric property of an animal. 
- **Literalism:** Hindi-medium students may translate "tail" literally and describe its texture (furry/bushy) rather than its form.
- **Item Relevance:** Since the answer "question mark" is a specific textual metaphor from the poem, students who lack reading fluency or have not memorized that specific line will fail, regardless of their visual-spatial reasoning.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- The poem "The Squirrel" is a standard, very short, and core part of the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum in India.
- The image of the "question mark for tail" is the most famous line of the poem and is often highlighted with illustrations in textbooks.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- **Language Barrier:** English-medium questions for Hindi-medium learners pose a challenge in sentence construction. Even if they know the answer is a "?" they may not know how to write "It is like a question mark" in English.
- **Open-ended format:** There are no visual cues or options to trigger recognition.
- **Socio-economic context:** Limited access to supplementary reading or coaching means the student is entirely dependent on classroom rote-learning of this specific text.

Step 5: Estimate proportion of students:
In Indian government school contexts, this specific question is a "frequent flier" in exams. Most students memorize this specific answer as a "one-word" response ("Question mark"). Despite language barriers, the high level of repetition in state curricula usually leads to a decent success rate for this specific rote-memorized fact.
