Step 1: The question asks for a central theme, requiring skills in reading comprehension, thematic analysis, and summarizing abstract concepts. From a logical structure standpoint (though it is an English item), it requires mapping characters to abstract values (King = Power, Rich Man = Wealth, Child = Freedom) and recognizing a "null" transaction where the bargain is satisfied by nothing material.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include: 
- Taking the text literally (thinking it is about a job hunt rather than a philosophical quest). 
- Equating success with money (assuming the "best" bargain must be the one with the highest pay).
- Difficulty differentiating between a "summary" (what happened) and a "theme" (the message).
Given this specific item, these misconceptions would likely lead to incorrect answers focused on the king or the rich man rather than the child.

Step 3: Ease factors: The poem is a standard part of the NCERT Class 8 curriculum. Many teachers emphasize this specific theme in rote memorization or during exam preparation, making it a "remembering" level task for some.

Step 4: Hardship factors: 
- Open-ended format: No scaffolding or options to prompt memory. 
- English Proficiency: Expressing abstract concepts like "unfettered," "power vs. freedom," or "materialistic vs. spiritual" in a second language is extremely difficult for students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds.
- Vocabulary barrier: If students cannot recall the English words for "freedom" or "power," they may fail despite understanding the poem.

Step 5: For many students in these circumstances, the barrier is not understanding the poem's story, but articulating the abstract theme in formal English. While rote learning helps some, the requirement for an open-ended English response on an abstract topic is a high hurdle.
