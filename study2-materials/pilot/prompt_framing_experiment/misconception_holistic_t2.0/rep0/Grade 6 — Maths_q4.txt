### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Knowledge of Multiples:** Understanding what a multiple is and how to list them.
*   **Prime Factorization or Division Method:** Ability to decompose numbers into primes ($2, 3, 5$) or perform the synthetic division method (Ladders/L-shape).
*   **Multiplication and Division Fluency:** Proficiency in basic multiplication tables (up to 20).
*   **Conceptual Understanding of "Least":** Selecting the smallest common value rather than just any common multiple.

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Confusing LCM with HCF (Highest Common Factor):** Students might find the factors and identify the HCF (which is 1 for this set). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Operational Errors:** Forgetting to multiply the remaining prime factors or incorrectly multiplying the result (e.g., $2^2 \times 3 \times 5 = 60$). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Missing a Number:** Only calculating the LCM for two of the three numbers (12 and 15, or 15 and 20). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Additive Logic:** Adding the numbers together instead of finding multiples. This leads to an incorrect answer.

### Step 3: Factors Making the Item Easier
*   **Familiarity:** Finding the LCM of 12, 15, and 20 is a "textbook classic" example in Indian curricula (NCERT).
*   **Friendly Numbers:** 12, 15, and 20 are small, standard numbers. Most students have memorized their tables or know their divisibility rules (all are divisible by 2, 3, or 5).
*   **Simple Command:** The question is direct. The term "L.C.M." is commonly used in both Hindi and English mediums, bypassing the language barrier.

### Step 4: Factors Making the Item Harder
*   **Open-Ended (Constructed Response):** Without multiple-choice options, students cannot "test" answers or use process of elimination; they must rely entirely on their calculation.
*   **Multi-Step Process:** The division method requires several steps of division followed by a final multiplication step, increasing the chance of a "careless" error.
*   **Economic/Medium Background:** Students from economically weaker sections may have gaps in foundational multiplication table fluency if their early schooling was inconsistent.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the concept of LCM is notoriously difficult for students to understand deeply (the *why*), the *procedure* for finding it is one of the most heavily drilled exercises in Grade 6. In the Indian school context, even students with limited English proficiency are generally proficient in these algorithmic procedures because the notation is universal. The numbers chosen ($12, 15, 20$) are the "simplest" version of a 3-number LCM problem.
