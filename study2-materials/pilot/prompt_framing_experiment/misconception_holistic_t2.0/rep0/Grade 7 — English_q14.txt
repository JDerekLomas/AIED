Step 1: As this is an English language item, the skills required are vocabulary acquisition, understanding the semantic relationship of antonyms, and the ability to retrieve the specific term "modern" or "new" from memory.

Step 2: Common misconceptions/errors:
- Associating "ancient" with "old" (synonym instead of antonym). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Confusion with similar-sounding words (phonetic interference).
- Literal translation errors from Hindi (e.g., "Purana" translated only as "Old," making the reversal to "New" easier but "Modern" harder).

Step 3: Factors making it easier: "Ancient" is a frequent keyword in Grade 6 and 7 History (Social Studies) textbooks. The concept of "Ancient/Modern" history is a standard classification students encounter. The rubric accepts "new," which is basic high-frequency vocabulary.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: The question is open-ended (supply-type) rather than multiple-choice. For Hindi-medium students, the word "antonym" itself may be unfamiliar unless "opposite" is also provided (which it is here). "Ancient" is a Tier 2 vocabulary word that students from economically weaker sections may not use in daily conversation, relying entirely on classroom exposure.

Step 5: Given the cross-curricular reinforcement from History and the inclusion of "new" in the rubric, a significant portion of students will likely get this right, though the lack of options will lead to blank answers for some.
