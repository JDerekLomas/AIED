Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is an English Language Arts (ELA) question rather than a mathematical one. It requires literary analysis, vocabulary acquisition (adjectives), and the ability to synthesize the tone of a text into a single descriptive term.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Conflating content with style:** Students often describe *what* the poem is about (e.g., "nature") rather than *how* it is written (e.g., "descriptive"). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Conflating mood with style:** Students may describe their feelings (e.g., "happy") instead of the author's technique. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Vocabulary limitations:** Students may understand the style but lack the English adjective to label it.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Generous Rubric:** The rubric accepts any "suitable and relevant" word, allowing for a wide range of correct responses.
*   **Short response:** Only one word is required, minimizing grammatical errors.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, words like "descriptive" or "informal" are academic vocabulary that may not be part of their active English lexicon.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without a word bank or multiple-choice options, students must retrieve words from memory rather than recognizing them.
*   **Abstract Reasoning:** Identifying "style" requires a higher level of Bloom’s Taxonomy (Analysis) than simply retrieving facts from the text.

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.
In the context of Grade 7 students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency, the abstract nature of "writing style" combined with the lack of vocabulary scaffolds makes this a very challenging item. Most students will likely describe the subject of the poem rather than the style.
