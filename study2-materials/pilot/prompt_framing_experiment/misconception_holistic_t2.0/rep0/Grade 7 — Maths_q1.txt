**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Integer multiplication:** Understanding the product of absolute values ($3 \times 4$).
*   **Sign Rules (Sign Property):** Knowledge of the specific rule that the product of two negative integers is a positive integer ($(-a) \times (-b) = ab$).
*   **Symbolic Literacy:** Recognizing parentheses as containers for negative signs and the $\times$ symbol as the operator.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Addition vs. Multiplication rule:** Students often confuse multiplication rules with addition rules (e.g., "negative plus negative is negative, so negative times negative must be negative"). **Effect:** Leads to $-12$. (High impact)
*   **Negative sign as "Subtraction":** Treating the expression as $-3$ minus $4$ or similar. **Effect:** Leads to $-7$. (Low impact but possible)
*   **Rule over-generalization:** Believing the answer must always take the sign of the "greater" number. **Effect:** $-4$ is the "larger" magnitude, so the answer remains negative.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Simple Numbers:** The use of 3 and 4 (basic times tables) eliminates cognitive load related to arithmetic, focusing purely on the sign rule.
*   **Rote Memorization:** In many Indian government schools, sign rules are taught as catchy rhymes (e.g., "Minus minus plus"), which students find easy to memorize even without conceptual depth.
*   **Familiar Format:** This is a "textbook-style" drill question that students see repeatedly.
*   **Language Independence:** Since it is purely symbolic, limited English proficiency is not a barrier here.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Open-ended:** No options to prompt the student; they must generate "12" or "+12" from scratch.
*   **The "Intuition" Trap:** Intuitively, children often feel that "adding" or "multiplying" negatives should result in something "more negative," making the positive result counter-intuitive.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
While the math is simple, the confusion between addition rules ($ -3 - 4 = -7 $) and multiplication rules ($ -3 \times -4 = 12 $) is a pervasive "sticky" misconception in Grade 7. However, because this specific drill (single-digit integer multiplication) is heavily prioritized in the curriculum and requires zero English decoding, a slight majority of students will recall the "minus times minus" rule correctly.
