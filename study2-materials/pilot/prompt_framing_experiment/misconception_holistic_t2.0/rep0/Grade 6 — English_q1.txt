Step 1: This is a literacy-based retrieval task. The primary "mathematical" logic involved is spatial prepositional understanding (positional mapping) and information matching from a text source.

Step 2: Misconceptions in this context refer to linguistic decoding errors. Students might mistake the "where" (place) for "when" (time) or "who" (person). A common error for ESL/ELL students is keyword matching: if the text mentions a "shelf" or a "box" near the "attic," they may select the wrong noun. In this case, choosing any noun that isn't the location would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Ease factors: The question uses a high-frequency question word ("Where") and simple past tense ("did... find"). If the text is short, "attic" likely stands out as a unique location noun.

Step 4: Harder factors: The word "attic" is culturally specific and likely unfamiliar to students from economically weaker sections in India (where houses rarely have attics; they might have a "loft" or "tand"). Limited English proficiency makes "attic" a "nonsense word" to many, leading to spelling errors or failure to recognize it as a place. The open-ended format requires the student to produce the word rather than recognize it.

Step 5: Given the disconnect between the vocabulary ("attic") and the lived experience/English levels of the target demographic, many students will struggle to identify the specific word even if they find the sentence.
