### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Knowledge of Formulas:** Identifying and applying the formulas for the area of a rectangle ($L \times W$) and the area of a square ($Side \times Side$).
*   **Arithmetic:** Performing basic multiplication ($5 \times 4$ and $5 \times 5$) and subtraction ($25 - 20$) to find the difference.
*   **Spatial Comparison:** Comparing two distinct geometric shapes based on a derived attribute (area).
*   **Measurement Units:** Understanding and applying square units (sq.cm).

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Area vs. Perimeter Confusion:** Many students calculate perimeter ($2[L+W]$ or $4 \times S$) instead of area. 
    *   *Effect on this item:* Incorrect answer.
*   **Additive vs. Multiplicative Reasoning:** Students might add the dimensions ($5+4$ and $5+5$) instead of multiplying. 
    *   *Effect on this item:* Incorrect answer.
*   **Confusion with "Greater":** Some may assume "greater" refers to the perimeter or just the larger numerical dimension provided (the "5").
    *   *Effect on this item:* Might accidentally pick the square but provide the wrong reasoning/value.
*   **Linear Measurement Thinking:** Treating area as a 1D attribute.

### Step 3: Factors making the item easier
*   **Simple Numbers:** The use of 4 and 5 involves very basic multiplication tables that most students have memorized.
*   **Familiar Shapes:** Squares and rectangles are the primary shapes introduced in Grade 6.
*   **Direct Comparison:** The comparison is explicit ("which of the two"), which provides a clear goal.

### Step 4: Factors making it harder
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the phrase "by how much" might be misinterpreted if their English proficiency is low. They might identify the larger shape but fail to perform the subtraction.
*   **Two-Step Process:** Students must perform two separate area calculations and then a third calculation (subtraction) to find the difference. Many students stop after the first step.
*   **Unit Conversion/Notation:** While units are simple, Grade 6 students often forget to write "sq.cm" or "cm²," though the rubric seems to focus on the calculation.
*   **Lack of Visuals:** The absence of a diagram forces students to mentally visualize the shapes or translate words into a sketch, which increases cognitive load for ELL students.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the multiplication is simple, the requirement to perform three operations (two multiplications and one subtraction) without a visual prompt often leads to errors in Indian government school contexts. The "by how much" part is a significant hurdle for students with limited English.
