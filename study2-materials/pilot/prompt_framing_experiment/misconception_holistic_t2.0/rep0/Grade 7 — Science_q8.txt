Step 1: Identify the mathematical/scientific concepts and skills required.
The question requires knowledge of natural indicators (turmeric and hibiscus). Students must recall specific color changes: turmeric turns red in a base and remains yellow in an acid; hibiscus turns green/yellow in a base and magenta/pink in an acid. The skill involves applying a classification procedure (testing and observation).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
1. Universal indicator confusion: Thinking turmeric turns green or blue in bases (confusion with litmus). Result: Incorrect answer.
2. Acidic reaction: Believing turmeric changes color in acids (it stays yellow). Result: Incorrect answer.
3. Mixing confusion: Thinking you must mix turmeric and hibiscus together to get a result. Result: Likely incorrect/muddled answer.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
- Context: Turmeric (Haldi) and Hibiscus (Gudhal) are highly familiar, everyday materials in Indian households, making the physical concept relatable.
- Low-complexity procedure: The physical act of dipping or mixing is straightforward.
- Rubric flexibility: The rubric allows for partial/alternative scientific observations.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
- Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students, phrasing "determine," "liquid," and "extract" in English can be a significant hurdle. They may understand the science but lack the English vocabulary to describe the process.
- Open-ended format: No options (MCQs) are provided. Students must construct a sentence, which is significantly harder than recognition.
- Memory Load: Recalling two different color changes for two different indicators without confusion is high-stakes for 1 mark.

Step 5: Holistically, while the science is core to the Grade 7 curriculum (Chapter: Acids, Bases and Salts), the requirement to describe a process in English for students with limited proficiency and from economically weaker sections (who may have less exposure to lab-style questioning) suggests a low success rate for a fully correct description.
