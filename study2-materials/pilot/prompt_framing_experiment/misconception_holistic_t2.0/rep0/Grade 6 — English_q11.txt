Step 1: Identify the linguistic and grammatical concepts required.
The student must understand the concept of a "verb phrase," which requires distinguishing between a main verb (playing) and an auxiliary/helping verb (are). They must also identify that these two words function together as a single unit within the sentence structure.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Verb = Action only:** Students may only identify "playing" because it represents the physical action, omitting "are." This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Single-word focus:** Many students are taught that a verb is a single "doing word." They may not realize a "phrase" can include more than one word. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Subject-Verb confusion:** Students might include the noun (children) or the object (football) if they associate the "verb phrase" with the entire predicate.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** The sentence structure (Subject + Verb + Object) is the most basic form taught in English as a Second Language (ESL).
*   **Common Vocabulary:** "Children," "playing," and "football" are high-frequency words that Hindi-medium students likely know.
*   **Present Continuous Tense:** This is often one of the first multi-word verb forms students learn.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
*   **Linguistic Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the term "verb phrase" is technical jargon. They might know the action but not the grammatical label.
*   **Lack of Scaffolding:** Since there are no multiple-choice options, students must know exactly which words to extract.
*   **Auxiliary Verb Neglect:** In Hindi, helping verbs often appear at the end of a sentence (e.g., *खेल रहे हैं*). Translating this structure to English sometimes causes students to miss "are" as part of the core verb unit.

Step 5: Holistically, while the sentence is simple, the specific grammatical term "verb phrase" is a significant hurdle for Grade 6 students from economically weaker backgrounds with limited English exposure, who likely focus on vocabulary rather than structural linguistics.
