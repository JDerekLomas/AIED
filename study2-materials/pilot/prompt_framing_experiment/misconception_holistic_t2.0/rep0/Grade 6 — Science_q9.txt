Step 1: This is a Science item (Biology/Nutrition) rather than a mathematical one. The skills required include recall of definitions, understanding the physiological function of nutrients (protection against disease), and identifying specific deficiency diseases.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include the idea that "protection" means physical protection (like skin or bones) rather than immune system support, or confusing the roles of energy-giving foods (carbohydrates/fats) with body-building foods (proteins). Students may misclassify a mineral deficiency (like anemia) as a vitamin deficiency. These misconceptions would lead to incorrect answers.

Step 3: The concept of "protective foods" is a central, emphasized keyword in the Grade 6 Science curriculum (NCERT). The examples of deficiency diseases (Scurvy, Beriberi, Goitre, Anemia) are rote-learned and frequently practiced in classroom drills and textbook exercises.

Step 4: Factors making it harder include the English language requirement for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, as they may struggle to phrase "help our body fight against diseases" in English even if they understand the concept. The open-ended format requires recall rather than recognition. The rubric is quite strict (asking for two parts for a single point), meaning an error in either (a) or (b) results in zero marks.

Step 5: Given the emphasis on this specific terminology in Indian government school exams and the high degree of memorization typical for these topics, many students will recognize the "protective foods" keyword. However, the requirement to answer both parts correctly in English for a single mark will lower the success rate.
