Step 1: This is a Social Science (History) question rather than a mathematical one. However, applying a pedagogical analysis: the item requires categorizing information into two distinct groups, defining terms, and recalling specific instances (examples) for each category. The cognitive skill involved is "Differentiation" and "Application."

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Believing that "history" only refers to written books (misclassifying all sources as literary).
- Confusing inscriptions (archaeological) with literary sources because they contain writing. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Thinking archaeology only means "dinosaurs" or "very old things," failing to identify coins or pottery as archaeological sources.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The concepts of "monuments" and "old books" are generally taught early in the curriculum and are standard vocabulary in Indian Social Science textbooks. The examples requested (like coins or Ramayana) are culturally familiar.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- Language barrier: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle to produce the English words "archaeological" and "literary" even if they understand the concepts in Hindi (पुरातात्विक and साहित्यिक). 
- Open-ended format: No cues or options provided. 
- Multi-part requirement: The student must define both AND give an example for both within a very constrained maximum score (1 mark), making it a high-stakes per-sentence task.
- Length of words: "Archaeological" is phonetically difficult for non-native English speakers.

Step 5: Given the high demand for specific vocabulary production in a second language and the multi-step nature of the rubric for a single point, many students from this demographic will struggle to formulate the full English response even if they have the conceptual knowledge.
