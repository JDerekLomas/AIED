Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   Distributive property (FOIL method or horizontal/column multiplication).
*   Laws of Indices (e.g., $a \cdot a = a^2$).
*   Operations with signed integers (handling negative coefficients).
*   Identification and combination of like terms ($9ab - 4ab$).
*   Understanding the terminology ("product" and "binomial").

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Exponent confusion:** Adding variables instead of multiplying ($a + a = 2a$, but $a \cdot a = a^2$). Students might write $6a$ instead of $6a^2$. (Leads to incorrect answer)
*   **Variable interaction:** Thinking $ab$ becomes something else or cannot be combined. (Leads to incorrect answer)
*   **Integer sign errors:** Mismanaging the $-2b$ during distribution (e.g., $(-2b) \cdot (3b) = +6b^2$ or $-2b \cdot 2a = +4ab$). (Leads to incorrect answer)
*   **The "Freshman's Dream":** Simply multiplying the first terms and last terms $(3a \cdot 2a)$ and $(-2b \cdot 3b)$, omitting the middle terms. (Leads to incorrect answer)

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   The coefficients (2 and 3) are small and very familiar.
*   The term "Product" is a standard keyword in both English and Hindi (*gunanphal*) instruction.
*   This is a "drill and kill" type question that is a staple of NCERT Chapter 9 (Algebraic Expressions) and is heavily practiced for exams.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **No Multiple Choice:** Since it is open-ended, students cannot reverse-engineer or guess; they must perform the algorithm perfectly.
*   **The Negative Sign:** The presence of $(3a - 2b)$ introduces a subtraction/negative operation, which significantly increases the error rate compared to all-positive expressions.
*   **English Language:** For Hindi-medium students, while "binomial" is a technical term, the phrasing "Find the product of..." is basic but requires decoding if they are struggling with English transitions.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
In Indian government school settings, algebraic manipulation is taught via heavy rote memorization of procedures. While many students will struggle with the negative sign or the $a^2$ notation, a significant portion of Grade 8 students would have been drilled on this specific structure ("Multiply $(a+b)(c+d)$") repeatedly. However, the requirement for a *fully correct* expansion with no sign errors or like-term errors usually filters out more than half the class in economically weaker sections where remedial support is low.
