Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a definitional task within the subject of English Literature, not Mathematics. However, in the context of cognitive processing for this demographic, it requires recall of a specific category definition, linguistic categorization (identifying "genre"), and the ability to articulate dual criteria (characters and purpose).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Genre Confusion:** Students often mistake a "fable" for a "folk tale" or a "fairy tale." (Likely to lead to a partially incorrect or vague answer).
*   **Animal characters as the only criterion:** Many students believe any story with animals is a fable, ignoring the "moral lesson" requirement. (Leads to an incorrect/incomplete answer per rubric).
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may understand the concept (as 'naitik kahani' or 'Panchatantra' style) but struggle to produce the specific English vocabulary "imparts," "moral," or "typically."

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   The concept is foundational and usually covered early in Grade 8 (often through "The Ant and the Cricket").
*   Fables are a familiar cultural concept in India (Panchatantra/Jataka tales), making the mental schema accessible even if the English words are not.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Proficiency:** This is a high-stakes barrier. Constructing a complete sentence in English with precise academic vocabulary ("imparts a moral lesson") is difficult for EAL (English as an Additional Language) learners.
*   **Recall vs. Recognition:** As an open-ended "Define" question with no options, students must retrieve information from scratch rather than recognizing the correct definition.
*   **Rubric Rigidity:** The rubric requires two distinct components (animal characters AND moral lesson). Missing either results in a score of 0.

Step 5: Weighted estimate.
While the concept is familiar, the requirement to produce a formal definition in English, combined with the socioeconomic and linguistic barriers described, makes it highly unlikely that a majority of students will provide a response that meets both criteria of the rubric.
