Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a grammar item, the cognitive task involves categorization and structural analysis. The student must distinguish between a preposition (requiring an object) and an adverb (modifying the verb "ran").

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Word-Category Mapping:** Many students believe a word can only be one part of speech. Since "around" is frequently taught as a preposition (e.g., "around the tree"), they will mislabel it here. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Positional Bias:** Students often assume any word following a verb that describes "where" must be a preposition. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Hindi-English Interference:** In Hindi, postpositions behave differently. Students may struggle to see "around" as a standalone modifier without a following noun.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   The sentence is extremely short (three words) and uses high-frequency vocabulary.
*   The context of "running" is concrete and familiar.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Limited English Proficiency:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often rely on rote memorization of definitions rather than functional analysis of sentences.
*   **No Multiple Choice:** The open-ended format prevents guessing and requires the student to recall and spell "adverb" correctly.
*   **Technical Distinction:** The distinction between an adverb and a prepositional "particle" or intransitive preposition is a high-level nuance for 7th-grade ESL students. Most will reflexively label "around" as a preposition.

Step 5: Holistically, most students at this level, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds with limited English exposure, will categorize "around" based on its most common role (preposition) rather than its function in this specific sentence.
