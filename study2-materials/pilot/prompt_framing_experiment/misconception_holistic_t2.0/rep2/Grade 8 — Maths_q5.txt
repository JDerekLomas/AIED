### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Identification of Common Factor:** Recognizing that $9/16$ appears in both terms of the expression.
*   **Distributive Property (Factoring):** Understanding the structure $ab + ac = a(b + c)$.
*   **Fraction Operations:** Adding and subtracting fractions with unlike denominators (specifically involving a negative term).
*   **Simplification:** Multiplying fractions and reducing the final result.

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Failure to factor:** Many students might perform the multiplication for each term separately ($9/16 \times 4/12$ and $9/16 \times -3/9$) before adding. **Result:** While it might lead to the correct answer, it fails the "using distributive property" requirement of the rubric.
*   **Signs/Integers:** Mismanagement of the negative sign in $+ (-3/9)$, treating it as a positive value or getting confused by the brackets. **Result:** Incorrect answer.
*   **Fraction addition error:** Adding numerators and denominators directly ($4/12 - 3/9 = 1/3$). **Result:** Incorrect answer.
*   **Keyword Confusion:** "Distributive property" is often memorized as $a(b+c) = ab+ac$. Reversing this (factoring out) is cognitively more demanding for Grade 8 students.

### Step 3: Factors that make it easier
*   **The common factor is obvious:** $9/16$ is explicitly visible at the start of both expressions, which helps in "seeing" the property.
*   **Standard Classroom Practice:** This specific type of problem is a staple of NCERT textbooks (Exercise 1.1 equivalent), so it is a highly rehearsed task.

### Step 4: Factors that make it harder
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the instruction "Using the distributive property" if they are more accustomed to "वितरण गुणधर्म" or simply the command "हल करें" (Solve).
*   **Computation Load:** Even after factoring, the student must deal with denominators $12$ and $9$ (LCM of $36$). For a 1-mark question, this is several steps.
*   **Format:** The open-ended format offers no "hints" through options, which often discourages students with low English proficiency from attempting the work.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While this is a "textbook" problem, the combination of fraction arithmetic, integer rules, and the specific requirement to use a property makes it a high-failure item for students in these specific demographics. Many will attempt it via direct multiplication, and many will fail at the fraction subtraction stage.
