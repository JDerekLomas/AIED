Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This question requires spatial reasoning and geometric recognition (associating the curve of a squirrel's tail with a symbolic shape). Students must perform a "mapping" task—translating a visual description in text into a mental image and matching it to a specific symbol (the question mark).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Symbol confusion:** Students may recognize the shape but misname it (e.g., calling a question mark a "hook" or "curvy line"). This would lead to an incorrect answer if the rubric is strict.
*   **Literal interpretation:** Students from rural backgrounds may focus on the texture (furry/soft) rather than the geometric shape. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Language Barrier:** Students might know the answer in Hindi ("प्रश्नवाचक चिह्न") but fail to recall the English term "question mark."

Step 3: Factors making the item easier:
The poem "The Squirrel" (Mildred Bowers Armstrong) is a standard part of the NCERT Class 7 English curriculum in India. The phrase "an interrogatory mark of exclamation" or "a question mark for a tail" is the central imagery emphasized in classrooms.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
The open-ended format is difficult for students with limited English proficiency. Unlike a multiple-choice question, they must produce the correct spelling and terminology. For students in Hindi-medium schools, translating the visual concept into specific English vocabulary remains a barrier.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
Since this poem is a core text and the "question mark" is the most frequently discussed line, most students will recognize the concept. However, the requirement to produce the phrase in English without a word bank will lower the success rate among the specified demographic.
