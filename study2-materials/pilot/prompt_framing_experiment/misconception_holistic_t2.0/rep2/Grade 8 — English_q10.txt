Step 1: Identify the linguistic and logical concepts required.
The item requires knowledge of the correlative conjunction structure "too + adjective + to + infinitive." The student must recognize the cause-effect relationship between "weakness" and the "inability to walk," transform the intensifier "very" into "too," and change the second finite clause ("He cannot walk") into a non-finite clause ("to walk").

Step 2: List common misconceptions/errors.
*   **Literal Translation (Translinguistic influence):** Hindi-medium students might translate the Hindi structure literally, resulting in "He is very weak so he cannot walk" or "He is too weak for walking." (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Double Negatives:** Students often think the word "not" must be present to show inability, leading to "He is too weak to not walk." (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Incorrect infinitive placement:** "He is too weak walking" or "He is too weak for walk." (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Retention of "very":** "He is too very weak to walk." (Leads to incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Highly Formulaic:** This specific sentence ("He is very weak. He cannot walk.") is a "textbook classic" used in nearly all State Board English Grammer textbooks in India.
*   **Simple Vocabulary:** Words like "weak" and "walk" are Tier 1 vocabulary familiar to learners even with low English proficiency.
*   **Rote Memorization:** Many students memorize the transformation rule (Remove 'very', add 'too'; remove 'He cannot', add 'to') without deep syntactic understanding.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Open-ended/Constructed Response:** There are no multiple-choice options to trigger recognition; the student must recall the structure entirely from memory.
*   **Syntactic Complexity:** Moving from two simple sentences to a complex sentence with an infinitive phrase is cognitively demanding for ESL learners.
*   **English Proficiency:** Economically weaker students in government schools often lack exposure to English outside the classroom, making syntax transformation feel abstract.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
While the transformation is a standard curriculum item, the shift from "He cannot" to the infinitive "to walk" remains a significant hurdle for students whose primary language does not use an identical "too...to" construction. However, due to the high frequency of this exact example in drills, many students get it right through pattern matching.
