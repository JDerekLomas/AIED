Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
- Data interpretation: Analyzing a table with three variables and numerical values.
- Comparison of numbers: Identifying the largest and smallest values in a set to determine "most" and "least."
- Trend analysis: Understanding the correlation between environmental conditions and the dependent variable (growth in cm).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
- Confusing height with growth rate: Students might look at the final height rather than the change, though in a 10-day experiment, these are usually synonymous. (Unlikely to lead to an error here).
- "Sunlight is heat": Misinterpreting the "Full Sunlight" condition as a temperature factor rather than a light factor. (Could lead to incorrect explanation in part b).
- Misunderstanding the word "hindered": For ELL (English Language Learner) students, not knowing what this word means may prevent them from answering part (c) even if they know the biology. (High likelihood of error).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
- Familiar context: Plants and sunlight are universal concepts.
- Small numbers: If the growth is measured in single or double digits, comparison is simple.
- Tabular format: Clear layout helps in identifying the "best" condition quickly.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Language Barrier: The words "favourable," "hindered," and "biological process" are high-level academic English for students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds.
- Part (c) Requirement: Requires retrieval of specific scientific vocabulary ("Photosynthesis") rather than just reading the data.
- Open-ended: No scaffolds or options to guess from.

Step 5: Holistically, while many students will get part (a) right (identifying the highest number in the table), the score of "1" is often all-or-nothing in many Indian marking schemes unless split marks are specified. The technical language in (b) and (c) will be a significant barrier for the majority of this specific demographic.
