**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Properties of Parallelograms:** Understanding that opposite angles are equal ($x = 110^\circ$) and adjacent angles are supplementary (sum to $180^\circ$, so $y = 180 - 110 = 70^\circ$).
*   **Parallel Lines:** Understanding transversal properties (interior consecutive angles).
*   **Explanation/Reasoning:** The ability to articulate "Opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal" in writing.

**Step 2: Common Misconceptions**
*   **Confusing Properties:** Thinking all angles in a parallelogram are equal ($x=y$). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Angle Sum Misconception:** Thinking the sum of any two angles is $180^\circ$ (though this accidentally works for adjacent angles here, it fails for $x$).
*   **Incorrect Naming:** Mixing up $x$ and $y$ based on the visual layout.
*   **Sum of interior angles of a quadrilateral:** Knowing they sum to $360^\circ$ but being unable to partition them correctly between $x$ and $y$.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Simple Numbers:** $110$ and $180$ are easy to subtract mentally ($70$).
*   **Visual Recognition:** A parallelogram is a standard geometric figure heavily practiced in Grade 8.
*   **Direct Property:** The value for $x$ is a direct application of a single property (opposite angles).

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds may struggle to provide the written "explanation" required by the rubric in English, even if they know the numerical value.
*   **Double Task:** Finding both $x$ and $y$ doubles the chance of a calculation or identification error.
*   **Open-ended/No Options:** There are no distractors to prompt memory; it requires pure recall.
*   **The "Why":** Rubrics requiring "explanation" are historically difficult for students who are used to rote calculation over conceptual reasoning.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
While finding $x=110$ is relatively straightforward, the requirement to find *both* variables AND provide a written explanation—coupled with the language barrier and the shift from calculation to reasoning—significantly lowers the success rate for a 1-mark "all or nothing" item in this demographic.
