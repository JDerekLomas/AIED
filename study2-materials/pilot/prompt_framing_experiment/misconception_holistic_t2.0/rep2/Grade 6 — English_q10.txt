Step 1: The concepts required are basic English grammar regarding "quantifiers" (determiners). While this is an English language item, it touches on logic—specifically the distinction between affirmative and negative statements. Students must recognize that "some" is used for positive/affirmative assertions of existence, while "any" is typically reserved for questions or negative sentences.

Step 2: 
- **Universal substitution:** Many students in this demographic believe "any" is a synonym for "any number of" or "some" without grammatical constraints. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- **Overgeneralization of "Any":** Hindi-speaking students might translate both as "kuch" or "thode," failing to see the structural trigger for the different English words. This leads to an incorrect answer.
- **Random Selection:** Students with very low English proficiency often treat these binary choices as a 50/50 guess.

Step 3:
- **Familiar Context:** "Apples" and "basket" are standard vocabulary introduced very early.
- **Simplicity:** The sentence is short and follows a basic Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern.
- **Visual association:** Students are often drilled in the "Positive = Some, Negative/Question = Any" rule.

Step 4:
- **Medium of Instruction:** For Hindi-medium students, the nuances of quantifiers are often abstract because Hindi does not split "some" and "any" in exactly the same structural way.
- **English Proficiency:** In economically weaker sections (EWS) settings, conversational exposure is low, making grammatical "feel" (intuition) weaker; they rely on memorized rules.

Step 5: This is a classic "easy" level question for a 6th-grade syllabus, but the demographic context lowers the expected performance slightly. While "some" is the "natural" sounding choice even for low-proficiency students, the lack of language immersion in government schools results in a significant number of errors due to guessing or confusion between the two common words.
