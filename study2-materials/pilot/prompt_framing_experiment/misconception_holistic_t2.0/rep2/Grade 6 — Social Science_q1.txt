Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, it involves basic enumeration (counting to two) and classification (grouping geographic entities under the category "mountain ranges"). It requires the retrieval of spatial information and identifying sets.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Confusing peaks with ranges:** Students may name "Mount Everest" or "Kanchenjunga." This would lead to an incorrect answer as these are specific peaks, not ranges.
*   **Confusing political boundaries:** Students might name a range outside India (e.g., Andes, Alps).
*   **Confusing categories:** Students might list rivers or states.
*   **English Language Proficiency:** Given the Hindi-medium background, a student may know "Himalaya" but struggle if they do not recognize the English word "ranges."

Step 3: Factors making the item easier:
*   **Familiar Context:** The Himalayas and Aravallis are core parts of the Grade 6 NCERT/State Board curriculum.
*   **Simple Requirement:** "Name any two" allows for multiple correct combinations, providing a low floor for success.
*   **Visual Reinforcement:** Students are frequently exposed to maps of India.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no options to choose from (no scaffolding).
*   **Language Barrier:** Terms like "major" and "located" might confuse students with limited English proficiency, even if they know the geography in Hindi (*parvat shrinkhala*).
*   **Spelling:** Students might worry about spelling "Western Ghats" or "Vindhya" in English, leading to hesitation.

Step 5: Holistic estimation:
Despite language barriers, the Himalayas are culturally iconic and deeply emphasized in Indian schools. Most students will be able to recall at least the Himalayas and one other range (often the Aravallis or Ghats) due to repetitive drilling in lower grades.
