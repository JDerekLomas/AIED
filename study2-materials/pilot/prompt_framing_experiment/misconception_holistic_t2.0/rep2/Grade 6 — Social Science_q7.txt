Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science item. No mathematical concepts are required. However, the student must apply categorization skills (identifying a "resource") and cause-and-effect reasoning (influence on lives).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Resource vs. Product: Students may list products (like "rotis") instead of natural resources (like "minerals"). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   Resource vs. Location: Students may name cities instead of resources found there.
*   Single-word thinking: Students may provide the names of resources but fail to "explain" the influence, which is required for the full score.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   Local Context: Students in India are taught extensively about Rajasthan's geography (desert, minerals).
*   High Familiarity: Students from economically weaker backgrounds often have parents involved in labor or construction; resources like marble, stone, and water are part of their daily survival conversations.
*   Broad Rubric: The list of acceptable resources is very wide.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
*   Language Barrier: Explaining "influence" requires complex English sentence structures (conjunctions like "because" or "leads to"), which is difficult for Hindi-medium learners.
*   Open-ended Format: No prompts or choices are provided.
*   Multi-part task: They must remember to list TWO and explain ONE. Many students miss the second half of a prompt.
*   Max Score Mismatch: The rubric assigns only 1 mark for two distinct cognitive tasks, providing no "half-credit" room for error.

Step 5: Estimate of correct responses.
Given the English proficiency constraints and the requirement to explain "influence" (rather than just identify), many students will likely provide the names of resources but fail to articulate a clear cause-and-effect relationship in English.
