Step 1: Although this is a Science item, the "mathematical" reasoning involves categorization and comparison. Students must differentiate between sets (ruminants vs. non-ruminants) and understand the relationship between a biological structure (compartmentalized stomach) and a specific input (cellulose/grass).

Step 2: 
- "Cows eat everything": Students might assume cows can digest anything humans can, missing the specific adaptation for cellulose. (Leads to incorrect answer).
- "Stomach size": Thinking it’s just about "volume" rather than "structure/function." (Leads to incorrect answer).
- Confusion about the word "ruminant": Students may recognize "cow" but not the technical term. (May lead to incorrect answer if the English is too complex).

Step 3: 
- The cow is a highly familiar animal in the Indian context (economic and cultural). 
- Students in rural or EWS backgrounds often have direct experience with livestock and might know cows "chew the cud" (paguhran) or have "different" bellies.
- The rubric allows for a broad answer ("multiple sections").

Step 4: 
- Language barrier: "Ruminant" and "digestive system" are academic English terms that may be unfamiliar to Hindi-medium/ESL learners.
- Open-ended format: Requires active recall and sentence construction rather than recognition.
- Multi-part prompt: Asking for both "why" and "a specific difference" can be confusing.

Step 5: While the content is relatable, the specific scientific vocabulary and the open-ended nature in English will likely act as a barrier for many students in this demographic.
