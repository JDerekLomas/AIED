Step 1: Identify the skills required.
Though this is an English language item, it requires reading comprehension, scanning for specific information, and basic sentence construction. Students must understand the question word "Where" (location) and map it to a specific prepositional phrase in the source text.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions/errors.
In this context, the primary "misconception" is linguistic interference. Students may confuse "Where" with "When" or "Who."
- Confusing "Where" with "Who" (e.g., answering "Riya"): Would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Identifying the wrong location (e.g., "school"): Would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Vocabulary gap (not knowing the word "attic"): If the student doesn't know what an attic is, they may skip the word in the text even if they find the sentence.

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
The answer is a short, concrete noun phrase. The rubric is generous (accepting one-word answers), which helps students with low English productive skills. If the text uses the word "attic" near the word "book," scanning becomes easy.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
For Hindi-medium students from economically weaker sections, "attic" is a culturally foreign concept (Indian homes typically have a *taand* or *duchhatti*, but the word "attic" is rarely used in daily life). The open-ended format is more difficult than multiple choice. English deficiency may prevent them from linking the question to the text if the verb tense changes (e.g., "found" vs "finds").

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the generous rubric but the hurdle of English proficiency and the specific vocabulary word ("attic"), many students will successfully scan the text but some will fail to interpret the question word or the text correctly.
