Step 1: This is a Social Science item, not a mathematics item. The cognitive skills required include recall of factual knowledge (fairs/festivals of Rajasthan) and the ability to synthesize descriptive information into a concise sentence.

Step 2: Common misconceptions in this context involve confusing regional festivals with national ones (e.g., naming Diwali as a Rajasthan-specific festival) or confusing a "fair" with a "shrine." However, since the question asks for "any two," students often resort to general knowledge which may or may not satisfy the "Rajasthan-specific" criteria depending on the examiner's strictness.

Step 3: Ease factors: The context is highly familiar and culturally relevant to students in North India. Fairs like Pushkar or festivals like Gangaur/Teej are part of the local lore. The language of "festivals" is a common vocabulary word even for Hindi-medium students.

Step 4: Harder factors: The "one sentence description" requires English syntax and composition, which is the primary barrier for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency. While they may know the name "Pushkar," describing the "significance" in English is a multi-step linguistic challenge. Furthermore, the rubric is surprisingly binary (Maximum score 1 for multiple parts), meaning any linguistic error in the description could lead to a zero despite knowing the names.

Step 5: While the content is familiar, the requirement to produce a descriptive sentence in English will be a significant bottleneck for this specific demographic.
