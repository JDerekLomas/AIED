Step 1: The mathematical concepts include integer multiplication and the application of the sign rules (specifically, negative × negative = positive). Skills required include basic multiplication fluency ($3 \times 4$) and recognizing parentheses as an indicator of multiplication.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
*   **The "Sign of the Larger Number" rule:** Students often apply the rule for addition to multiplication, assuming the result takes the sign of the number with the larger absolute value. This would lead to an incorrect answer of $-12$.
*   **Additive/Subtractive Thinking:** Students might see the minus signs and attempt to subtract or add the numbers $(-3 - 4 = -7)$. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Double Negative = Negative:** Some students believe two negatives simply reinforce the "negativity." This leads to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: This item is relatively simple because the numbers are small and within the basic multiplication table ($1$ to $10$). There are no linguistic barriers; the expression is purely symbolic, which bypasses the English language proficiency issues typical for Hindi-medium students. The operation is a standard, rote-learned procedure.

Step 4: The open-ended format is the primary difficulty factor, as students cannot "test" given options. However, for a one-step operation, this is a minor hurdle compared to multi-step word problems. The abstract notation (parentheses and signs) is the primary source of conceptual error.

Step 5: Given that this is a "pure" calculation and a high-priority topic in the Class 7 curriculum (Integers), students who have attended school regularly generally memorize the rule "Minus-Minus-Plus." However, the confusion with addition rules (which results in $-12$ or $-7$) remains a significant attractor for error among this demographic.
