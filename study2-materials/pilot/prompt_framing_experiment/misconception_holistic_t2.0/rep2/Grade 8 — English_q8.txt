Step 1: Identify the linguistic and grammatical concepts and skills required.
- Identification of subject, verb, and object.
- Knowledge of tense (Simple Past in A; Present Perfect in B).
- Knowledge of past participle (V3) forms: "prepared" and "found."
- Mastery of the "be + V3" passive construction.
- Understanding the use of the agentive "by" clause.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold.
- Word order confusion: Moving the object to the front but failing to change the verb form. (Incorrect)
- Tense shifting: Using "is/are" instead of "was/were" for Simple Past, or dropping the "has been" in Present Perfect. (Incorrect)
- Confusion between "found" and "founded." (Incorrect for B)
- Vocabulary barrier: Students may not know "successor," leading to spelling errors or failure to identify it as the object. (Incorrect)

Step 3: Factors making the item easier:
- Sentence A uses "prepared," a common and regular verb.
- The context (Chef/Meal) is relatively concrete and understandable.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- English Proficiency: For Hindi-medium students, the shift in word order and auxiliary verbs is cognitively demanding.
- Open-ended format: No multiple-choice options to scaffold the "was prepared" structure.
- Present Perfect complexity: Sentence B requires "has been found," which is significantly harder than the Simple Past.
- Rubric Rigidity: To get a 1, students likely need to be correct on both, and the vocabulary "Successor" is a high-level word for this demographic.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
The transition from Hindi (an SOV language with a very different passive structure) to English passive voice is a major hurdle. Given the requirement for two different tenses and the vocabulary in B, many students will fail to get the full mark despite being in Grade 8.
