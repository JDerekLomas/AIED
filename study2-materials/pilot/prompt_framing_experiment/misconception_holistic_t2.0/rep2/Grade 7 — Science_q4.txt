Step 1: This item, while primarily a Science question, involves mathematical/logical thinking in identifying variables (color and fabric type) and their inverse/direct relationships with heat (reflecting vs. absorbing and evaporation). 

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- "White attracts cold" (leads to a correct answer via incorrect logic).
- Confusing reflection with transparency (might lead to incorrect reasoning but a "plausible" answer).
- Misunderstanding "absorption": Thinking heat vanishes rather than transferring. 
Most misconceptions at this level actually lead students toward the "plausible" answers required by the rubric.

Step 3: Ease factors: The context is highly familiar and culturally relevant. Students in India experience extreme summer heat and have lived experience with the benefits of cotton and light colors. The rubric is extremely generous, accepting "bouncing off heat" as a valid scientific reason.

Step 4: Hardship factors: The language barrier is significant. Students may know the "why" in Hindi (सूती कपड़े पसीना सोखते हैं) but struggle to translate "absorption" or "evaporation" into English. The open-ended "Explain" format is harder than multiple-choice for students with limited English proficiency. However, the requirement is only for one "plausible reason" to get the full 1 mark.

Step 5: Given the high familiarity of the phenomenon and the low threshold for what constitutes a "scientific reason" in the rubric, many students will provide a response based on common sense that meets the criteria, even if their English is broken.
