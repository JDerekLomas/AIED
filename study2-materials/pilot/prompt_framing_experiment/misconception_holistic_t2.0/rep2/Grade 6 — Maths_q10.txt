**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   Understanding the definition of an angle and its components (vertex and rays).
*   Ability to align the protractor's baseline and center point (crosshair) correctly with a ray and vertex.
*   Distinguishing between the inner and outer scales of a protractor.
*   Knowledge of angle classification (identifying 110° as obtuse and 40° as acute) to verify the plausibility of the drawing.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Scale Misreading:** Choosing the wrong scale (e.g., drawing 70° instead of 110° or 140° instead of 40°). **Impact: High.** This is the primary reason for failure on this item.
*   **Alignment Error:** Aligning the bottom edge of the plastic protractor rather than the actual zero-line. **Impact: High.**
*   **Vertex Confusion:** Placing the center of the protractor at the end of the line instead of the designated vertex. **Impact: Moderate.**

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Standard Tooling:** The protractor is a standard geometry box item familiar to students.
*   **Direct Instruction:** "Use a protractor to draw" is a routine, procedural task heavily practiced in the Grade 6 NCERT/State curriculum.
*   **Simple Numbers:** Multiples of 10 (40, 110) are the easiest to locate on the scale compared to values like 47°.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** While the numbers are clear, students with limited English may struggle if they don't recognize "protractor" (often called "D" or "chanda" in local Hindi-medium contexts), though the context usually clarifies this.
*   **The 110° Obstacle:** For a 110° angle, many students default to the scale number they see first (70°) because they are conditioned to look at the numbers closest to the 90° mark without checking if the angle should be obtuse.
*   **Performance Task:** Unlike a multiple-choice question where they might see the correct shape, students must execute the drawing from scratch.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
In many government school settings, the rote practice of drawing angles ensures a basic level of proficiency. However, the 110° angle acts as a "trap" for students who do not yet grasp the difference between acute and obtuse scales. The lack of visual cues in an open-ended format usually results in a significant minority of students providing the supplementary angle (70°) instead of 110°.
