**Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.**
Though primarily a Science question, it involves quantitative sequences: understanding temperature ($70^\circ\text{C}$), specific durations (15–30 seconds), and the inverse relationship of "rapid heating" followed by "rapid cooling." It requires ordinal logic (step-by-step processing) and an understanding of magnitude (high vs. low).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions and their impact.**
*   *Boiling vs. Pasteurization:* Students often think "preserving" means "boiling." If they write that milk is simply boiled, they miss the "chilling/rapid cooling" aspect. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   *Heat equals Safety:* The misconception that heat alone is sufficient, ignoring the time-temperature relationship, may lead students to omit the second half of the process (cooling).
*   *Duration:* Some may confuse "short time" with "long hours," though the rubric is lenient on exact numbers.

**Step 3: Factors making the item easier.**
*   *Familiar Context:* Milk is a daily staple in Indian households. Most students have seen "Pasteurized" written on milk packets (Amul/Mother Dairy).
*   *Lenient Rubric:* The fact that specific numbers (70 degrees, 30 seconds) are not mandatory significantly lowers the barrier for students who understand the concept but struggle with memorizing data.

**Step 4: Factors making the item harder.**
*   *Language Barrier:* This is the primary hurdle. Describing a two-part process in English is difficult for Hindi-medium/ESL learners. They may know the "what" but lack the vocabulary ("chilled," "abruptly," "preserved").
*   *Open-ended Format:* There are no cues or options to trigger memory; the student must recall and synthesize the explanation entirely from scratch.
*   *Scientific Terminology:* The word "pasteurization" is a "tier-3" academic word that is difficult to spell and define for students with limited English literacy.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate.**
While the concept is central to the Grade 8 NCERT syllabus, the requirement to *describe* and *explain* (two distinct tasks) in a non-native language makes this difficult. Many students will likely mention heating but omit the rapid cooling or struggle to articulate the "why" (killing microbes) clearly enough to earn the point in an open-ended format.
