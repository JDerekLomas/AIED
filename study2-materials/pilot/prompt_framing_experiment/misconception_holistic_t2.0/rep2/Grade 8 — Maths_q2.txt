**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Algebraic Multiplication:** Knowledge of the distributive property (FOIL method or horizontal/column multiplication) to multiply two binomials.
*   **Laws of Exponents:** Understanding that $a \times a = a^2$ (not $2a$).
*   **Signed Integer Operations:** Ability to multiply positive and negative coefficients (e.g., $-2 \times 3 = -6$ and $-2 \times 2 = -4$).
*   **Combining Like Terms:** Identifying $ab$ and $ba$ as like terms and performing addition/subtraction on their coefficients ($9ab - 4ab = 5ab$).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Exponential Confusion:** Students might write $3a \times 2a = 6a$ instead of $6a^2$. *Result: Incorrect.*
*   **Linear Distribution:** Multiplying only the first terms and last terms, i.e., $(3a \times 2a) + (-2b \times 3b) = 6a^2 - 6b^2$. *Result: Incorrect.*
*   **Sign Errors:** Ignoring the negative sign attached to $2b$ during distribution. *Result: Incorrect.*
*   **Variable Conflation:** Treating $a$ and $b$ as the same entity or failing to realize $ab = ba$. *Result: Incorrect.*

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Familiar Terminology:** "Find the product" and "binomial" are standard vocabulary in Grade 8 NCERT textbooks (widely used in Indian government schools).
*   **Simple Coefficients:** The integers 2 and 3 are small and easy to multiply, reducing cognitive load on arithmetic.
*   **Standard Format:** The item is a textbook-style "drill" question. Students in this demographic often practice this specific procedural skill heavily.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Linguistic Barrier:** For Hindi-medium/ESL students, "Product" might be less familiar than the operation symbol $(\times)$, though "Product" is usually taught early.
*   **Mixed Signs:** The presence of both a minus and a plus sign in the binomials increases the likelihood of sign errors compared to a $(+)$ and $(+)$ expression.
*   **Constructed Response:** As there are no multiple-choice options, students cannot work backward or use elimination; they must execute the full algorithm correctly.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
In Indian government school settings, algebraic manipulation is a heavily emphasized area of the Grade 8 curriculum. While the logic of "distributive property" is abstract, students are often conditioned through rote practice to follow the "FOIL" steps. The primary hurdles for this specific group will be sign errors $(-2 \times 3)$ and forgetting the exponent $^2$. Given that this is a one-mark "all or nothing" rubric, many students who understand the process but make a small computational or notation error will receive a zero.
