Step 1: This is a Social Science (Civics/Political Science) item, not a mathematics item. The primary cognitive skills required are recall and recognition of foundational political terminology related to the structure of the Indian government.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Confusing "Fundamental Rights" with "Fundamental Duties" (Likely wouldn't lead to an incorrect answer as either shows constitutional awareness, though "Duties" isn't a "key feature" in the traditional sense, a liberal rubric would accept it).
- Confusing "Federalism" with "Centralism" (might lead to an incorrect description, but the rubric only asks to *mention* a feature).
- Thinking "Democracy" is the name of the Constitution rather than a feature.
Given the rubric asks for only "any one" correct feature, minor misconceptions about the nuances of a feature usually don't prevent students from providing a correct term.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The content is a core part of the NCERT Class 8 curriculum and is frequently repeated in national celebrations (Republic Day). The rubric is extremely generous (only 1 point, only 1 feature needed). Keywords like "Rights" (Adhikar) are familiar even to Hindi-medium students.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: English proficiency is the primary barrier. Students may know the concept in Hindi (e.g., *Dharmanirpekshta*) but struggle to spell or recall "Secularism." The open-ended format requires retrieval from memory rather than simple recognition (as in an MCQ). For students from economically weaker sections, access to quality Civics instruction can be inconsistent.

Step 5: Holistically, while the language barrier is significant, "Fundamental Rights" or "Secularism" are high-frequency terms taught in both Hindi and English contexts. Because the rubric allows for a single, broad term, a majority of students are likely to get this correct.
