Step 1: The item is primarily based on Social Science (Geography) rather than mathematics. However, the logical skills required include understanding a cyclical process, identifying a causal chain (weathering $\rightarrow$ erosion $\rightarrow$ sedimentation), and expressing a transformational relationship between states.

Step 2: 
- **Confusion of terms:** Students often swap "igneous" and "sedimentary." This leads to incorrect answers.
- **The "Linear" Fallacy:** Viewing the rock cycle as a one-way street rather than a cycle. This may not hurt here since the prompt asks for a specific path.
- **Heat/Pressure Misconception:** Believing all rock transformations require heat and pressure (confusing it with metamorphic processes). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- **Scale:** Difficulty imagining rocks breaking into sand over millions of years.

Step 3:
- **Direct Link:** The prompt asks for a specific, frequently taught segment of the cycle (Igneous to Sedimentary).
- **Simple Mechanics:** Breaking things down is an intuitive concept.

Step 4:
- **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, specialized English vocabulary like "Igneous," "Sedimentary," "Weathering," and "Erosion" represents a significant hurdle.
- **Format:** The open-ended "Explain" format is much harder than multiple-choice, especially for students with limited English proficiency who may understand the concept but cannot articulate it in the required language.
- **Scientific Literacy:** "Transform" is a formal term that might be misinterpreted by EWS students with low vocabulary exposure.

Step 5: While the concept is foundational, the combination of an open-ended English explanation requirement and the need for specific geological terminology for students from these backgrounds makes it a low-scoring item.
