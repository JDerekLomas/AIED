Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While the item is labeled as "Subject: English," the cognitive skills required are structural and logical sequencing. The student must understand syntax patterns (Subject-Verb-Object), which functions like an algorithmic process. They must perform a 1-to-1 mapping of given words to a new sequence.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold.
The primary "misconception" in this context is transferring the syntax of the native language (Hindi) to English. Hindi follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) structure ("Vah pustak padh raha hai" / He book reading is).
- Incorrect pattern (SOV): "He a book reading is." This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Confusion with articles: Placing 'a' incorrectly (e.g., "A book is reading he") would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
- High-frequency vocabulary: "book," "reading," and "he" are among the most basic words taught in early English modules.
- Familiar context: Reading a book is a standard school activity.
- Visual cues: Capitalization of "he" is often a hint that it starts the sentence, though not provided in the prompt (all lowercase here).
- Short length: Only 5 words reduce cognitive load.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
- ESL/Hindi-medium background: The discrepancy between English (SVO) and Hindi (SOV) syntax is a significant hurdle for economically weaker students with limited English exposure.
- Lack of choices: As an open-ended "rearrange" task, there is no opportunity to guess or use process of elimination.
- Tense complexity: The use of the present continuous "is reading" adds a helper verb, increasing the chance of placing "is" in the wrong position.

Step 5: Holistically estimate the proportion of students who would produce the correct answer.
Given that this is a foundational sentence type practiced extensively in Indian Grade 6 curriculum, but balanced against the language interference (SOV vs SVO) and the "economically weaker section" context which often implies less out-of-school English exposure:
