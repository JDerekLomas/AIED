Step 1: Identify the skills required.
Though categorized under Social Science, the item requires identifying cause-and-effect relationships and chronological reasoning (historical sequencing). Linguistically, it requires understanding the term "contribute" and the abstract concept of "political dominance."

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **The "King" Misconception:** Students often believe the British immediately became the "Kings" of India after one battle, rather than understanding the puppet-state mechanism (Mir Jafar). On this item, this might still lead to a correct score if they mention dominance.
*   **Conflict Confusion:** Confusing Plassey (1757) with Buxar (1764). If they describe the Diwani rights (Buxar), they might miss the specific "establishment" nuance required for Plassey, though a generous grader might pass it.
*   **Personalization:** Thinking the war was a personal grudge between leaders rather than a strategic move for trade and territory expansion.

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
*   **Curriculum Staple:** The Battle of Plassey is a core "landmark" event taught extensively in Grade 8 History (NCERT/State boards).
*   **Familiar Context:** The "Puppet Nawab" (Mir Jafar) narrative is a standard rote-memorization point in most classrooms.
*   **Binary Result:** The shift from trade to politics is the singular most emphasized point of this chapter.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
*   **Linguistic Barrier:** "Contribute" and "expansion" are Tier 2/3 academic vocabulary words. For Hindi-medium/ESL students, the question phrasing is significantly more complex than the required answer.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options, students must construct a sentence in English. Students may know the answer in Hindi ("Mir Jafar ko kathputli banaya") but struggle to translate it to "established political dominance."
*   **Subjectivity of the Rubric:** While the rubric asks for "explaining," it only allows for 1 mark, making it an "all or nothing" situation.

Step 5: Holistically, while the fact is a core curriculum requirement, the linguistic demand of articulating an abstract political cause-and-effect in English—for students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency—creates a significant barrier to the "fully correct" response required for the 1-point rubric.
