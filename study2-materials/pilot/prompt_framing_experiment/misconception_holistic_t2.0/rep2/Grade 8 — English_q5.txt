Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a language arts (English literature) task, not a mathematics task. However, the cognitive skills involved include abstracting a general principle from a narrative, summarizing, and translating complex thematic imagery (symbols of a king, a moneylender, and a fair maid) into the concepts of power, wealth, and beauty vs. freedom.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
1. Literal interpretation: Students often mistake the "bargain" for a literal financial transaction and fail to see it as a metaphor for human connection. (Leads to incorrect answer).
2. Conclusion bias: Students may think the "bargain" is with the child at the end simply because it’s the last event, without understanding *why* that bargain was accepted. (Likely incorrect or incomplete).
3. Moralizing: Students might provide a generic moral ("be good") rather than the specific theme of freedom. (Leads to incorrect answer).

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
The poem is part of the standard SCERT/NCERT curriculum. In Indian government schools, this poem is often rote-memorized or heavily summarized in Hindi by teachers, making the "core message" a familiar talking point.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
1. Language barrier: Writing a coherent sentence in English is a significant hurdle for Hindi-medium students from EWS backgrounds.
2. Open-ended format: No options (MCQs) are provided to trigger recognition; the student must generate the text (production).
3. Abstract Vocabulary: Words like "theme" or "central idea" may be misunderstood, and words like "power," "wealth," or "freedom" may be difficult for the student to spell or use correctly in a sentence.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically:
While the concept of the poem is taught, the requirement to independently synthesize and write a thematic summary in English—combined with limited English proficiency—makes this a high-difficulty task for this specific demographic. Most students may understand the story in their mother tongue but will struggle to express the "theme" accurately according to the rubric in English.
