Step 1: Identify the conceptual skills required.
While this is a Social Science question, the underlying cognitive skills include:
- Understanding the functional relationship between a democratic state and its representative institutions.
- Synthesizing abstract concepts (sovereignty, representation, legislation) into a causal explanation.
- Expressive language skills to articulate a multi-faceted definition (representing the "will of the people").

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
- "Government equals Parliament": Students often conflate the Executive (PM/Ministers) with the Legislature. On this item, it might lead to a partially correct but incomplete answer (e.g., "Parliament runs the country").
- "Laws are made by the Police/Courts": Common in students with limited civic exposure; this would lead to an incorrect answer.
- "Parliament is just a building": Concrete operational thinking; would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
- High-frequency topic: Democracy and Parliament are core themes in the Grade 8 NCERT syllabus.
- Key phrases like "law-making" are often rote-learned or emphasized through keywords.
- Broad rubric: Acceptance of either representation OR law-making allows for a partial conceptual grasp to score full marks.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
- Language Barrier: English-medium testing for Hindi-background students makes articulating "representatives" or "expression of will" extremely difficult, even if the concept is understood.
- Open-ended format: No cues or options to trigger recognition; requires recall and synthesis.
- Economic context: Limited exposure to news media or dinner-table political discussion can make "Parliament" feel like a distant, abstract concept rather than a functional reality.

Step 5: Estimate.
Despite the difficulty of the English language for this demographic, the "keyword" approach to Indian Civics education and the generous rubric (allowing for one of two points) mean many students will be able to provide the rote-learned response of "making laws."
