### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Definition of Factors:** Understanding that a factor is a number that divides 68 without leaving a remainder.
*   **Divisibility Rules:** Knowledge of rules for 2 (even numbers) and 4 (last two digits).
*   **Multiplication/Division Fluency:** Proficiency in multiplication tables (up to 20) and long division.
*   **Systematic Listing:** The ability to find factors in pairs (e.g., $1 \times 68$, $2 \times 34$) to ensure none are missed.
*   **Identification of Composite Numbers:** Recognizing 68 as an even composite number.

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Confusing Factors with Multiples:** Student might list $68, 136, 204...$ (Would lead to an incorrect answer).
*   **Missing Factor Pairs:** Students often stop after finding $1, 2,$ and $68$. (Incorrect under this rubric).
*   **Overlooking "Hidden" Factors:** Not testing for 4 or 17 because 17 is a less familiar prime number. (Incorrect).
*   **Including '0' or the number itself minus 1:** Misunderstanding the boundaries of factors. (Incorrect).

### Step 3: Factors Making the Item Easier
*   **No Language Barrier:** The term "factors" is a standard academic term taught in Hindi-medium schools as *गुणनखंड (Gunankhand)*. The sentence structure is minimal.
*   **Familiar Operation:** Grade 6 students spend significant time on the "Playing with Numbers" chapter.
*   **Small Even Number:** Starting with an even number makes it immediately obvious that 2 is a factor.

### Step 4: Factors Making the Item Harder
*   **Rubric Rigidity:** The "Maximum score 1" indicates an all-or-nothing approach. Missing just the "17" or "4" results in 0 marks.
*   **The number 17:** Multiplication tables for 17 are notoriously difficult for students to memorize compared to 2, 5, or 10. Finding $68 \div 4 = 17$ requires multi-digit division.
*   **Open-ended Format:** No options to prompt their memory or guide their search for divisors.
*   **Limited English:** While the math is clear, the word "factors" might be forgotten if the teacher has not consistently used both Hindi and English terms.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is foundational, the specific number 68 is a "trap" for Grade 6 students because 17 and 34 are not "common" factors found in early childhood multiplication tables. In economically weaker section (EWS) contexts, where rote memorization of tables often stops at 10 or 12, the factors 4, 17, and 34 are frequently missed. Given the binary (1 or 0) scoring, many students will provide a partial list and receive no credit.
