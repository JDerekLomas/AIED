Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is an English Language Arts (ELA) item, not a mathematical one. However, it requires the analytical skill of classification and the ability to map specific evidence (textual features) to an abstract category (literary style).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Conflating content with style:** Students often describe *what* the poem is about (e.g., "nature") rather than *how* it is written. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Literal vs. Figurative:** Students may interpret metaphorical language literally, failing to recognize "descriptive" or "metaphorical" as stylistic traits.
*   **Limited vocabulary:** A student may understand the style but lack the specific English adjectives (like "informal") to label it.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Short response:** Only a single word or short phrase is required.
*   **Flexible rubric:** Any "appropriate" word is accepted, allowing for some leniency in vocabulary choice.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, "writing style" is an abstract concept. Translating the stylistic nuance of English poetry into an English descriptor is a high-order linguistic task.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without a word bank or multiple-choice options, students must retrieve specific vocabulary from their long-term memory.
*   **Subjectivity:** Literary analysis is more abstract than computational tasks, making it difficult for students who rely on rote memorization.
*   **Economic Context:** Limited exposure to diverse English literature outside of the classroom reduces "linguistic intuition."

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.
While the task seems simple, the combination of low English proficiency, the abstract nature of "style," and the lack of scaffolding (choices) makes this very challenging for Grade 7 students in this specific demographic.
