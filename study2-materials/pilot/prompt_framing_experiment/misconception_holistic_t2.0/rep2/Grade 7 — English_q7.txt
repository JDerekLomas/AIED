Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a language arts (English) item rather than a mathematical one. However, applying a linguistic-analytical lens: it requires identifying the functional role of a word within a sentence. Specifically, the student must recognize that "around" modifies the verb "ran" (describing direction/circumstance) without a following noun phrase, thus categorizing it as an adverb rather than a preposition.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Word-as-Label Misconception:** Students often memorize words like "around," "in," or "on" strictly as prepositions. This would lead to an incorrect answer here.
*   **Positional Clues:** Students may believe adverbs must end in "-ly." Absence of "-ly" might lead them to guess a noun or adjective, resulting in an incorrect answer.
*   **Syntactic Over-generalization:** In Hindi, postpositions are used similarly. Students might struggle with the "hanging" nature of the English adverb in "ran around."

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Simple Vocabulary:** The words "ran" and "around" are part of the basic English vocabulary (sight words) introduced early in Indian curricula.
*   **Short Sentence:** The lack of clauses or complex modifiers reduces the cognitive load of parsing the syntax.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the distinction between a preposition and an adverb is often subtle and taught late. 
*   **No Multiple Choice:** The open-ended nature means students cannot rely on elimination. They must produce the technical term ("adverb") correctly spelled.
*   **The "Around" Ambiguity:** In "We ran around the park," it is a preposition; in "We ran around," it is an adverb. This distinction is one of the most difficult concepts in middle-school functional grammar.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given that students are from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency and are taught in environments where rote learning of "around = preposition" is common, this functional shift is very difficult. Most students will likely identify it as a preposition or be unable to provide the English terminology.
