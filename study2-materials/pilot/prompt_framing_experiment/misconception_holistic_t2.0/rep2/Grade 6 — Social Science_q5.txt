Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science item. No mathematical concepts are required for the content; however, linguistically, the student must process a two-part question within a single-score framework.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Linear Progress Fallacy:** Students may believe ancient civilizations only hunted or only farmed, failing to recognize the specific transition to pastoralism in the early Vedic period.
*   **Modern Overlay:** Students might assume technology (tractors/markets) existed then. 
*   **Answer Impact:** Misidentifying the transition from nomadic pastoralism to settled agriculture might lead a student to name only one, which the rubric allows.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Generous Rubric:** Accepting either "agriculture" or "cattle rearing" is very lenient, as these represent two different phases (Early vs. Later Vedic). 
*   **Familiar Content:** This is a core topic in the NCERT/State Board Grade 6 syllabus.
*   **Simple Keywords:** Even with low English proficiency, keywords like "Vedic," "Main," and "Occupation" are high-frequency terms in classrooms.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students in an English-medium assessment, "Occupation" and "Aspect" are Tier 2/3 vocabulary that may be difficult to decode.
*   **The "Second Part" Trap:** The prompt asks for a description of a "key aspect." A student who correctly identifies the job but fails to describe an aspect (or lacks the English vocabulary to do so) may be marked down, despite the identification.
*   **Open-ended Format:** No options provided; requires active recall.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the generous rubric and the fact that "agriculture" or "farming" are universal default answers for "ancient India" questions, many students will hit the identification mark. However, the requirement to describe a "key aspect" in English will be a significant barrier for the target demographic (economically weaker, Hindi-medium background), leading to incomplete or unintelligible responses.
