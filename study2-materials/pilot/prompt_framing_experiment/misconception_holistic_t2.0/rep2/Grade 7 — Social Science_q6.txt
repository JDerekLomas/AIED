Step 1: Although this is a Social Science (Geography) question, it requires specific cognitive skills: logical reasoning (cause and effect), categorization of environmental factors (climate, defense, water resources), and linguistic articulation.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Confusing "significance" with physical description (e.g., "they are very high" instead of "they block cold winds"). This may lead to partial credit or incorrect answers if not linked to an "impact."
- Localizing the benefit only to the immediate mountain range rather than the entire "Indian subcontinent."
- Conflating the Himalayas with other mountain ranges (less likely at this grade level, but possible).
These misconceptions would likely lead to a 0.5 or 0 score.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The context is highly familiar and a staple of the Indian NCERT curriculum (a "frequently asked question").
- Students can rely on rote memorization of standard points (Climate, Rivers, Defense).
- High cultural resonance; even with limited English, students often know keywords like "Rivers," "Rain," or "Guard."

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- English proficiency: Formulating two distinct points in a second language is a high cognitive load for ESL students from Hindi-medium backgrounds.
- Open-ended format: No cues or options to trigger recognition.
- Rubric Rigor: The rubric requires two distinct and plausible points for just 1 mark, which is a relatively high bar for full credit compared to MCQ formats.

Step 5: Holistically, while the topic is foundational, the combination of an open-ended English response and the requirement for two distinct points (especially for students struggling with syntax) will lower the success rate among economically weaker sections where language acquisition is often a barrier to expressing conceptual knowledge.
