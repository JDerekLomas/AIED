Step 1: This item is a Social Science (History) question, not a mathematical one. However, it requires linguistic and cognitive skills such as chronological sequencing (linear progression), identifying cause-and-effect relationships, and synthesizing historical narratives into a concise explanation.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include the belief that the Company arrived with the intent to invade (conquest by design), a confusion between the British Government and the East India Company, and a lack of distinction between commercial dominance and political sovereignty. On this specific item, if a student believes the Company arrived as conquerors rather than traders, they would fail to meet the specific rubric requirement.

Step 3: Factors making it easier include the high degree of familiarity with this narrative; the transition from "Trader to Ruler" is a central, repeated theme in Indian Grade 8 NCERT textbooks (often the title of Chapter 2). The rubric is extremely lenient, requiring only the mention of "traders" or "trading posts" to earn the single mark.

Step 4: Factors making it harder include the English language proficiency gap for Hindi-medium/ESL students. Describing a "process" in English is much harder than identifying a fact. The open-ended "Describe" prompt might intimidate students, leading them to provide too little or irrelevant information, even if they understand the concept.

Step 5: Given the simplicity of the rubric (only needing to mention their original status as traders) and the centrality of this topic in the curriculum, many students will hit the keyword requirement even with limited English.
