Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a vocabulary and reading comprehension item. The required skill is synonymous matching—identifying a specific word in a text based on a provided definition. In the context of the requested "mathematical" framework, it requires 1-to-1 mapping and categorization (associating the property "light wind" with the element "breeze").

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Contextual Over-reliance:** Students might pick a word related to the setting (e.g., "tree" or "sky") rather than the specific definition. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Phonetic or Visual Matching:** Hindi-medium students often look for words that "sound" like the definition if they don't know the meaning. "Light" might lead them to pick a word starting with 'L' or meaning "bright."
*   **Word Class Mismatch:** Identifying an adjective (e.g., "cool") instead of a noun ("breeze").

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
The context of weather is generally familiar to all students regardless of socio-economic status. If the passage is short, the visual search field is small. "Breeze" is a common "textbook" vocabulary word taught in early English modules in Indian government schools.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
The open-ended format is a significant barrier for students with limited English proficiency. There are no cues (multiple choices). Hindi-medium students may know the concept in Hindi ("Hawa") but lack the English bridge to "Breeze." Limited English exposure makes it harder to distinguish between a "wind," a "storm," and a "breeze" in a foreign language.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the specific demographic (economically weaker, Hindi-medium, Grade 8), vocabulary recall in English is typically low. While "breeze" is a standard word, the leap from a definition to a specific word without options is difficult for English Language Learners (ELL).
