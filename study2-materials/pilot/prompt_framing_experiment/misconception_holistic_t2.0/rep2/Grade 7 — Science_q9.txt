Step 1: Identify the concepts and skills required.
Though categorized as Science, the item requires identifying a specific biological category (insectivorous plants) and reasoning about the nitrogen cycle. Students must understand that photosynthesis provides carbohydrates, but some environments (soil) lack essential nutrients like nitrogen, necessitating an alternative source.

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
1. "Green plants make all their food": Students may believe that because a plant is green, it does not need to consume anything else. This leads to confusion regarding why it would trap insects (incorrect reasoning for b).
2. "Plants 'eat' insects like animals eat food": Students might think insects provide energy/sugar instead of minerals/nitrogen (leads to incorrect answer for b).
3. "All nutrition is either Autotrophic or Heterotrophic": Students may struggle with the nuance of a "partial heterotroph" or the specific term "insectivorous."

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
The Pitcher plant is a standard, highly visual example used in nearly all NCERT Science textbooks. For many students, the "trap" structure is memorable.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
1. Language barrier: "Mode of nutrition" is a technical phrase. For Hindi-medium students with limited English, "insectivorous" (कीटभक्षी) is a difficult term to recall and spell correctly in English.
2. Open-ended/Multi-part: There are no cues or options. The student must generate three distinct pieces of information.
3. Logical complexity: Part (b) requires explaining a paradox (performing photosynthesis but still needing insects), which requires higher-order reasoning and sufficient English vocabulary to express "nitrogen deficiency."
4. Rubric Strictness: The rubric requires the specific term "insectivorous" for part (a).

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the English language constraints and the requirement to explain a scientific "why" (nitrogen) in a non-native language, many students who understand the concept will struggle to articulate the correct terminology and reasoning clearly enough to score.
