Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a language arts (English) reading comprehension task, not a mathematical one. However, it requires logical categorization and the ability to identify a triad (a set of three) from a text. The skill required is textual retrieval and sequencing.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
While there are no mathematical misconceptions, linguistic "misconceptions" include:
- Difficulty distinguishing between the *answers* provided to the king vs. the *questions* he asked. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Confusion regarding the interrogative pronouns (What/When/Who).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
- The story ("Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy) is a standard, central piece in the Grade 7 NCERT English curriculum used in Indian government schools. 
- It is frequently emphasized in classroom drills and rote memorization exercises.
- The context (a king seeking wisdom) is culturally familiar to students through local folklore.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Open-ended format: Students must construct sentences in English, which is difficult for ESL learners with limited proficiency.
- Grammar/Syntax: Even if they know the answer, they may struggle to phrase "the right time to begin something" correctly.
- Language barrier: Hindi-medium backgrounds make expressive English tasks significantly more difficult than multiple-choice tasks.
- Length: Providing three distinct points is a multi-part requirement for a single mark.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
Given that this is a foundational story in the curriculum, many students will have memorized these three points through repetition, despite the language barrier. However, the requirement to produce the answer in English without options will result in many partial or grammatically incorrect answers that might not meet a strict rubric.
