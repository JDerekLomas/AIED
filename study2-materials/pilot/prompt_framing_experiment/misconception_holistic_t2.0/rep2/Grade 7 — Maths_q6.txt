### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Conversion:** Ability to convert mixed fractions ($1 \frac{1}{2}$ and $3 \frac{1}{4}$) into improper fractions ($\frac{3}{2}$ and $\frac{13}{4}$).
*   **Multiplication Algorithm:** Multiplying numerators ($3 \times 13$) and denominators ($2 \times 4$).
*   **Simplification/Reconversion:** Ability to convert the resulting improper fraction ($\frac{39}{8}$) back into a mixed fraction ($4 \frac{7}{8}$).
*   **Calculation Fluency:** Basic multiplication facts for small numbers.

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Component-wise Multiplication:** Students may multiply whole numbers and then multiply fractions ($1 \times 3$ and $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4}$), leading to $3 \frac{1}{8}$. **Impact:** Direct incorrect answer.
*   **Cross-Multiplication Error:** Confusing the multiplication process with cross-multiplication used in division or equivalent fractions. **Impact:** Incorrect product.
*   **Addition instead of Multiplication:** Adding the denominators or using a "common denominator" unnecessarily. **Impact:** Incorrect product.
*   **Incorrect Conversion Rule:** Adding the whole number to the numerator and keeping the denominator ($1 \frac{1}{2} \rightarrow \frac{2}{2}$) or multiplying the whole number by the numerator. **Impact:** Incorrect intermediate steps.

### Step 3: Factors Making the Item Easier
*   **Standard Procedural Item:** This is a classic textbook problem often heavily drilled in Indian classrooms.
*   **Simple Numbers:** The integers involved are small ($1, 2, 3, 4, 13, 39$), which reduces the likelihood of basic arithmetic errors.
*   **Familiar Terms:** The phrase "mixed fraction" is standard in NCERT/State Board textbooks, which students from Hindi-medium backgrounds recognize.

### Step 4: Factors Making the Item Harder
*   **Three-Step Process:** Students must convert, multiply, and then convert *back*. Forgetting the final conversion is a high risk.
*   **No Multiple Choice:** Since it is open-ended, students cannot work backward from options or use process of elimination.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the English command "Multiply and express..." may pose a minor hurdle, though the symbols ($1 \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \frac{1}{4}$) usually bridge this gap.
*   **Accuracy Decay:** Each step (two conversions, multiplication, final conversion) provides an opportunity for a minor error that negates the 1-point score.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the problem is fundamental, the requirement for a multi-step transformation (Improper $\rightarrow$ Product $\rightarrow$ Mixed) often catches students in the middle. In government school settings with high enrollment and varying mastery levels, component-wise multiplication is the single most common "distractor" error that students fall for.
