Step 1: Although the prompt asks for mathematical concepts, in the context of this English Grammar item, the required "logical" skills are:
*   Understanding the rule of Tense Change (Backshifting): Present Continuous to Past Continuous.
*   Understanding Personal Pronoun Change: Shifting from "I" to "she" based on the speaker.
*   Structural Syntax: Using the connector "that" and removing quotation marks.

Step 2: Common misconceptions/errors:
*   Tense Retention: Thinking the verb should stay in the present tense because the action might still be true. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   Literal Translation: Translating word-for-word from Hindi/native tongue, where indirect speech structures differ significantly. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   Pronoun Confusion: Failing to map "I" to the subject "She". (Leads to incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
*   Standard "She said" structure is the most common example used in classroom practice.
*   Simple vocabulary: "reading", "novel", "am" are high-frequency words.
*   "Am reading" is one of the most straightforward tense changes taught.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   Limited English proficiency: For Hindi-medium students, the distinction between "said" and "said that" is not always intuitive.
*   No options (Supply-type): Unlike multiple-choice questions, students must generate the spelling and punctuation correctly.
*   Verb conjugation: Even if they know it changes to "past," they may struggle with "was" vs "were."

Step 5: Considering the student profile (EWS, Hindi-medium background) and the complexity of shifting both the pronoun and the tense simultaneously without the help of multiple-choice distractors, a significant portion will struggle with the auxiliary verb change.
