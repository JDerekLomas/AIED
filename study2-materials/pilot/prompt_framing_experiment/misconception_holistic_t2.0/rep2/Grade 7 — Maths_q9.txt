**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Translation of Context:** Identifying that a "rate" problem involving "how far" per "one unit" requires multiplication when given multiple units.
*   **Mixed Number Conversion:** Converting $5 \frac{3}{4}$ into an improper fraction ($\frac{23}{4}$).
*   **Fraction Multiplication:** Multiplying a whole number by a fraction ($10 \times \frac{23}{4}$).
*   **Decimal/Fractional Logic:** Understanding that the result will be between 50 and 60 km.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Addition instead of Multiplication:** Students might see $10$ and $5 \frac{3}{4}$ and simply add them. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Improper conversion of Mixed Numbers:** Adding the whole number to the numerator without multiplying by the denominator ($5 \frac{3}{4}$ becoming $\frac{8}{4}$). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Positional Confusion (Decimals):** Treating $5 \frac{3}{4}$ as "5.3" instead of 5.75. This is common among students transitioning from vernacular systems to English-standard notations and leads to an incorrect answer ($33$ instead of $57.5$).

**Step 3: Factors making the item easier**
*   **Familiar Context:** Transport and diesel costs/usage are highly familiar to students in these demographics.
*   **Unit Basis:** Being given the value for "1 litre" makes the operation choice (multiplication) more intuitive than if they had to find the unit rate first.
*   **Simple Base Number:** "10" is the easiest multiplier.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Fractional Calculation:** Mixed numbers are a significant "stumbling block" for Grade 7 students, particularly those from under-resourced schools.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the phrasing "How far can it travel on..." might be less immediate than "Calculate distance."
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options (MCQs), there is no opportunity for "back-solving" or checking for reasonableness against choices.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
While the context is familiar, the mechanical step of multiplying a whole number by a mixed number ($10 \times 5.75$ or $10 \times 23/4$) is where many students from economically weaker sections/limited English backgrounds lose points due to uneven foundation in rational numbers. However, since the rubric awards a point for identifying the operation (multiplication), many students will likely succeed in the conceptual intent even if the final calculation is slightly off (though the rubric here implies a 0/1 binary).
