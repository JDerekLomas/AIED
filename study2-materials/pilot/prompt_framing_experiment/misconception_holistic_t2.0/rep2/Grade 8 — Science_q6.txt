Step 1: The question assesses observational skills and the ability to link environmental triggers (deforestation) to long-term consequences (climate change, loss of habitat, soil erosion).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include confusing "deforestation" with "pollution" or believing that cutting a few trees has only immediate, local effects rather than global consequences. While a vague answer might lose marks, most Grade 8 students understand that "trees being cut" leads to "less oxygen" or "more heat," which aligns with the rubric.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The context (cutting trees/an axe) is a highly familiar visual cue in Indian textbooks. The language in (a) is descriptive and requires little academic vocabulary. Students often perform better on environmental science topics as they are reinforced through social messaging and "General Knowledge."

Step 4: Factors making it harder: English proficiency is the primary barrier; students might know the answer in Hindi ("Vann-unmulan" or "Ped katna") but struggle to construct "consequences will be faced" in English. Part (b) is open-ended, and the word "sustained" is sophisticated for learners with limited English. The 1-mark maximum for two sub-parts is punishing; an error in part (b) could lead to a zero or half-mark.

Step 5: Holistically, the visual nature of the task bridges the language gap, and the rubric is lenient for part (a). However, the complex phrasing of the prompt (b) and the English-medium requirement for Hindi-background students will suppress the total score.
