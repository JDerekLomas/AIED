Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, it involves logic and information organization. It requires students to understand the causal relationship between a systemic action (policy/process) and a resulting quality (transparency). It involves "system thinking"—understanding how protocols influence outcomes.

Step 2: 
- Conflating "Transparency" with "Honesty": Students may think being transparent just means "not lying," rather than providing access to data. This might lead to vague answers like "officials should be good people," which may not score.
- Misunderstanding the term: In Hindi-medium backgrounds, the word "transparency" (paradarshita) is academic. Students might confuse it with physical transparency or general "cleanness" in work.
- Thinking government is a monolithic entity: They may not understand that specific mechanisms (like RTI or websites) are the "ways" to achieve the goal.

Step 3: 
- Familiar Context: In Indian schools, "RTI" (Right to Information) is a buzzword often taught in Civics, which is a one-phrase answer that fits the rubric.
- Low Threshold for Success: The rubric only requires ONE plausible way for full marks, making it a "low floor" task.
- Social relevance: Discussions on corruption are common in low-income households, providing some intuitive background knowledge.

Step 4: 
- Language Barrier: The term "Transparency" is high-tier academic English. Hindi-medium students may not recognize the word in an English-medium test.
- Open-ended Format: No cues or options provided.
- Abstract Concept: "Governance" and "Transparency" are abstract compared to more concrete topics like "Forests" or "Local Government."

Step 5: While the rubric is extremely lenient, the linguistic barrier for students from economically weaker sections/Hindi-medium backgrounds to interpret "transparency in governance" without a bilingual prompt or context is a significant hurdle. Many will leave it blank or provide moralistic rather than structural suggestions.
