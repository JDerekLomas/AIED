Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Science item, it requires cognitive skills related to memory retrieval and vocabulary. The student must map a biological function ("essential for photosynthesis") and a visual attribute ("green pigment") to a specific technical term.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
*   Misconception: All green parts of a plant are leaves. (Unlikely to affect the answer as "leaves" is in the prompt).
*   Misconception: Plants eat soil for food. (Does not prevent knowing the name of the pigment).
*   Misconception: Conflating "Chlorophyll" with "Chloroplast." This is common in Grade 7 and could lead to an incorrect or partially incorrect answer.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
*   Familiar context: Photosynthesis is a core topic introduced early in primary school.
*   Highly practiced: This specific fact (Chlorophyll = green) is a rote-memorized "landmark" fact in Indian Science curricula (NCERT).
*   Direct cueing: The words "green pigment" act as a strong trigger for the target word.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
*   Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, the spelling of "Chlorophyll" (क्लोरोफिल) in English is difficult.
*   Format: Being an open-ended (supply-type) question, the student cannot rely on recognition (as in an MCQ); they must recall and spell it.
*   Transcription errors: Economically weaker students with limited English exposure may phonetically spell the word incorrectly (e.g., "Clorofil"), which may or may not be marked correct depending on the examiner's leniency.

Step 5: Estimate proportion.
In the Indian school context, photosynthesis is one of the most emphasized topics. Even students with low English proficiency often memorize "Chlorophyll" as a buzzword associated with "green" and "plants." However, the requirement to produce the word in English without options will result in some loss due to confusion with "chloroplast" or complete memory blocks.
