Step 1: Identify the mathematical/scientific concepts and skills required.
*   Classification of the structure of a flame (inner, middle, and outer zones).
*   Correlation between flame zones and temperature (outermost is hottest).
*   Understanding the properties of combustion (complete vs. incomplete).
*   Reasoning and application: connecting a specific profession (goldsmith) to a physical requirement (high heat to melt metal).

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
*   "Visible light equals heat": Students often believe the middle (luminous/yellow) zone is the hottest because it is the brightest. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   "The center is the source": Misconception that the flame is hottest near the wick (innermost zone). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   Language confusion: The term "Goldsmith" might be unfamiliar to students with limited English, causing them to miss the context of melting gold/silver.

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
*   Direct curriculum link: This is a "textbook" question directly from the NCERT Grade 8 Science syllabus.
*   Memorization: For many students, this is a rote-learned fact ("Outer zone = Goldsmith") often emphasized in coaching or class drills.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
*   Open-ended format: No options (like a MCQ) to prompt memory.
*   Dual-requirement: Must provide both the zone and the "reason" to get the point (though the rubric suggests 1 mark, implying high precision is needed).
*   Language barrier: Translating the conceptual understanding from Hindi/Vernacular to English, or even understanding the English prompt, poses a significant hurdle for ESL/EWS students.
*   "Non-luminous" terminology: Scientific vocabulary (non-luminous/outermost) is often harder to recall than "the blue part."

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the fact is standard in Indian textbooks, the open-ended nature and the requirement to explain "Why" (High temperature/complete combustion) combined with the language barriers common in EWS settings reduce the success rate significantly.
