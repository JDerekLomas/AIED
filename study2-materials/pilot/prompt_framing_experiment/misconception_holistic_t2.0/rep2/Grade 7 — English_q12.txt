Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
Though the subject is English, the structural logic required involves: 
1. Transitive property: Identifying the subject, verb, and object relationship. 
2. Substitution and Transformation: Reordering the elements (Object becomes Subject). 
3. Algorithmic thinking: Applying the specific rule "to be" verb + Past Participle (V3). 

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold. 
1. Incorrect Participle Form: Students may use "blew" or "blowed" instead of "blown." This leads to an incorrect answer.
2. Subject-Verb Agreement: Using "was" instead of "were" because "wind" is singular or due to poor grasp of plural "leaves." This leads to an incorrect answer.
3. Tense Mismatch: Changing "blew" (Past) to "are blown" (Present). This leads to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier:
1. Context: The vocabulary (wind, leaves, blow) is elementary and relatable to rural/urban contexts. 
2. Standard Structure: This is a classic S-V-O sentence without complex clauses or double objects.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
1. Irregular Verb: "Blow-blew-blown" is a common pain point for Hindi-medium students who often default to adding "-ed" or confuse the vowel shifts. 
2. Language Barrier: For ESL/Hindi-medium learners, the "by" agent construction is cognitively demanding. 
3. No Scaffolding: Being an open-ended "Change the sentence" task, there are no options to trigger recognition; it requires pure recall of the V3 form.

Step 5: Holistic estimate: 
In typical government school settings for Grade 7, the irregular past participle ("blown") and the plural agreement ("were") act as significant hurdles. Most students will likely struggle with the irregular verb form or the auxiliary verb selection.
