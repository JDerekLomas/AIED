**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Multiplication and repeated addition:** Calculating the value of multiple coins of the same denomination (e.g., $16 \times 50$ paise).
*   **Unit conversion:** Understanding the relationship between Paise and Rupees ($100 \text{ paise} = ₹1$).
*   **Decimal/Fractional logic:** Treating 50 paise as 0.50 or $1/2$ of a Rupee.
*   **Multi-step problem solving:** Executing three separate calculations, summing them, and then performing a final division or comparison to find how many $₹5$ coins can be formed.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Place Value/Decimal Confusion:** Students often think "10 coins of 10 paise" equals 100 Rupees rather than 100 Paise. *Result: Incorrect answer.*
*   **Ignoring Units:** Simply adding the counts $(10+5+16 = 31)$. *Result: Incorrect answer.*
*   **Whole Number Bias:** Struggling with $16 \times 50$ by treating it as a large multiplication and failing to convert to ₹8. *Result: Incorrect answer.*
*   **Last-step error:** Calculating the total sum (₹10) correctly but failing to divide by 5 to find the number of coins. *Result: Incorrect answer.*

**Step 3: Factors that make it easier**
*   **Familiar context:** Even in economically weaker sections, handling small denominations of currency is a real-life skill students practice daily.
*   **Round numbers:** The totals for each group ($10 \times 10$ and $5 \times 20$) both result in exactly ₹1, making the mental math easier.

**Step 4: Factors that make it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, a word problem in English with multiple clauses ("...from 10 coins of 10 paise...") can be syntactically confusing.
*   **Obsolete Currency:** 10p and 20p coins are no longer in circulation; students may have no physical intuition for their value compared to a 50p coin.
*   **Multi-step nature:** It is not a single calculation; it requires four distinct mathematical steps (three multiplications/summations and one final division).
*   **No Multiple Choice:** There are no cues to help self-correct errors in conversion.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
While the math involves "clean" numbers, the combination of the language barrier (English proficiency), the obsolescence of the smaller coins, and the necessity to complete a final division step (dividing the ₹10 total by 5) after the initial addition poses a significant hurdle for Grade 7 students in this demographic.
