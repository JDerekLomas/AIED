Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
*While the question is Science-based, the cognitive processes involve logic and conditional "if-then" reasoning. The student must map distinct inputs (liquid types) to distinct outputs (color changes) based on a rule set.*

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Confusing indicators:** Students often swap the reactions (thinking turmeric turns red in acid). *Would lead to incorrect answer.*
*   **Ambiguity of "Neutral":** Thinking an indicator must change color to prove something is an acid, rather than understanding "no change" is also data. *Would lead to incomplete/incorrect answer.*
*   **Hibiscus confusion:** Because the prompt provides both materials, students may attempt to combine them or describe hibiscus colors (pink/green) instead of the turmeric requested by the rubric. *May lead to partial credit or zero depending on evaluator.*

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Familiar context:** Turmeric (Haldi) and Hibiscus (Gudhal) are highly accessible, everyday items in Indian households. 
*   **Visual cues:** The color change of Haldi is a common life experience (stains on clothes turning red with soap).

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **English Language Barrier:** The question is a word problem. For Hindi-medium students, translating "extract" or phrasing the procedure in English is a high cognitive load.
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no options to prompt memory; students must retrieve the information and construct a sentence.
*   **Distractor material:** Providing two indicators but requiring only one (or both) can confuse students on which to focus on.

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.
Given the open-ended nature of the question and the requirement to express a procedure in English, many students will likely know the "red/yellow" concept but fail to write a complete, scientifically accurate sentence in English that satisfies the rubric.
