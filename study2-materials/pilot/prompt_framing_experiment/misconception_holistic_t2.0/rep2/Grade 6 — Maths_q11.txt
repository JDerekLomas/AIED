**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Concept recognition:** Identifying that the "maximum value" used for exact measurement refers to the Greatest Common Divisor or Highest Common Factor (HCF).
*   **Arithmetic skill:** Performing prime factorization or using the division method for the numbers 75 and 69.
*   **Multiplication/Division facts:** Knowing factors of numbers (specifically recognizing that 3 divides into both).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **LCM vs. HCF Confusion:** Many students see "maximum" and associate it with "multiple," leading them to find the LCM (1725). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Additive Reasoning:** Some students may subtract the numbers ($75-69=6$) as a way to find "the difference" rather than the factor. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Unit Misconception:** Treating "weight" as a continuous measure rather than looking for discrete integer factors.

**Step 3: Factors making the item easier**
*   **Familiarity:** This is a classic "textbook" problem often found in NCERT (Class 6, Chapter 3).
*   **Small numbers:** The numbers (75, 69) are small and manageable.
*   **Odd numbers:** Since both are odd, students aren't tempted to simply divide by 2 repeatedly.

**Step 4: Factors making the item harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the phrase "exact number of times" is an English idiom that is difficult to translate into mathematical operations without strong English proficiency.
*   **No Multiple Choice:** As an open-ended item, there is no "guess and check" or "back-calculating" from options.
*   **Primality:** 23 is a factor of 69 ($3 \times 23$), which is a less common prime for 6th graders to work with, making the factorization of 69 slightly trickier than more common composite numbers.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
The heavy linguistic load (the bridge between the word "maximum" and the HCF operation) is a significant hurdle for students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds. While the math is simple ($HCF = 3$), identifying *what* to do is the primary barrier. Many will either find the LCM or simply add/subtract the weights.
