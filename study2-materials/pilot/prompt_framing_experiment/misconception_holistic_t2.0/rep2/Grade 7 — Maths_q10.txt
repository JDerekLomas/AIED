**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Knowledge of Formulas:** Recalling the perimeter of a rectangle ($P = 2(l + w)$) and area ($A = l \times w$).
*   **Algebraic Manipulation:** Substituting known values into a formula and solving for an unknown variable (width).
*   **Multi-step Computation:** Dividing the perimeter by 2, subtracting the length to find the width, and then multiplying to find the area.
*   **Unit Management:** Ensuring final answers are in cm and $\text{cm}^2$ (though the rubric focuses on the value).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Formula Confusion:** Using $P = l \times w$ or $P = l + w$. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Linear vs. Square Units:** Confusing perimeter (cm) with area ($\text{cm}^2$).
*   **Arithmetic Error in Transposition:** Adding 10 to 32 instead of subtracting after dividing by 2 (or vice versa).
*   **Incomplete Execution:** Finding the width but forgetting to calculate the area. This is a high risk here since the question asks for two values.

**Step 3: Factors making the item easier**
*   **Simple Numbers:** $32, 10, 6$ are "clean" integers.
*   **Standard Context:** Perimeter and area of rectangles are "drill-and-practice" staples in Class 6 and 7.
*   **Step-by-Step Logic:** The problem follows a linear progression common in Indian textbooks (NCERT style).

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the English terms "Perimeter," "Width," and "Area" if they are not yet comfortable with English vocabulary in math.
*   **Multi-Step requirement:** The student must perform three distinct operations ($32/2$, $16-10$, and $10 \times 6$). Failure at any point results in zero marks (given the binary Max Score: 1).
*   **Missing Cues:** The lack of multiple-choice options prevents "back-solving" from given answers.
*   **Implicit Algebra:** Setting up $2(l+w) = P$ is more cognitively demanding than simply finding $P$ given $l$ and $w$.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimation**
While the arithmetic is simple, the requirement to solve a two-part question (width AND area) for a single mark is a high bar for this demographic. Many students will correctly find the width (6 cm) but may fail to complete the second step or make a calculation error in the inverse operation required to find the width.
