Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, it involves concepts of economic quantification (surplus, deficit, debt, and taxation). Students must understand the relationship between expenditure (military costs) and resources (state treasury).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- "Totalist thinking": War results in total destruction of all money/people, rather than specific economic shifts (Leads to correct/vague answers).
- Confusion between "King’s wealth" and "Kingdom’s economy": Students might think only the palace gets poor (May lead to incorrect answers if they can't link it to the "economic life" of the people).
- Zero-sum misunderstanding: Thinking only the loser loses money; forgetting that the winner also spent heavily (Would still likely lead to a correct answer regarding cost).

Step 3: The context is highly familiar from Indian history textbooks (Shivaji, Marathas, Mughals). The rubric is very generous—it only requires one plausible impact, and "increased taxes" or "loss of crops" are highly intuitive answers taught since Grade 5.

Step 4: The biggest hurdles are linguistic. "Assess the impact" is high-level academic English. Students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds may know the concept (Yuddh se nuksan) but struggle to decode the formal phrasing of the prompt. The open-ended format requires sentence construction, which is difficult for students with limited English proficiency.

Step 5: While the conceptual bar is low and the rubric is lenient, the combination of a high-level academic prompt in English and the requirement for a written response (rather than a checkbox) will filter out many students who understand the history but cannot articulate it in the target language.
