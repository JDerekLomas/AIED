Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, it involves categorical thinking and understanding hierarchical structures. The "mathematical" equivalent is understanding sets/subsets (Central -> State -> Local/Panchayat).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Power confusion: Thinking the Sarpanch is an employee of the State government rather than an elected local representative (Could lead to incorrect/vague answer).
- Scope confusion: Believing the Panchayat can make laws like Parliament (Leads to incorrect answer).
- Role confusion: Equating "Panchayat" only with "justice/solving fights" rather than administrative development (Might result in a partial or incorrect answer depending on strictness of rubric).

Step 3: Ease factors: The context is highly familiar; even in urban settings, students from economically weaker sections often have strong ties to rural "home" villages. The term "Panchayati Raj" is frequently heard in Hindi and English. It is a core, repeated topic in the Class 6-8 curriculum.

Step 4: Difficulty factors: The item is open-ended, requiring the student to formulate a definition in English. For Hindi-medium students, translating "Local Self-Governance" or "Grassroots" into precise English is a high cognitive barrier. Limited English proficiency makes it difficult to articulate "administrative" or "developmental" functions even if the concept is understood in the native language.

Step 5: Holistically, while the concept is culturally resonant, the requirement to explain a complex political science concept in a non-native language without the scaffolding of multiple-choice options will significantly lower the success rate.
