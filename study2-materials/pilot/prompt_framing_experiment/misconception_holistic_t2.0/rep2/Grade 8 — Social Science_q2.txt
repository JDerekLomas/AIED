Step 1: Identify the concepts and skills required.
Though the question is labeled Social Science, it involves spatial and structural reasoning. Students must understand urban organization (the "Grid" concept—intersecting perpendicular lines), geometric regularity (standardized baked bricks), and topological elevation (division of city into high/low sectors). Linguistic skills are also critical here, as students must translate visual or conceptual understanding into descriptive English.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold.
*   **Conflating Periods:** Thinking Harappan technology was similar to the Stone Age or primitive rural settings. (Would lead to an incorrect answer if they describe "caves" or "huts").
*   **Grid Understanding:** Difficulty visualizing "intersecting at 90 degrees." (Might describe roads but not the *planning* element).
*   **Vocabulary Barriers:** Misunderstanding "urban" or "citadel." For Hindi-medium students, the concept of a "Citadel" is often taught as "Durg" or "Qila"; without knowing the English term, they may struggle to describe it.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** The Harappan/Indus Valley Civilization is a cornerstone of the Grade 6–8 Indian NCERT/State curriculum; students are exposed to it repeatedly.
*   **Keyword Association:** Students are often coached to memorize specific buzzwords like "Drainage System" or "Baked Bricks" which suffice for the 1-mark requirement.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** Describing a "feature" in a complete sentence is significantly harder for ELL students than selecting a multiple-choice option.
*   **Abstract Reasoning:** Connecting the physical layout to the concept of "planning" requires higher-order thinking beyond simple recall of facts.
*   **No Scaffolding:** The open-ended format provides no hints or word banks.

Step 5: Holistically, while the topic is very well-rehearsed in Indian schools, the combination of an open-response format and the English language barrier for EWS/Hindi-medium students reduces the success rate. Many will provide one-word answers (e.g., "Drainage") which might receive credit in a lenient rubric but may fail to "describe" as the prompt requires.
