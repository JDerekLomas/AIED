Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
Strictly speaking, this is a Social Science item. However, in terms of quantitative/logical structure, it requires set identification (identifying 2 items from a specific category), data pairing (linking a monument to a specific city), and attribute assignment (linking a monument to a reason for fame).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
1. Category error: Students might list natural features (Mount Abu) instead of "monuments," though many consider these interchangeable. (May lead to incorrect answer).
2. Location displacement: Attributing a monument to the wrong city (e.g., Amer Fort in Jodhpur). (Will lead to incorrect answer).
3. Scale/Magnitude confusion: Confusing historical significance with modern size or local popularity.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
Context familiarity: For students in India (even in EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds), monuments like Hawa Mahal, Amer Fort, and Chittorgarh Fort are cultural staples and common general knowledge. The names are often phonetically similar in Hindi and English.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
English proficiency: While the students know the names, expressing the "why it is famous" in English can be a significant barrier. 
Question complexity: It is a three-part request (Name 2, Pick 1, State city, State reason). Students may lose marks for omission (forgetting to state why it's famous) even if they know the facts.
Rubric Rigidity: The prompt asks for 4 distinct pieces of information, but the maximum score is 1. This suggests "all or nothing" grading, which lowers the success rate.

Step 5: Estimate the proportion of students who would produce the fully correct answer.
While the subject matter is familiar, the English language barrier for the descriptive part ("why it is famous") and the multi-part nature of the question within an "all or nothing" 1-point rubric will lead to many partially correct but technically "wrong" answers.
