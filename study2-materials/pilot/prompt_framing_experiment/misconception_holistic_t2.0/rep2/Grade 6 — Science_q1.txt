Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While categorized as Science, the item involves logic and spatial reasoning. Students must understand the concept of directional poles (vectors), binary relationships (North-North vs. North-South), and the physical outcome of interaction (force). In a mathematical sense, it is an application of "like signs repel."

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Magnetism as Gravity: Thinking magnets just stick to everything (leads to "attract" or "stick together").
*   Size Bias: Thinking a larger magnet will always pull a smaller one regardless of polarity (may lead to an incorrect answer).
*   Pole Confusion: Confusing North/South with left/right or top/bottom (may lead to an incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   Familiar Context: Bar magnets are standard "kit" items in Indian government schools; "like poles repel" is a foundational mnemonic often memorized in both Hindi (समान ध्रुव) and English.
*   Binary Outcome: There are only two primary possibilities (attract or repel), giving students a high chance of success if they recall the rule.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
*   Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students, the word "repel" is academic English. They may know what happens but struggle to find the specific English word, though the rubric allows "push away."
*   Open-ended Format: No multiple-choice options means students must generate the term from memory.
*   Abstract Reading: Interpreting "brought near" requires visualizing the physical action from a text description.

Step 5: Estimate of correct responses.
Despite the English language challenge, this is one of the most heavily emphasized and "demo-heavy" concepts in the Grade 6 Science curriculum. Students in this demographic often perform well on rote-recalled physical laws even if their general English is limited.
