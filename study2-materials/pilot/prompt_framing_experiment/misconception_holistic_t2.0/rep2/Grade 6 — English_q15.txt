Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a language assessment item, not a mathematical one. However, the underlying cognitive skills required include logical structuring, basic syntax (Subject-Verb-Object), and vocabulary retrieval.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Subject-Verb Agreement: Misconception that the verb form is independent of the pronoun (e.g., "He play" instead of "He plays"). This would lead to an incorrect answer under "grammatically correct."
*   Tense consistency: Mixing past and present incorrectly.
*   Confusion between possessive and nominative pronouns (e.g., "His is my friend").

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   Highly familiar context: Every student knows who their "best friend" is.
*   High frequency of practice: Describing a person is one of the first communicative tasks taught in Grade 6.
*   Simple sentence structure is sufficient to score the point (e.g., "Rahul is my friend. He is good.").

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Open-ended format: No scaffolding or sentence starters provided.
*   Strict Rubric: Requires *two* sentences *and* grammatical correctness; a single error in one sentence results in 0 marks.
*   Language barrier: Students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds may think in their mother tongue and struggle to translate the concepts into correct English syntax.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
While the topic is simple, the requirement for complete grammatical correctness in two sentences is a high bar for learners with limited English proficiency transitioning from Hindi-medium environments. Many will write one sentence or commit a minor grammatical error (e.g., "My friend name is...").
