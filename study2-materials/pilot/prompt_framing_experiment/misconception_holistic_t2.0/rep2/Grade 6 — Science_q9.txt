Step 1: The question is a Biology (Science) item, not a mathematical one. However, the cognitive skills required include recall of definitions, causal reasoning (linking nutrient functions to the term "protective"), and categorizing specific health conditions by their nutrient source.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include the idea that all nutrients provide energy (confusion with carbohydrates/fats) or that "protection" means physical strength rather than immunity. These misconceptions would lead to incorrect explanations in part (a).

Step 3: This is a high-frequency topic in the Grade 6 NCERT/State Board syllabus. The term "Protective Foods" is a keyword often highlighted in textbooks. The deficiency diseases (like Scurvy, Rickets, or Goiter) are common rote-memorization points, which students often perform well on.

Step 4: Factors making it harder include:
- The Hindi-to-English transition: Students may understand that these foods help "bimari se ladne ke liye" (fight illness) but may struggle to articulate the word "immunity" or structure the English sentence correctly.
- Multi-part structure: Missing any part of the question (either a vitamin disease OR a mineral disease) would result in a score reduction according to many state board marking schemes.
- The rubric is binary (1 point for the whole item) yet requires two separate parts to be answered.

Step 5: While the content is familiar and frequently drilled, the open-ended nature and English language barrier for students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds create a hurdle for providing a complete, technically correct explanation for part (a) in English.
