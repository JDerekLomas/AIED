**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Vocabulary-Operation Correspondence:** Understanding that the word "of" in the context of fractions signifies multiplication.
*   **Fraction Multiplication:** Numerator × Numerator and Denominator × Denominator ($a/b \times c/d = ac/bd$).
*   **Comparing Fractions:** Comparing $3/8$ and $4/15$ requires either finding a Common Denominator (LCM), cross-multiplication ($3 \times 15$ vs $8 \times 4$), or converting to decimals.

**Step 2: Common Misconceptions**
*   **Additive/"Gap" Reasoning:** Thinking $3/8$ and $4/15$ are "equal" or similar because they can't see the scale.
*   **"Of" means Addition:** Students might add $1/2 + 3/4$. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Whole Number Bias:** Thinking $4/15$ is larger because 15 is much larger than 8 (inverse relationship misunderstanding). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Multiplication Rule Error:** Trying to find a common denominator *before* multiplying. While it yields the same result, it often leads to computational errors.

**Step 3: Factors making the item easier**
*   **Simple Numbers:** The initial fractions are small (single digits).
*   **Procedural Routine:** "Of" problems are a standard part of the Class 7 NCERT curriculum (Chapter 2), making the calculation step highly practiced.

**Step 4: Factors making the item harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the word "of" is "ka" (का). In an English-medium paper, "of" can occasionally be a stumbling block if the student relies on rote memorization of keywords.
*   **Multi-Step Comparison:** Calculating the products is only half the battle. Comparing $3/8$ (0.375) and $4/15$ (~0.266) requires a secondary, more difficult skill: comparing fractions with unlike denominators.
*   **No Scaffolding:** Being open-ended with no multiple-choice options removes the possibility of guessing or working backward.
*   **Rubric Rigidity:** The rubric requires both calculations to be correct. Even if a student identifies the correct "greater" value by intuition, they may lose the mark if the calculation is messy.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
In Indian government school contexts, students are often proficient at rote multiplication ($1/2 \times 3/4$), but the second step—comparing the two resulting fractions—is where a significant number of Grade 7 students struggle. $3/8$ vs $4/15$ is not intuitively obvious. Many students will stop after the multiplication or make a mistake in cross-multiplication/LCM.
