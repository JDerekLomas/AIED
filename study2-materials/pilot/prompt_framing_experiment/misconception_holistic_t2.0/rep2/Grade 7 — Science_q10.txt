Step 1: The mathematical/scientific concepts involve identifying patterns and categorizing chemical reactions based on properties. It requires an understanding of binary oppositions (acid vs. base) and the process of "Neutralization." Students must link a specific biological symptom to its chemical remedy.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include the belief that all "stings" are the same substance, the idea that "neutralization" only refers to making something water-like rather than a chemical reaction, and confusing which substance is acidic (bee vs. wasp). While confusing the substances might lead to an error in practice, the question asks for the "principle," so a student might still correctly identify "Neutralization" even if they forget which sting is which.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: The context of "remedies" for stings is common in Indian science textbooks and life-skills modules. The word "Neutralization" is a high-frequency keyword in Grade 7 chemistry.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: The question is open-ended. Language is a significant barrier: the typo "string" instead of "sting" (used twice) can be highly confusing for students with limited English proficiency. Many might know the concept in Hindi (उदासीनीकरण - Udāshīnīkaraṇa) but struggle to recall or spell "Neutralization." Additionally, explaining the principle requires expressive language skills rather than just selecting an option.

Step 5: Holistically, while the concept is a core part of the curriculum, the linguistic errors in the item and the requirement for an open-ended English explanation from Hindi-medium backgrounds will lower the success rate.
