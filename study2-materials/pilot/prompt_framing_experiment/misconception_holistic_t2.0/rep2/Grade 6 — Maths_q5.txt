Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills: Understanding the definition of a palindrome; identifying place value up to 10,000s; identifying the specific boundaries of 5-digit numbers; performing large number addition (sum) and subtraction (difference).

Step 2: Common misconceptions:
- Confusion between "5-digit" and "up to 5 digits" (Incorrectly picking 101 or 10,001).
- Misunderstanding "palindrome": Many students mistake it for a repeating digit (11111) or a "mirrored" number that doesn't account for zero (picking 11111 instead of 10001 as the smallest).
- Reversals/Carrying errors in addition/subtraction.
- Language barrier: Not knowing the terms "sum" or "difference" due to limited English proficiency.

Step 3: Facilitators: The numbers 10,001 and 99,999 are relatively "clean" benchmarks. Palindromes are often taught as a recreational math topic which can be memorable for some students.

Step 4: Inhibitors: This is a high-cognitive load item. It is a "constructed response" (no options to guess from). It requires three distinct steps: finding two specific numbers based on a definition, adding them, and then subtracting them. Most importantly, the rubric allocates 1 mark but asks for *two* operations (sum and difference); students may stop after the first step (the sum). The English term "palindrome" is a high-level vocabulary word not commonly used in everyday Hindi-medium households.

Step 5: Holistically, for EWS students in Hindi-medium transitions, the vocabulary barrier ("palindrome," "sum," "difference") combined with the multi-step nature of the task makes this very challenging for Grade 6.
