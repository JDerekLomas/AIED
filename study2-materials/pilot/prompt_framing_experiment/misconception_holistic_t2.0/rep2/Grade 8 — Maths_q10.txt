### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Knowledge of Geometric Properties:** Identification of vertically opposite angles and the Angle Sum Property of a triangle.
*   **Algebraic Application:** Setting up and solving a simple linear equation (e.g., $x + 50 + 60 = 180$ or $x + 110 = 180$).
*   **Logical Deduction:** Understanding the relationship between different parts of a geometric figure.

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Linear Pair Misconception:** Students might assume $x$ and the adjacent interior angle must sum to 180°, or mistakenly apply properties of parallel lines (like corresponding angles) where they don't apply. *Effect: Incorrect answer.*
*   **Confusion between Interior and Exterior Angles:** If $y$ is an exterior angle, students often struggle to relate it correctly to the interior angles. *Effect: Incorrect answer.*
*   **Additive Errors:** Simply adding the visible numbers (50 + 60) and assuming $x$ is the result. *Effect: Incorrect answer.*

### Step 3: Factors Making the Item Easier
*   **Simple Arithmetic:** Typically, these problems use "friendly" numbers (multiples of 10 or 5) that minimize calculation errors.
*   **Standard Presentation:** This is a "textbook" style figure. In Indian government schools, NCERT exercises drill this specific visual format extensively.
*   **Familiar Terminology:** Terms like "Angle Sum Property" are frequently rote-memorized in both Hindi and English.

### Step 4: Factors Making the Item Harder
*   **Language Barrier:** The prompt is in English. While "Find $x$ and $y$" is common, requiring a "reason" (as per the rubric) in English is a high bar for Hindi-medium students.
*   **Multi-step Requirement:** The student must solve for one variable to find the other (or use two different properties), increasing the chance of a procedural slip.
*   **Rubric Rigidity:** The rubric requires both the calculation *and* the reason for 1 mark. This "all or nothing" scoring is punitive for students who can calculate but cannot articulate the theorem in English.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
Given that these students are highly practiced in rote geometric procedures but often struggle with the "reasoning" component in a second language and face a strict 1-mark rubric:
