Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
Strictly speaking, this is a Social Science item. However, in terms of cognitive skills applicable across disciplines, it requires: categorization/classification, logical differentiation (contrast), and the ability to link a theoretical definition to a concrete representative (example).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts. For each, note whether it would lead to an incorrect answer on THIS specific item.
*   "Written = Only Modern": Students may think literary sources must be printed books, failing to realize palm-leaf manuscripts are literary. (Leads to incorrect examples).
*   "Old = Archaeological": Students often classify any old object, including an old manuscript, as archaeological because it is found in the ground or a museum. (Leads to an incorrect distinction).
*   "Inscriptions are Literary": Because inscriptions involve writing, students often classify them as literary sources rather than archaeological ones. (Leads to an incorrect distinction).

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
*   Familiarity: This is a foundational "Intro to History" topic taught early in Grade 6.
*   Single Example: Only one example is required per category.
*   Vocabulary: The terms "archaeological" and "literary" are core technical terms usually drilled via rote memorization in both English and Hindi.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
*   Language Barrier: For ESL/Hindi-medium students, spelling "archaeological" and "manuscripts" is difficult.
*   Open-ended Format: No options provided; requires active recall and sentence construction.
*   Complex Definition: The rubric requires both a definition AND an example for only 1 mark; failure to provide any of the four components (2 definitions + 2 examples) results in zero.
*   Bilingual confusion: Translating "sources" (srot) and differentiating between "puratatvik" and "sahityik" while writing in English.

Step 5: Estimate the proportion of students who would produce the fully correct answer.
While the topic is standard, the requirement to define AND give examples for two distinct categories for a single mark is a high-threshold rubric. Many students will give examples but fail the formal definition, or swap the two, especially with the language barrier.
