Step 1: Identify mathematical concepts and skills.
Students must know the definition of a rectangle, identify "length" and "breadth" as its dimensions, and apply the formulas for Area ($L \times B$) and Perimeter ($2 \times (L + B)$). They also need to distinguish between square units and linear units.

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
*   **Formula confusion:** Mixing up the formulas for area and perimeter. (Would lead to an incorrect answer as both are requested).
*   **Additive Area:** Adding dimensions instead of multiplying ($15 + 8 = 23$). (Incorrect answer).
*   **Concept Blur:** Calculating only one when both are requested. (Incorrect answer per rubric).
*   **Unit errors:** Failing to provide "sq. cm" or "cm²".

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
*   **Simple numbers:** 15 and 8 are easy to multiply and add.
*   **Standard vocabulary:** "Length," "Breadth," "Area," and "Perimeter" are keywords taught early and emphasized in NCERT textbooks.
*   **Direct application:** The question is a standard drill-style problem without a complex "real-world" scenario.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
*   **Multi-part requirement:** The rubric requires both area and perimeter for the score (implicitly, though the rubric focuses on area, "Find its area and perimeter" requires two calculations). If a student gets the area right but perimeter wrong, they fail.
*   **English Language:** For Hindi-medium students, the terms "breadth" vs. "चौड़ाई" (Chaudai) and "area" vs. "क्षेत्रफल" (Kshetraphal) can pose a barrier if the exam is not bilingual.
*   **Constructed Response:** No multiple-choice options to trigger memory or allow for back-calculation.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
While the arithmetic is simple, Grade 6 students in this demographic often struggle with distinguishing between Area and Perimeter concepts and frequently omit units or perform only one half of the calculation required by the prompt.
