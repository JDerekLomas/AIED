Step 1: The mathematical concepts and skills required are not applicable here as the item is from an English language assessment. However, equivalent cognitive skills involve categorization, semantic mapping, and vocabulary recall.

Step 2: Common linguistic misconceptions for Grade 8 students in this context include:
- Confusing synonyms with antonyms (leads to incorrect answer).
- Spelling errors in English (often phonetically influenced by Hindi) (may lead to partial or incorrect answer depending on strictness).
- Thinking a synonym must have a completely identical meaning rather than a similar one (leads to omission/hesitation).
- Misunderstanding the word "quiet" due to phonetic similarity with "quite" (leads to incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making it easier: "Quiet" is a very high-frequency word introduced in early primary school (e.g., "Keep quiet" in classrooms). The context is highly familiar in a school setting.

Step 4: Factors making it harder: The open-ended format requires active recall rather than recognition (multiple choice). Limited English proficiency among Hindi-medium students makes recalling formal words like "silent" or "noisy" harder than understanding them receptively. The vocabulary "synonym" and "antonym" themselves are academic terms that may confuse students even if they know the meaning of "quiet."

Step 5: Given the high frequency of the word "quiet" in classroom management but the hurdle of academic metalanguage (synonym/antonym) and recall-based formatting for ESL learners:
