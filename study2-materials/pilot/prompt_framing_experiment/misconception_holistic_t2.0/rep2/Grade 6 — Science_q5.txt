Step 1: Identify the scientific concepts and skills required.
Students need to recall the specific chemical reagent used for starch (iodine) and the procedural step of applying it to a food sample. They must also identify the specific color change (blue-black) that signifies a positive result. 

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
1. Confusing reagents: Students often mix up iodine (starch), copper sulfate/caustic soda (protein), and the "oily patch" test (fats). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
2. Confusion of colors: Students might recall a color change but mix it up (e.g., saying it turns orange or pink). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
3. Language Barrier: Students may know "आयोडीन" (iodine) but struggle to construct a descriptive sentence in English ("Describe the simple procedure"). This is a significant barrier for ESL/Hindi-medium learners.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
- Familiar context: Potatoes are a staple food, and the starch test is a standard, visually striking experiment performed in most Grade 6 NCERT-based classrooms. 
- Low threshold rubric: The rubric only requires mentioning iodine, not necessarily a complex chemical explanation.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Open-ended format: Unlike a multiple-choice question where "iodine" might be an option to recognize, this requires active recall and sentence construction.
- English proficiency: Explaining a "procedure" and "observation" requires command of verbs and structure that many students in this demographic struggle with, even if they understand the science.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
While the "iodine test" is a foundational piece of the Grade 6 curriculum, the combination of an open-ended descriptive requirement and the language barrier for economically disadvantaged/Hindi-medium students significantly lowers the expected success rate compared to a simple fill-in-the-blank or MCQ. Many will provide one-word answers ("Iodine") which might only get partial credit or be ignored depending on strictness, though the rubric here is somewhat lenient.
