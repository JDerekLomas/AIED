Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a language conventions item, not a mathematical one. However, applying the required logic to this literacy task: The skills required are pattern recognition (identifying proper nouns), understanding rule-based sets (days of the week, names), and spatial/symbolic manipulation (applying capitalization and full stops).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Case Insensitivity:** Students often believe capital letters are decorative rather than functional. (Leads to incorrect answer)
*   **Internal Punctuation Ignorance:** Believing capitalization only occurs at the start of a sentence, ignoring proper nouns like "Meena" and "Sunday." (Leads to incorrect answer)
*   **The "Middle-word" neglect:** Students may correct the first and last parts of a sentence but ignore the middle (Meena). (Leads to incorrect answer)

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
The context is familiar (market, friends). The sentence length is short. The names (Riya, Meena) are common Indian names, making them recognizable as proper nouns despite Hindi-medium backgrounds.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
The open-ended format (no multiple choice) requires the student to produce the sentence from scratch. For students transitioning from Hindi to English, the rule for capitalizing days of the week ("Sunday") is often confusing as this rule does not exist in Devanagari script. Identifying three separate instances of capitalization plus a period is a multi-step verification process.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the English language proficiency levels in economically weaker section schools and the transition from Hindi (which lacks case distinction), most students will provide a partially correct answer (starting with 'Riya' and ending with a period) but miss 'Meena' or 'Sunday.'
