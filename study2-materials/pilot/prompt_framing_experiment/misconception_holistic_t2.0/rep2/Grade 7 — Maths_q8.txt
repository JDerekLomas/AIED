**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Unitary Method:** Understanding that if 5 liters cover 55 km, 1 liter covers a specific constant amount.
*   **Division and Multiplication:** Performing $55 \div 5$ (division) and then $11 \times 12$ (multiplication).
*   **Concept of "Mileage":** Connecting the mathematical result of $55/5$ to the real-world term "average" or "mileage."
*   **Proportional Reasoning:** Understanding the direct relationship between fuel and distance.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Additive vs. Multiplicative reasoning:** A student might think $12 - 5 = 7$, so they add 7 to 55 ($55+7=62$). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Inverse operation:** Dividing 55 by 12 or multiplying 55 by 5. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Ignoring the second question:** Students may find 132 km but fail to explicitly state the "mileage" (11 km/l), though the rubric focuses primarily on the 132 km result.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Familiar context:** "Mileage" and car travel are highly relatable real-world contexts, even for students from economically weaker sections (via motorcycles or public transport).
*   **Friendly numbers:** 55 and 5 are easily divisible (multiples of 11), reducing cognitive load during the first step.
*   **High practice:** The unitary method is a core component of the Grade 6 and 7 curriculum in India.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** The phrase "How much mileage (average) the car is giving?" might be confusing for Hindi-medium students if they are used to the word "Average" (औसत) or "Mileage" in a specific linguistic context.
*   **Double Question:** The item asks two things: "How much distance..." and "How much mileage...". In a high-stakes or timed setting, students often stop after the first calculation.
*   **Open-ended/No Choices:** Without multiple-choice options, there is no "safety net" to prompt a rethink if their calculation doesn't match a given option.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
While the math is straightforward (division by 5, then multiplication), the dual-part nature of the question and the specific phrasing of "mileage" often lead to incomplete answers or confusion for English Language Learners (ELL). However, because 55/5 is a very common "textbook" style calculation, many students will recognize the pattern.
