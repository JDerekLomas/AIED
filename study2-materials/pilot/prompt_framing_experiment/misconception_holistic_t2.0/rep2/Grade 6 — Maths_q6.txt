### Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required
*   **Formula Application:** Knowledge of the area formulas for a rectangle ($L \times W$) and a square ($S \times S$).
*   **Calculation:** Single-digit multiplication ($5 \times 4$ and $5 \times 5$).
*   **Comparative Reasoning:** Identifying which value is larger ($25 > 20$).
*   **Subtraction/Difference:** Calculating "by how much" ($25 - 20 = 5$).
*   **Unit Awareness:** Understanding square units (sq.cm).

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Area vs. Perimeter:** Students often confuse the two. If a student calculates perimeter ($P_{rect}=18$, $P_{sq}=20$), they would still conclude the square is "greater," potentially leading to a correct answer for the wrong reason, but failing the rubric.
*   **Additive Area:** Adding side lengths instead of multiplying ($5+4=9$, $5+5=10$). This would lead to a "Square is larger" conclusion but incorrect values.
*   **Confusion with "Length" in Square:** Some might try to use $L \times W$ for a square and struggle because only one dimension is given (though "side" is stated).
*   **Incomplete Response:** Calculating the areas but failing to answer "by how much."

### Step 3: Factors making it easier
*   **Simple Numbers:** The numbers $4$ and $5$ are small and within the basic multiplication table range familiar to most students.
*   **Familiar Shapes:** Rectangles and squares are the most commonly practiced shapes in Grade 6.
*   **Explicit Dimensions:** No unit conversions are required (all are in cm).

### Step 4: Factors making it harder
*   **Multi-step Process:** The student must perform two separate calculations, a comparison, and a final subtraction.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students with limited English, terms like "greater" and "by how much" (कितना अधिक) can be confusing if the question is only provided in English.
*   **Constructed Response:** There are no options to nudge the student toward the right process; they must recall the formulas entirely from memory.
*   **Unit of Measure:** "Sq.cm" is often missed by students at this level, which might affect scoring if the rubric is strictly applied.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
Given that this is a multi-step word problem in English for students from low-resource, ESL backgrounds, many will likely stumble on the second part of the question ("by how much") or confuse area with perimeter, even if they understand the basic geometry.
