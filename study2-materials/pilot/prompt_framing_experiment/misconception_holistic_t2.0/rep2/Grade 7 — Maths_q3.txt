### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Knowledge of Formula:** Recall the specific formula for the area of a triangle ($A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$).
*   **Substitution:** Correcting plugging in the values (8 for base, 6 for height).
*   **Arithmetic Operations:** Multiplicative proficiency (multiplying 8 and 6) and division/multiplication by a fraction (halving the product).
*   **Unit Awareness:** Understanding that the result represents an area (though the rubric focuses on the calculation).

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Area of a Rectangle Misconception:** Students often forget the $1/2$ and simply multiply $8 \times 6 = 48$. This is very common at this level and **would lead to an incorrect answer.**
*   **Additive Misconception:** Students might add the dimensions ($8 + 6 = 14$) if they confuse area with perimeter or lack operational conceptualization. This **would lead to an incorrect answer.**
*   **Confusing Height with Slant Height:** Not applicable here as a diagram is not provided to mislead, but the concept of "height" might be abstract if not clearly understood.
*   **Misinterpreting Units:** Writing $14$ or $48$ without understanding the scale.

### Step 3: Factors Making the Item Easier
*   **Simple Integers:** The numbers 8 and 6 are single digits and easy to multiply. 48 is also an even number, making the division by 2 straightforward.
*   **Direct Language:** The question uses standard keywords ("base," "height," "area") which are common in both English and Hindi-medium ($आधार, ऊंचाई, क्षेत्रफल$) textbooks.
*   **Single-step Application:** This is a "plug-and-chug" problem requiring no rearrangement of the formula.

### Step 4: Factors Making it Harder
*   **Open-ended Format:** There are no multiple-choice options to trigger a memory of the $1/2$ in the formula. If a student calculates 48, there is no "distractor" to make them second-guess; they will simply write it down.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, while the terms are standard, a lack of comfort with English sentence structures can occasionally lead to anxiety, though this specific phrasing is the most basic version possible.
*   **Formula Retrieval:** Many students in economically weaker sections (EWS) rely on rote memorization; if the "$\frac{1}{2}$" was not drilled effectively, the most common error is calculating the area of a quadrilateral.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
Given that this is a standard, low-level procedural item, many students will recognize it. However, the absence of a diagram and the high frequency of the "Base $\times$ Height" error (forgetting the half) significantly impacts the success rate in high-poverty or linguistically diverse classrooms where conceptual "why" (a triangle is half a rectangle) is often skipped in favor of "how."
