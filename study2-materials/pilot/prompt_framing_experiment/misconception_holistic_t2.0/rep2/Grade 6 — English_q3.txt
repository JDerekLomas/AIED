Step 1: The question requires basic English literacy, specifically literal comprehension of a text (finding "who" did "what" and "when"). No mathematical concepts are required.

Step 2: Since this is an English language item, the primary "misconception" involves syntactic processing—mixing up the subject (Riya) with the object (books). Students might also confuse the timeframe ("evening") with other times mentioned in a potential passage. However, in a basic retrieval task, these errors usually stem from poor vocabulary rather than conceptual misunderstanding.

Step 3: Ease factors include a very common context (reading) and a straightforward question word ("What"). The rubric is generous, accepting "read books," which allows students with low English syntax skills to get full marks if they can identify the keyword.

Step 4: Hardship factors are significant for this demographic: 
1. The question is in English; Hindi-medium students often struggle to decode the question even if they understand the passage. 
2. The open-ended format (no multiple choice) prevents guessing and requires productive writing. 
3. Students may find the information in the text but fail to transform "to read" into a grammatically acceptable answer, even if the rubric is lenient.

Step 5: For Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency, basic retrieval tasks are achievable for those with foundational literacy, but approximately 35-40% typically struggle with expressing the answer in English without prompts.
