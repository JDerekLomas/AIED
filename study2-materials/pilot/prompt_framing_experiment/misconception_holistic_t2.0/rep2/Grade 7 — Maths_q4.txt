**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Division with decimals:** Understanding how to handle a divisor that is a decimal.
*   **Equivalency:** Multiplying both the dividend and divisor by 10 (or moving the decimal point) to create a whole-number divisor ($80 \div 72$).
*   **Simplification of fractions:** Reducing $\frac{80}{72}$ or $\frac{10}{9}$ or performing long division to a recurring decimal ($1.11...$).
*   **Mental Arithmetic:** Basic division facts and remainders.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **"Division makes numbers smaller":** Not a primary issue here, as the result is greater than 1, but students often struggle when the divisor is larger than the dividend.
*   **Ignoring the decimal:** Treating $7.2$ as $72$, leading to an answer of $8 \div 72 \approx 0.11$. (Incorrect)
*   **Misplacing the decimal in the quotient:** Calculating $8 \div 72$ and guessing where the dot goes. (Incorrect)
*   **Inverting the operation:** Doing $7.2 \div 8$ because the larger-looking number "must" be the dividend. This leads to $0.9$. (Incorrect - very common).
*   **Subtraction error:** $8 - 7.2 = 0.8$ (Misunderstanding the operator symbol).

**Step 3: Factors that make it easier**
*   The numbers are small (single or double digits).
*   The divisor $7.2$ is "close" to $8$, making the magnitude of the answer easy to estimate (slightly more than 1).
*   Removing a single decimal place is a standard, well-practiced algorithm in Class 7.

**Step 4: Factors that make it harder**
*   **The divisor is larger than the dividend ($8 < 72$ after clearing the decimal):** This is the single biggest hurdle for students. Many will instinctively calculate $7.2 \div 8$ because $72/8$ is a clean multiplication table fact.
*   **Non-terminating result:** $80/72$ reduces to $10/9$ or $1.11...$. Students at this level often expect "clean" answers. A result that doesn't end (periodic decimal) can cause them to think they've made a mistake.
*   **Abstract notation:** The horizontal $\div$ symbol is sometimes less familiar than the "long division house" or fraction bar.
*   **Language:** While the numbers are universal, the rubric requires "setting up the division," which assumes the student understands the underlying rule of decimal manipulation rather than just performing a rote calculation.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
In an Indian government school context, Class 7 students are heavily trained in algorithms, but the "smaller dividend/larger divisor" trap is notorious. The tendency to flip the numbers to get $0.9$ will be extremely high. Additionally, the recurring decimal result ($1.11$) acts as a deterrent for many students who expect integer or simple decimal outcomes.
