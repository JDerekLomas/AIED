### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Knowledge of Multiples:** Understanding what a multiple is and how it differs from a factor.
*   **Prime Factorization or Division Method:** Mastery of a procedural algorithm (the "ladder" or common division method is standard in Indian government schools).
*   **Basic Arithmetic (Divisibility):** Knowledge of divisibility rules for 2, 3, and 5.
*   **Calculation:** Accuracy in multiplication of the resulting factors (e.g., $2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5$).

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Confusing LCM with HCF:** This is the most common error. If a student finds the Highest Common Factor (HCF) instead, they will get 1 (as there is no common factor for all three numbers except 1). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Addition instead of Multiplication:** Summing the prime factors instead of multiplying them. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Stopping early:** Finding a common multiple for two numbers but not all three. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Execution error:** Making a multiplication table mistake (e.g., $15 \times 4 = 50$). This leads to an incorrect answer.

### Step 3: Factors that make it Easier
*   **Familiar Numbers:** 12, 15, and 20 are "benchmark" numbers in Grade 6. They are small, frequently used in textbook examples, and students often have their multiplication tables memorized.
*   **Routine Procedure:** In the Indian curriculum, finding the LCM is a highly practiced "drill-and-kill" skill by Grade 6.
*   **Short Vocabulary:** The question is direct. Even students with low English proficiency understand the abbreviation "L.C.M." as it is used across both Hindi and English mediums.

### Step 4: Factors that make it Harder
*   **Constructed Response:** There are no options to provide a hint or allow for "plugging in" answers.
*   **Triple Numbers:** Finding the LCM of three numbers is significantly more prone to procedural errors than finding the LCM of two.
*   **Common Division Pitfall:** In the division method, students often forget to "bring down" a number that is not divisible by the current prime, leading to a wrong calculation.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the numbers are small and the instruction is clear, the transition from Hindi to English mediums and the reliance on perfect execution of a multi-step algorithm in a non-multiple-choice format usually results in a significant number of "careless" or procedural errors. In economically weaker section schools where resource access may be lower, procedural fluency is often prioritized, but mastery varies.
