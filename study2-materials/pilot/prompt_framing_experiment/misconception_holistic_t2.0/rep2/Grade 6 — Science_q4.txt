Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Science item, the underlying logical structure involves "causal reasoning" and "functional properties." There are no direct numerical calculations, but students must understand a 1:1 correspondence between a material's property (porosity/absorption) and its utility (cooling).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Misconception 1: "Cotton is naturally cold."** Students might believe the fabric itself has a low temperature, rather than understanding it facilitates evaporation. This would likely lead to an incorrect answer as it fails to describe a physical *property* (like absorption).
*   **Misconception 2: Conflating "thinness" with "cotton."** Students might think any thin cloth is cotton. If they describe "thinness" instead of a material property like absorption, they may miss the mark according to the rubric.
*   **Misconception 3: Focus on color.** Many students are taught to wear "white" in summer. They might provide an answer about reflecting sunlight, which is a property of color, not specifically a property of the fiber (cotton), potentially leading to a zero score based on the rubric.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Context:** Extremely familiar. Living in India, the heat and the use of cotton are daily realities for students.
*   **Prior Knowledge:** This is a standard topic in the Grade 6 Science chapter "Fibre to Fabric."
*   **Vocabulary:** The word "Soak" (Hindi: सोखना - sokhna) is common in daily parlance.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** The phrase "property" or "preference" may be difficult for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. If they don't understand what a "property" is in a scientific context, they cannot answer correctly.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options (MCQ), students must retrieve scientific terms from memory rather than simply recognizing them.
*   **Expressive limitations:** Students might know why it's used but struggle to articulate it in English (e.g., using "pores" or "absorption").

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.
While the context is relatable, the requirement to name a specific "property" and the language barrier for economically weaker students often leads to "common sense" answers (e.g., "it keeps us cool") rather than the "scientific property" answers required by the rubric (absorption/porosity).
