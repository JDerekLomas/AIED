Step 1: Identifying the concepts and skills required.
While the subject is Social Science, the "mathematical" and cognitive skills involved include understanding the transfer of value, understanding digital ledgers/integers, and logic-based causal relationships (how 'x' leads to growth).

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
- "Money is only physical cash": This would lead to failure in the second part of the question.
- "Development equals more personal money": Confusing macroeconomics with personal wealth. 
- Misunderstanding digital money as "free" or disconnected from actual currency. These misconceptions would likely lead to an incorrect answer given the analytical nature of the prompt.

Step 3: Factors that make it easier.
Digital payments (UPI) are ubiquitous in India, even among economically weaker sections (EWS), providing a familiar real-world context. The threshold for success is low (explaining only "one" role) and the maximum score is only 1 point.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
- Language Barrier: Words like "Analyze," "Economic Development," and "Evaluate" are high-level academic English (tier 3 vocabulary). Students with limited English proficiency may understand the concept but fail to interpret the prompt.
- Question Format: It is an open-ended "evaluate/analyze" prompt, which requires high-order thinking skills (Bloom’s Taxonomy) rather than simple recall.
- Structural Complexity: It is a two-part question for only one mark.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
The high linguistic demand of the terms "analyze" and "evaluate" will be the primary barrier for Grade 7 EWS students. Despite being familiar with the physical act of digital payment, articulating the systemic "role" and "evaluating" its use in writing is a significant leap for this demographic.
