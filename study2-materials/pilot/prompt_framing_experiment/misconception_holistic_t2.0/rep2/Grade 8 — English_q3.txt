Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a reading comprehension item in English, not a mathematics item. However, it requires cognitive skills such as extracting information from a text, summarizing a character's perspective, and articulating an abstract relationship (hobby vs. emotional expression).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Literal Interpretation: Students might believe a "hobby" is just a physical activity rather than an emotional outlet. This leads to an incomplete answer.
*   Misunderstanding "Mean": In Hindi, students might interpret "mean" as a definition rather than personal significance. This would lead to a dictionary-style answer rather than the character-focused response required.
*   Text-Copying: Students often copy the nearest sentence containing the word "drawing," which might not include the "feelings and thoughts" aspect required by the rubric.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   The concept of drawing is concrete and universally familiar to students across socio-economic backgrounds.
*   If the text uses simple vocabulary (e.g., "Anika loves drawing because..."), the literal extraction of the answer becomes simpler.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   English Proficiency: For Hindi-medium students, translating "expressing thoughts and feelings" into a grammatically correct English sentence is a high bar.
*   Open-ended Format: Without multiple-choice cues, students struggle to structure the sentence and often provide one-word answers (e.g., "Hobby") which would fail the rubric.
*   Abstract Rubric: The rubric requires two specific components (not just a hobby + way of expression). This "and" condition is difficult for students with limited vocabulary to satisfy simultaneously.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given the English language barrier for economically weaker students in Hindi-medium backgrounds, the jump from understanding the text to producing a two-part answer in written English is significant. Most students will likely identify it as a hobby but fail to articulate the "expressing feelings" aspect clearly enough for a full 1-point score.
