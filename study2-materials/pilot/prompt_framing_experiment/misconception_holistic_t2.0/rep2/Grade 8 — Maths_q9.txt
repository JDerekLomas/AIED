Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   Understanding and calculating "Discount" relative to Marked Price (MP).
*   Calculating "Selling Price" (SP) using MP and Discount.
*   Understanding and calculating "Cost Price" (CP) relative to Profit percentage and SP.
*   Solving a two-step word problem involving linear relationships (MP → SP → CP).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   Calculating profit on MP instead of CP (leads to incorrect CP).
*   Misunderstanding "Discount" as an addition rather than a deduction.
*   Inversion of the Profit formula (calculating 8% of SP and subtracting it from SP to find CP, which is algebraically incorrect).
*   Confusing the terminology (MP, SP, CP) due to language barriers.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   Familiar context (shopping/discount) found in NCERT textbooks.
*   Friendly numbers: ₹1200, 10%, and 8% are relatively easy to compute.
*   10% is a benchmark percentage most students can calculate mentally.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Multi-step reasoning: The rubric stops at SP, but the question asks for CP, requiring a second inverse calculation (CP = SP / 1.08).
*   Language barrier: Words like "allows," "marked price," and "even after" are often barriers for students transitioning from Hindi to English.
*   Abstract calculation: Dividing 1080 by 1.08 to find 1000 requires solid grasp of decimal division or fraction manipulation.
*   Open-ended: No options to work backward from or guide the student.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
The item is cognitively demanding for this demographic because it requires transitioning through two distinct financial identities (Discount and Profit) in English. While the numbers are "clean," the structural confusion between CP and MP frequently trips up Grade 8 students.
