**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Time Calculation:** Calculating the duration (elapsed time) between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm.
*   **Rate Multiplication:** Understanding the rate ($2^\circ\text{C}$ per hour) and multiplying it by the number of hours ($6 \times 2 = 12$).
*   **Addition:** Adding the temperature increase to the initial temperature ($30 + 12 = 42$).
*   **Unit Literacy:** Understanding temperature scales and time markers (am/pm).

**Step 2: Common Misconceptions**
*   **Subtracting Time across 12-hour markers:** Students often treat 4:00 and 10:00 as pure numbers ($10 - 4 = 6$), which happens to lead to the correct duration here, but others might calculate $10$ to $4$ as $4$ hours or get confused by the 12-hour clock (Thinking: 10, 11, 12... then 1, 2, 3, 4).
*   **Direct Operation (Single Step):** Students may simply add 30 + 2 + 4 + 10 without understanding the rate-time relationship. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Off-by-one Error:** Counting the hours (10 to 11 is one, 11 to 12 is two...) sometimes results in counting 7 hours instead of 6 if they count both endpoints.

**Step 3: Factors making the item easier**
*   **Context:** Temperature and cities (Jodhpur) are familiar contexts for Indian students.
*   **Simple Numbers:** The numbers (30, 2, 4, 10) are low and the multiplication is basic (2-times table).
*   **Coincidence:** Subtracting 10 from 4 using a 12-hour mental jump or simply subtracting 4 from 10 can coincidentally result in the number "6," leading to the correct step even with faulty logic.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** The phrase "per hour" and the am/pm transition are in English. For Hindi-medium students, the linguistic switch for "increases" and "evening" can be a barrier.
*   **Multi-step logic:** It is a three-step problem: Find duration $\rightarrow$ find increase $\rightarrow$ find final total. Grade 6 students often struggle to sequence operations without prompts.
*   **Open-ended:** There are no multiple-choice options to "back-solve" or provide a scaffold.

**Step 5: Holistic Weighting**
While the math is simple, the transition from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm is a common "trap" for students from economically weaker backgrounds who may not use analog/digital clocks regularly in a formal school manner. The English phrasing "per hour" and "at 4:00 in the evening" poses a significant reading comprehension hurdle for this specific demographic.
