Step 1: The item requires an understanding of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, specifically the distinction between face value (5) and place value ($5 \times 100$). The student must identify the position of the digit (units, tens, hundreds) and translate that into a numerical value or a positional name.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Confusing "place value" with "face value" (answering 5).
- Confusing "place value" with "place name" (though the rubric allows both, some students may misinterpret the term entirely).
- Incorrectly counting positions from left to right instead of right to left (answering 50).
- Confusing "hundreds" with "hundredths" (though less common in Grade 6 before decimal proficiency).
All these misconceptions would lead to an incorrect answer here.

Step 3: Ease factors: The number 7560 is small and does not include a zero in the target place, which reduces confusion. The digit 5 is in a central position. In the Indian curriculum (NCERT/State Boards), place value is heavily drilled from Grade 3 onwards. The term "Place Value" (स्थानीय मान - Sthānīya māna) is a standard vocabulary item familiar even to Hindi-medium students.

Step 4: Hardship factors: The question is in English; for a student with limited proficiency, the phrase "place value" is a technical term they must recognize. The open-ended format prevents guessing.

Step 5: Considering the heavy emphasis on rote procedural fluency in place value within the Indian school system, most Grade 6 students—even from economically weaker backgrounds—will have mastered this specific task, as it is a foundational skill frequently assessed in lower grades.
