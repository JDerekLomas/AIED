Step 1: Identifying the concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, the underlying cognitive skills include memory retrieval, historical categorization (distinguishing the "medieval period" from ancient or modern), and basic writing skills in English (as per the school context).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Anachronism:** Students often struggle to distinguish between time periods (e.g., naming a 20th-century figure or a mythological figure from the Vedic period). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Geographic Displacement:** Students might name famous national figures (e.g., Akbar, Shivaji, or Ashoka) who were not "from Rajasthan." This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Spelling/Language Barrier:** Given the limited English proficiency, students might know the name but fail to write it legibly or recognize the English phrasing of "medieval period."

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Cultural Familiarity:** Maharana Pratap and Prithviraj Chauhan are folk heroes in Rajasthan; their stories are frequently told in households and local culture, making them highly "retrievable" in memory.
*   **Simplicity:** The question asks for "any two," allowing students to choose the ones they know best.
*   **Low Stake Rubric:** The rubric suggests a very low threshold for credit (mentioning one correct name earns a score).

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **The Language Barrier:** Interpreting "medieval period" in English may be difficult for Hindi-medium background students who might only know the term as "Madhayakalin."
*   **Recall vs. Recognition:** As an open-ended question without options, it requires active recall rather than simple recognition.
*   **Narrow Geography:** Restricting the answer to kings "from Rajasthan" excludes other famous kings students might know from the broader Indian context.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given that these specific kings are regional icons and central to the Grade 6 Rajasthan board curriculum, even students with limited English are likely to recognize the names and attempt them. However, the requirement to write them in English and the specific temporal classification ("medieval") will provide some barrier.
