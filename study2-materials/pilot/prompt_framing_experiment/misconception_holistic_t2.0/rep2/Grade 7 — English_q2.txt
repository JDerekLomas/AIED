Step 1: This is a literacy and reading comprehension task based on the classic story "The Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy. It requires identifying cause-and-effect relationships within a narrative and expressing a reason in English.

Step 2: Common misconceptions in this context (transferring "mathematical" logic to linguistic logic) include:
- Narrative Confusion: Mixing up the king's motivation (finding answers) with his action (the reward itself). This leads to incorrect answers.
- Linguistic "Matching" Error: Copying a sentence from the text that contains the word "reward" but does not explain the *reason* for it. This leads to incorrect answers.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The story "The Three Questions" is a staple in Grade 7 NCERT/State Board English textbooks in India.
- The concept of a "reward" (inaam) for a task is culturally universal and easily understood.
- The "why" question structure is the most common reading comprehension format.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- English Proficiency: For Hindi-medium/EWS students, expressing the "why" requires constructing a sentence with "because" or "to," which is harder than identifying a name or date.
- Open-ended format: No multiple-choice options to trigger memory; students must retrieve the information from the text and formulate a response.
- Reading comprehension barrier: If the student cannot decode the sentence in the text that links "reward" to "three questions," they will fail despite knowing the story.

Step 5: Considering the prevalence of this specific story in the Indian curriculum and the relatively straightforward narrative link between "questions" and "reward," many students will recall the plot even if their English grammar is weak. However, limited English proficiency for EWS/Hindi-medium students remains a significant barrier to formal correctness.
