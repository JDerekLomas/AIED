Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science item. No mathematical concepts are required. The skills required include comparison/differentiation, classification of service sectors, and constructing a short descriptive argument.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
1. "Private healthcare is always better quality": While often true in the Indian context, students might fail to provide an "argument" or "example" if they see this as an absolute fact rather than a service difference.
2. "Public healthcare is free": Students may miss the nuance that it is tax-funded or low-cost, leading to vague answers.
On this specific item: Vague descriptions (e.g., "Private is good, Public is bad") would fail the rubric requirement for two specific features/examples.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- Familiarity: Students from economically weaker sections often have direct, frequent experience with government hospitals (OHS/dispensaries) and local private clinics (RMPs or small nursing homes).
- Direct Experience: The "overcrowding" or "affordability" arguments are based on lived reality.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- Language barrier: English-medium testing for Hindi-background students makes "evaluate," "public/private," and "valid argument" high-barrier vocabulary.
- Format: It is open-ended.
- Rubric Rigor: The rubric requires two specific features plus examples for only 1 mark. A student might provide one strong difference and get 0.
- Abstract Terms: Concepts like "Public" and "Private" may be conceptually understood but difficult to label in English.

Step 5: Estimate the proportion.
While the lived experience is high, the language barrier for "evaluating" in English combined with the requirement for two features for a single point makes this difficult for the target demographic.
