Step 1: Identify the linguistic and grammatical concepts required.
The student must understand the concept of a "verb phrase," which requires distinguishing between a lexical verb ("playing") and an auxiliary/helping verb ("are"). They must also be able to separate the action from the subject ("children") and the object ("football").

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **The Verb is a Single Word:** Many students in Indian government schools are taught that the "verb" is the "doing word." They likely identify "playing" but exclude "are." This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Subject/Object Confusion:** Students with limited English proficiency often struggle with sentence structure and might include the noun ("football") as part of the action. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Literal Translation:** Hindi-medium students might process the sentence via translation. In Hindi, the auxiliary often comes at the end, which can lead to confusion in English syntax.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** The sentence describes a common activity (playing football) using very simple vocabulary.
*   **Present Continuous Tense:** This is one of the earliest and most practiced tense forms in the Grade 6 curriculum.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
*   **No Multiple Choice:** The lack of options makes it harder for students who "half-know" the answer or might have guessed "playing" without considering the phrase.
*   **Language Barrier:** The term "verb phrase" is technical. Even if a student knows the action, they may not know that "are" is included in the grammatical definition of a "phrase."
*   **Hindi-English Interference:** In many Hindi-medium contexts, the distinction between a verb and a verb phrase is rarely emphasized.

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.
While the sentence is simple, the specific grammatical term "verb phrase" is a significant hurdle. Most students will likely identify only "playing" or the entire predicate "playing football," falling short of the specific rubric requirements.
