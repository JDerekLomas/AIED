**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Angle Sum Property of a Triangle:** Understanding that the sum of interior angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$.
*   **Arithmetic Skills:** Ability to add two given angles (likely two-digit numbers) and subtract the sum from $180$.
*   **Geometric Literacy:** Recognizing a closed figure as a triangle and understanding what "$\angle x$" represents.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Complementary vs. Supplementary:** Thinking angles must add to $90^\circ$ (Incorrect).
*   **Right-Angle Assumption:** Assuming a "looks like" right angle is $90^\circ$ even if not marked (Incorrect).
*   **Incorrect Base Sum:** Some students mistakenly think all triangle sums are $360^\circ$ (similar to quadrilaterals).
*   **Linear Pair Misapplication:** Trying to subtract a given angle from $180$ directly without adding the other two.

**Step 3: Factors that make the item easier**
*   **Familiarity:** Finding the third angle of a triangle is a standard, highly practiced exercise in the Grade 6 Indian NCERT/State Board syllabus.
*   **Simple Numbers:** Typically, such test items use multiples of 10 or 5, making computation straightforward.
*   **Visual Representation:** A clear figure reduces the reliance on English language proficiency.

**Step 4: Factors that make it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** While the question is short, if the "given figure" is complex or the instruction is only in English, Hindi-medium students may hesitate.
*   **Multi-step Reasoning:** Requires a two-step calculation (addition then subtraction).
*   **Lack of Choices:** Being an open-ended question, students cannot guess or use the process of elimination.
*   **Rubric Rigidity:** A score of $0.5$ suggests a very specific part of a larger problem; if it's an isolated question, the narrow margin for error makes it "all or nothing."

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
Given that the "Angle Sum Property" is a foundational drill in Grade 6 across Indian government schools, and the computation involved is usually basic, most students recognize the pattern. However, common errors in subtraction (regrouping from $180$) and the linguistic disconnect for EWS students often result in a significant portion of the class making minor errors.
