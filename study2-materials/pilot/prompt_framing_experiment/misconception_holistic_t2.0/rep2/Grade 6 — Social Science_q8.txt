Step 1: The question is labeled as "Social Science," yet it requires specific cognitive and structural skills typically evaluated in educational analysis: list-making (categorization), prioritizing, and deductive reasoning. Linguistically, it requires structural English (explaining "importance") rather than just identifying keywords.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include confusing "rights" with "duties" (e.g., "studying hard" is a right) and blurring the line between legal rights (Right to Education) and general moral treatment. Because the rubric allows for "commonly understood entitlements," some misconceptions about formal law might still lead to a "correct" answer, though students often struggle to articulate "importance" beyond a superficial level.

Step 3: Ease factors include the high degree of repetition of the topic "Fundamental Rights" in the Indian NCERT/SCERT curriculum. The rubric is very generous for a 1-mark question (usually a question requiring two identifications AND an explanation would be worth 2 or 3 marks). Familiarity with terms like "Right to Education" (RTE) due to local school campaigns makes the identification step easier.

Step 4: Difficulty factors are significant for this demographic. The "Explain" prompt is high-stakes for a student with limited English proficiency; they may know the concept in Hindi but lack the vocabulary to define "importance." The question is "double-barreled" (Two rights + Explain one), which is cognitively demanding for a 6th grader in a 1-mark format. The open-ended nature and the need for written sentences (rather than multiple-choice) significantly increase the failure rate.

Step 5: While the rubric is lenient, the combination of linguistic barriers, the multi-step nature of the task for a single mark, and the abstract nature of "importance" will prevent many students from completing all parts of the prompt correctly.
