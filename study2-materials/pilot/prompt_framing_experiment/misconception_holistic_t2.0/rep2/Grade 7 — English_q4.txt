Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a reading comprehension/critical thinking item, not a mathematics item. However, in the context of cognitive processing for this grade level, it requires identifying a pattern (the three questions) and applying a value judgment (utility in "real life").

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- Misinterpretation of "Real Life": Students may struggle to bridge the gap between a folkloric "King" context and their own modern socio-economic reality.
- Language interference: Hindi-medium students often confuse "Do you think..." (opinion) with "What happened..." (recall).
- Specific to this item: Students might think there is only one "correct" book-based answer rather than an open-ended "valid reason," leading to silence/blank answers.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- The context of the story ("Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy) is a standard, highly emphasized part of the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum in India.
- The rubric is generous ("Any valid reason").

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- English Proficiency: Expressing a "reason" in a second language is significantly harder than selecting a multiple-choice option for students from economically weaker sections.
- Open-ended format: No scaffolding is provided.
- Critical thinking: Requires moving beyond rote memorization to application.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically, estimate what proportion of students at this grade level would produce the fully correct answer.
While the story is familiar, the requirement to formulate an original sentence in English ("Give one reason") acts as a major barrier for students with limited English proficiency. Many will provide partial or grammatically broken responses that might not meet the "valid reason" threshold depending on the strictness of the evaluator.
