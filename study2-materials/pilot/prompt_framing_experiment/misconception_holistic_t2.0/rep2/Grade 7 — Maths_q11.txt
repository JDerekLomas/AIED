Step 1: Skills include data interpretation, determining a mathematical scale, spatial reasoning for graph construction, and identifying extremes (max/min).
Step 2: Common misconceptions include inconsistent intervals on the Y-axis (e.g., 80, 90, 95 instead of 10, 20, 30), swapping X and Y axes, or failing to start at zero. These would lead to a loss of the single mark according to the rubric.
Step 3: Ease factors: The context of school classes is highly familiar. Comparing numbers for part (b) is a lower-grade skill.
Step 4: Hardship factors: Part (a) is high-effort. For students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds, the word "appropriate scale" is a technical term that may not be fully internalized. Lack of graph paper in government school settings often leads to measurement errors using a standard ruler. The rubric is "all or nothing" (Maximum 1 mark), meaning any minor error in labeling or scale consistency results in zero marks.
Step 5: While identifying max/min is easy, the rigorous requirement of drawing a fully correct, labeled bar graph with a consistent scale is a high barrier for many Grade 7 students in this demographic.
