**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   Understanding the definition of probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.
*   Basic addition (summing 4 and 6 to find the total outcomes).
*   Correctly identifying "favorable outcomes" based on the specific color requested (black).
*   Expressing the result as a fraction ($4/10$ or $2/5$).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Part-to-Part Ratio:** Students might express probability as favorable:unfavorable ($4/6$). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Equiprobability Bias:** Thinking every outcome (Black or White) is equally likely regardless of count ($1/2$). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Small Sample Bias:** Misunderstanding "at random" as meaning the results cannot be calculated precisely.
*   **Integer Misconception:** Some students believe probability must be a whole number, leading them to simply answer "4".

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Familiar Context:** Marbles/balls in a bag is a standard, concrete example used in almost all Indian NCERT textbooks.
*   **Friendly Numbers:** 4 and 6 sum to 10, which makes mental calculation and decimal conversion (0.4) easy.
*   **Language:** The phrasing is standard and follows the patterns used in Hindi-to-English translations commonly found in State/National curricula.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options, students cannot "work backward" or use elimination; they must generate the formula from memory.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, terms like "drawn at random" and "favorable" can be intimidating if they haven't been taught the English keywords, though "Probability" (Prayikta) is usually well-drilled.
*   **Simplification:** If the teacher expects $2/5$ but the student stops at $4/10$, the lack of clarity on whether a non-simplified fraction is acceptable might cause hesitation.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
In Grade 8 across Indian government schools, this is considered a "Level 1" (Knowledge/Recall) question. While language barriers exist, the "totaling" of two numbers is a heavily rehearsed procedure in the probability unit. The most common error is the "part-to-part" ratio ($4/6$), but the simplicity of the numbers (summing to 10) helps a significant majority find the correct path.
