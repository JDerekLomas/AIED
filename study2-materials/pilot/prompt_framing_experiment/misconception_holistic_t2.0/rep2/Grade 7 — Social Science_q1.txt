Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, it relies on underlying mathematical reasoning related to temporal sequences: 
*   **Ordinality:** Understanding the "first, then, next" structure of time.
*   **Measurement of Time:** The ability to treat time as a measurable quantity (linear measurement).
*   **Comparison:** Comparing different values on a timeline to determine duration or intervals.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Circular vs. Linear Time:** Students often view time as seasonal/cyclical rather than a linear progression of specific dates. (Potential for incorrect answer).
*   **Large Magnitude Perception:** In Grade 7, distinguishing between 500 years ago and 2000 years ago can be abstract; students may view all history as a singular "old" category. (Unlikely to affect this specific item).
*   **Confusion between BC/AD or BCE/CE:** Difficulty with "counting backward" in history. (Would not prevent them from stating dates are "important for order").

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Foundational Topic:** This is the opening chapter of the Grade 7 History syllabus ("How, When and Where"), making it a highly rehearsed concept.
*   **Generous Rubric:** The rubric allows for multiple simple interpretations (order, sequence, or "when it happened").
*   **Relatability:** Students use dates in their daily school lives (attendance, exams).

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the English command "Explain the importance" is more complex than "What is...".
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options, students must construct a sentence, which is difficult for those with limited English proficiency.
*   **Abstract Reasoning:** Explaining *why* a system is used is cognitively more demanding than simply using the system.

Step 5: Holistically, while the concept is basic, the requirement to "explain" in English for students with limited proficiency and from EWS backgrounds poses a significant hurdle to achieving the full 1 mark. However, many will provide the rote-memorized response from the NCERT textbook.
