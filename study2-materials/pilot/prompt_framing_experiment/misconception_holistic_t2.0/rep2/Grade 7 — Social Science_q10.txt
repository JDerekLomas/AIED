Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
There are no mathematical concepts involved in this question. It is a subjective, descriptive question in Social Science requiring historical recall, understanding of cause-and-effect, and writing skills.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
The primary misconceptions here are historical rather than mathematical:
1. Conflating the Maurya Empire with later empires (Gupta/Mughal). (Leads to incorrect answer).
2. Believing Ashoka was a pacifist from the start rather than after Kalinga. (Might still lead to a correct answer regarding his transformation).
3. Mistaking "Dhamma" for a strictly religious conversion to Buddhism rather than a code of social ethics. (Minor impact on this specific rubric).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
- Content familiarity: Ashoka is a staple of the Grade 6/7 Indian curriculum and is often treated as a "heroic" figure, making the story memorable.
- Bilingual context: In Hindi-medium or regional backgrounds, students likely know the terms "Kalinga Yuddh" (Kalinga War) and "Dhamma," which translates well even with limited English.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Linguistic barrier: Writing an explanation in English is difficult for students with limited proficiency, especially for abstract concepts like "ethical governance" or "significance."
- Open-ended format: No cues or options are provided to trigger memory.
- Rubric Rigidity: To get the full 1 mark, students must provide two distinct aspects. Writing "He was a good king" would not satisfy the rubric.
- Economic/Educational disadvantage: Students may lack the supplementary reading or sophisticated vocabulary to express "significance" clearly in writing.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the subject matter is well-known, the requirement to produce a multi-point written explanation in English—given the background of the students—poses a significant barrier to earning the full mark according to a formal rubric.
