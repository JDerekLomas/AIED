Step 1: The concepts required are biological/scientific rather than mathematical. However, students must apply logical categorization and binary contrast. They need to understand the prefix-based vocabulary: "auto-" (self) and "hetero-" (other).

Step 2: 
- "Plants breathe in CO2 and breathe out Oxygen" (Misunderstanding gas exchange): This would not affect this specific item as it focuses on nutrition/food source.
- "All plants are autotrophs" (Ignoring parasitic/insectivorous plants): This might lead to a slightly imprecise answer but would likely be marked correct in this rubric.
- Confusing "Heterotroph" with "Herbivore": Students might think only animals that eat plants are heterotrophs. This could lead to a correct but limited example.
- Human-centric misconception: Thinking humans are autotrophs because "we cook our own food." This is a major misconception that leads to an incorrect answer on this specific item.

Step 3: This is a "core" concept in the Grade 7 Science NCERT textbook (Chapter 1), taught early in the year and frequently repeated. The term "Auto" (like auto-rickshaw) is familiar, and "food" is a concrete context. The requirement of one example is straightforward.

Step 4: The primary difficulty is the language barrier. "Differentiate" is a complex English verb for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. The terms "autotrophic" and "heterotrophic" are long, phonetically difficult, and Greek-rooted. Students might understand the concept but struggle to recall or spell the technical terms. The open-ended format requires sentence construction in English, which is a significant hurdle for these students.

Step 5: While the concept is foundational, the combination of writing in a second language and the specific academic vocabulary required for a full mark makes it challenging for this demographic.
