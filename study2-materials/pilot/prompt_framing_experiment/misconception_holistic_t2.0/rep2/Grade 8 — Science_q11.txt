Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   **Data Interpretation:** Reading and comparing values in a table.
*   **Comparing Magnitudes:** Identifying the maximum value in a set of numerical data.
*   **Ordering:** Ranking materials based on the rate of expansion.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Reverse Logic:** Some students may confuse "expands the most" with "expands the least" (leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Material properties vs. Data:** Students might choose Copper for (a) simply because it is a familiar metal, ignoring the table (leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Confusing sub-questions:** Since the rubric only grades part (a) for 1 mark, students who get (b) or (c) right but (a) wrong will fail. Conversely, some might skip (a) to answer the more "practical" (b) or (c).

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
*   **Direct extraction:** Part (a) is a simple look-up task from a provided table.
*   **Familiar context:** Expansion of metals and railway tracks are standard Grade 8 NCERT science examples.
*   **Low computational load:** No calculations are required; it is purely observational.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds may struggle with the English phrasing "expands the most" or "recommend."
*   **Question Density:** Asking three distinct questions for only 1 mark (according to the rubric) is confusing. Students may lose focus or think they need to write a long paragraph.
*   **Distraction:** Parts (b) and (c) require conceptual scientific reasoning rather than table reading, which may overwhelm a student with limited English proficiency.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
The task of identifying the "most" from a table is a basic skill. Even with limited English, the word "most" and the table format are generally recognizable. However, the presence of three questions for a single mark and the linguistic transition from Hindi to English will cause a significant drop-off.
