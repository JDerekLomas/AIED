Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a reading comprehension item rather than a mathematical one. However, in the context of a 6th-grade student from an EWS background, it requires the ability to extract literal information from a text, understand the "Who" interrogative, and recall specific nouns (subject-predicate identification).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
While not "mathematical" misconceptions, students at this level often struggle with:
- **Wh- word confusion:** Mistaking "Who" for "Where" or "What," leading them to describe the book rather than the character.
- **Literalism vs. Inference:** Students might answer based on real-world knowledge (e.g., "no one lives in books") if they lack the English fluency to process the "magical" context.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
- The context (a fairy) is a globally recognized cultural trope.
- The rubric is generous, accepting single words ("fairy") rather than requiring a complete, grammatically correct sentence.
- The vocabulary "lived inside" is relatively simple compared to more academic English.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- **Open-ended format:** Without options, students must retrieve the vocabulary word "fairy" from memory and spell it, which is difficult for Hindi-medium learners.
- **Language Barrier:** For students from economically weaker sections, exposure to English-language storybooks is often low, making the "magical book" premise abstract.
- **Transliteration/Spelling:** Students might know the answer but struggle to write "fairy," potentially writing "pari" (Hindi word) or incorrect phonetic spellings that may not be credited depending on the strictness of the teacher.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
The item is a straightforward literal recall question. In the Indian government school context, rote learning of "question-answers" from textbooks is common. If this question is based on a prescribed textbook story, the success rate will be higher. However, as an unseen comprehension item for ESL learners with limited vocabulary, the lack of choices will hinder many.
