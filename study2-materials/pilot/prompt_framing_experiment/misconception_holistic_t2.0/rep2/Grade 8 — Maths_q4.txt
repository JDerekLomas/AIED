**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Transposition/Cross-multiplication:** Understanding that multiplying both sides by the denominators (3 and 5) eliminates the fractions.
*   **Distributive Property:** Correcting multiplying the constant into the binomial, e.g., $5(x-5) = 5x - 25$.
*   **Variable Isolation:** Moving $x$ terms to one side and constants to the other.
*   **Arithmetic with Integers:** Managing negative signs during subtraction and transposition.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Additive vs. Multiplicative Inverse:** Students might try to "move" the 3 or 5 by adding/subtracting them instead of multiplying. (*Will lead to incorrect answer.*)
*   **Incomplete Distribution:** Multiplying the constant only by the $x$ and not the second term (e.g., $5x - 5 = 3x - 3$). (*Will lead to incorrect answer.*)
*   **Sign Errors:** Forgetting that moving $-25$ across the equals sign makes it $+25$. (*Will lead to incorrect answer.*)
*   **Denominator Misconception:** Thinking the denominators can simply be ignored or subtracted from the numerators. (*Will lead to incorrect answer.*)

**Step 3: Factors that make it easier**
*   **Simple Integers:** The numbers (3, 5) are small and familiar.
*   **Symmetry:** The structure of the equation is balanced/parallel, which is a common "textbook" format practiced heavily in NCERT curricula.
*   **Limited English Requirement:** The mathematical notation is universal; the Hindi-medium background is not a barrier here because there is no word-problem context to decode.

**Step 4: Factors that make it harder**
*   **Step-heavy:** A single error in any of the four steps (cross-multiply, distribute, transpose, divide) results in a zero.
*   **No Multiple Choice:** There are no cues or "reverse-engineering" options (plugging in answers) common in MCQ formats.
*   **Negative Signs:** Both sides involve subtraction, which increases the likelihood of operational errors for students with weak foundations in signed numbers.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
In Indian government school contexts, "cross-multiplication" is often taught as a mechanical "rule" (the "X" method). While many students can set up the first step, the common pitfalls of the distributive property (e.g., $5x - 5$ instead of $5x - 25$) and transposition signs significantly lower the success rate. For Grade 8 students in EWS/Hindi-medium contexts, this remains a "medium-difficulty" algebraic task.
