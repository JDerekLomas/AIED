**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Data interpretation:** Reading and comparing values in a table.
*   **Inverse Relationship:** Understanding that in the context of "fastest," a *lower* numerical value (less time) represents a *higher* rate of speed.
*   **Logical Reasoning/Scientific Explanation:** Connecting the presence of a solute (salt) to the physical process of evaporation (vapor pressure lowering/surface area occupancy).

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **"Higher is Better/Faster":** Students often associate larger numbers with "more" or "faster." On this item, this would lead a student to choose Liquid C (80 mins) as the fastest, resulting in an incorrect answer.
*   **Unit Neglect:** If a student ignores "minutes" and views numbers as raw scores, they might default to choosing the highest number.
*   **Solute Confusion:** Students might believe adding salt makes a liquid "stronger" and therefore should evaporate faster, or conversely, that it simply "gets thicker" without being able to articulate the mechanism.

**Step 3: Factors making the item easier**
*   **Familiar Context:** Water and Salt Solution are common household concepts.
*   **Simple Numbers:** The values (15, 45, 80) are distinct and easy to rank.
*   **Part (a) Accessibility:** Part (a) only requires a one-word answer and simple data identification.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **English Proficiency:** For Hindi-medium students, words like "observed," "evaporate," and "conditions" can be barriers to understanding the setup.
*   **Inverse Correlation Logic:** The "Less Time = Faster" logic is a significant cognitive hurdle for Grade 7 students.
*   **Open-ended "Why":** Part (b) requires generating a sentence in English. Students may understand the concept (e.g., "Salt gets in the way") but lack the vocabulary to explain it, leading to zero points on the second part of the rubric.
*   **Contextual unfamiliarity with Petrol:** Depending on their daily lives, some students may not know how fast petrol evaporates compared to water.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
While many students will struggle with the English explanation in part (b), a significant number will likely correctly identify Liquid A for part (a). However, the "large number = fastest" misconception remains a dominant error in this age group, and the linguistic barrier for EWS/Hindi-medium students in an English-language assessment significantly lowers the success rate for a "fully correct" answer (both parts).
