Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While labeled "Science," the mathematical/logical skills involved include categorization, binary classification, and attribute listing. In a multidisciplinary sense for Grade 6, it requires identifying set properties.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- **Motion equals life:** Students may think clouds or fire are living because they move. (Likely to lead to incorrect characteristics).
- **Invisibility of processes:** Students may fail to recognize plants as living because they don't see them "breathe" or "eat." (Might lead to incomplete answers).
- **Life = Humans/Animals only:** Excluding plants or microscopic organisms. (May lead to incorrect examples, though the question asks for characteristics).

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- The context is highly familiar and is a foundational topic taught from early primary years.
- The rubric is extremely lenient (only requiring ONE characteristic despite the prompt asking for two).
- Basic vocabulary (grow, eat, move) is common even among English Language Learners (ELL).

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium/EWS students, the word "Differentiate" or "Characteristics" might be intimidating or misunderstood.
- **Open-ended format:** Requires recall and sentence construction rather than recognition.
- **Formatting mismatch:** The prompt asks for two characteristics for each, but the rubric only awards points for one.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically.
Given that this is a core topic and the rubric is exceptionally generous (awarding 0.5 points for just one valid characteristic of living things), most students will successfully identify a basic trait like "they grow" or "they need food," even with limited English.
