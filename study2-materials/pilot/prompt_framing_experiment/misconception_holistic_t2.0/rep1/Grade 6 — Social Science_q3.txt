Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
Strictly speaking, this is a Social Science/General Knowledge item, not a mathematics item. No mathematical computation, spatial geometry, or data analysis is required beyond basic observation and descriptive literacy.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
A common "misconception" (or error) here is misidentifying the visual iconography. Students might confuse Gangaur with other idol-based processions like Teej or Durga Puja. However, because the item asks for "this picture" and we must assume the picture is culturally distinct, the barrier is visual literacy rather than conceptual logic.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
The context is highly familiar (Rajasthan-based curriculum). For students from economically weaker sections in North India, religious and regional festivals are part of daily lived experience. Using Hindi terminology in an English medium test might actually be easier for these students as "Gangaur" is a vernacular term.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- **English Proficiency:** For Hindi-medium backgrounds, the second part of the question ("describe how people celebrate it") requires sentence construction in English, which is a significant barrier.
- **Maximum Score Discrepancy:** The rubric only awards points for the name (Gangaur), but the prompt asks for a description. Students might get bogged down trying to write a description they can't translate, or they might provide the correct name but fail if the grader strictly enforces the "description" part (though the rubric ignores it).
- **Open-ended format:** There are no cues or options to jog memory.

Step 5: Holistically estimate the proportion of correct answers.
While the cultural knowledge is high, the barrier of English language instruction and the specific identification of regional festivals in a formal test setting usually results in a moderate success rate for Grade 6 students in this demographic.
