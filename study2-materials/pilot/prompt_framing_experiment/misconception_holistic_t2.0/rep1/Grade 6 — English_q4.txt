Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a vocabulary and reading comprehension item in an English language assessment, not a mathematics item. However, in terms of logic and pattern matching, it requires:
*   Scanning/Searching: The ability to scan a text for a semantic match.
*   Synonym Retrieval: Connecting a multi-word definition ("shining brightly") to a single target word ("glowing").
*   Contextual Verification: Ensuring the identified word appears within the provided text.

Step 2: List common misconceptions students at this grade level hold.
*   Over-generalization: A student might pick a word related to light but not "brightly" (e.g., "sun" or "lamp"). *Likely incorrect.*
*   Visual Association: Choosing a word that "looks" like the target (e.g., words ending in -ing) without checking meaning. *Likely incorrect.*
*   Language Interference (Hindi/ESL): Translating "shining brightly" into Hindi (chamkilā) and then looking for a word that sounds similar in English or guessing a different English word they know better (e.g., "beautiful"). *Likely incorrect.*

Step 3: Factors making the item easier:
*   The definition "shining brightly" is composed of basic English vocabulary that even second-language learners usually acquire early.
*   "Glowing" is a high-frequency word often introduced in primary school stories.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   Limited English Proficiency (LEP): For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, nuances between "shining" and "glowing" might be lost.
*   Open-ended/Supply-type: There are no options to choose from; the student must locate the word within the text.
*   Spelling: The student must transcribe the word correctly from the passage.
*   Vocabulary Depth: Students often struggle with synonyms compared to direct literal questions.

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors:
For students from economically weaker sections in government schools with limited English exposure, vocabulary-based "find the word" questions are significantly harder than literal information retrieval questions (e.g., "Where did he go?"). While the concepts are basic, the language barrier and the open-ended nature of finding synonyms in a foreign language lead to lower success rates.
