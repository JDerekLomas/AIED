**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Time Calculation:** Determining the elapsed time between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm (converting 12-hour clock format).
*   **Rate/Unitary Method:** Understanding "2°C per hour" as a multiplier.
*   **Arithmetic:** Multiplication ($6 \text{ hours} \times 2^\circ\text{C}$) and Addition ($30^\circ\text{C} + 12^\circ\text{C}$).
*   **Word Problem Comprehension:** Mapping linguistic cues to mathematical operations.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Linear subtraction of time:** Subtracting $10 - 4 = 6$ (by coincidence leads to the right time interval, but often results in calculation errors).
*   **Miscounting hours:** Counting the start or end hour twice (e.g., thinking 10 am to 4 pm is 7 hours). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Additive vs. Multiplicative increase:** Students might just add 2 once ($30+2=32$). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Confusion with AM/PM:** Treating 4:00 pm as 4:00 in the morning (which would lead to -6 hours or complex calculations).

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Familiar Context:** Jodhpur is a known city in India; temperature is a relatable concept.
*   **Friendly Numbers:** 10, 4, 30, and 2 are easy to work with and do not require complex long-form multiplication.
*   **Coincidence factor:** Subtracting 10 and 4 ($10-4=6$) accidentally gives the correct elapsed time, even if the student's logic is flawed.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** Terms like "increases by... per hour" may be difficult for students with limited English proficiency.
*   **12-Hour Cycle transition:** Crossing the 12:00 noon mark is a frequent stumbling block for Grade 6 students.
*   **Multi-step process:** Requires time calculation $\rightarrow$ multiplication $\rightarrow$ final addition. Each step is an opportunity for error.
*   **Open-ended:** No options to guide the student's reasoning or flag a calculation error.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
While the math is fundamental, the combination of multi-step logic, the potential for English language misinterpretation, and the specific challenge of the AM/PM transition (noon barrier) makes this moderately difficult for students from the described demographic.
