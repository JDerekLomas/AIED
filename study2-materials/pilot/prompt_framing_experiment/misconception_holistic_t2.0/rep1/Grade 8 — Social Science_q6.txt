Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, it requires cognitive processing skills such as categorization (identifying factors), cause-and-effect reasoning, and the ability to synthesize historical narratives into distinct "points."

Step 2: Common misconceptions include conflating "Nationalism" with "Patriotism" (treating it as an innate feeling rather than a political movement), confusing the French Revolution (18th century) with 19th-century developments, and the "Great Man" fallacy (attributing growth only to individuals like Napoleon or Mazzini rather than structural factors). Misunderstanding the timeframe (19th century) would likely lead to an incorrect or historically displaced answer.

Step 3: Ease factors: "French Revolution" is a high-frequency keyword in Indian Grade 8 NCERT/State curricula. Many students rely on rote memorization of standard textbook headings, and this question mirrors common "back-of-chapter" exercises.

Step 4: Difficulty factors: The linguistic barrier is significant for Hindi-medium students (words like "sentiment," "contributed," and "factors" are high-academic English). The requirement to "Identify two" but only get "1 mark" with a "brief explanation" creates a high effort-to-reward ratio. The open-ended format without options prevents guessing.

Step 5: Given the high dependence on rote memorization in these demographics and the language barrier associated with "briefly explains," many students might identify a factor but fail to provide a coherent explanation in English, or confuse the specific European context with the Indian National Movement.
