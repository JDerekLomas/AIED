Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, the underlying mathematical literacy includes understanding of currency exchange, basic arithmetic related to transactions (digital vs. cash), and the abstract concept of value representation. Students must understand the scaling of economy through monetary systems.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
1. "Money equals physical wealth": Students may not understand money as a medium of exchange but rather as a physical resource. This might lead to vague answers.
2. "Digital money is 'free' or separate from real money": A lack of understanding of electronic transfers.
3. Confusion between "price" and "value."
On this specific item, these misconceptions would likely lead to a score of 0 because the question requires "analysis" and "evaluation," not just naming.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
The context of digital money (UPI, BHIM, Paytm) is highly visible in India, even among economically weaker sections, due to the widespread nature of digital payments. This provides a familiar entry point for the "Evaluate" portion of the question.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
1. Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students with limited English, complex verbs like "Analyze" and "Evaluate" are highly academic and difficult to decode.
2. Cognitive Demand: This is a high-level Bloom’s Taxonomy task (Analyze/Evaluate) for a 12-year-old.
3. Writing Burden: As an open-ended question in a second language, many students will struggle to articulate "economic development" even if they understand the concept.
4. Rubric Strictness: Despite the 1-mark value, "analyzing role in development" is a sophisticated expectation for Grade 7.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
The mismatch between the high-level cognitive command (Analyze/Evaluate) and the linguistic barriers of the target demographic will result in many students providing "everyday" answers that may not meet the "significant role in development" threshold of the rubric.
