Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science item. No mathematical concepts are required. The task involves civic literacy, identifying causal relationships between political structures (Parliament) and democratic values (representation/law), and synthesizing a written response.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- **Conflation of Powers:** Students may believe the Prime Minister or President "is" the government and makes all rules, missing the role of the legislative assembly. (Would lead to incorrect answer).
- **Parliament as a Building:** Viewing it solely as a physical landmark in Delhi rather than a functional institution. (Would lead to incorrect answer).
- **Election = Democracy:** Believing that once a vote is cast, the democratic process ends, failing to understand how Parliament represents that "voice" continuously. (Would lead to an incomplete or incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
- **Familiar Context:** Democracy and "Sansad" (Parliament) are frequent topics in the Grade 8 NCERT curriculum.
- **Rote Learning:** This specific question is a "textbook" style question, and many students from this background are trained to memorize standard definitions of Parliament.
- **Flexible Rubric:** The rubric allows for either "law-making" OR "representation," giving students two paths to a correct answer.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
- **Language Barrier:** English-medium testing for Hindi-medium backgrounds makes articulating abstract concepts like "representation" or "legislation" very difficult.
- **Open-ended Format:** No options (MCQs) to trigger recognition; students must generate the vocabulary (sovereignty, voice, will) from scratch.
- **Abstract Logic:** Explaining *why* a body is necessary requires higher-order thinking beyond simple identification.

Step 5: Holistically estimate proportion of students producing a fully correct answer.
While the concept is core to the syllabus, the linguistic challenge of expressing complex political theory in English for ESL students from economically weaker backgrounds is significant. However, because this is a "standard" question often featured in model papers, a fair portion of students will provide a rote-memorized response that satisfies the rubric.
