Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   Division with remainders and understanding of dividends/divisors.
*   Concepts of multiples (specifically finding the next higher multiple of 80).
*   Word problem decoding: translating "minimum number... to distribute to all" into a rounding-up scenario rather than a subtraction scenario.
*   Two-stage calculation: first determining total chocolates (320), then dividing that total by the number of classes (8).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
*   Division as purely procedural: Students may perform 300 ÷ 80 and provide the quotient (3) or the remainder (60) as the answer. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   Subtracting for "Equal": Students often think equal distribution means "How many are left over?" or "How many can I give from what I have?". They may say 240 (80 × 3), missing the "distribute to *all*" requirement if they interpret it as "without having any left over."
*   Misinterpretation of "Minimum number required": Students often confuse this with finding the smallest remainder, leading them to stay below 300 rather than going above it.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   The context (chocolates/students/classes) is very familiar and concrete.
*   The numbers are relatively friendly (multiples of 10), and 320 is a very recognizable multiple of 80.
*   Division by 8 is a standard Grade 4/5 skill, well-practiced by Grade 8.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, the phrase "minimum number... required" is linguistically complex. They might interpret "required" as "how many more" (20) or "how many in total" (320).
*   Non-routine reasoning: Most school problems ask "how many are left over" or "how many does each get." Asking "what is the total needed" to satisfy a condition requires higher-order "word-to-math" mapping.
*   The "Hidden" two-step process: The rubric implies a specific chain of logic (finding 320 first) that isn't explicitly prompted as separate questions.
*   Multiple constraints: The student must manage "Equal quantity," "80 students," and "8 classes" simultaneously.

Step 5: Holistically, this is a deceptively difficult question for this demographic. While the math is simple, the linguistic demand and the requirement to "round up" to 320 rather than "subtract the remainder" from 300 will trip up the majority of students who rely on rote operations.
