Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, it requires specific cognitive and structural skills: spatial categorization (associating a specific geographical entity with a political boundary), descriptive linguistics (summarizing features), and adherence to constraints ("Name the one"). 

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
- Confusing "Landform" with "Land use": Thinking of "farms" or "cities" rather than physical geography. (Leads to incorrect answer)
- Generalization: Thinking Rajasthan is *only* desert and failing to identify it as a specific "landform" type. (May lead to a correct but vague answer).
- Linguistic confusion: Students may know the Hindi term "Registan" but struggle to translate it to "Desert" or "Thar Desert" in English. (Leads to incorrect answer if the medium of instruction is strictly English).

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
- Contextual Familiarity: Rajasthan’s desert is an iconic cultural and geographical symbol in India, heavily featured in Grade 6 curricula and general knowledge.
- Simple Recall: It requires naming one entity rather than comparing multiple entities.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Language Barrier: The grammar in the prompt ("Name the one major landforms") is non-standard, which can confuse students with limited English proficiency.
- Format: It is open-ended (constructed response) rather than multiple-choice, providing no scaffolding.
- Subjectivity in "Briefly Describe": Students from EWS backgrounds may lack the expressive vocabulary in English to "describe" beyond a single word, even if they know the facts.
- Low Stakes/High Effort: A score of 0.5 for a multi-part answer (name AND describe) may lead to low effort or incomplete answers.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
The item benefits from the high cultural resonance of the Thar Desert, but is significantly hindered by the English language requirement and the "describe" component for a very small point value (0.5 marks). For students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds, naming is easy; describing in English is a major hurdle.
