Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, it involves basic enumeration (naming two items) and categorization. The primary skill is retrieval of information from memory and classifying specific laws as "Fundamental Rights."

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Confusing Fundamental Rights with Fundamental Duties (e.g., "respecting the flag"). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Confusing specific laws/acts with constitutional rights (e.g., "Right to Education Act" vs "Right to Education"). The rubric's allowance for simplified phrasing might mitigate this.
- Confusing Directive Principles with Rights. This would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- High familiarity: Fundamental Rights are a core part of the Grade 8 Civics curriculum and are often taught repeatedly through rote memorization and slogans.
- Flexible rubric: Accepting "simplified phrasing" accommodates students with limited English proficiency or those who translate directly from Hindi (e.g., "Samanata ka Adhikar" to "Equality Right").
- Minimal retrieval requirement: The student only needs to remember two out of six possible options.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- Open-ended format: No cues or options provided; requires pure recall.
- Language barrier: Translating concepts like "Exploitation" or "Constitutional Remedies" from Hindi to English can be difficult for ESL learners.
- Accuracy requirement: If a student lists one right and one duty, they receive 0 marks due to the "all or nothing" maximum score of 1.

Step 5: Holistically, this is a "recall-level" question on a topic that is highly prioritized in Indian government school syllabi. Despite language challenges, most students can name "Right to Equality" and "Right to Liberty/Freedom."
