Step 1: Although this is categorized as an English item, the underlying mathematical and cognitive skills involve logical sequencing (linear time), spatial reasoning (perspective-taking), and set theory (categorizing attributes of a "bird"). 
Step 2: Common misconceptions include difficulty with deictic shifts (mixing "I" with "the bird"), which would lead to an incorrect answer. At this level, students often struggle with subject-verb agreement in English as a second language, potentially failing the "grammatically correct" rubric requirement.
Step 3: The context is highly familiar and concrete; the requirement is only a single sentence, reducing the cognitive load.
Step 4: The open-ended format is difficult for students with limited English vocabulary. Translating from a Hindi thought process ("Main pakshi hoon...") into a grammatically correct English sentence ("I fly in the sky") requires bridging a linguistic gap that often results in syntax errors (e.g., "I am fly"). The strict "grammatically correct" rubric is the highest barrier.
Step 5: Given the English proficiency barrier for students from Hindi-medium, economically weaker backgrounds, the "grammatically correct" constraint will exclude many who understand the concept but lack the syntax.
