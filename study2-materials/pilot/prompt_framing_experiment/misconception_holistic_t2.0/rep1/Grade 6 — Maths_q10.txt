**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   Understanding the definition of an angle and its measurement in degrees.
*   Physical dexterity and procedural knowledge of using a protractor (aligning the vertex at the origin and the baseline with $0^\circ$).
*   Ability to distinguish between the inner and outer scales on a standard protractor.
*   Basic geometric construction: drawing two rays meeting at a common vertex.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Scale Confusion (Primary Obstacle):** Students often use the wrong scale (e.g., drawing $70^\circ$ instead of $110^\circ$). This leads to an incorrect answer for $110^\circ$.
*   **Orientation bias:** Thinking an angle must always "open" to the right. If the student aligns the baseline to the left but uses the right-side numbers, they will fail.
*   **Vertex misalignment:** Placing the bottom edge of the protractor on the line rather than the actual crosshair/center point.
*   **Attribute confusion:** Confusing the length of the rays with the size of the angle. (Unlikely to cause failure here as they are drawing it).

**Step 3: Factors making the item easier**
*   **Standard Procedural Task:** This is a fundamental "drill and practice" skill taught heavily in Grade 6.
*   **Simple Numbers:** $40^\circ$ and $110^\circ$ are multiples of 10, meaning they align with major tick marks on every protractor.
*   **Direct Instruction:** There is no "trick" or word-problem context; it is a straightforward command.

**Step 4: Factors making the item harder**
*   **The "Obtuse" Trap:** $110^\circ$ is particularly difficult because it requires the student to recognize the angle is greater than a right angle. Many students will reflexively mark $70^\circ$ (the supplementary angle) because "110" and "70" share a physical location on the plastic protractor.
*   **Language Barrier:** While the math is clear, for Hindi-medium students, the phrase "Use a protractor to draw angle having the following angles" is grammatically clunky and might be confusing, though "110°" is universal.
*   **Tool Accessibility:** In economically weaker sections, students may use cheap, scratched, or shared geometry boxes where the markings are faded.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
Drawing a $110^\circ$ angle is a significant hurdle due to the dual-scale nature of protractors. While students find the $40^\circ$ angle relatively easy, the rubric only rewards the $110^\circ$ angle (for part 'a'). In government school settings with high enrollment and limited individual attention, the scale-selection error ($110$ vs $70$) is the most persistent mistake in this grade.
