Step 1: The item assesses the use of quantifiers "some" vs "any" in the context of positive vs negative/interrogative sentences. Mathematically, this involves binary classification and recognizing the presence of a "positive" set vs a "null" or "negative" set.
Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- Overgeneralization of "any" to mean "it doesn't matter which one," leading to an incorrect answer.
- Confusion with native language (Hindi) structures where the word 'kuch' (some/any) can often be used interchangeably in both positive and negative contexts.
- Translating literally from Hindi ("basket mein koi apple hain" vs "kuch apple hain").
Step 3: Ease factors include the familiar context ("apples in a basket"), the binary choice format (50/50 chance), and the sentence being a simple Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure.
Step 4: Harder factors include limited English vocabulary which might prevent students from identifying the sentence as affirmative, and the specific nuance that "some" is generally for affirmative while "any" is for negative/questions, a rule often untaught or confusing for second-language learners.
Step 5: Given the simple structure and familiar context, but accounting for the language barriers and common confusion between these two quantifiers in early learners, about two-thirds of the students are likely to select the correct option through either knowledge or logical guessing.
