Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
Strictly speaking, this is a Social Science (History) item. However, the underlying "mathematical" logic required involves sequencing (chronology) and understanding cause-and-effect transitions (logic/flowcharts). 

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- Misconception: "The British arrived with an army to conquer immediately." (Directly leads to an incorrect answer here because they miss the "trader" starting point).
- Misconception: "The Company was the same as the British Government." (May lead to incorrect terminology, but might still satisfy the rubric if they mention trading).

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- The content is a core pillar of the Grade 8 NCERT History curriculum ("From Trade to Territory").
- The rubric is extremely lenient; the student only needs to mention that they started as "traders" or had "factories" to get the full 1 mark.
- The context is a foundational narrative taught repeatedly in Indian schools.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- Language Barrier: Students from Hindi-medium or economically weaker backgrounds may struggle to construct a "description" (narrative) in English.
- Open-ended format: Requires generating text rather than selecting an option.
- Length of question vs. rubric: The question asks to "Describe the process" (implying a long answer), but the rubric only requires one specific fact (they were traders). This mismatch might confuse a student into overthinking or freezing.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically:
While the language barrier is a significant hurdle for this demographic, the rubric is remarkably low-stakes (only needing to mention "traders"). Most students, even with limited English, can recall and write the keywords "trade" or "business" or "East India Company traders" due to heavy rote memorization practices common in these settings.
