**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Multiplication and mental math:** Calculating products of counts and denominations (e.g., $16 \times 50$).
*   **Unit Conversion:** Understanding the relationship between *paise* and *Rupees* (100 paise = ₹1).
*   **Multi-step calculation:** Finding three sub-totals, summing them, and then dividing the final sum by 5.
*   **Problem-solving/Decoding:** Understanding that the question asks for the final number of ₹5 coins, not the total value in Rupees.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Decimal/Unit confusion:** Many students may treat 10, 20, and 50 as whole units without converting them to Rupees, resulting in a total of "900" (100 + 100 + 800) and then being unable to relate it to a ₹5 coin. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Additive interference:** Summing all numbers in the prompt (10 + 10 + 5 + 20 + 16 + 50) without considering the multiplicative relationships. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Premature stopping:** Finding the total value (₹10) but forgetting the final step (dividing by 5 to find the number of coins). This would result in an answer of "10" instead of "2".

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Familiar Context:** Money and coins are highly familiar even to students with lower academic literacy; "market math" is often a strength for students from economically weaker sections.
*   **Friendly Numbers:** The totals (100p, 100p, 800p) are clean multiples that sum perfectly to ₹10.
*   **Language:** The terminology ("How many," "Rupee," "coins") is basic.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **English Proficiency:** For Hindi-medium students, the phrasing "made from... of..." can be syntactically complex, potentially leading them to miss the specific goal.
*   **Division at the end:** The final step (dividing the total by 5) is frequently missed in multi-step word problems.
*   **The 50p/20p/10p coins:** These coins are no longer in common circulation in India, making the physical context slightly abstract/historical rather than modern.
*   **No Multiple Choice:** There are no cues to signal an error if they get a massive or nonsensical number.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimation**
The multi-step nature is the primary barrier. While students can likely handle the multiplication and basic addition, the transition from *paise* to *Rupee* and the final division by 5 represents three distinct cognitive hurdles. Many students will likely arrive at ₹10 and provide "10" as the answer.
