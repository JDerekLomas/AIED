Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a linguistic/literary task, not a mathematical one. It requires recall of a definition, categorization of a literary genre, and command of English syntax to construct a formal definition.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- Misconception 1: Any story with animals is a fable. (Could lead to a partially correct answer if "moral lesson" is omitted).
- Misconception 2: Confusing a fable with a fairy tale (magic) or folk tale (cultural). (Would lead to an incorrect or imprecise definition).
- Misconception 3: Difficulty distinguishing between the story’s plot and the genre’s definition.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- Grade 8 curriculum in India heavily emphasizes certain Panchatantra and Aesop stories (like "The Ant and the Cricket"), making the context of the word familiar.
- The definition is often a rote-learned "vocabulary" item in NCERT textbooks.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- Open-ended format: Students must produce the sentence rather than recognize it.
- Language barrier: Hindi-medium students often know *what* a fable is (kahani) but lack the academic English vocabulary ("imparts," "moral," "typically") to satisfy the rubric.
- Technicality: To get full marks, they must include both elements: animals and the moral. Many students omit the moral aspect.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically, estimate the proportion of students who would produce a fully correct answer.
While the concept is familiar, the requirement to write a formal English definition from scratch—specifically including the "moral lesson" criteria—is a significant hurdle for students from economically weaker sections and limited English backgrounds. Rote memorization will help some, but language construction remains the primary barrier.
