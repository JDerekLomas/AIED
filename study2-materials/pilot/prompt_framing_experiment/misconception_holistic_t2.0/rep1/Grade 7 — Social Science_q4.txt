Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science item, not a Mathematics item. However, the underlying cognitive skills include logical reasoning, understanding cause-and-effect relationships within a civic system, and the ability to formulate a prescriptive statement.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
1. Confusing "Transparency" with "Honesty": Students may think being transparent just means being a good person, leading to answers like "the leader should be kind." (Incorrect)
2. Confusing "Transparency" with "Elections": Thinking that just having a vote makes everything clear. (Incorrect)
3. Difficulty with Abstract Terminology: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may not have a strong grasp of the English word "transparency" (paradarshita) in a political context. (Incorrect)

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
1. Extremely low threshold for success: The rubric only requires ONE plausible way to score the full point.
2. High social relevance: General topics like "stopping corruption" are frequent points of discussion in Indian civic discourse.
3. Acceptability of broad answers: Common answers like "using computers/the internet" or "Right to Information (RTI)" are likely to be credited.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
1. Language barrier: "Transparency" and "Governance" are high-level academic English words. For EWS students with limited English, decoding the question itself is the primary hurdle.
2. Open-ended format: No options to provide cues or triggers for memory.
3. Abstract nature: Grade 7 students (12-13 years old) are still developing the capacity for abstract systemic thinking.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
The leniency of the rubric (any one way) balances the difficulty of the vocabulary. Most students will recognize "transparency" as being related to "anti-corruption" and provide a basic answer like "putting info on the internet" or "giving news to people," which would be marked correct. However, the language barrier for English-medium testing of Hindi-medium learners remains a significant filter.
