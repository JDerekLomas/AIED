Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science item (History/Culture), not a Mathematics item. However, from a cognitive load perspective, it requires categorization (classifying events as festivals or fairs) and descriptive writing. There are no mathematical concepts involved.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
A common misconception in this context is confusing national festivals (Republic Day) with regional ones (Rajasthan-specific). Another is the inability to distinguish between a "fair" (Mela) and a "festival." Given the English language barrier for Hindi-medium students, they might know the answers in Hindi (Pushkar Mela, Gangaur) but struggle to construct the descriptive "one sentence" required in English, leading to a partial or incorrect answer based on rubric constraints.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
The context is highly familiar and culturally relevant. Students in Rajasthan or surrounding areas have significant lived experience with these events. The question asks for only two examples, and the rubric is surprisingly lenient (awarding 1 mark just for naming two distinct festivals/fairs, though the prompt asks for a sentence).

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
The open-ended format requires recall rather than recognition. The primary hurdle is the English language proficiency. Many students may fail to write a grammatically correct sentence describing the "significance," or they may provide the names but leave out the description entirely due to lack of confidence in English.

Step 5: Estimation.
While the cultural knowledge is high, the combined requirement of naming specific regional examples and writing an English description—coupled with the language barriers faced by students from economically weaker sections—lowers the expected success rate.
