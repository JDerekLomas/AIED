Step 1: The scientific concept required is thermal conductivity and the mechanism of heat transfer in solids. Skill-wise, students must identify a physical phenomenon, recall specific terminology, and articulate a process in English (which is the medium of instruction for Science in many Indian schools despite the students' linguistic backgrounds).

Step 2: 
- Confusion between Conduction, Convection, and Radiation: This is the most common error. Students may mistake "liquid tea" for "convection" being the answer, failing to focus on the metal spoon.
- Heat as a physical fluid: Students might think the hot liquid is moving inside the spoon, which would lead to an incorrect explanation in part (b).
- Conductors vs. Insulators: A misconception that the handle gets hot because it "absorbs" heat rather than "transmitting" it through molecular vibration.

Step 3: 
- Familiar Context: A tea cup and spoon are everyday items in Indian households across all socioeconomic levels.
- Direct link to syllabus: Heat transfer is a core topic in Grade 7 Science (NCERT), and the spoon-in-tea is the classic textbook example used to illustrate conduction.

Step 4:
- Linguistic barrier: For Hindi-medium background students, recalling the English term "Conduction" (as opposed to 'Chalan') can be difficult.
- Open-ended explanation: Part (b) requires explaining molecular vibrations and collisions. Translating these complex thoughts from a native language to English often results in lost marks due to poor sentence structure or missing keywords like "vibrations" or "collisions."
- Maximum score of 0.5: The very low weightage for a two-part question may lead to lower student effort or strict grading on the explanation.

Step 5: While the concept is familiar and widely taught, the linguistic barrier and the requirement for an open-ended explanation in a second language significantly lower the probability of a "fully correct" answer according to a formal rubric.
