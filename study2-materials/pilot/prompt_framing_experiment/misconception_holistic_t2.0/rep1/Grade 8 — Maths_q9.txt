Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   Understanding and differentiating between three prices: Marked Price (MP), Selling Price (SP), and Cost Price (CP).
*   Applying percentage discounts: $SP = MP \times (1 - \frac{discount}{100})$.
*   Applying percentage profit: $CP = \frac{SP}{1 + \frac{profit}{100}}$.
*   Multi-step proportional reasoning.

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
*   **Mixing up the Base:** Students often calculate the 8% profit based on the MP (₹1200) instead of the SP or CP. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Additive Percentages:** Thinking that a 10% discount and 8% profit means the SP is 2% lower than CP (or 18% difference). This leads to incorrect answers.
*   **Reverse Calculation Error:** Correctly finding the SP (₹1080) but then calculating 8% of ₹1080 and subtracting it, rather than treating ₹1080 as 108% of CP.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Simple Numbers:** ₹1200, 10%, and 8% are "friendly" numbers. ₹1080 is an easy result for a 10% discount.
*   **Familiar Context:** Shopping, discounts, and profit are relatable everyday concepts.
*   **Direct Terminology:** Standard vocabulary (MP, CP, Discount, Profit) is used.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Multi-Step Process:** Students must calculate SP first as an intermediate step. Any error in the first step invalidates the second.
*   **Language Barrier:** Hindi-medium students may struggle with English terms like "Marked Price" vs "Cost Price" if they haven't mastered the English equivalents of "Ankit Mulya" and "Lagat Mulya."
*   **Abstract Proportionality:** Finding CP from SP (working backwards from 108%) is significantly more difficult for Grade 8 students than finding SP from CP (working forwards).
*   **No Multiple Choice:** The absence of options prevents "working backwards" or eliminating unreasonable answers.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the demographic, the multi-step nature of the problem, and the common struggle with the concept that $SP = CP + Profit\% \text{ of } CP$ (the reverse calculation), many students will likely find the SP but fail to correctly determine the CP.
