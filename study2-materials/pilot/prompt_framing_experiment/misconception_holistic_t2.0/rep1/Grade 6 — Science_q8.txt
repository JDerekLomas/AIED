Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Science item, the cognitive skills involve logical deduction (if A, then B) and identifying causal variables. In a mathematical sense, it requires understanding the concept of a "necessary condition" for growth and correlating observable symptoms (variables) with missing inputs (constants).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **The "Soil is Food" Misconception:** Students often believe plants "eat" soil like animals eat food. This might lead them to correctly identify "missing nutrients" but could lead to a lack of specificity. (Result: Correct answer).
*   **Misunderstanding "Inference":** Students often describe what they see (stunted growth) rather than why it is happening. (Result: Incorrect answer).
*   **Light as a "helper" not a "need":** Some students think light only helps plants see or stay warm, not that it is a fundamental metabolic requirement. (Result: Incorrect if they don't think of sunlight as a deficiency).

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** Students from economically weaker backgrounds or rural settings are often highly familiar with farming and kitchen gardens. They have likely seen "yellowing leaves" in real life.
*   **Lenient Rubric:** The rubric accepts multiple different causes (nutrients, sunlight, or water), increasing the surface area for a correct response.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the word "stunted" is a low-frequency vocabulary word. If they cannot decode "stunted" or "infer," they cannot answer the question even if they know the biology.
*   **Abstract Reasoning:** Moving from a symptom to a cause is an "inverse problem," which is cognitively more demanding than "what happens if a plant gets no water?"
*   **Open-ended Format:** There are no cues or options to trigger recognition; it requires active recall and sentence construction in English.

Step 5: Weighted Estimate.
While the students' practical life experience with plants is high, the English language proficiency (specifically words like "stunted" and "infer") creates a significant barrier. However, because the rubric is generous and the physical signs of a dying plant are common knowledge, many will attempt it.
