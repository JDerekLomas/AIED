Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
- Data Interpretation: Extracting the highest and lowest values from a frequency or growth table.
- Comparative Analysis: Comparing numerical values across different categories ( Sunlight, Partial Shade, Darkness).
- Logical sequencing: Understanding the correlation between a variable (light) and an outcome (height/growth).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
- "Growth means taller": Students might think a spindly, weak plant in the dark (etiolation) that grows tall is "better" growth, though data here likely shows the opposite. This could lead to an incorrect answer if they ignore the table and rely on outside observations.
- Language barrier: "Favourable" and "Hindered" are high-level academic English words. For Hindi-medium students, not understanding these words would lead to an incorrect answer even if they understand the data.
- Process confusion: Students often confuse "Photosynthesis" with "Respiration" or "Transpiration." This affects part (c).

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
- Familiar context: Plants and sunlight are universally understood.
- Simple comparison: Finding the largest number in a table of three is a foundational skill.
- Direct correlation: More light usually equals more growth in textbook examples.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Language Barrier: The term "Favourable" (अनुकूल) and "Hindered" (बाधित) are likely outside the active vocabulary of English Language Learners (ELL) in 6th grade.
- Subjective explanation: Part (b) requires constructing a sentence in English, which is a major barrier for Hindi-medium students.
- Technical vocabulary: Part (c) requires a specific biological term ("Photosynthesis"), which is difficult to recall if the medium of instruction has shifted or if spelling is a factor.
- Multistage: The student must succeed in interpretation, explanation, and terminology.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While part (a) is highly accessible, parts (b) and (c) are significant hurdles due to English proficiency and the requirement for technical biological recall. In an economically weaker section context where English is a second or third language, the transition from data to abstract biological naming is the primary filter.
