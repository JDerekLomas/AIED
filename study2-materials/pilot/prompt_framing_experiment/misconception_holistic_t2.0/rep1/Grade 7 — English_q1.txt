Step 1: This is an English Language Arts (ELA) reading comprehension item, not a mathematical one. However, following the logical structure of the request, the skills required are reading comprehension, information retrieval from a text, and English sentence construction.

Step 2: Common misconceptions (applied to literacy) include confusing the king’s search for the "right people" with searching for "famous people" or "wise men." In the context of this specific item, the primary hurdle is not a conceptual misconception but a linguistic one: translating thoughts from Hindi to English. If students cannot recall the specific triad of questions from Leo Tolstoy’s "Three Questions," they will fail.

Step 3: Ease factors: The story "Three Questions" is a standard part of the NCERT Class 7 English curriculum ("Honeycomb"). Most students will have encountered the story in class. The narrative is linear and fable-like, which is generally engaging for this age group.

Step 4: Hardship factors:
- Linguistic Barrier: For students with limited English proficiency, articulating three distinct complex ideas (time, people, action) in a foreign language is difficult.
- Open-ended Format: Without multiple-choice options to trigger recognition, students must rely on pure recall and synthesis.
- Transcription: Students often struggle to differentiate between the "right people to listen to" versus "the right people to work with," and may lose points on technical accuracy or grammar.
- Memorization: Success depends heavily on having read and remembered the specific textbook chapter.

Step 5: Given that this is a core textbook chapter likely taught by rote in government schools, many students will recognize the question. However, the requirement to produce a full, multi-part answer in English—compounded by the economic and linguistic barriers mentioned—presents a significant challenge for complete accuracy.
