Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a reading comprehension item for the subject of English, not mathematics. The primary skill required is retrieving explicit information from a text. However, in the context of your specific framework (looking for mathematical intersections), the task involves identifying a 1:1 correspondence between an entity (who) and a location (inside the book) based on the provided narrative.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
1. Confusing "Who" (Person/Entity) with "Where" (Location): A student might answer with the name of a place. (Impact: Incorrect answer)
2. Associating "Inside a book" with "Words" or "Pictures": Drawing from real-world knowledge rather than text evidence. (Impact: Incorrect answer)
3. Subject/Subject Verb Agreement: Errors in phrasing (e.g., "The fairy live") usually do not penalize a 1-mark "Who" question if the entity is identified.

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier:
The vocabulary is simple. The question uses "lived," which is likely the exact verb used in the source text. For a Hindi-medium student, "Who" (Kaun) is one of the first interrogatives learned. The answer is a single noun phrase ("fairy").

Step 4: Factors that make it harder:
The lack of options (Open-ended) is difficult for students with low English vocabulary. They might know the answer is a fairy but lack the spelling or the confidence to write it in English. If the text was complex, identifying the fairy as the specific inhabitant among other characters could be challenging.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
Given the simplicity of the noun required ("fairy") and the high frequency of this specific type of narrative in Indian Grade 6 ESL curricula, a majority of students would likely identify the answer, though spelling errors might occur.
