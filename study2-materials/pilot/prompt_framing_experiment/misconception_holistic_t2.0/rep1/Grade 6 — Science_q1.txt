Step 1: Identify the mathematical/scientific concepts and skills required.
*   Understanding of polarity (North and South poles) in magnetism.
*   Application of the fundamental law of magnetism: "Like poles repel, unlike poles attract."
*   Linguistic translation of the physical phenomenon into descriptive English ("repel" or "push away").

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Magnets always stick together: Students may believe all parts of magnets attract regardless of orientation. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   Confusion between "repel" and "attract": Inverting the terminology despite understanding the physical sensation. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   Misinterpreting "North" as a directional movement rather than a property of the pole. (Leads to incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   Hands-on experience: Magnetism is a highly tactile topic; students likely felt the physical resistance during classroom activities.
*   The rubric allows for "push away," accommodating students with lower English vocabulary who may not know the technical term "repel."
*   Simplicity: It is a single-step factual recall question.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, the phrase "brought near" might be confusing, and they may struggle to write the response in English if they don't know the equivalent terms.
*   Open-ended format: There are no cues or options (MCQs) to help jog the memory of the specific term required.
*   Cognitive load of translation: Students must translate the English question to Hindi, determine the scientific outcome, and translate back to English.

Step 5: Estimate of correct responses.
Despite the language barrier, the physical "feeling" of magnetic repulsion is one of the most memorable science experiments in Grade 6. The inclusion of "push away" in the rubric significantly lowers the difficulty for ESL/ELL students.
