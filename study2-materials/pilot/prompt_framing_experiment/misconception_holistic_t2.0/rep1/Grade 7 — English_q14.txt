Step 1: Identify the linguistic and cognitive concepts required.
The item requires vocabulary acquisition (specifically "ancient"), an understanding of the semantic relationship of antonymy (opposites), and the ability to retrieve or deduce a word that signifies the temporal opposite of "old/historical."

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions/errors.
- Confusion with synonyms: A student might provide a synonym like "old" or "historical." (Leads to an incorrect answer).
- Partial understanding: A student might recognize the word is related to "history" but lack the English vocabulary for "modern," potentially providing a Hindi word like "Naya" or "Aadhunik." (Leads to an incorrect answer).
- Orthographic/Spelling errors: Misspelling "modern" or "new." (May lead to partial credit or incorrect depending on rubric strictness).

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
- "New" is a high-frequency, basic word taught in early primary years.
- The concept of "opposite" is a well-practiced drill in Indian government school English curricula.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
- Open-ended format: No multiple-choice options to trigger recognition.
- Language barrier: "Ancient" is a Tier 2 vocabulary word. Hindi-medium students often encounter it in Social Science (History) but may not have bridged it to their English vocabulary.
- Lack of context: The word is presented in isolation, providing no clues to its meaning.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
Given the English proficiency gap in economically weaker sections and the transition from Hindi to English medium terminology, "ancient" is often a word students struggle to define without options. While they might know the concept, retrieving "modern" without a word bank is a significant hurdle.
