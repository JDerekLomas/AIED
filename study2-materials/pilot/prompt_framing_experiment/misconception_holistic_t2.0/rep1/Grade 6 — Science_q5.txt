Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
Though this is a Science question, the underlying "mathematical" logic involves a simple conditional statement: If Action (Iodine) + Object (Potato) = Result (Blue-Black), then Conclusion (Starch). It requires sequencing a multi-part process (Input $\rightarrow$ Process $\rightarrow$ Output).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Reagent confusion:** Confusing iodine with other chemicals like copper sulfate or caustic soda (used for protein tests). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Color confusion:** Thinking the change is to pink, red, or simply "changing color" without specifying "blue-black." This leads to an incorrect answer based on the rubric requiring the observation.
*   **Functional misconception:** Thinking the potato *contains* blue-black liquid rather than it being a chemical reaction. This may not affect the answer if they describe the procedure correctly.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Familiar context:** Potatoes are a staple food for students from all economic backgrounds. 
*   **Common Experiment:** This is a foundational, visual experiment usually demonstrated even in resource-constrained schools using simple kits.
*   **Specific Rubric:** The rubric is relatively lenient, focusing on the use of iodine.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle to "Describe" and "State" in English. They might know the concept (आयोडीन/Iodine) but fail to construct the sentence "Put iodine on the potato."
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no cues or options (MCQs) to trigger memory.
*   **Dual Requirement:** The student must provide both the procedure (adding iodine) and the result (blue-black color). Missing the color change—a common omission—results in a zero.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the experiment is memorable and iconic, the requirement to write a descriptive response in English for a Hindi-medium/EWS student significantly lowers the success rate compared to an MCQ format.
