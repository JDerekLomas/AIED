Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a language arts (English) assessment item, not a mathematics item. The primary skills required are reading comprehension, identifying central themes in a poem, and synthesizing a written response. From a mathematical/logical perspective, it requires "part-to-whole" reasoning (connecting specific lines to a general theme).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
1. Literal Interpretation: Students may think "the most important thing" must be a physical object mentioned in the poem rather than an abstract concept like "friendship." This leads to incorrect/incomplete answers.
2. Direct Retrieval Error: Students may look for the exact sentence "The most important thing is..." and if it isn't in the poem, they may guess randomly.
3. Summary vs. Theme: Students often confuse the plot (what happened) with the theme (the message).

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
The rubric is very generous (allowing full marks for mentioning a general theme without specific evidence). The context of "friendship" is universally familiar to 6th graders, regardless of socio-economic background.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
The English language barrier is a major factor for Hindi-medium students. Identifying "themes" in a second language is a high-level cognitive task. The open-ended format requires sentence construction, which is difficult for students with limited English proficiency.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically:
While the concept (friendship) is simple and the rubric is lenient, the combination of an open-ended English response requirement and the abstract nature of "theme" for students from EWS backgrounds with limited English exposure makes this challenging.
