### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Formula Application:** Knowledge of the area formulas for a rectangle ($L \times W$) and a square ($S \times S$).
*   **Calculation:** Single-digit multiplication ($5 \times 4$ and $5 \times 5$).
*   **Comparison Reasoning:** Determining which of the two results is larger ($25 > 20$).
*   **Subtraction:** Finding the difference ("by how much") to complete the multi-step requirement ($25 - 20 = 5$).
*   **Unit Awareness:** Recognizing and using "sq. cm" for area.

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Confusing Area and Perimeter:** Students might calculate $2(L+W)$ or $4S$. *Result: Incorrect.*
*   **Formula Mix-up:** Applying the square formula to the rectangle or vice versa (though the dimensions here mitigate this). *Result: Incorrect.*
*   **Linear Thinking:** Assuming that because the length of the rectangle is equal to the side of the square ($5 = 5$), the areas might be the same or similar. *Result: Incorrect.*
*   **Incomplete Calculation:** Finding the two areas but failing to subtract to find "how much" greater. *Result: Incorrect (given the rubric and "Maximum score: 1").*

### Step 3: Factors Making it Easier
*   **Simple Numbers:** The use of 4 and 5 involves very basic multiplication tables that students in Grade 6 are expected to know well.
*   **Familiar Shapes:** Rectangles and squares are the first geometric figures taught in elementary measurement.
*   **Standard Context:** This is a "textbook-style" word problem commonly found in NCERT and state-level workbooks.

### Step 4: Factors Making it Harder
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the phrase "by how much" (कितना अधिक) in English might be a hurdle if they don't recognize it as a prompt for subtraction.
*   **Multi-step Requirement:** The student must perform three distinct operations: (1) Area 1, (2) Area 2, (3) Comparison/Subtraction. If they miss the third step, they fail according to the rubric.
*   **Open-ended Format:** There are no distractors to guide them; the student must generate the entire process from memory.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimation
While the math is simple, the transition from Hindi to English at Grade 6 in government schools often results in "calculation success but comprehension failure." Many students will correctly find the two numbers (20 and 25) but may struggle to articulate the final "by how much" comparison or might accidentally calculate the perimeter if they confuse the terms. Given the strict 1-mark rubric (which usually implies an "all or nothing" result), the success rate is lowered.
