### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Conversion:** Converting mixed fractions to improper fractions ($1 \frac{1}{2} \rightarrow \frac{3}{2}$ and $3 \frac{1}{4} \rightarrow \frac{13}{4}$).
*   **Multiplication:** Applying the algorithm for multiplying fractions (numerator $\times$ numerator; denominator $\times$ denominator).
*   **Reconversion:** Converting an improper fraction back into a mixed fraction ($\frac{39}{8} \rightarrow 4 \frac{7}{8}$).
*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Fluency in multiplication tables ($3 \times 13$) and division/remainders.

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Whole Number Operation:** Multiplying whole numbers ($1 \times 3$) and fractions ($\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4}$) separately. *Result: $3 \frac{1}{8}$.* (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Cross-Multiplication:** Confusing the multiplication algorithm with the butterfly method used for addition or comparing. *Result: $\frac{12}{26}$.* (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Additive Conversion:** Adding the whole number to the numerator without multiplying by the denominator ($1+1=2$; $3+1=4$). *Result: $\frac{2}{2} \times \frac{4}{4} = 1$.* (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Language Interference:** In Hindi-medium backgrounds, terms like "Mixed Fraction" are taught as "मिश्रित भिन्न" (Mishrit Bhinn). Students with limited English may recognize the numbers but stumble if they do not comprehend the English instruction "Express."

### Step 3: Factors making the item easier
*   **Simple Numbers:** The denominators (2 and 4) are small, making the final division ($39 \div 8$) relatively manageable.
*   **Procedural Routine:** In the Grade 7 Indian NCERT curriculum, the "Mixed $\rightarrow$ Improper $\rightarrow$ Operation" sequence is a highly practiced "drill" skill.
*   **No Word Problem:** There is no complex linguistic context or "story" to decode.

### Step 4: Factors making it harder
*   **Open-ended Format:** There are no multiple-choice options to help prompt a correction if the student makes a calculation error.
*   **Multi-step execution:** Even if a student knows the concept, a single error in any of the three stages (Conversion 1, Multiplication, Conversion 2) results in a zero under the strict rubric provided.
*   **Final Step Burden:** The instruction "express the answer as a mixed fraction" is often the most skipped step by students who stop once they reach $\frac{39}{8}$.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the procedure is a core part of the syllabus, the cumulative nature of the steps (Mixed $\to$ Improper $\to$ Multiply $\to$ Mixed) poses a significant challenge for students from economically weaker sections who may have gaps in foundational numeracy. Common errors in conversion and the final step of long division often reduce accuracy rates in government school settings.
