Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is an English Literature/Language Arts item. However, in a cross-curricular sense, it requires cognitive skills such as categorization (identifying a specific line) and logical reasoning (providing a causal explanation "why"). It requires no numerical calculation, but necessitates the structural understanding of a poem (knowing what constitutes a "line").

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- Misunderstanding a "line": Students often mistake a stanza or the whole poem for a "line." On this item, it would lead to a partially incorrect or non-specific answer.
- Tautological reasoning: Providing a "why" that just repeats the choice (e.g., "I like it because it is good"). This would fail the rubric's "mentions why" requirement for full credit.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
The context (the poem) is presumably provided in the textbook or the exam paper, allowing for direct copying of text. There is no "wrong" answer regarding preference, reducing anxiety for the student.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
The open-ended format is very challenging for students with limited English proficiency. Constructing an original sentence in English to explain "why" (using "because..." or "...so...") is a high-level task for Hindi-medium students from economically weaker backgrounds. They may understand the poem in their native language but lack the English vocabulary to satisfy the rubric.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically, estimate what proportion of students at this grade level would produce the fully correct answer.
While many students will identify a line (0.5 marks), a significant majority will struggle to provide a grammatically coherent or logically distinct reason in English. In government school settings with the described demographics, expressive writing in a second language is a significant barrier.
