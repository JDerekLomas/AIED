Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While the subject is Social Science, the question implicitly requires spatial reasoning and geometric understanding (the "grid" system, perpendicularity, and rectangularity) and an understanding of proportions/material uniformity (baked bricks).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- **Modernity bias:** Students may assume "ancient" means primitive/random, failing to grasp the "planned" aspect. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- **Misunderstanding of "Urban":** Thinking urban implies electricity or modern tech rather than infrastructure. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- **Language barriers:** Students may know the concept in Hindi (Nagar-niyojan) but struggle to translate specific terms like "citadel" or "drainage" into English.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier:
- **Highly repetitive content:** The Harappan civilization is a staple of the Class 6-8 NCERT curriculum. 
- **Familiarity:** Even in Hindi-medium schools, terms like "drainage" and "grid" are emphasized as keywords. 
- **Multiple paths to success:** The rubric is generous; a student only needs to remember *one* of several features (bricks, drains, or walls).

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- **Language Proficiency:** For ESL/Hindi-medium students, "urban planning" is a complex phrase that may be harder to decode than simple factual recall.
- **Open-ended format:** Without options (MCQs), students must generate the vocabulary themselves.
- **Socio-economic context:** Students from EWS backgrounds may have less exposure to modern urban infrastructure, making the comparison to ancient systems slightly more abstract.

Step 5: Holistic estimate:
Given that this is one of the most emphasized topics in Indian middle-school History (often appearing in both Grade 6 and Grade 8), most students will recall at least the word "drainage" or "baked bricks," even if their English is limited.
