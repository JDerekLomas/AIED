Step 1: Skills include data interpretation, determining a numerical scale, spatial reasoning for graph construction, and identifying extremes (max/min).
Step 2: Common misconceptions include inconsistent intervals on the Y-axis (e.g., 80, 95, 100 without equal spacing), confusing the X and Y axes, or failing to start the scale at zero. These would directly result in a score of 0 according to the strict rubric.
Step 3: Ease factors: The context (school classes) is highly familiar. The "maximum/minimum" vocabulary is standard in Indian bilingual classrooms (अधिकतम/न्यूनतम).
Step 4: Hardship factors: Part (a) is high-effort. For students with limited English, "Represent," "Appropriate," and "Scale" are academic hurdles. For EWS students, access to a ruler or graph paper can be a practical constraint, and the rubric requires "Correctly draws and labels," which is a multi-step demand for a single point. 
Step 5: While many students will correctly answer part (b), the rubric for part (a) is stringent, and many students struggle with the manual precision and proportional reasoning required for the "scale" and "consistent" labeling of the Y-axis.
