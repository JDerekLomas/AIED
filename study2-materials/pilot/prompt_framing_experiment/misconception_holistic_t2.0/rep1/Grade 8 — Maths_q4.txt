**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Transposition/Cross-multiplication:** Understanding that multiplying both sides by the denominators (3 and 5) eliminates the fractions.
*   **Distributive Property:** Correcting multiplying the constant into the binomial, e.g., $5(x-5)$ as $5x - 25$.
*   **Solving Linear Equations:** Grouping like terms (variables on one side, constants on the other) and performing inverse operations.
*   **Integer Operations:** Managing negative signs during subtraction and division.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Partial Multiplication:** A student might multiply the constant only by the $x$, leading to $5x - 5 = 3x - 3$. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Additive Transposition Error:** Students often try to move the denominator by adding/subtracting it (e.g., $(x-5) = (x-3)/5 + 3$). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Cross-multiplication Directionality:** Confusion over which numerator joins which denominator. While usually solved correctly, the sign handling during this shift is a high-risk area.
*   **Cancellation Error:** A student might mistakenly "cancel" the $x$ or parts of the fraction before cross-multiplying.

**Step 3: Factors that make the item easier**
*   **Simple Integers:** The numbers (3, 5) are small, prime, and familiar, making calculations less intimidating.
*   **Standard Format:** This is a classic "textbook" style problem frequently practiced in Grade 8 NCERT-based curricula.
*   **Symmetry:** The structure is balanced, which often prompts students to remember the "cross" pattern.

**Step 4: Factors that make it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the instruction "Solve the equation" is standard, but the abstract nature of the variables provides no contextual clues.
*   **Multiple Steps:** The student must cross-multiply, distribute, transpose, and divide. One sign error in any of these four steps results in failure.
*   **Lack of Scaffolding:** Being an open-ended item (not MCQ) means students cannot "plug and play" options to find the result.
*   **The "Double Negative" risk:** Calculating $-9 + 25$ or similar during the grouping phase is a frequent stumbling block for students from weaker educational backgrounds.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
While the problem is a standard curriculum staple, the combination of required distributive property accuracy and multi-step manipulation usually results in significant "slippage." In economically disadvantaged and Hindi-medium contexts where foundational math fluency in middle school can be inconsistent, many students will start correctly but fail to reach the final value of $x=8$.
