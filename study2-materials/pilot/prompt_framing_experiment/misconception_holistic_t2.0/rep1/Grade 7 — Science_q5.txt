Step 1: This is a Science item requiring categorical classification and conceptual recall. Students must identify the source of energy/matter for both categories. Linguistically, they need to break down the Greek roots "auto" (self), "hetero" (other), and "trophic" (nourishment).

Step 2:
- Misconception: "Plants get their food from the soil." (Leading to an incorrect or incomplete explanation of autotrophy).
- Misconception: "Autotrophs are only plants and heterotrophs are only animals." (Correct enough for this specific rubric to get the mark).
- Misconception: "Humans are autotrophs because they cook their own food." (Common linguistic confusion; would lead to an incorrect answer).

Step 3: This is a foundational, highly rehearsed concept in the Class 7 NCERT curriculum. It is typically one of the first topics taught in the first chapter ("Nutrition in Plants"). The contrast between the two terms is a classic exam "standard."

Step 4: For Hindi-medium students with limited English, the terms "Autotrophic" and "Heterotrophic" are phonetically difficult and easy to confuse. Writing a "differentiation" in English requires constructing complete sentences, which is challenging. However, the rubric is generous (0 or 1 mark), requiring only a basic distinction rather than complex biological accuracy.

Step 5: Given the high frequency of this question in Indian school drills and the simplicity of the "self vs. others" distinction, most students will have memorized the answer, though some will struggle to express it clearly in English.
