Step 1: Identify mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   Understanding the term "thrice" as a multiplication by 3.
*   Basic arithmetic: $12 \times 3$.
*   Understanding the concept of age difference: Subtracting current ages $(36 - 12)$.
*   Conceptualizing time: Recognizing that age difference remains constant regardless of the years passed.

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
*   "Linear Age Addition": Adding the 5 years to both ages but failing to recognize the difference stays the same (leads to $41 - 17 = 24$, which is correct but involves more steps).
*   "Single Age Increase": Adding 5 years only to Rahul or only to the father (leads to an incorrect answer).
*   "Misinterpretation of 'Thrice'": Confusing it with "three years older" $(12 + 3)$ instead of multiplication (leads to an incorrect answer).
*   "The $+5$ Trap": Students often feel compelled to use every number in a word problem. They might calculate the current difference (24) and then add 5 to it $(24 + 5 = 29)$ because they assume the difference changes over time (leads to an incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   Familiar context: Age problems are common in Indian textbooks.
*   Simple numbers: $12 \times 3$ is a basic table most students know.
*   The math operations (multiplication and subtraction) are below Grade 8 level.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Language barrier: The word "thrice" is often less familiar to Hindi-medium students than "three times."
*   Cognitive Trap: The inclusion of "after 5 years" is a distractor for those who don't realize the age gap is constant.
*   Open-ended: No options to guide the student or allow for back-calculation.
*   Economic context: Students from EWS backgrounds may have had interrupted schooling, making multi-step word problems in English particularly daunting.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
While the arithmetic is simple, the " $+5$ " distractor is a classic cognitive trap that even high-performing students fall into if they haven't internalized the property of constant age differences. Given the English proficiency barrier and the tendency to perform "Number Harvesting" (using all digits provided in the prompt), many will calculate 29.
