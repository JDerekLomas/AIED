Step 1: As this is a Social Science item, it does not require formal mathematical concepts. However, it requires cognitive skills such as categorization (grouping events under "aspects"), chronological sequencing (placing Ashoka after the Mauryan expansion), and causal reasoning (linking the Kalinga war to his change of heart).

Step 2: Misconceptions include:
- Chronological confusion: Confusing Ashoka with Akbar or Chandragupta Maurya (Lead to incorrect answer: Yes).
- Definitional misunderstanding: Treating "Dhamma" purely as a ritualistic religion rather than an ethical code (Lead to incorrect answer: No, usually accepted at this level).
- Oversimplification: Believing he became a pacifist who disbanded the army immediately (Lead to incorrect answer: No, often rewarded in school contexts).

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- Ashoka is a central, highly emphasized figure in the Grade 6 and 7 Indian curriculum ("The Great").
- The Kalinga War and "Dhamma" are "anchor points" taught extensively through storytelling.
- The rubric allows for broad interpretations of "significance."

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- Language barrier: English-medium phrasing ("significance," "aspects," "reign") is very challenging for students from Hindi-medium or economically weaker backgrounds.
- Open-ended format: Requires generating original sentences in English rather than identifying a fact.
- Subjective evaluation: The student must synthesize two distinct points, which requires more cognitive load than a rote fact.

Step 5: While the content is familiar, the English language requirement acts as a significant filter for this specific demographic. Students may know the story in Hindi but struggle to construct a formal 1-mark explanation in English.
