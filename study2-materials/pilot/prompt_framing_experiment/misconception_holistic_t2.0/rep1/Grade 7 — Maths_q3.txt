### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills
*   Knowledge of the specific geometric formula for the area of a triangle ($A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$).
*   Ability to identify and substitute numerical values (base = 8, height = 6) into the formula.
*   Basic multiplication and division skills (or halving).
*   Understanding of square units for area (though the rubric suggests any correct numerical derivation of the formula earns the point).

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Confusion with Rectangle Area:** Students often multiply base × height ($8 \times 6 = 48$) and forget to divide by 2. **Would lead to an incorrect answer.**
*   **Confusion with Perimeter:** Students may add the given dimensions ($8 + 6 = 14$). **Would lead to an incorrect answer.**
*   **Formula Inversion:** Some might divide by a different constant or struggle with the fraction $\frac{1}{2}$. **Would lead to an incorrect answer.**
*   **Terminology Confusion:** While "base" and "height" are standard, some may not recognize them if they are more used to terms like "length" or "breadth" in Hindi (*aadhaar* or *unchai*). However, in this item, the numbers are explicit.

### Step 3: Factors Making It Easier
*   **Simple Numbers:** 8 and 6 are single-digit integers that are easy to multiply and yield an even product (48), which is easy to divide by 2.
*   **Standard Terms:** The words "base" and "height" are the standard terms taught alongside the formula.
*   **Direct Application:** This is a "plug-and-chug" problem requiring no spatial visualization, diagram interpretation, or multi-step logic.
*   **Context-Free:** There is no "word problem" fluff or linguistic complexity to decode.

### Step 4: Factors Making It Harder
*   **Open-ended Format:** Since it is not multiple-choice, students cannot work backward from options or use process of elimination.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the shift to English terminology ("Find the area," "triangle," "whose base is") can cause initial hesitation, though these are "Tier 2" math vocabulary words they usually memorize early.
*   **Formula Recall:** If the student hasn't memorized the $\frac{1}{2}$, there are no scaffolds to help them derive it.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the math is simple, the transition from Hindi to English instruction in Grade 7 often sees a "dip" in performance for students from economically weaker sections. The most significant barrier is the "half" factor—many students will likely provide "48" as the answer. However, because this is a fundamental, highly drilled "Exercise" type question in Indian textbooks (like NCERT), a slight majority usually succeed through rote memorization of the formula.
