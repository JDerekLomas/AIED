Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, it involves basic quantification (counting to two) and the logical skill of categorization (selecting sub-sets of rights specific to children rather than general human rights).

Step 2: 
- Confusing general "Human Rights" (like freedom of speech) with "Child Rights" (like right to education). *Leads to incorrect answer.*
- Misinterpreting "Rights" as "Duties" (e.g., studying hard). *Leads to incorrect answer.*
- Over-generalizing specific government schemes (like Mid-day meals) as a named "Right." *Leads to partial credit/incorrect.*

Step 3: 
- Contextual familiarity: Grade 6 students are often taught about the Right to Education (RTE), which is highly relevant to their lives.
- Language: Even with limited English, terms like "Education" and "School" are foundational vocabulary.
- The rubric allows for "commonly understood entitlements," meaning strict legal jargon is not required.

Step 4: 
- Multi-part task: Students must (1) recall two items, (2) select one, and (3) provide an explanation. 
- Open-ended format: No cues or options are provided to trigger memory.
- Language Barrier: Explaining the "importance" requires constructing a complex sentence in English, which is a high hurdle for Hindi-medium, EWS students.
- Disproportionate Rubric: The rubric is extremely demanding for a maximum score of only 1 mark (one must name two rights AND explain one perfectly).

Step 5: While children might name one right easily (RTE), naming a distinct second one and providing a functional explanation in English is difficult. The "explain" requirement, combined with a harsh 1-mark limit for a multi-part answer, will likely exclude many students who have partial knowledge.
