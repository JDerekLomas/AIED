**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Properties of Parallelograms:** Understanding that opposite angles are equal ($x = 110^\circ$) and adjacent/consecutive angles are supplementary ($x + y = 180^\circ$ or $110^\circ + y = 180^\circ$).
*   **Algebraic Application:** Setting up a simple linear equation to find $y$ (e.g., $180 - 110$).
*   **Geometrical Reasoning:** The ability to articulate "why" $x$ is $110^\circ$ (opposite angles property).
*   **English Comprehension:** Decoding the prompt "Please find the angles x and y for point B and C."

**Step 2: Common Misconceptions**
*   **All angles are equal:** Some students assume all four angles are $110^\circ$ because it is a "regular-looking" quadrilateral. (Incorrect for $y$)
*   **Sum of interior angles:** Students might know the sum is $360^\circ$ but fail to use the supplementary property, trying instead to divide the remaining $140^\circ$ incorrectly.
*   **Z-angles/Alternate Interior:** Students often confuse properties of parallel lines with those of parallelograms, though in this case, it might lead them to the correct numerical answer by accident.
*   **Difficulty with Explanation:** Even if they identify $110^\circ$, many students struggle to write "Opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal" in English, which the rubric explicitly requires for the point.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Standard Diagram:** The parallelogram is a standard shape frequently practiced in Grade 8 NCERT textbooks.
*   **Simple Arithmetic:** The subtraction required ($180 - 110 = 70$) involves round numbers, reducing calculation errors.
*   **Visual Recognition:** The "opposite angle" property is visually intuitive.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** Hindi-medium students often struggle with the instruction "give an explanation." They may write the correct numbers but skip the words, failing the rubric requirements.
*   **The "Two-Part" Requirement:** The question asks for $x$ and $y$, but the rubric focuses heavily on $x$ and the explanation. Any confusion on $y$ (the supplementary angle) might disqualify the student from a full score depending on how strictly the "Max score 1" is applied to the two-variable prompt.
*   **Open-ended explanation:** Providing a reason is a higher-order skill than a mere calculation, and is often where students from these demographics lose marks due to a lack of formal math vocabulary.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
Given the language barrier and the specific requirement to "give an explanation" to receive the single mark, many students will find the numerical value for $x$ but fail to justify it or struggle to calculate the supplementary angle $y$ (70°).
