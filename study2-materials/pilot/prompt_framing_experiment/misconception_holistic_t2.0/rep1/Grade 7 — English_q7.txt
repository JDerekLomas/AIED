Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
Note: Although this is an English question, the analytical framework treats language patterns and classification logic similarly to discrete categorization in math. The student must recognize the syntactic function of the word "around" (part of speech identification) and distinguish whether it functions as a preposition (requiring an object) or an adverb (modifying the verb "ran").

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
1. "Around" is always a preposition: Students often memorize lists of words (on, in, around, through) as fixed categories. This leads to an incorrect answer on this item because "around" lacks an object here.
2. Positional cue: Students might believe any word following a verb must be an object (Noun), leading them to label it a Noun or Preposition.
3. Lack of meta-linguistic vocabulary: Students may understand the meaning but cannot recall the English term "adverb."

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
The sentence is extremely short (three words), and the vocabulary ("ran," "we") is basic Tier 1 English likely familiar even to ESL learners from Hindi-medium backgrounds.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
The open-ended format (no multiple-choice options) is highly challenging for this demographic. Without the word "Adverb" provided as an option, students with limited English proficiency often struggle to recall the specific English terminology. In Hindi-medium schools, "Kriya-visheshan" (Adverb) is taught, but the translation layer adds difficulty. Crucially, "around" is more commonly taught and used as a preposition (e.g., "around the tree"), making the adverbial use a "trick" or higher-order distinction for Grade 7.

Step 5: Holistically, given the linguistic barrier, the open-ended response format, and the common confusion between prepositions and adverbs for this specific word, the success rate will be low.
