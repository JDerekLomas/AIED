Step 1: This is a language comprehension task based on the NCERT textbook story "Three Questions." The required skills include reading comprehension, recalling narrative causality, and the ability to formulate a short sentence in English using "because" or "to + verb" structures.

Step 2: While not a mathematical item, "conceptual misconceptions" here involve linguistic transfer and narrative retrieval. Students often confuse "what" was offered (a reward) with "why" it was offered. However, since the text is central to the curriculum, many students rely on rote memorization of this specific answer. Misconceptions in grammar (e.g., using "because of" incorrectly) might not lead to an incorrect answer if the rubric accepts "any similar reason."

Step 3: Factors making it easier include:
- Familiar Context: This is likely from the first chapter of the Grade 7 textbook, which is heavily drilled in Indian government schools.
- Direct Correlation: The king's motive is the primary plot driver.
- Lenient Rubric: The rubric allows for partial or "similar" answers, reducing the penalty for poor English grammar as long as the keyword "questions" or "answers" is present.

Step 4: Factors making it harder include:
- Language Barrier: Moving from Hindi to English syntax to explain "reason" (the "Why") is significantly harder for EWS students than a "Who" or "What" question.
- Open-ended format: No options (MCQs) means the student must produce the language independently.
- English Proficiency: Limited vocabulary may prevent students from phrasing the reason clearly, even if they understand the story.

Step 5: Given the high priority placed on the first few chapters of the textbook in Indian schools and the flexibility of the rubric, many students will provide a recognizable, albeit grammatically flawed, correct answer.
