Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   **Data Interpretation:** Reading and comparing values in a table.
*   **Ordering Decimals/Integers:** Comparing numerical values to determine the "greatest" amount of expansion.
*   **Logical Reasoning:** Connecting thermal expansion to engineering (railway tracks) and material properties to utility (conductivity).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Expansion equals Size:** Students might think the largest material expands the most, rather than the one with the highest rate (No, doesn't apply to table reading).
*   **Decimal Place Value:** If expansion rates are in decimals (e.g., 0.02 vs 0.1), students often think more digits mean a larger number (e.g., 0.003 > 0.02). (Likely to cause errors if table values are small).
*   **Context Confusion:** Students might answer part (b) based on general knowledge but fail part (a) if they cannot decode the English text or the table headers.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Contextual Familiarity:** Railway tracks and electrical wires are standard "textbook examples" in Indian Grade 8 curriculum.
*   **Table Reading:** Identifying the highest number in a column is a lower-order cognitive task (provided the English is understood).

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds may struggle with terms like "recommending" or "expand."
*   **Rubric vs. Item Structure:** The rubric only awards 1 mark for part (a). However, the item has three parts (a, b, and c). Students may feel overwhelmed by the three-part structure or spend too much time on (b) and (c) for no marks.
*   **Writing in English:** Open-ended explanations in (b) and (c) are very difficult for ESL learners, even if they understand the science.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
While identifying "Aluminium" is simple, the combined weight of three sub-questions for only one mark, the English proficiency required to parse the table, and the potential for decimal confusion in expansion coefficients (which usually accompany such tables) reduces the success rate.
