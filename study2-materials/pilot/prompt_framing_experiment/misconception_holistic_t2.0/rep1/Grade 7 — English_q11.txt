Step 1: The primary concepts required involve parts of speech (adjective vs. noun), sentence syntax, and identifying descriptors. In an Indian context, students are often taught "qualifying words."

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- **Part of speech confusion:** Confusing an adjective (tiny) with a noun (bird). This leads to an incorrect answer.
- **Word order dependency:** Thinking the adjective must come after the noun (common in some linguistic structures).
- **Confusion between Adjective and Adjective Phrase:** The question asks for a "phrase," but the rubric accepts a single word ("tiny"). If a student understands the technical definition of a "phrase" (a group of words), they might struggle because there isn't a complex phrase here (like "of great beauty"). However, most Grade 7 students will simply look for the describing word.

Step 3: Ease factors: The sentence is simple, the vocabulary ("tiny," "bird," "nest") is foundational, and the context (a bird's nest) is concrete and familiar. The rubric is lenient, accepting the single word "tiny" even though the question asks for a phrase.

Step 4: Hardness factors: The main barrier is the term "phrase." For an ESL/Hindi-medium student, "Identify the adjective" is much clearer than "Identify the adjective phrase." This linguistic jargon may cause hesitation or prompt students to include the noun (e.g., writing "tiny bird"), which might be marked wrong depending on strictness.

Step 5: Given the simple vocabulary and the fact that "tiny" is a prototypical adjective, a significant portion of students will identify it, despite potential confusion over the word "phrase."
