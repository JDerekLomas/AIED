Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
Though categorized under "English," this item involves logic, extraction of abstract principles from a narrative, and summarizing. It requires "Synthesis," a high-level cognitive skill in Bloom's Taxonomy. In a mathematical sense, it requires mapping diverse qualitative variables (power, money, beauty) to a common output (worthlessness) to find the "invariant" (human freedom/happiness).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   Literalism: Students may believe a "bargain" must involve money or an exchange of goods. (Leads to incorrect answer: Focusing on the specific transactions rather than the theme).
*   Misinterpretation of Power: Students may equate the King's power with "winning." (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   Binary thinking: Viewing a job only as a means to survive, making the rejection of gold confusing. (Leads to incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   The poem is a standard part of the NCERT curriculum (Class 8 Honey Dew), so it is a "seen" text.
*   The title is literal and helps frame the narrative.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Open-ended format: No multiple-choice options to scaffold the student's memory.
*   Language barrier: Writing a coherent abstract sentence in English is extremely difficult for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds with limited proficiency.
*   Abstraction: Tagore's poems deal with philosophical freedom, which is more difficult to articulate than simple plot summaries.
*   Rubric rigor: Requires identifying "power, wealth, or pride" as the discarded elements to get the full mark.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
The high linguistic barrier for students from economically weaker sections, combined with the abstract nature of Tagore’s philosophy and the open-ended writing requirement, makes this a very challenging item for this specific demographic, despite the poem being in the textbook.
