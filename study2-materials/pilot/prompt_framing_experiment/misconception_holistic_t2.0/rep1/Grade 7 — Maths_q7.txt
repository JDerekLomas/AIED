**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Interpretation of the word "of":** Understanding that in the context of fractions, "of" signifies the operation of multiplication.
*   **Fraction Multiplication:** Knowing how to multiply numerators by numerators and denominators by denominators ($a/b \times c/d$).
*   **Fraction Comparison:** The ability to compare two fractions with different denominators (e.g., $3/8$ and $4/15$) by finding a common denominator or converting to decimals/cross-multiplying.
*   **Calculation and Logical Reasoning:** Carrying out the multi-step process from calculation to final comparison.

**Step 2: Common Misconceptions**
*   **Additive "of":** Thinking "of" means addition. *Result: Incorrect.*
*   **Whole Number Logic (Inverse Magnitude):** Believing $4/15$ is larger than $3/8$ because 15 and 4 are larger than 8 and 3, or assuming a larger denominator always means a smaller value without checking the numerator. *Result: Incorrect.*
*   **Cross-Multiplication Error:** Confusing the procedure for multiplication with the procedure for division (flipping the second fraction). *Result: Incorrect.*
*   **Gap in Comparison Skills:** Students often succeed in the multiplication ($3/8$ and $4/15$) but fail to accurately compare them, often just "guessing" which is larger based on visual appearance.

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Simple Numbers:** The numerators and denominators are small (under 20), which simplifies basic multiplication.
*   **Standard Curriculum:** This is a "textbook style" question found directly in NCERT Grade 7 exercises, making it a familiar format for students who have attended school regularly.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students with limited English, the word "of" (in Hindi: "ka") is a specific technical term. If they haven't bridged the English terminology, they may stumble.
*   **No Multiple Choice:** Since it is open-ended, students cannot "plug in" or eliminate options.
*   **Multiple Steps:** The student must perform two multiplications AND one comparison. A failure in any one step leads to a score of 0 according to the strict 1-point rubric.
*   **Common Denominator Difficulty:** Comparing $3/8$ and $4/15$ requires finding a common denominator of 120, which is a significantly larger leap than comparing fractions with smaller denominators (like 4 and 6).

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
Given the strict rubric (1 mark for the full process), the high likelihood of students forgetting to perform the final comparison, and the cognitive load of the multi-step calculation for students in resource-constrained environments, the success rate is likely to be below half.
