Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science item, not a Mathematics item. However, the cognitive skills required include recall of historical facts, linking visual symbols (the currency) to state identity (the National Emblem), and the linguistic ability to explain a "Why" question in written English.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Biological/General knowledge misconception:** Students might think lions are there because they are the "King of the Forest" or represent power/bravery in a general sense rather than a specific historical/political sense. This would lead to an incorrect answer based on the rubric.
*   **Symbolic confusion:** Students might confuse the lions with the Tiger (the National Animal). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Historical displacement:** Thinking the lions represent the British Empire or a different Indian dynasty. This would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Visual Familiarity:** Every student in an economically weaker section interacts with currency (coins and notes) daily. The image of the lions is ubiquitous.
*   **Curriculum alignment:** The Lion Capital and Ashoka are core components of the Grade 6 History syllabus in India (the "Ashoka, The Emperor Who Gave Up War" chapter).

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Linguistic barrier:** For Hindi-medium students with limited English, "Explain" is a difficult prompt. They may know the answer ("Ashoka Pillar") but struggle to formulate a sentence like "It is the National Emblem."
*   **Specific Rubric:** The rubric requires two distinct points (Ashoka/Lion Capital AND National Emblem). Many students may provide only one.
*   **Open-ended format:** Unlike multiple-choice questions where they could recognize the term "National Emblem," they must generate the vocabulary themselves.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
While the subject matter is foundational, the combination of an open-ended English response requirement and a rubric requiring a specific two-part historical link (rather than a general "bravery" answer) makes this difficult for the specific demographic described.
