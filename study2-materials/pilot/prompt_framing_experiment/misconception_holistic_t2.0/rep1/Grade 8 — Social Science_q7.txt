Step 1: The question asks for a causal relationship between a historical event (Battle of Plassey) and its systemic consequence (British expansion). It requires identifying the shift from a trading entity to a political power.

Step 2:
- Conflating different battles (e.g., confusing Plassey with Buxar): Likely to lead to incorrect answers.
- Misunderstanding "Puppet Nawab": Students may think Mir Jafar was an independent ally rather than a tool for control.
- Anachronism: Thinking the British immediately ruled all of India in 1757, failing to note the focus was on Bengal.

Step 3: Factors making it easier: This is a "landmark" date frequently memorized (1757); it is a core topic in NCERT textbooks; "British power" is a familiar thematic narrative in Indian curricula.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- Language Barrier: English phrasing like "contribute to the expansion" may be difficult for students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds.
- Open-ended format: Requires generating a narrative explanation rather than selecting an option.
- Structural Reasoning: Moving beyond "who won" to "what was the political impact" requires higher-order thinking skills often under-developed in rote-learning environments.

Step 5: While the event is famous, the requirement to explain the mechanism of political dominance in English, combined with limited vocabulary and the shift from "what" to "how," presents a significant challenge for this specific demographic.
