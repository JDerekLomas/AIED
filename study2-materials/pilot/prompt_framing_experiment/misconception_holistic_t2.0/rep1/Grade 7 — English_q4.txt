Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a reading comprehension item based on the story "Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy. It requires zero mathematical concepts. However, from a logical perspective, it requires understanding a three-part categorization (When? Who? What?) and evaluating their utility in a real-world context.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
While there are no mathematical misconceptions, pedagogical misconceptions include:
- Literalism: Students may think they must list the three questions rather than explain their "importance." This would likely lead to a zero or partial score depending on the strictness of the rubric.
- Confusing "importance" with "accuracy": Students might focus on the hermit’s specific answers from the story rather than providing a personal "reason" as requested.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
- The context (kings, stories, morals) is familiar in the Indian curriculum (NCERT/State boards).
- The rubric is generous ("Any valid reason").
- The story is a standard part of the Grade 7 English syllabus, meaning it is "well-practiced."

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
- Language barrier: Economically weaker students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may understand the story in their mother tongue but struggle to articulate a "reason" in grammatical English.
- Open-ended format: Unlike multiple-choice questions (MCQs), there is no cue to help the student formulate the response.
- Abstract reasoning: "Important in real life" requires transferring a literary moral to a practical context, which is a higher-order thinking skill (HOTS).

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.
While the content is familiar, the requirement to generate a unique reason in a second language (English) presents a high barrier for students from the described demographic. Most students will grasp the "vibe" of the story but may struggle to write a coherent sentence that satisfies a grader.
