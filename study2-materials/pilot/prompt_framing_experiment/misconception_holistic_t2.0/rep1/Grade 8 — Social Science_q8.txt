Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science item. While there are no mathematical calculations, it requires the cognitive skill of "recall" from a categorized list. Students must categorize abstract political concepts under the umbrella of "Indian Constitution."

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts. 
- Misconceiving "Constitution" as "Government" or "Law Book": This might lead to generic answers like "rules," which might be marked correct depending on the leniency of the examiner, but usually allows for correct feature identification.
- Confusing Rights with Duties: Students often interchange Fundamental Rights and Fundamental Duties. Both are correct features, so this misconception would NOT lead to an incorrect answer here.
- Translation confusion: Terms like "Federalism" are abstract. Hindi-medium students may know the concept in Hindi (Sanghvad) but struggle to produce the English term.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier:
- Low threshold: The rubric only requires ONE correct feature for full marks.
- Rote memorization: This is a foundational, frequently repeated topic in the Class 8 NCERT/State curriculum.
- Familiar context: "Fundamental Rights" is a high-frequency term that even students with limited English proficiency often memorize phonetically.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder:
- English Proficiency: The need to produce the answer in English for a Hindi-medium student is a significant barrier. Spelling errors (e.g., "Secularism") might cause hesitation.
- Open-ended format: No cues or options provided.

Step 5: Holistic estimate:
Given that the curriculum emphasizes this specific list and the rubric is extremely lenient (only one feature required), a high number of students will recall at least "Fundamental Rights" or "Secularism," which are culturally prominent terms.
