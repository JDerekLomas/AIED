Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
*   **Note:** Although categorized under Science, the "mathematical" logic required here involves categorical classification (Venn diagram thinking) and multi-step cause-effect reasoning.
*   Scientific literacy: Vocabulary recall ("Insectivorous") and conceptual synthesis (photosynthesis vs. nitrogen deficiency).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Misconception 1: Plants only "eat" through photosynthesis.** Students may think if it’s green, it doesn't need "food." *Effect: Direct impact on part (b).*
*   **Misconception 2: Insectivorous plants are like animals.** Thinking they eat insects for "energy/sugar" rather than "minerals/nitrogen." *Effect: Leads to an incorrect explanation for part (b).*
*   **Misconception 3: Nutrition is binary.** Either a plant is an autotroph or a heterotroph. The "partial heterotroph" concept is difficult.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar context:** The Pitcher Plant is a classic, highly visual example in Indian NCERT Grade 7 Science textbooks (Chapter 1).
*   **Recall-based parts (a and c):** Venus Flytrap and the term "insectivorous" are rote-memorized keywords.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
*   **English Language Proficiency:** For Hindi-medium students, spelling "insectivorous" correctly is a hurdle. Understanding the phrasing of part (b) in English is complex.
*   **Multi-part/Open-ended:** The student must provide three distinct answers without cues (no multiple choice).
*   **Scientific Reasoning (b):** This requires explaining nitrogen-deficient soil, which is a sophisticated biological concept compared to simple recall.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
The item is part of the standard curriculum, but the combination of English-language demands for describing the nitrogen requirement and the requirement for all three parts to be correct (implied by the score) poses a significant challenge for this demographic.
