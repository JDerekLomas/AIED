Step 1: The mathematical skills required are minimal as this is a Science item, focusing instead on logic, comparative reasoning, and categorization of biological structures based on dietary inputs (cellulose vs. diverse human diet).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
- "Stomach size" vs. "Stomach structure": Thinking the difference is only size, not the four-chambered system. This leads to an incorrect answer.
- Confusion between "chewing cud" and the actual internal anatomy. If the student only describes the behavior and not the structural difference, they miss the rubric's specific requirement.
- Over-simplification: Believing animals eat grass simply because they have no other choice, rather than possessing specialized enzymes/organs for cellulose. This may miss the "key difference related to diet" part of the prompt.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The context (cow) is highly familiar and culturally relevant in the Indian context.
- "Ruminant" is a high-frequency vocabulary word in the Grade 7 Science textbook.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- English Proficiency: Expressing "cellulose" or "four-chambered stomach" in a second language is a high cognitive load for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds.
- Open-ended format: Requires active recall and sentence construction rather than recognition (MCQ).
- Specific Rubric: The student must specifically mention the anatomical difference (rumen/multiple sections), not just general differences in habits.

Step 5: While the subject matter is standard, the requirement for an open-ended English explanation and the specific anatomical requirement in the rubric present significant barriers for this demographic.
