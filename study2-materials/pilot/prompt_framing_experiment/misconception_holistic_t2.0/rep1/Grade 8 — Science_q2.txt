Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a science question requiring factual recall and categorization. The primary skill is retrieving the specific biological term "Lactobacillus" from long-term memory and identifying its biological kingdom (Bacteria). No mathematical operations are required.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold.
*   **Germs vs. Bacteria:** Students often believe all microorganisms are harmful "germs," making it difficult to internalize that one is "helpful." (Does not directly lead to an incorrect answer if they memorized the term).
*   **Fungus/Virus Confusion:** Students may miscategorize the bacterium as a fungus (yeast) because yeast is also used in food production (fermentation of bread). (Leads to an incorrect category answer).
*   **Living vs. Non-living:** Some may view the process as chemical rather than biological.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** Making curd (dahi) is a daily occurrence in Indian households; students are very familiar with the concept.
*   **Standard Textbook Content:** This is a classic "textbook" question highlighted in NCERT and state boards, often rote-memorized.
*   **Low Point Value:** 0.5 marks suggests a one-word or very short answer is expected.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** Spelling "Lactobacillus" is a significant hurdle for students with limited English proficiency and Hindi-medium backgrounds.
*   **Dual Requirement:** The question asks for both the name AND the category (Bacteria). Forgetting the second part results in an incorrect response per the rubric.
*   **Recall vs. Recognition:** Unlike a multiple-choice question, there are no cues to trigger memory.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
The high familiarity with the curd-making process is offset by the difficult spelling and the two-part nature of the question. For students from economically weaker sections, while "Lactobacillus" is a buzzword they might know phonetically, providing the "fully correct" written answer (name + category) remains a challenge.
