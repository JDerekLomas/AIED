Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a vocabulary and reading comprehension task within an English assessment. It requires synonym matching (mapping a definition to a specific term) and scanning a text for information. Mathematically, it involves a one-to-one mapping (equivalence).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
1. Confusing a description with a synonym: A student might identify a phrase or a different weather-related word (like "cloud" or "storm") if they do not know the specific term.
2. Literal translation: Students from Hindi backgrounds may know the concept "thandi hawa" but struggle to retrieve the specific English Tier-2 vocabulary word "breeze" from a passage.
3. Spelling errors: Given the target demographic, phonetic spelling attempts might lead to incorrect marks.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
The context of weather is universal and concrete. "Light wind" is a relatively simple definition using high-frequency words.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
The open-ended format (supply-type) is much harder than a multiple-choice format, especially for students with limited English proficiency. If "breeze" is not a word they have used frequently in conversation, they may fail to identify it even if they understand the passage. The language barrier (Hindi to English) adds a layer of difficulty in lexical retrieval.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
Given the English proficiency levels in economically weaker section (EWS) contexts and the specific requirement to retrieve an exact vocabulary word without cues, this item is moderately difficult.
