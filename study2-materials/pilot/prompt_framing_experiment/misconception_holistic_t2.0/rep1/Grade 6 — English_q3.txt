Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
Strictly speaking, this is a language literacy item. However, in a cross-curricular analysis for Grade 6, the relevant cognitive skills include literal information retrieval, decoding text, and localizing specific details within a structured set (a passage). 

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Contextual Over-inference:** Students might guess common evening activities (playing, watching TV) rather than citing the text. *Impact: Likely incorrect.*
*   **Keyphrase Matching Errors:** Students might associate "evening" with another character or event if the passage has multiple timeline cues. *Impact: Likely incorrect.*
*   **Grammar-meaning disconnect:** Students may understand the content but fail to form a "correct" response in English. However, the rubric is flexible, allowing "read books."

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
The context is familiar (hobbies/evening routines). The vocabulary is simple (love, read, books). The question is a direct "Wh-" retrieval task, which is a foundational skill frequently practiced. The rubric allows for phrases and fragments, which aids students with low English proficiency.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
The open-ended format requires writing, which is significantly harder than a multiple-choice item for students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds. Students may struggle with "What did... love" (past tense construction) versus "reads" or "read" (the answer). 

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.
Given the flexible rubric and the simple retrieval nature of the question, most students can locate "read books" in a passage, even if their grammar is weak.
