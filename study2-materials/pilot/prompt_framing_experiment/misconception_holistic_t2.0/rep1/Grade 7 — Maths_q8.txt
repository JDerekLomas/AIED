Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required:
*   Unitary method (finding the value of one unit before finding the value of multiple units).
*   Ratio and Proportion (understanding the constant relationship between fuel and distance).
*   Division (55 ÷ 5) and Multiplication (11 × 12).
*   Understanding the definition of "mileage" (average distance per liter).

Step 2: Common misconceptions:
*   Additive thinking: Some students may add the difference in liters (7) to the distance (55 + 7 = 62) rather than using multiplication/division. (Incorrect answer).
*   Inverting the operation: Students might try to divide 5 by 55 or multiply 55 by 5. (Incorrect answer).
*   Scaling confusion: Multiplying 55 by 12 without dividing by 5 first. (Incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
*   Familiar context: "Petrol" and "Car distance" are relatable, everyday concepts even in economically weaker sections.
*   Simple numbers: 55 is a clean multiple of 5, making the mental math for the unit rate (11) very easy.
*   Practice: The unitary method is a core focus of Grade 6 and 7 curricula in Indian schools.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   Language barrier: Words like "covers," "mileage," and "average" may be difficult for students with limited English proficiency/Hindi-medium backgrounds.
*   Double question: The prompt asks for two things (distance for 12L AND mileage), but the rubric only specifies one part. A student might find the mileage but fail to calculate the 12L distance, or vice versa.
*   Format: Open-ended questions are always harder than multiple-choice for this demographic due to the lack of "cueing" from answer options.

Step 5: Holistic estimation:
While the math is simple, the English phrasing "how much mileage (average) the car is giving" is slightly non-standard and might confuse students more than the calculation itself. However, because the numbers divide so cleanly, many students will intuitively find the "11" and proceed.
