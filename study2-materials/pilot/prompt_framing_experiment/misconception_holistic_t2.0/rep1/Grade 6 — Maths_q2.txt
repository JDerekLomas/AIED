Step 1: Identify mathematical concepts and skills.
Students must understand the decimal place value system, specifically identifying the value of a digit based on its position (units, tens, hundreds, thousands). They must also differentiate between "place value" (500) and "face value" (5).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Face Value Confusion:** Treating the digit as its literal value regardless of position. Result: "5" (Incorrect).
*   **Column Miscount:** Counting from the left instead of the right, or mislabeling the column. Result: "50" or "Tens" (Incorrect).
*   **Vocabulary Confusion:** Confusing "place" (hundreds) with "value" (500), though the rubric allows both here. 
*   **Zero-placeholder confusion:** Not understanding the role of the 0 at the end. (Likely leads to incorrect answers).

Step 3: Factors that make it easier.
*   **Simple numbers:** 7560 is a small, 4-digit integer within the standard Grade 3-4 curriculum.
*   **Rubric flexibility:** Accepting both "500" and "Hundreds" compensates for language barriers or formal notation gaps.
*   **Common Drill:** This is a highly practiced "Type I" drill problem in Indian textbooks (NCERT/SCERT).

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds might know the concept (*sthaneeya maan*) but struggle with the English term "place value."
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no distractors to prompt the student; they must recall the terminology independently.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Place value is one of the most emphasized topics in primary and upper-primary bridge courses. Despite the English language challenge, the digit '5' is clearly in the third position, and most Grade 6 students, even from economically weaker backgrounds, have had significant exposure to this specific question format.
