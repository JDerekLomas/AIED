Step 1: Although this is a Social Science item, it requires cognitive skills such as categorization, comparison, and establishing sets. Students must distinguish between "Material Remains" (tangible/physical) and "Written Documents" (textual).

Step 2:
- **Misconception: All old things are "books."** Students might think any ancient object is a story or record, failing to distinguish between the object itself and the text. (Leads to incorrect answer).
- **Misconception: "Archaeological" means "Dinosaur bones."** Common in early learners due to media; they may miss human history sources. (Leads to incorrect answer).
- **Misconception: Confusing inscriptions.** Students often think inscriptions are literary because they have writing, whereas the rubric classifies them as archaeological based on the physical medium. (Leads to incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The distinction is a foundational concept taught at the very beginning of the Grade 6 History curriculum.
- Common examples (coins, pots) are highly visual and frequently repeated in textbooks.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- **Language Barrier:** "Differentiate," "Archaeological," and "Literary" are complex, high-tier academic vocabulary in English. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle to decode the prompt even if they know the concepts (Puraatattvik vs Sahityik).
- **Recall vs. Recognition:** As an open-ended question, there are no cues; students must generate technical terms and spelling independently.
- **Rubric Density:** To earn the single mark, the student must provide two definitions AND two examples correctly. A minor slip on one half results in a score of zero.

Step 5: Considering the high linguistic demand and the rigid rubric requiring four distinct pieces of information (two definitions, two examples) for a single point, many students will provide partial answers or struggle with the English phrasing.
