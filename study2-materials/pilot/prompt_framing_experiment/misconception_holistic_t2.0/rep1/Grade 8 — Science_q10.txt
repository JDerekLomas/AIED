Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a science question, it requires understanding "Rate of Change" (rapid cooling/heating) and "Thresholds" (specific temperature/time constants). Students must sequence events chronologically (first heat, then cool) and understand the inverse relationship between temperature and bacterial growth.

Step 2: Common misconceptions and their impact on this item.
- "Boiling is the only way to kill germs": Many students equate preservation with "boiling." If they use the word "boil" instead of "heat," they may fail to capture the nuances of pasteurization.
- "Cooling kills bacteria": Students often think refrigerators kill germs rather than just slowing growth. This might lead them to omit the critical "quick cooling" step of the process.
- Language interference: In Hindi, the distinction between "boiling" (उबालना) and "heating" (गर्म करना) is often blurred in casual conversation, leading to imprecise descriptions.

Step 3: Factors that make the item easier.
- Familiar context: Milk is a staple in most households, even in economically weaker sections.
- Forgiving rubric: Not requiring specific numbers (70°C or 15 seconds) removes a major memorization hurdle for students who struggle with English technical terms.
- Curriculum focus: Pasteurization is a core, frequently highlighted topic in the NCERT Grade 8 "Microorganisms" chapter.

Step 4: Factors that make the item harder.
- Language Barrier: For ESL/Hindi-medium students, "Describe" and "Explain" are high-level English command words that require constructing complex sentences rather than just identifying a term.
- Two-part requirement: The student must describe the *how* and explain the *why*. For a 1-point question, many students will provide only half of the answer.
- Open-ended format: No multiple-choice cues means the student must recall the entire process from scratch.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the forgiving rubric (no specific numbers required), the popularity of the topic, and the daily-life relevance of milk preservation, most students will know "what" happens. However, the requirement to explain "why" (preserving/killing germs) in English, combined with the lack of scaffolding in an open-ended format, will lead to many incomplete responses from students with limited English proficiency.
