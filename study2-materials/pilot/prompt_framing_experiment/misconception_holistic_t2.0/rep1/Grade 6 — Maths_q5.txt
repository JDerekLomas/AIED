Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required:
*   Understanding the place value system up to five digits.
*   Understanding the definition of a "palindrome" (symmetry in numbers).
*   Constructing the smallest and largest possible 5-digit palindromes using constraints (smallest must not start with 0).
*   Fluency in multi-digit addition and subtraction (regrouping/borrowing).
*   Reading comprehension of multi-step instructions.

Step 2: Common misconceptions:
*   **Definition of Palindrome:** Students often confuse "palindromes" with "all digits same" (e.g., 11111) or simple symmetry (e.g., 10001). Some might include four-digit numbers if they ignore the "5-digit" constraint. This leads to incorrect answers.
*   **Place Value (Zeroes):** Students might think 00000 or 01110 are 5-digit numbers. This leads to an incorrect "smallest" value.
*   **Incomplete task:** Calculating only the sum and forgetting the "difference" mentioned in the second sentence.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
*   Addition and subtraction of 5-digit numbers are standard curriculum targets for Grade 6.
*   The largest 5-digit number (99,999) is already a palindrome, which simplifies half of the search.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the term "palindrome" is a high-level vocabulary word. Even in Hindi (*विलोमपद/पालिंड्रोम*), it is not a common conversational word.
*   **The "Double" Question:** The item asks for both sum and difference but only allocates 1 mark in the rubric. If a student gets one right and not the other, they fail to get the point.
*   **Cognitive Load:** The student must hold the definition, construct two numbers, add them, and subtract them without options (no MCQ safety net).

Step 5: Holistic Estimation:
While calculation is easy, the vocabulary (palindrome) and the two-part instruction pose significant barriers for students with limited English and background. Finding 10,001 as the smallest palindrome is a specific logical hurdle.
