Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, the "mathematical" reasoning involved relates to sets and subsets. Students must categorize elements into "Natural" vs. "Human" (man-made) domains and identify the causal relationship (modification) between them.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **The "Built-Only" Fallacy:** Students often think human environment only refers to buildings/infrastructure, missing the "interaction" or "social/political" aspect. This would lead to a partial or simplified definition.
*   **Natural/Human Dichotomy:** Students often believe something is either 100% natural or 100% human-made, failing to see how humans modify a natural element (e.g., turning a river into a dam). This could make providing a specific "modification" example difficult.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** Topics like roads, buildings, and pollution are concrete and visible in their daily lives.
*   **Curricular Emphasis:** This is a core topic in Chapter 1 of the Grade 7 NCERT Geography textbook ("Environment"), usually covered extensively early in the year.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** Defining "human environment" requires specific English academic vocabulary (interaction, creation, modification) which is challenging for Hindi-medium/ESL learners.
*   **Open-ended Format:** There are no cues or options to trigger memory; students must generate the technical definition from scratch.
*   **Dual Requirement:** They must provide a definition AND a specific causal example (how humans *change* something).
*   **Weighting:** The 0.5 maximum score is extremely punishing. If a student gets one part right but the other wrong, or has poor phrasing, they receive 0 or a very low fractional mark.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
The low marks allocated (0.5) suggest a very strict grading rubric for a two-part conceptual question. Given the linguistic transition and the abstraction required to define "environment" beyond just "surroundings," many students will likely provide a partial answer or a circular definition.
