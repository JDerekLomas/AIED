**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Variable understanding:** Recognizing `x` as a placeholder for a specific number.
*   **Operation inversion:** Understanding that to "undo" addition (+2), one must use subtraction, and to "undo" multiplication (4x), one must use division.
*   **Order of operations in reverse:** Knowing to address the constant term before the coefficient.
*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Subtracting 10 - 2 and dividing 8 by 4.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Combining unlike terms:** Adding $4x + 2$ to get $6x$. *Impact: Incorrect answer.*
*   **Operation confusion:** Moving +2 to the other side and adding it instead of subtracting ($4x = 12$). *Impact: Incorrect answer.*
*   **Order error:** Dividing 10 by 4 before subtracting 2. *Impact: Incorrect answer.*
*   **Juxtaposition as addition:** Seeing $4x$ as $4+x$. *Impact: Incorrect answer.*
*   **Left-to-right processing:** Treating the equation like a string of operations rather than a balance.

**Step 3: Factors that make it easier**
*   **Simple Integers:** All numbers (4, 2, 10) are small, positive, and the final result (2) is a whole number. There are no fractions or negatives to manage.
*   **Familiar Structure:** The $ax + b = c$ format is the most "standard" form of a linear equation taught in NCERT Grade 7 textbooks.
*   **Linguistic Simplicity:** The word "Solve" is standard even for Hindi-medium students; the equation itself is a universal mathematical language, minimizing the English proficiency barrier.

**Step 4: Factors that make it harder**
*   **Constructed Response:** Since there are no multiple-choice options, students cannot "plug and play" numbers to check for equality.
*   **Multi-step logic:** It requires two distinct steps (transposition and division), increasing the surface area for a minor calculation error.
*   **Concept of Equality:** Many students in this demographic see the "=" sign as a "calculate the answer" button rather than a balance, leading to confusion when moving terms.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimation**
The problem is highly aligned with the core Grade 7 curriculum (NCERT Chapter 4: Simple Equations). While the English-language barrier is low, the abstraction of algebra remains a significant hurdle for students in resource-constrained environments where rote memorization of procedures often replaces conceptual understanding. However, because the numbers divide perfectly and are very small, many students will arrive at "2" through mental trial-and-error even if their formal algebraic steps are shaky.
