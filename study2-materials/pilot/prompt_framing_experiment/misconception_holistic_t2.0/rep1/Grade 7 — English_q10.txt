Step 1: Although this is an English language item, the "mathematical" logic required involves mapping variables (pronouns) and performing a transformation (tense shift) based on a specific rule set (Direct to Indirect Speech). Skills include identifying the subject-verb agreement and the temporal relationship between the reporting verb and the quoted speech.

Step 2: 
- **Pronoin mapping error:** Keeping the "I" instead of changing it to "she" based on the speaker. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- **Tense conservation error:** Maintaining the present continuous ("is reading") because the action feels "current" in the student's mind. This leads to an incorrect answer.
- **Reporting connector omission:** Forgetting to add "that." The rubric allows some flexibility, but omission of "that" is common in informal speech and might be penalised depending on the strictness of the grader.
- **Hindi-to-English translation error:** In Hindi, "उसने कहा कि मैं उपन्यास पढ़ रही हूँ" often keeps the "I," leading students to write "She said that I am reading..."

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
- The sentence is short and uses high-frequency vocabulary ("reading," "novel").
- The reporting verb is in the simple past ("said"), which is the most standard form practiced.
- There are no tricky time markers (like "now" or "today") that require additional changes.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
- **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, the shift from "am" to "was" is structurally different from their native grammar in reported speech.
- **No options:** As a "fill-in-the-blank" or transformation task with no multiple-choice cues, students must recall the grammar rules entirely from memory.
- **Economic/Resource context:** Limited exposure to conversational English outside the classroom makes "natural" acquisition of reported speech difficult; it is treated as a set of rigid, easily forgotten rules.

Step 5: Considering the shift from present to past and the necessary pronoun change, many students will succeed at one part but fail at the other (e.g., "She said that she is reading"). Given the linguistic profile of the students described, this "double transformation" (pronoun + tense) is a significant hurdle.
