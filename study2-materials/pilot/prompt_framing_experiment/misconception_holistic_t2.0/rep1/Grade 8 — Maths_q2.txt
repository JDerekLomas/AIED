**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Algebraic Multiplication:** Knowledge of the Distributive Property (FOIL method) applied to binomials.
*   **Variable Manipulation:** Multiplying coefficients (constants) and variables (indices laws, i.e., $a \times a = a^2$).
*   **Integer Arithmetic:** Managing positive and negative signs during multiplication and addition.
*   **Combining Like Terms:** Identifying and simplifying terms with the same literal factors (the $ab$ terms).

**Step 2: Common Misconceptions**
*   **Linear Multiplication:** Squaring only the first and last terms, i.e., $(3a \times 2a) + (-2b \times 3b) = 6a^2 - 6b^2$. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Sign Errors:** Miscalculating $-2b \times 3b$ as $+6b^2$ or failing to carry the negative sign to both terms in the second bracket. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Index Errors:** Adding variables instead of multiplying, e.g., $3a \times 2a = 6a$. (Leads to incorrect answer).
*   **Incorrect Term Combination:** Trying to add $a^2$ and $ab$ together. (Leads to incorrect answer).

**Step 3: Factors that make the item easier**
*   **Language Independence:** The word "Product" and "Binomials" are standard academic vocabulary; even with limited English, the notation `( ) ( )` clearly signals multiplication to Indian students.
*   **Simple Coefficients:** The numbers (2 and 3) are small and familiar, reducing cognitive load on arithmetic.
*   **Procedural Routine:** This is a "textbook" problem. In Indian government schools, mechanical drill-and-practice for "multiplying expressions" is a significant part of the Grade 8 algebraic identity unit.

**Step 4: Factors that make the item harder**
*   **Mixed Signs:** Having one subtraction and one addition increases the likelihood of a sign error compared to all-positive terms.
*   **Open-ended Format:** Without multiple-choice options to provide a "hint" or trigger a correction, students must execute the algorithm perfectly from memory.
*   **Mental Complexity:** Combining $9ab - 4ab$ requires keeping the intermediate "expansion" step in mind or writing it down carefully.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
While the math is procedural, the transition from Hindi to English medium and the precision required for signs and powers often result in "slippage." However, because this is a core competency frequently practiced for exams, a significant portion of diligent students will successfully apply the FOIL method.
