### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Knowledge of Geometric Formulae:** Recall of the perimeter of a rectangle $P = 2(l + w)$ and the area formula $A = l \times w$.
*   **Algebraic Manipulation:** Rearranging a linear equation or using reverse operations to isolate an unknown variable ($w = \frac{P}{2} - l$).
*   **Multi-step Arithmetic:** Division (32 ÷ 2), subtraction (16 - 10), and multiplication (10 × 6).
*   **Units of Measurement:** Correct application of cm for width and $\text{cm}^2$ for area (though the rubric focuses on $w = 6$).

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Perimeter vs. Area Confusion:** Students might multiply 32 and 10 or divide 32 by 10, thinking "area" first. *Impact: Incorrect answer.*
*   **Additive Perimeter Error:** Adding the perimeter and length ($32 + 10$) or just subtracting the length once ($32 - 10 = 22$). *Impact: Incorrect answer.*
*   **Incorrect Equation Setup:** Solving $10 + w = 32$, forgetting that the rectangle has two lengths and two widths. *Impact: Incorrect answer ($w = 22$).*
*   **Arithmetic Slips:** Errors in basic division or subtraction. *Impact: Incorrect answer.*

### Step 3: Factors Making the Item Easier
*   **Familiarity:** Perimeter and area of rectangles are "high-drill" topics in Class 6 and 7 in the NCERT/State curriculum.
*   **Simple Numbers:** The numbers (32, 10) are even and small, making mental calculation feasible.
*   **Sequential Logic:** The question asks for width *before* area, guiding the student through the necessary steps.

### Step 4: Factors Making the Item Harder
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, terms like "Perimeter" and "Width" in English can be stumbling blocks if they haven't memorized the English equivalents.
*   **Two-Step Requirement:** The student must perform an inverse operation (perimeter to width) followed by a forward operation (length/width to area).
*   **Constructed Response:** Without multiple-choice options, there is no "safety net" to prompt self-correction.
*   **Incomplete Rubric vs. Question:** The question asks for *both* width and area, but the rubric provided only accounts for the width, which may lead to partial credit situations not reflected in a binary 0/1 score.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
Given the focus on rote formula application in Indian government schools, many students will recognize the perimeter formula. However, the requirement to solve for a missing dimension (reverse calculation) is significantly more difficult than finding perimeter from given sides. The language gap and the multi-step nature will likely lead to a high error rate among students who struggle with reading comprehension or basic algebraic transposition.
