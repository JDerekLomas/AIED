Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a reading comprehension item for English, not a mathematics item. However, in the context of cognitive processing, it requires logical sequencing, cause-and-effect reasoning, and information retrieval from a text.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Misinterpretation of "Why":** Students often confuse "Why" (reason) with "What" (content). In this specific item, a student might list the three questions rather than explaining the *logic* of why knowing them prevents failure.
*   **Causal Linkage:** Students may fail to connect "knowledge" with "success/efficiency," assuming the king's desire was purely curiosity rather than a strategic tool.
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the conditional structure ("if he knew...") and the negative auxiliary ("would never fail").

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** This story ("Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy) is a standard text in the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum used in Indian government schools. Many students will know the answer from memory even if they struggle to decode the English on the page.
*   **Direct Information:** The reason is stated quite explicitly in the opening paragraphs of the source text.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Proficiency:** For students with limited English, constructing 2-3 original sentences is significantly harder than a multiple-choice question.
*   **Grammatical Complexity:** The prompt itself contains a grammatical error ("Why the king felt..." instead of "Why did the king feel..."), which can confuse students who are taught rigid sentence structures.
*   **Subjectivity vs. Rubric:** The rubric asks for the three questions, but the "Why" requires an explanation of "certainty" or "right decision-making," creating a potential disconnect for the student.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given that this is a core textbook story, most students will recognize the content. However, the requirement to produce 2-3 sentences in English—combined with limited proficiency and the open-ended nature of the task—poses a significant barrier to earning the full mark for economically weaker, Hindi-medium students.
