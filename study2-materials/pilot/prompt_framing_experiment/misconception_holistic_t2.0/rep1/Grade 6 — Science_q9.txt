Step 1: Identify the core concepts and skills required. 
The question requires the retrieval of specific scientific terminology (nutritional categorization) and the recall of biological facts (deficiency diseases). Students must link the function of immunity to the term "protective" and demonstrate rote memorization of a vitamin/disease and mineral/disease pair.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   **Broadening "Health":** Students often think any food that makes you grow or gives energy (like proteins or carbs) is "protective." This would lead to a vague or incorrect answer for (a).
*   **Generalizing Deficiency:** Students might confuse symptoms with names (e.g., saying "weakness" instead of "Anemia").
*   **Interchanging Nutrients:** Thinking vitamins and minerals are the same thing, or that a mineral deficiency (like Iodine/Goitre) is caused by a vitamin.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** This is a staple topic in Grade 6 NCERT textbooks, frequently emphasized in classroom drills.
*   **Direct Retrieval:** Part (b) asks for a simple list, which is the easiest form of cognitive recall.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium/limited English proficiency students, the word "protective" (meaning 'suraksha' or 'raksha') is intuitive, but "deficiency" and "essential" are academic vocabulary that might cause confusion.
*   **Precision in Part (a):** The rubric requires a specific link to "fighting disease." If a student says "they make us strong," they might lose the mark despite having the right idea.
*   **Two-part Structure for One Mark:** The maximum score of 1 for a two-part question (a and b) means any minor error in either part results in a zero.

Step 5: Holistically weighing factors.
The "all-or-nothing" grading (Max score 1 for multiple parts) combined with the linguistic demand of "Explain" will be the biggest hurdles for students from this demographic, even though the factual content is well-rehearsed.
