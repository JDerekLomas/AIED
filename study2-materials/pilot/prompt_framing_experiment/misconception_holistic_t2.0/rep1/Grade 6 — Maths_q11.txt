**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Concept recognition:** Identifying that the problem asks for a common divisor.
*   **Language interpretation:** Understanding that "maximum value" and "exact number of times" signify the Highest Common Factor (HCF).
*   **Calculation:** Finding the prime factorization or using the division method for 75 and 69.
*   **Property of numbers:** Recognizing 69 and 75 as multiples of 3.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **LCM vs. HCF Confusion:** Many students see the word "maximum" and associate it with "Highest," but often revert to Least Common Multiple (LCM) because it is a more commonly drilled procedure. *Impact: Incorrect answer (1725).*
*   **Keyword dependency:** Students might not understand what "exact number of times" means physically/mathematically. *Impact: Conceptual block.*
*   **Additive reasoning:** Some might subtract the two numbers ($75-69=6$) thinking the difference is the "measure." *Impact: Incorrect answer (6).*

**Step 3: Factors that make it easier**
*   **Standard NCERT problem:** This is a classic textbook example used in Grade 6 Chapter 3 ("Playing with Numbers"). Many students may have memorized the method for these specific numbers.
*   **Small, manageable numbers:** 75 and 69 are relatively small and don't require complex long division or extensive prime factorization.

**Step 4: Factors that make it harder**
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, words like "fertiliser," "measure," and "exact number of times" in English are significant barriers to decoding the word problem.
*   **High cognitive load in translation:** Translating the situational context into a mathematical operation is harder than performing the operation itself.
*   **Primes and Factors:** 69 is often mistaken as a prime number by students, who may fail to see it is divisible by 3 ($6+9=15$).
*   **Low Reward:** A score of 0.5 for a multi-step word problem can be demotivating, leading to less effort in checking the work.

**Step 5: Holistic estimate**
While the calculation is simple (HCF = 3), the shift from "language" to "math" is the primary filter. Given the English language barrier and the common tendency to confuse HCF with LCM in word problems, many students will either perform the wrong operation or leave it blank. However, because it is a direct textbook example, those who have practiced the NCERT exercises will recognize it.
