Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
Though this is a Social Science item, it involves basic enumeration and classification skills. The student must retrieve two distinct entities from a specific set (Mountain Ranges) constrained by a geographic boundary (India).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
- Confusing "Mountains" with "Mountain Ranges": A student might name a peak like "Mount Everest" or "K2." Since Everest is in Nepal, this would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Confusion with other landforms: Naming a plateau or a river.
- Geographic boundary error: Naming the Andes or Alps because they are famous ranges.
- Spelling errors (highly likely for English Language Learners): Writing "Himalay" or "Aravali."

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- High familiarity: The Himalayas and Aravallis are core parts of the Grade 6 geography curriculum and general cultural knowledge in India.
- Visual memory: Map pointing is a frequent exercise in Indian government schools.
- Short response: It only requires proper nouns, which mitigates low English proficiency.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- Open-ended format: No options (like in a MCQ) to trigger recognition.
- Language barrier: While the concepts are taught, remembering the specific English terms for those who primarily speak or learned the concepts in Hindi (e.g., "Parvat Shrinkhala") might pose a challenge.
- Multi-item requirement: The student must recall *two* correct names to fulfill the "any two" prompt.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically, estimate what proportion of students at this grade level would produce the fully correct answer.
In the context of Indian government schools, the Himalayas are almost universally known. Recalling a second (like the Vindhyas or Western Ghats) is the primary hurdle. However, given the focus on rote memorization of geography "facts" in these systems, the success rate is usually high for this specific factual recall.
