**Step 1: Mathematical concepts and skills required**
*   **Integer Multiplication:** Understanding how to multiply absolute values (3 × 4).
*   **Sign Rules (Signs of Products):** Applying the specific rule that the product of two negative integers is a positive integer.
*   **Notation Literacy:** Recognizing that parentheses denote grouped signed numbers and the '×' symbol indicates multiplication.

**Step 2: Common misconceptions**
*   **Sign Confusion (Addition vs. Multiplication rules):** Students often confuse the rule for adding negatives (e.g., $-3 + -4 = -7$) with multiplying them. This would lead to an incorrect answer of $-12$ or $-7$.
*   **"Negatives always result in Negatives":** A general intuition that "minus means less than zero" leads some to believe any operation involving negatives must result in a negative. This would lead to $-12$.
*   **Absolute Value Error:** Incorrectly performing the basic multiplication (e.g., $3 \times 4 = 7$ by accidentally adding).

**Step 3: Factors making it easier**
*   **Simple Numbers:** $3$ and $4$ are foundational single-digit numbers; no complex calculation is required.
*   **Direct Instruction:** In the Indian state curriculum (NCERT), "Negative $\times$ Negative = Positive" is a heavily rote-memorized "formula."
*   **Minimal English:** The question is almost entirely symbolic ("Find the value of"), which reduces the barrier for Hindi-medium students.

**Step 4: Factors making it harder**
*   **Lack of Context:** As an abstract calculation without visual aids or number lines, students who rely on conceptual understanding rather than rote rules may struggle.
*   **Open-ended:** Without options (MCQ), students cannot "guess" or be prompted by seeing $12$ as a possibility.

**Step 5: Holistic Estimate**
The rote nature of the Indian mathematics curriculum at this level places a high premium on sign rules. While many students will struggle with the "Addition vs. Multiplication" sign rule interference, the simplicity of $3 \times 4$ allows the majority to focus entirely on the sign. Among economically weaker sections (EWS), where rote fluency is often emphasized over conceptual derivation, this specific "Negative $\times$ Negative" drill is a standard success marker.
