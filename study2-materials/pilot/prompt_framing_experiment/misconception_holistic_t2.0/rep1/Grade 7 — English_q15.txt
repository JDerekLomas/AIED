Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a non-mathematical task. The skills required are linguistic and structural: vocabulary retrieval, syntax construction (Subject-Verb-Object), and coherence. If interpreted through a logic/procedural lens, it requires following a three-part prompt structure.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
*   **Paragraph vs. Sentence:** Students often provide a single sentence or a list of words. (Would lead to 0 marks).
*   **Subject-Verb Agreement:** Mixing "I plays" or "My hobby are." (Could lead to 0 marks depending on how strictly "clearly mentions" is interpreted).
*   **Semantic Confusion:** Not understanding the prompt "Why" and simply repeating the hobby. (Would lead to 0 marks).

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
*   **Familiar Context:** "My Favourite Hobby" is a "standard" essay topic practiced since primary school in the Indian curriculum.
*   **Low Length Requirement:** Only 4-5 sentences are required.
*   **Common Vocabulary:** Words like "cricket," "reading," or "playing" are familiar even to ESL learners.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
*   **English Proficiency Gap:** Students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds often struggle to construct original sentences without a template.
*   **All-or-Nothing Scoring:** The maximum score is 1. If a student forgets the "when" or the "why," they fail the entire rubric, even if the English is good.
*   **Open-ended Format:** No word bank or "fill-in-the-blanks" support.

Step 5: Holistic Estimation:
While the topic is very common, the rigid "all-or-nothing" 1-point rubric combined with the requirement to include three specific criteria (what, when, why) makes it difficult for English Language Learners. Students often answer the "what" but fail to explain the "why" or "when" in full sentences.
