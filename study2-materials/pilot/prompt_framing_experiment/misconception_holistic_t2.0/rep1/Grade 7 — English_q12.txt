Step 1: Identify the linguistic concepts and skills required.
- Understanding of the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure in English.
- Identification of the tense (Past Simple: "blew").
- Knowledge of the past participle form of the irregular verb "blow" (blown).
- Applying the passive voice transformation formula: Object + was/were + past participle + by + Subject.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
- Tense shifting: Students often confuse passive voice with indirect speech and change "blew" to "had blown." This would lead to an incorrect answer.
- Incorrect past participle: Students often use "blewed" or keep "blew" (e.g., "leaves were blew"). This leads to an incorrect answer.
- Subject-Verb Agreement: Using "was" instead of "were" for the plural "leaves." This leads to an incorrect answer.
- Translating literally from Hindi: Hindi uses the passive voice differently; students might struggle with the "by" construction.

Step 3: Factors that make it easier.
- Familiar vocabulary: "Wind," "leaves," and "away" are common words.
- Short sentence length: The sentence is concise and direct.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder.
- Irregular verb: "Blow-blew-blown" is significantly harder than regular "-ed" verbs.
- Open-ended format: No multiple-choice options to provide a scaffold or trigger recognition.
- Language barrier: For Hindi-medium students, identifying the object vs. the adverbial phrase ("away") can be confusing.
- Pluralization: Students often default to the singular "was."

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given the combination of an irregular verb, the requirement for plural subject-verb agreement ("were"), and the open-ended nature of the task for students with limited English proficiency, a majority of students are likely to make a grammatical error.
