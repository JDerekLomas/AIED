Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
Though categorized as Science, the item requires basic retrieval of terminology and spelling accuracy. In a mathematical sense, it involves simple classification and categorization of a biological component based on specific attributes (color and function).

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   Misidentifying the organelle for the pigment (Chloroplast vs. Chlorophyll): This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   Generalizing "green stuff" as "leaves": A student might name the leaf itself rather than the pigment.
*   Confusion with other biological processes: Some might think the pigment is glucose or oxygen, but the "green" cue usually redirects them.

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
The context is highly familiar; photosynthesis is a core concept taught repeatedly since primary grades in the Indian curriculum. "Green pigment" is the standard definition-link used in textbooks. For Hindi-medium students, the term is often transliterated in bilingual teaching (क्लोरोफिल), making it a high-frequency vocabulary word.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
The open-ended format is the primary difficulty. For students with limited English proficiency from economically weaker sections, spelling "Chlorophyll" correctly is a significant hurdle. Phonetic spelling errors (e.g., "Clorofil") might be penalized depending on the strictness of the teacher, and the absence of multiple-choice options removes the ability to recognize the word visually.

Step 5: Estimate the proportion of students who would produce the fully correct answer.
While the concept is well-known, the shift from "understanding" to "accurately writing a complex English scientific term" in an open-ended format significantly reduces the success rate for this specific demographic.
