Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a Social Science item. No direct mathematical concepts (like arithmetic or algebra) are required. However, the logical skill of "causal reasoning" (Action A leads to Economic Outcome B) is a prerequisite for higher-level quantitative literacy.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **The "Looting is Profit" Fallacy:** Students may believe wars were always beneficial because winners got gold. While this would lead to a "correct" answer under this broad rubric (as it is a plausible impact), it misses the macro-economic drain on resources.
*   **Difficulty with the word "Economic":** Many students at this level, especially those with limited English/Hindi-medium backgrounds, struggle to distinguish between "economic," "political," and "social." They might describe people dying (social) or a king losing territory (political) instead of financial impacts (taxation, trade disruption, treasury depletion).

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **The Rubric is extremely lenient:** Only one distinct impact is required for a full point.
*   **General knowledge:** Most students intuitively understand that wars are expensive or involve stealing wealth.
*   **Subjectivity:** "Plausible" gives students a wide margin for error.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** For students from Hindi-medium/economically weaker backgrounds, terms like "Assess," "Impact," and "Economic life" are sophisticated English academic vocabulary. Many might not understand what the question is asking them to do.
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no cues or options to help a student who is stuck.
*   **Abstract Reasoning:** Moving from "fighting" to "economic life" requires a level of abstraction that 12-year-olds are still developing.

Step 5: Holistically weighing all factors.
While the rubric is generous, the combination of a high-vocabulary barrier ("Economic life") and the open-ended requirement for causal reasoning is difficult for Grade 7 students in this specific context (ESL/economically disadvantaged). Many will likely give "social" answers (people died) rather than "economic" ones.
