Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
While the subject is Social Science, the implicit mathematical/logical skills required involve classification (identifying elements within the set "Natural Resources") and establishing a functional relationship (how Resource A affects Variable B). Structurally, it requires a "2+1" logic (naming two items, selecting one for further analysis).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Conflation of "Natural" and "Man-made":** Students might list factories or roads. This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   **Generalization vs. Specificity:** Providing a resource not specific to or prominent in Rajasthan (e.g., "Forests" or "Apples"). This might lead to partial or no credit depending on the rigor of the grader.
*   **Scale of Impact:** Difficulty in articulating the "how" (causality). Students often describe what a resource *is* rather than how it *influences* lives.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Local Context:** Rajasthan’s minerals (marble) and sunlight are visible, everyday realities for these students.
*   **Vocabulary:** The term "Natural Resources" is a high-frequency keyword in Class 6 curriculum.
*   **Low Linguistic Barrier for Identification:** Naming "Marble" or "Sun" is linguistically simple.

Step 4: Factors making the item harder.
*   **Language Proficiency:** The requirement to "explain" in English is a major barrier for Hindi-medium, EWS students. They may know the answer but lack the syntax to describe influence.
*   **Open-ended format:** There are no cues or options to trigger memory.
*   **Strict Rubric/Weightage:** The rubric allows for a maximum of 1 mark for a multi-part response, meaning any error in the second half of the question results in zero marks or partial failure in a high-stakes setting.
*   **Abstraction of "Influence":** Explaining socio-economic impact requires higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) that are often underdeveloped in under-resourced schools.

Step 5: Estimate
The high linguistic demand of "explaining" combined with the English language barrier for this specific demographic significantly lowers the success rate, despite the familiarity of the geographic context.
