### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Divisibility Rules:** Understanding that a factor must divide the number without a remainder (specifically rules for 2 and 4).
*   **Multiplication/Division Facts:** Proficiency in multiplication tables (specifically beyond 10, up to 17 or 20).
*   **Systematic Exhaustion:** The ability to list factor pairs $(1 \times 68, 2 \times 34, 4 \times 17)$ to ensure none are missed.
*   **Definition of "Factor":** Distinguishing between factors (divisors) and multiples.

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Confusion between Factors and Multiples:** Students might list 68, 136, etc. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Incomplete Listing:** Missing the middle pair (4 and 17). This is highly likely on this item because 17 is a prime number not commonly found in lower-level multiplication drills.
*   **Mistaking Odd Numbers for Primes:** Thinking 17 is a factor but failing to check it, or conversely, assuming 68 has no other factors because "it doesn't look like it's in the 1-10 tables."
*   **Stopping at 2:** Identifying 1, 2, 34, and 68 but missing the 4 and 17.

### Step 3: Factors that make the item easier
*   **Even Number:** The presence of an even number (68) makes it immediately obvious that 2 is a factor.
*   **Language Simplicity:** "Write all the factors" is a standard prompt in NCERT textbooks (Hindi/English) that students are trained to recognize.
*   **Familiarity:** This is a core topic in Grade 6 (Chapter 3: Playing with Numbers).

### Step 4: Factors that make it harder
*   **Large/Uncommon Factors:** 17 and 34 are difficult for students who have only memorized tables up to 10 or 12. Most Indian govt school students focus on rote memorization of tables 1-10; 17 is often a "blind spot."
*   **Open-ended format:** Unlike multiple choice, there are no cues to suggest how many factors there should be.
*   **Missing 4:** Testing for divisibility by 4 is a higher-level skill than testing for 2 or 5. Many students will miss the $4 \times 17$ pair.
*   **Rubric Rigidity:** Since it is a "Maximum score 1" item, missing even one factor (like 17) results in 0 marks.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is foundational, the specific number 68 is a "trap" number for Grade 6 students. Most will find 1, 2, 34, and 68. However, the majority will miss 4 and 17 because 17 is not part of their standard mental math toolkit. Given the "all or nothing" rubric, the success rate will be lower than expected for a "simple" factors question.
