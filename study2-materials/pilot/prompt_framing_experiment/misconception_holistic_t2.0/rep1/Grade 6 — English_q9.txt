Step 1: Identify the English grammar concepts and skills required. (Note: Despite the "mathematical" prompt, the item is an English punctuation task). Skills include:
*   Identifying and capitalizing proper nouns (Riya, Meena, Sunday).
*   Identifying and capitalizing the start of a sentence.
*   Identifying and applying the correct end-mark punctuation (Full stop/period).

Step 2: Common misconceptions/errors:
*   Overgeneralization: Students may think only the first word of a sentence needs a capital letter, ignoring proper nouns within the sentence (would lead to an incorrect answer).
*   Day/Name Confusion: Students may not realize days of the week (Sunday) are proper nouns in English (would lead to an incorrect answer).
*   Translanguaging gaps: In Hindi, there is no distinction between upper and lower case letters. This is a foundational hurdle for Hindi-medium students that often persists into Grade 6 (would lead to an incorrect answer).

Step 3: Factors that make it easier:
*   The vocabulary is basic (friend, market, Sunday).
*   The sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object) is the most familiar type.
*   The names "Riya" and "Meena" are culturally familiar.

Step 4: Factors that make it harder:
*   No scaffolding: It is an open-ended "rewrite" task rather than multiple-choice.
*   Multiple points of failure: The student must identify four distinct capitalization points (Riya, Meena, Sunday, start of sentence) and the full stop. If even one is missed, the rubric assigns 0.
*   Language Interference: Since students are from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the lack of case sensitivity in their mother tongue makes consistent capitalization one of the hardest skills to master.

Step 5: Holistic estimate:
Given the strict binary rubric (all or nothing) and the common difficulty Hindi-medium students have with English capitalization rules, a significant portion will miss at least one required change (likely "Meena" or "Sunday").
