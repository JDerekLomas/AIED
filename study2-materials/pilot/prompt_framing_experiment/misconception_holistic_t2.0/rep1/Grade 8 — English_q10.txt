Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
Note: Although this is an English language item, the underlying cognitive logic involves **transposition**, **substitution**, and **mapping of logical relations**. The student must identify the cause-effect relationship (Intensity -> Inability) and map it onto a specific structural template ($Subject + is + too + Adjective + to + Verb$).

Step 2: List common misconceptions students hold about these concepts.
- **Substitution error (Intensity):** Students often replace "very" with "too" but fail to change the second clause, resulting in "He is too weak. He cannot walk." (Incorrect)
- **Tautology error:** Keeping the negative word "cannot." Because "too...to" carries an inherent negative meaning, students may produce "He is too weak to not walk" or "He is too weak to cannot walk." (Incorrect)
- **Word Order/Category error:** Using "to" before the adjective or confusing "too" (adverb) with "to" (preposition). (Incorrect)

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier.
- **High Frequency:** This is a classic "Transformational Grammar" exercise heavily drilled in Indian state boards (NCERT/SCERT).
- **Simple Vocabulary:** "Weak" and "Walk" are high-frequency words familiar to Hindi-medium students.
- **Structure:** The sentence is the most basic prototype of this rule (Subject + Verb + Adj).

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder.
- **ESL/Hindi interference:** In Hindi, the construction usually involves "so... that he can't" (*itna... ki nahi chal sakta*). The concise "too...to" structure is not intuitive.
- **Open-ended format:** Without options, students must recall the specific syntax and spelling.
- **Literal translation:** Students often try to translate every word of the original two sentences, leading to "He is too weak he to walk."

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given that this is a highly standardized "drilling" item in Grade 8 curriculum in Indian schools, most students will recognize the pattern even if they don't fully master the grammar. However, for students from economically weaker sections with low English exposure, the transition from "cannot" to the infinitive "to walk" remains a significant hurdle.
