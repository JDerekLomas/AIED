Step 1: Identify mathematical concepts and skills.
Students must know the definition of a rectangle, identify "length" and "breadth" as its dimensions, recall the formula for area ($L \times B$) and perimeter ($2(L + B)$), perform multi-digit multiplication ($15 \times 8$), and apply correct units (sq. cm and cm).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Area vs. Perimeter Confusion:** Students often swap the formulas. If they calculate only perimeter ($46$ cm) or provide the perimeter in the area slot, they fail the rubric. (Likely to lead to an incorrect answer).
*   **Additive Area:** Thinking area is the sum of sides. (Incorrect).
*   **Unit Misplacement:** Writing $120$ cm instead of sq. cm. Depending on strict grading, this could lead to a zero score.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar context:** Geometry is a staple of the Grade 6 curriculum.
*   **Simple numbers:** $15$ and $8$ are manageable integers; $15 \times 8 = 120$ is a common calculation in times-tables or easy to solve via addition.
*   **Standard terminology:** "Length" and "breadth" are the standard terms used in Indian textbooks.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Dual-tasking:** The prompt asks for *both* area and perimeter, but the rubric only specifies area. However, for a student, doing both increases the cognitive load and the chance of a "careless error."
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the English terms "length," "breadth," "area," and "perimeter" if they are transitioning to English-medium instruction.
*   **Format:** Being a constructed-response question (no options), there is no "cueing" to help a student self-correct.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
In the context of economically weaker sections and language transitions, many students struggle with the distinction between area and perimeter concepts even if they can perform the multiplication. Additionally, the requirement to calculate two distinct properties (even if the rubric only scores one) increases the likelihood of incomplete or confused responses.
