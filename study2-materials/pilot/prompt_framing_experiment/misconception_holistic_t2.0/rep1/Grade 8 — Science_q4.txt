Step 1: Identify the scientific concepts and skills required.
Students must recall the structure of a candle flame (three zones: inner, middle, and outer) and understand the relationship between oxygen supply, combustion efficiency, and temperature. They must specifically identify the outermost (non-luminous) zone as the hottest part and link this property to the functional need of a goldsmith (melting metal).

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Visual-Heat Association:** Many students believe the brightest part of the flame (middle/luminous yellow zone) is the hottest. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Color Correlation:** Some students associate blue with "cold" and yellow/red with "hot" due to domestic experiences, leading them to choose the middle zone. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **The "Core" Fallacy:** A belief that the center of an object is its "hottest core." This leads them to select the innermost black zone. This would lead to an incorrect answer.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Familiar Context:** In the Indian NCERT Grade 8 textbook, the specific example of a goldsmith using a metallic blowpipe is a standard illustration and a frequent "back-of-chapter" question.
*   **Visual Recognition:** Many students from economically weaker sections may have seen local artisans or jewelers at work in their communities, providing a real-world anchor.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** The term "Goldsmith" or "Outer/Non-luminous zone" may be unfamiliar in English to students transitioning from Hindi-medium backgrounds (*Sunaar* and *Bahri kshetra*).
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options, students must retrieve specific vocabulary ("non-luminous," "outermost") rather than just recognizing it.
*   **The "Give Reason" requirement:** For a 1-point question, providing both the identification and the causal reasoning (hottest part/complete combustion) requires linguistic synthesis that is difficult for ESL learners.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given that this is a highly "predictable" exam question in the Indian curriculum that is often memorized as a rote fact, many students will succeed. However, the requirement to explain the reason in English, combined with common misconceptions about heat and light, will pose a significant challenge for nearly half the cohort.
