Step 1: Identify the concepts and skills required.
*   Subject Matter: Historical knowledge of the Vedic period.
*   English Language Literacy: Understanding the term "main occupation" (professional activity) and "key aspect" (characteristic/feature).
*   Cognitive Skills: Retrieval of factual knowledge from memory and description/elaboration.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions.
*   Conflation of time periods: Thinking ancient people were primarily hunters-gatherers (Early Stone Age) or industrial workers (Modern Age). This leads to an incorrect answer.
*   Rural-Urban Bias: Assuming all ancient Indians lived in planned cities like the Harappans (which were urban), whereas the Vedic period was rural.
*   Generalization: Assuming "Farming" is always the answer for any ancient civilization, which is partially rewarded here, though the early Vedic period was primarily pastoral.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   Familiar Context: Farming and cattle rearing are highly familiar to students from rural or economically weaker backgrounds.
*   Rubric Flexibility: Accepting both pastoralism and agriculture as correct makes the item significantly more accessible.
*   Curriculum Centrality: This is a fundamental topic covered in standard Grade 6 textbooks (NCERT).

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students, the word "Occupation" may be unfamiliar in English.
*   Dual Task: The question requires identifying AND describing. Even if they know the word "Farming," they may struggle to write a sentence in English describing an aspect of it (e.g., "ploughing the land").
*   Open-ended Format: No multiple-choice options to trigger recognition memory.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
The item's difficulty lies heavily in the "Describe" component and the English proficiency required to express the "key aspect." While many will recognize the concept, the transition from Hindi-thought to English-written description will be the primary hurdle.
