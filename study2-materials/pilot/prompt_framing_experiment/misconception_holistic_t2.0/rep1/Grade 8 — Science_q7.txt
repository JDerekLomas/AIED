Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a science question (Biology/Environmental Science), not a mathematical one. However, the cognitive skills required include observation of physical/chemical change over time, understanding of the process of decomposition (nutrient cycling), and evaluating cause-effect relationships regarding soil quality.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Misconception 1: Waste just "disappears" or "dries up."** Students might think the volume decreases because things shrink rather than being decomposed by microorganisms. This would likely lead to a correct "yes, there is a change" but might miss the "reason."
*   **Misconception 2: All waste is harmful.** Students often associate "waste" or "garbage" with something bad. They might conclude it is bad for soil health unless they specifically connect it to the concept of manure/compost. This would lead to an incorrect evaluation.
*   **Misconception 3: Decomposition happens instantly.** Students might ignore the "after some days" prompt and focus only on the end state.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   **Context:** Extremely familiar. Gardening and composting are common in Indian rural and semi-urban contexts.
*   **Vocabulary:** Words like "waste," "fruits," and "vegetables" are basic English likely taught in early primary years.
*   **Experience:** Students from economically weaker backgrounds often have more direct contact with kitchen waste disposal or local agricultural practices.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle to articulate "decomposition" or "nutrients" in English.
*   **Three-Part Prompt:** The question asks for three things: notice a change, give a reason, and evaluate benefit. Students often answer the first part ("Yes") and ignore the rest.
*   **Open-ended format:** Requires construction of a sentence rather than selecting an option.
*   **Rubric/Weighting:** The 0.5 marks limit is discouraging for a three-part answer, potentially leading to incomplete responses.

Step 5: Holistic estimation.
While the concept is intuitive and culturally relevant, the English language requirement and the need to provide a scientific reason (decomposition/compost) for a multi-part question make it challenging for students with limited English proficiency to provide a "fully correct" answer as per the rubric's requirements.
