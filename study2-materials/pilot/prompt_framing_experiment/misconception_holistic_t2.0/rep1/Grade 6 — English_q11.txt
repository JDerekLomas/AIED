Step 1: Identify the linguistic and grammatical concepts required.
The student must distinguish between a single verb (action) and a "verb phrase." This requires identifying the auxiliary verb (are) and the main verb (playing) as a single functional unit.

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
1. The "Single Word" misconception: Many students believe a verb must be one word. This leads them to identify only "playing" as the verb. This would result in an incorrect answer.
2. The "Noun-Verb" confusion: In Hindi-medium backgrounds, the word order (SOV) differs from English (SVO). However, since "football" is a common loanword, this is less likely here.
3. The "Action" bias: Students are often taught "verbs are doing words." "Playing" is a clear action, while "are" is an abstract state of being. This frequently leads students to omit "are" from the phrase.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
1. High-frequency vocabulary: "Children," "playing," and "football" are among the most common English words taught in Indian government schools.
2. Context: The scenario is highly relatable and concrete.
3. Sentence structure: This is a standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) declarative sentence, the most practiced form in Grade 6.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
1. Lack of answer choices: In an open-ended format, students cannot use process of elimination.
2. Terminology: The term "verb phrase" is a technical grammatical term. While students may know "are playing" is the action, they may not know that the two words together constitute a "verb phrase."
3. Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students, identifying "are" as part of the action is non-intuitive because the equivalent auxiliary often appears at the end of the sentence in Hindi.

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
While the vocabulary is simple, the specific instruction to identify a "verb phrase" is a technical hurdle. Most Grade 6 students in this demographic will likely identify only the main action word ("playing") and omit the auxiliary ("are").
