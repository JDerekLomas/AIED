Step 1: Identify the concepts and skills required.
While this is a Social Science item, it requires cognitive skills similar to logic and classification: understanding hierarchical structures (local vs. state/central) and identifying the core function of a decentralized administrative system.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Hierarchical Confusion:** Students often believe all power resides with the District Magistrate or State Government, leading them to think the Panchayati Raj is just a branch office rather than "self-governance." This would likely lead to a partially correct but incomplete answer.
*   **Function Misconception:** Many students associate the Panchayat only with dispute resolution (Judicial) rather than administrative development.
*   **Scale Misconception:** Confusion between "Gram Sabha," "Panchayat," and "Zila Parishad."

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   **Contextual Familiarity:** For students from rural or economically weaker backgrounds, the "Panchayat" is a visible, tangible reality. They see the Pradhan or Sarpanch.
*   **Key Terms:** The term "Panchayati Raj" is a high-frequency term in both Hindi and English Social Science curricula.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options, students must retrieve and construct the phrase "local self-government" or "grassroots development," which is linguistically demanding for those with limited English proficiency.
*   **Keyword Requirement:** The rubric requires the concept of "primary role." Students might list specific activities (building roads, wells) instead of the overarching role (governance/administration), which might fail the specific rubric depending on how strictly "primary role" is interpreted.
*   **Language Barrier:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may understand the concept perfectly as "स्थानीय स्वशासन" (Sthaniya Swashasan) but struggle to translate this into the English academic vocabulary required.

Step 5: Holistic Estimate.
The familiarity of the subject matter in the Indian rural context provides a strong baseline. However, the requirement to produce an abstract definition in English (which acts as a "math-like" barrier of formal notation/expression) will significantly lower the "fully correct" rate for students from economically weaker sections.
