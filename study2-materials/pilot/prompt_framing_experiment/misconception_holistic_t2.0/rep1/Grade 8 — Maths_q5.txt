### Step 1: Mathematical Concepts and Skills Required
*   **Identification of Common Factor:** Recognizing that $9/16$ is common to both terms.
*   **Distributive Property (Factoring):** Understanding the structure $ab + ac = a(b + c)$.
*   **Rational Number Arithmetic:** Adding fractions with unlike denominators, specifically handling positive and negative values.
*   **Simplification:** Reducing fractions (e.g., $4/12$ to $1/3$ and $-3/9$ to $-1/3$) to make the arithmetic manageable.

### Step 2: Common Misconceptions
*   **Order of Operations vs. Specific Property:** Students often ignore the "Using distributive property" instruction and solve via direct multiplication. Since the rubric specifically requires applying the property, a student who calculates $36/192 - 27/144$ correctly but doesn't show the factoring step would fail the rubric.
*   **Signs in Rational Numbers:** Mismanaging the $+ (-x)$ transition. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Additive Inverse:** Students might not notice that $4/12$ (1/3) and $-3/9$ (-1/3) sum to zero, causing calculation errors in a step that should be trivial.

### Step 3: Factors Making the Item Easier
*   **Explicit Instruction:** The prompt explicitly tells the student which property to use ("Using the distributive property").
*   **Mathematical "Coincidence":** The numbers are designed to collapse. $4/12 = 1/3$ and $3/9 = 1/3$. The term inside the parentheses becomes $(1/3 - 1/3) = 0$. Students who notice this can bypass difficult common denominator calculations.
*   **Familiar Structure:** This specific type of problem is a staple in the NCERT Class 8 Mathematics textbook.

### Step 4: Factors Making the Item Harder
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, "Distributive Property" (वितरण गुणधर्म) is a technical term they may know in Hindi but fail to recognize quickly in English.
*   **Fraction Fluency:** Grade 8 students in these contexts often struggle with fractions (Rational Numbers), particularly when nested within a multi-step property problem.
*   **The Negative Sign:** The inclusion of brackets and a negative sign `{9/16 \times (-3/9)}` increases the cognitive load.

### Step 5: Holistic Estimate
While the problem "collapses" to zero (making it mathematically "simple"), the rubric is strict about the *application* of the property. For students from economically weaker sections with English language barriers, the jump from procedural arithmetic to structural property identification is often the "bottleneck" in Grade 8. Many will attempt to multiply the fractions directly.
