Step 1: Although this is a Social Science (Geography) question, it requires the mathematical concept of **sequential processing/cycle logic** and the ability to link causal relationships (Process A $\rightarrow$ Process B). In the context of the curriculum, it requires understanding a "state change" from a solid to particles.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
*   **The "Melting" Fallacy:** Students often think all rock transitions involve melting or heat (Magma). On this item, this leads to an incorrect answer as it bypasses the "sediment" stage.
*   **Immediate Transformation:** Students may think rocks turn into other rocks instantly rather than through intermediary steps.
*   **Vocabulary Confusion:** Confusing "Sedimentary" with "Metamorphic."

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
*   The rock cycle is a core, frequently repeated diagram in Indian textbooks (NCERT).
*   The prompt specifies the starting and ending points (Igneous to Sedimentary), narrowing the focus.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, technical English terms like "weathering," "erosion," and "transportation" are significant hurdles. They might know the process in Hindi (अपक्षय/अपरदन) but struggle to express it in English.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options, students must recall and articulate the mechanism (breaking down/moving) rather than just identifying a label.
*   **Precision:** The rubric specifically requires mentioning the "break down/sediment" phase, which is often skipped by students who move directly to the name of the new rock.

Step 5: Given the English language barrier and the specific requirement of the rubric for the "process" rather than just the "result," many students will fail to earn the full point despite having a general idea of the cycle.
