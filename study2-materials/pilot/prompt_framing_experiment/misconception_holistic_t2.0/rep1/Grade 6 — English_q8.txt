Step 1: Identify the concepts and skills required.
*   Understanding Sentence Structure: Recognition of the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern in English.
*   Parts of Speech: Identifying the pronoun (He), the auxiliary verb (is), the present participle (reading), the article (a), and the noun (book).
*   Syntactic Logic: The ability to determine that a "person" (He) performs the "action" (reading) upon an "object" (book).
*   Syntactic Ordering: Placing the auxiliary verb before the main verb in the continuous tense.

Step 2: Common misconceptions at this grade level.
*   Mother Tongue Interference (L1 to L2): In Hindi (SOV structure), the verb comes at the end. A student might try "He a book reading is," leading to an incorrect answer.
*   Misplacement of Auxiliary Verb: Putting "is" after the action (He reading is a book). This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   Random Stringing: Placing words in an arbitrary order without grammatical logic.

Step 3: Factors making the item easier.
*   Familiar Context: "Reading a book" is a common phrase used in early English pedagogy and textbooks.
*   Simple Vocabulary: All five words are high-frequency, basic sight words for Grade 6 students.
*   Minimal Components: Only five words are provided, limiting the total number of possible permutations compared to longer sentences.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   Open-ended Format: No multiple-choice options provided, meaning the student must construct the syntax entirely from memory.
*   Language Barrier: For students from economically weaker backgrounds or Hindi-medium roots, English grammar rules (like the position of 'is') are often memorized as abstract rules rather than internalized through exposure.
*   Articles: Proper placement of "a" can sometimes be confusing for L1 Hindi speakers, though here it is linked clearly to "book."

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
Given that this specific sentence structure is a "foundation stone" of English primary education in India (Continuous Tense) and the vocabulary is extremely simple, many students will recognize it as a familiar pattern from their textbooks. However, the Hindi-to-English transition (SOV vs SVO) remains a significant hurdle for those with low English exposure.
