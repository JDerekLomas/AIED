Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is a language assessment task (English), not a mathematical one. The skills required are vocabulary recall, understanding semantic relationships (similarity vs. opposition), and spelling.

Step 2: List common misconceptions.
*   **Confusing Synonym and Antonym:** Students may swap the definitions, providing a word with the opposite meaning for the synonym and vice versa. This would lead to an incorrect answer.
*   **Phonetic Over-generalization:** Hindi-medium students often confuse "Quiet" with "Quite." They may provide a synonym/antonym for "Quite" (e.g., "Very" or "Fully"), leading to an incorrect answer.
*   **Contextual limitations:** Students might understand "quiet" in a classroom context (Silent) but struggle to find a formal antonym like "Noisy" or "Loud" in written English.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
*   "Quiet" is a high-frequency, basic vocabulary word introduced early in English language learning.
*   The classroom environment frequently uses this word ("Keep quiet"), making the concept familiar even to those with low proficiency.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
*   **Open-ended format:** Without options (MCQs), students must recall and spell words correctly. For Hindi-medium students, translating the concept from Hindi (Shaant/Shor) back to English (Silent/Noisy) adds a layer of cognitive load.
*   **English Proficiency:** For economically weaker sections with limited exposure to English outside school, the distinction between "synonym" and "antonym" as technical terms is often a significant hurdle. They might know the words but not know which label refers to "same" or "opposite."
*   **Binary Rubric:** The rubric requires both parts to be correct for 1 mark (implied by "Maximum score: 1" for both parts), leaving no room for partial credit if one is swapped or misspelled.

Step 5: Holistically estimating the proportion of correct responses.
Given the English-language barrier in Indian government schools (where terms like "synonym/antonym" are often stumbling blocks even if the word "quiet" is understood), and the common confusion between quiet/quite, the success rate is moderate to low.
