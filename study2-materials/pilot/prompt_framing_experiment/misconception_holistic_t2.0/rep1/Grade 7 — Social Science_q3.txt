Step 1: This is a Social Science item. While it does not require mathematical calculation, it requires the logical skill of **application** (applying an abstract legal/constitutional concept to a concrete scenario).

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
*   **Equality vs. Sameness:** Thinking equality means everyone must have the exact same things, rather than the same rights/opportunities. (Could lead to incorrect or confusing examples).
*   **Government vs. Constitution:** Difficulty distinguishing between a specific leader's actions and constitutional rights.
*   **Scope of Equality:** Belief that equality only applies to voting (Universal Adult Franchise) and not to social interactions or schooling.

Step 3: Factors making it easier:
*   **Flexible Rubric:** The "OR" condition in the rubric is extremely generous; a student only needs to explain the concept OR provide an example to get full credit.
*   **Familiarity:** Equality is a core pillar of the Grade 7 Civics curriculum in India (Chapter: "On Equality").
*   **Low Linguistic Barrier for Content:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds likely understand "Samanta" (Equality) well even if they struggle to frame a complex English sentence.

Step 4: Factors making it harder:
*   **English Proficiency:** For students with limited English, "Guaranteed," "Constitution," and "Concept" are high-level academic terms that may prevent them from understanding what the question is asking.
*   **Open-ended format:** There is no scaffolding or multiple-choice options to prompt their memory.
*   **Daily life translation:** Connecting school book definitions to real-world observations requires a higher level of cognitive processing than rote memorization.

Step 5: Holistic estimate: Because the rubric allows for *either* a basic definition or an example, and because the Mid-day Meal scheme or voting lines are heavily emphasized in Indian textbooks as standard examples, many students will capture at least one of the two requirements despite language barriers.
