Step 1: The task requires an understanding of grammatical transformations (active to passive voice). Specifically:
*   Identifying the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure.
*   Identifying verb tenses (Simple Past in sentence A, Present Perfect in sentence B).
*   Applying the rules of "be + past participle" and the addition of the "by" agent.
*   Note: While this is an English language item, the logic involves structural patterns analogous to algorithmic transformations.

Step 2: Common misconceptions include:
*   **Subject-Object confusion:** Difficulty distinguishing between who does the action and what receives it. (Will lead to an incorrect answer).
*   **Tense Maintenance:** Failing to match the auxiliary "to be" verb to the original tense (e.g., using "is prepared" instead of "was prepared"). (Will lead to an incorrect answer).
*   **Irregular Past Participles:** Misspelling or misidentifying the third form of the verb (find-found-found). (Will lead to an incorrect answer).
*   **Word Order issues:** Translating directly from Hindi grammar (SOV) rather than English (SVO), which creates "A delicious meal the chef prepared." (Will lead to an incorrect answer).

Step 3: Easier factors:
*   The vocabulary ("chef," "meal," "king") is relatively common in standard English textbooks used in India.
*   Passive voice is a heavily drilled "rote" exercise in 8th-grade grammar modules in government schools.

Step 4: Harder factors:
*   **Bilingual Interference:** For Hindi-medium students, "Passive Voice" is conceptually different in their native tongue; direct translation leads to errors.
*   **Complexity of Tense (B):** Sentence B uses "has found" (Present Perfect), requiring the student to use "has been found." This is significantly harder than Simple Past.
*   **Linguistic Barrier:** Students from economically weaker sections often have lower exposure to "Natural English" and rely purely on classroom rules which they may forget.
*   **No Scaffolding:** There are no options (Multiple Choice), requiring perfect recall of structure and spelling.

Step 5: Holistically, despite being a standard textbook topic, the transition from simple past (A) to perfect tense (B) combined with limited English fluency and no choice-based support makes the likelihood of full accuracy (correctly doing both, even if the rubric only mentions A) quite low.
