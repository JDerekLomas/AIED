Step 1: Identify mathematical concepts and skills.
Students must interpret data presented in a table. They must compare quantities (time) and understand the inverse relationship between "fastest" and "duration": the smallest numerical value represents the highest speed/fastest process. Basic unit comparison (minutes/hours) and numerical ordering are required.

Step 2: Common misconceptions.
*   **Direct proportionality bias:** Many students believe a larger number always represents "more" or "better." This would lead them to choose Liquid C (highest number) as the "fastest." This is highly likely to cause an incorrect answer for part (a).
*   **Reading comprehension (Linguistic):** Hindi-medium students may confuse "fastest" (sabse tez) with "takes more time" (zyada samay) if they rely on keywords without understanding the physical process of evaporation.

Step 3: Factors making it easier.
The substances mentioned (Petrol, Water, Salt water) are familiar to students from economically weaker backgrounds. The table format is a standard way of presenting information in Indian NCERT-aligned curriculum. Part (a) is a straightforward retrieval of data.

Step 4: Factors making it harder.
The lack of options (open-ended) forces students to write in English, which can be a barrier for Hindi-medium learners. Part (b) requires explaining a physical mechanism (impurities/solute lowering vapor pressure), which is often abstract for 7th graders. The core difficulty lies in the inverse logic of time vs. speed; students frequently equate "highest value" with "fastest."

Step 5: Holistic estimate.
While identifying the fastest liquid seems simple, the inverse relationship between time and rate is a significant hurdle for this demographic, combined with the English language barrier for the explanation in part (b).
