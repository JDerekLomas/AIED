Step 1: Identify the mathematical concepts and skills required.
This is an English Language Arts (ELA) question, not a mathematical one. However, it requires linguistic categorization, analytical thinking, and vocabulary retrieval. In a broader cognitive sense, it requires "pattern recognition" of a writer's tone and "classification" of text into descriptive categories.

Step 2: List the most common misconceptions students at this grade level hold about these concepts.
1. Confusing "style" with "story/content": Students may describe what happens in the poem rather than how it is written. (Lead to incorrect answer)
2. Identifying the poet's emotion rather than the writing style: Saying the poet is "sad" instead of "descriptive." (Lead to incorrect answer)
3. Difficulty with abstract vocabulary: Knowing a poem is easy to read but lacking the English word "simple" or "direct" to label it. (Lead to incorrect answer)

Step 3: Consider factors that make the item easier:
- The rubric allows for a wide range of synonyms (e.g., "easy," "clear").
- If the poem studied in class was explicitly discussed as having a certain style, this becomes a rote recall task rather than an analysis task.
- Short, one-word responses are less intimidating than full sentences for ESL learners.

Step 4: Consider factors that make it harder:
- Language barrier: "Writing style" is a complex meta-linguistic concept for students transitioning from Hindi to English.
- Open-ended format: There are no options to choose from (unlike a multiple-choice question), which is difficult for students with limited active vocabulary.
- Subjectivity: Literary analysis is more abstract than computational tasks.
- Background: Students from economically weaker sections may have less exposure to literary critique terms.

Step 5: Weighing ALL factors holistically:
For Grade 7 students in this demographic, "writing style" is a very high-order academic term. While some may use the word "simple," many will likely summarize the poem's topic instead of describing the style. Without a word bank, the production of an appropriate descriptive adjective in English is a significant barrier.
