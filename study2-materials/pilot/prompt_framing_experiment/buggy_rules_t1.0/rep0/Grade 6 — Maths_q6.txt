Step 1: Procedural steps required:
1. Recall the formula for the area of a rectangle ($L \times W$).
2. Substitute the values ($5 \times 4$) and perform multiplication to get $20$.
3. Recall the formula for the area of a square ($Side \times Side$).
4. Substitute the values ($5 \times 5$) and perform multiplication to get $25$.
5. Perform a comparative judgment to identify which value is "greater."
6. Calculate the difference (subtraction: $25 - 20 = 5$).
7. Include correct units (sq. cm) as per the rubric's expectation for a full mark.

Step 2: Potential "Buggy Rules" and systematic errors:
- Area-Perimeter Confusion: Calculating $2(L+W)$ or $4 \times Side$ instead of area.
- Additive Error: Adding the dimensions given in the prompt ($5+4=9$ and $5+5=10$) instead of multiplying.
- Formula Misapplication: Using $L \times W$ for the square but perhaps only using one dimension (treating it as a line) or doubling the side ($5 \times 2$) instead of squaring it.
- "By how much" neglect: Providing only the name of the shape (Square) without the numerical difference.
- Language Barrier: Misinterpreting "greater" or "by how much" due to English-as-Second-Language (ESL) constraints.

Step 3: Population considerations:
In Grade 6 (Indian Govt Schools), students are transitioning from concrete arithmetic to formal geometry. While the multiplication is simple, the multi-step nature of the "compare and find difference" task in an open-ended format is high-stakes. The rubric is binary (Max score 1), meaning any error in any of the 6-7 steps results in a 0.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis:
While many students will correctly identify that $25 > 20$, a significant portion will fail to execute all steps perfectly (especially the "by how much" part or the area/perimeter distinction). Given the binary scoring and the language-heavy phrasing for a Hindi-medium student, the success rate is typically low.
