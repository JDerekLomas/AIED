Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall the specific technical term for the instrument used for human body temperature ("clinical thermometer").
2. Recall the specific structural difference between clinical and laboratory thermometers (presence of a "kink" or constriction).
3. Connect the structural feature to its function (prevents backflow of mercury).
4. Translate these scientific concepts from Hindi/Internalized knowledge into English sentences.
5. Synthesize the "why" into a comparative statement (explaining why the lab thermometer is unsuitable due to immediate reading drops).

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. **Generalization Error:** Assuming "thermometer" is the specific name (failure to provide the subtype "clinical").
2. **Category Error:** Confusing "Clinical" with "Laboratory" due to the phonetic or contextual similarity in a school setting.
3. **The "Mercury Drop" Bug:** Knowing the reading drops but attributing it to the environment rather than the lack of a kink in a lab thermometer.
4. **Linguistic Approximation:** Using descriptive but non-technical language (e.g., "doctor thermometer" or "small thermometer") which may fail the strict rubric.
5. **Functional Misconception:** Believing lab thermometers are simply "too big" or "for chemicals only" rather than identifying the procedural impossibility of reading them outside the body.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Language Barrier:** EL learners often struggle to articulate the "why" component in English even if they understand the concept.
2. **Recall vs. Recognition:** Without options (A, B, C, D), students cannot rely on familiar patterns; they must retrieve "kink" or "constriction" from long-term memory.
3. **Low ROI:** At a weight of only 0.5 marks for a two-part complex explanation, students may put less effort into the "why" section or skip it entirely.
