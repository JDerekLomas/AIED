Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the written English question ("Who", "lived", "inside").
2. Retrieve the specific narrative detail from long-term memory (discriminating between the book itself and characters *in* the story).
3. Map the semantic concept of "fairy" to the English label.
4. Formulate a written response (ranging from a single word to a syntactically correct sentence).
5. Align the retrieved answer with the specific imagery of the text (ensuring the "fairy" is the one "inside" the book, not just a character in the plot).

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules"
1. Literalism Bug: Answering with the name of a person who literally owns or reads the book (e.g., "the boy") because humans live in houses, not books.
2. Keyword Matching Bug: Seeing "Who lived" and retrieving the main character or the setting (e.g., "in a village") rather than the specific entity "inside the book."
3. L1 Interference Bug: Translating the concept correctly in Hindi (परी/Pari) but failing to retrieve the English phoneme/grapheme "Fairy."
4. Copying Bug: Extracting a random noun from the question or a nearby text passage because the student cannot decode the prompt.
5. Syntax Over-generalization: Attempting a full sentence ("The fairy live inside...") but failing to produce the specific keyword "fairy" required by the rubric.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students in this context often face a "reading-to-learn" gap. While the rubric is lenient (accepting "fairy"), the open-ended recall format is significantly harder than multiple-choice for English Language Learners (ELLs). Students from economically weaker sections may have limited access to the specific storybook outside of school hours, making memory retrieval the primary bottleneck.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement for specific noun recall in a second language and the high probability of "Keyword Matching" errors where students name the protagonist instead of the magical entity, the success rate is likely below the halfway mark.
