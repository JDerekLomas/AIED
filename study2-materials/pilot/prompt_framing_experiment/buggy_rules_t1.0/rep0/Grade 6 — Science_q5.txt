Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the specific reagent required for a starch test (Iodine).
2. Describe the physical action (adding drops of iodine solution to the potato slice).
3. Identify the specific qualitative change (color change).
4. Recall the specific final color that indicates a positive result (blue-black).
5. Translate these scientific observations into English sentences.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. Reagent Confusion: Substituting "Iodine" with other common lab chemicals (e.g., "HCl," "Alcohol," or "Copper Sulphate") due to interference from other food test protocols (Protein/Fats).
2. Incomplete Observation: Stating the color changes to "blue" or "black" or "dark" instead of the scientifically standard "blue-black."
3. Causality Inversion: Stating that starch is added to iodine rather than iodine to the potato.
4. Language Shadowing: Using vague Hindi-influenced English descriptors (e.g., "put liquid," "color change happen") which may fail to meet "describe" criteria depending on the rigor of the grader.
5. Procedure Skipping: Mentioning only the reagent or only the color without describing the "procedure" (the act of adding/dropping).

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 6 is the introductory year for formal laboratory chemistry in the Indian curriculum. For students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, the cognitive load of retrieving the specific English term "Iodine" and "Blue-black" while constructing a "Describe" response (recall) rather than a "Circle the answer" (recognition) is high. The transition from home language to English terminology often leads to "tip-of-the-tongue" phenomenon where the student knows the test involves a "medicine-like liquid" but cannot name it.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
While the rubric is relatively generous (focusing on the mention of iodine), the requirement to describe a procedure and state an observation in a second language for 11-year-olds leads to significant attrition in accuracy.
