Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English prompt into Hindi/native conceptual framework to identify the object (lion on currency).
2. **Visual/Conceptual Mapping**: Associate the image on the currency with the specific historical artifact (Lion Capital of Ashoka).
3. **Fact Retrieval**: Recall the specific nomenclature "Lion Capital" and the ruler "Ashoka."
4. **Symbolic Association**: Connect the historical artifact to its modern legal status as the "National Emblem."
5. **Synthesis and Encoding**: Formulate an English sentence that links the historical origin to the symbolic significance.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules" / Errors
1. **Mislabeling (Generalization Bug)**: Identifying the lions as symbols of "bravery" or "strength" (semantic association) rather than the specific historical/national identifier.
2. **Source Confusion (Contextual Bug)**: Stating they are there because "lions live in India" or "to make the note look good" (utilitarian/literal reasoning).
3. **Partial Recall (Incomplete Rule)**: Identifying Ashoka but failing to mention the National Emblem, or vice versa (insufficient for the 1-point rubric).
4. **Language Transfer Error**: Knowing the answer in Hindi ("Ashok Stambh") but being unable to translate "Emblem" or "Capital" into English, leading to an abandoned or incoherent response.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 6 is the transition year to more formal history. In Indian government schools, "National Symbols" are often taught via rote memorization. However, the requirement to explain "Why" in English for a student from an economically weaker section (EWS) often creates a "double burden": the cognitive load of historical retrieval plus the linguistic load of English syntax. Many students will provide a correct "General Knowledge" fact that does not align with the technical requirements of the rubric.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is foundational, the combination of open-ended recall (no options), technical vocabulary ("Lion Capital," "National Emblem"), and the English language barrier for Hindi-medium students significantly lowers the success rate for a fully correct 1-point response.
