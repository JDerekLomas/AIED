Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English sentence structure "Do you think...?" and identify the subject (the King's questions).
2. Retrieve the specific three questions from the story "The Three Questions" (Leo Tolstoy) via recall.
3. Map the literary context (1. When is the right time? 2. Who are the right people? 3. What is the most important thing to do?) onto the concept of "real life."
4. Evaluate the utility of these questions (Judgment formation).
5. Formulate a reason in English (Subject-Verb-Object alignment).
6. Transcribe the thought into written English with basic grammatical coherence.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. The "Literal Meaning Bug": Translating "important" as "vajan" (weight) or "zaroori" (necessary) but failing to connect it to decision-making, leading to a "Yes" without a valid reason.
2. The "Copy-Paste Bug": Extracting a random sentence from the provided reading passage that contains the word "king" or "questions" regardless of its relevance to the "real life" prompt.
3. The "Agreement Bug": Answering "Yes, I think" but providing a reason that describes the story plot (e.g., "Because king wants to know") rather than an application to real life.
4. The "Language Transfer Bug": Thinking the reason in Hindi (e.g., "Samay ka pata hona chahiye") but failing to find the English functional equivalent, resulting in an unintelligible or blank response.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 7 students from economically weaker sections often face a "threshold effect" in English. While they may understand the story's gist in Hindi, the leap from recognition (identifying the king) to production (generating an original reason in English) is steep. The open-ended nature of "Give one reason" removes the safety net of multiple-choice cues.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The requirement to synthesize literary recall with abstract real-world application, while overcoming significant language barriers, makes this a high-difficulty task for this demographic. Many will likely provide a "Yes" (binary choice) but fail the "reason" component required by the rubric for the full point.
