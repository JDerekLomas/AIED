Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the English vocabulary (stunted, yellowing, infer, evidence).
2. Link the physical symptoms (yellowing/stunted growth) to biological concepts (chlorosis, lack of photosynthesis, nutrient uptake).
3. Retrieve specific causal factors from memory (Nitrogen, sunlight, or water).
4. Formulate a sentence in English that connects the symptom to the deficiency (inference).

Step 2: Potential "Buggy Rules":
1. Over-generalization of "Water": Students may apply the "water is life" rule to all plant problems, ignoring specific symptoms like "yellowing."
2. Literal Interpretation/Tautology: Restating the question as the answer (e.g., "The plant is not healthy").
3. Linguistic Substitution: Using a local language term (Hindi) for "nutrients" but being unable to translate it, leading to a blank or fragmented English response.
4. Misattribution of Cause: Attributing growth issues to external physical damage (e.g., "someone stepped on it") rather than internal physiological needs.

Step 3: Student context:
Grade 6 is a transitional year where academic vocabulary increases. For Hindi-medium students in EWS contexts, "infer" and "stunted" are high-tier academic words. While students may intuitively know plants need water/sun, the open-ended "Explain" format requires productive language skills which are significantly lower than receptive skills in this demographic.

Step 4: Holistic estimate:
The combination of specific vocabulary demands (English) and the requirement for an "inference" (a high-level cognitive skill) rather than simple recall makes this challenging for the demographic. While the rubric is generous, the language barrier and the shift from recognition to production will likely result in a lower success rate.
