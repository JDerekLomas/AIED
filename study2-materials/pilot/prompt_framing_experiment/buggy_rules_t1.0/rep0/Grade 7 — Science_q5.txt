Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the academic vocabulary in English ("Differentiate," "Autotrophic," "Heterotrophic," "Nutrition").
2. Retrieve the conceptual definition of "Autotrophic" (self-nourishment/photosynthesis).
3. Retrieve the conceptual definition of "Heterotrophic" (consumption of others).
4. Map the prefix "Auto-" to "Self" and "Hetero-" to "Other" to ensure correct pairing.
5. Retrieve/Generate one specific example for each category (e.g., Green plants, Human/Lion).
6. Construct a comparative sentence or table in English that expresses the functional difference.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. **Semantic Swap:** Correctly defining both but swapping the labels (defining autotrophs as heterotrophs).
2. **The "Food" Ambiguity:** Defining autotrophs as "making food" but confusing this with the domestic act of "cooking food" (attributing autotrophy to humans who cook).
3. **Example-Definition Mismatch:** Providing a correct definition but an incorrect example (e.g., "Autotrophs make their own food, like a Lion").
4. **Keyword Dependency:** Only providing the keywords ("plants" and "animals") without explaining the *mode* of nutrition as requested.
5. **Language Interference:** Understanding the concept in Hindi (Svaposhi/Parposhi) but failing to retrieve the specific English phonemes, leading to blank answers or "Hinglish" approximations.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students from economically weaker backgrounds often face high linguistic barriers. The question is open-ended, requiring active recall and English syntax construction rather than simple recognition (MCQ). While this is a foundational "rote" concept in the Indian NCERT curriculum, the requirement to provide both definitions *and* examples for a single mark makes the "all-or-nothing" rubric (Max score 1) quite punishing for students with partial knowledge.
