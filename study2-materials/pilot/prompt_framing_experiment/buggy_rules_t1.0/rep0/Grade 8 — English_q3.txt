Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. **Decoding/Translation**: Interpret the question syntax (What + did + [verb] + mean) and translate the keyword "mean" (meaning/significance) into L1 (Hindi: *kya matlab tha*).
2. **Information Retrieval**: Locate the specific passage segment related to Anika and drawing (long-term memory or text-based search).
3. **Conceptual Mapping**: Distinguish between the "surface activity" (hobby/drawing) and the "internal state" (expressing feelings).
4. **Syntactic Encoding**: Formulate an English sentence using correct tense (past tense "meant" or "was") and complex structures ("more than," "way of").
5. **Vocabulary Selection**: Retrieve high-level abstract terms like "expressing," "thoughts," or "feelings" (productive vocabulary).

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. **The "Copy-Paste" Bug**: Copying any sentence from the text containing the word "drawing" or "Anika" regardless of whether it explains meaning.
2. **The "Direct Definition" Bug**: Defining drawing literally (e.g., "Anika used a pencil to draw") instead of its significance.
3. **The "L1-L2 Transliteration" Bug**: Writing the answer in Hindi or using Hindi syntax with English words ("Anika for drawing hobby not").
4. **The "Tense-Shift" Bug**: Incorrectly using "mean" instead of "meant" or "is" instead of "was," often leading to structural collapse in the sentence.
5. **The "Keyword Over-reliance" Bug**: Providing a one-word answer like "hobby" which contradicts the rubric’s requirement for "more than a hobby."

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **EWS/Hindi-medium context**: High discrepancy between receptive and productive English vocabulary.
2. **Open-ended vs. MCQ**: Lack of scaffolding (recognition) makes retrieval of abstract nouns ("thoughts," "feelings") significantly harder than selecting them.
3. **Subjectivity of "Meaning"**: In many Indian government school contexts, students are trained for factual retrieval (Who/Where) rather than interpretive retrieval (What did X mean).

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
The rubric requires a two-part conceptual bridge: it wasn't just a hobby AND it was for feelings. For an L2 learner with limited English proficiency, articulating "expressing thoughts and feelings" without grammatical collapse is a high-threshold task. While many might understand the sentiment, the procedural execution of writing it in English to meet the 1-mark rubric is a significant barrier.
