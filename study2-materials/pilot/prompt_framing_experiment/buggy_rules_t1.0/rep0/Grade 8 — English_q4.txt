Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Read and comprehend the prompt "Find a word from the passage that means 'a light wind'" (L2 English decoding).
2. Scan the passage text to identify the specific phrase "a light wind" or synonyms.
3. Map the conceptual definition ("a light wind") to the specific vocabulary word ("breeze") located within the text.
4. Verify that the word "breeze" exists verbatim in the passage (constraint satisfaction).
5. Transcribe the word "breeze" accurately onto the answer sheet.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" / procedural errors
1. **Keyword Matching Bug:** Student searches for the word "light" or "wind" in the passage and extracts the word immediately following or preceding it, regardless of meaning.
2. **Prior Knowledge Intrusion:** Student provides a synonym they know (e.g., "air," "fan," "cool") that is not actually present in the provided text.
3. **Literalism Bug:** Student copies the entire sentence containing the word instead of identifying the specific single word requested.
4. **Phonetic/Orthographic Approximation:** Student finds the word but misspells it (e.g., "breze," "braze"), which may lead to 0 marks depending on rubric strictness.
5. **Scanning Exhaustion:** Student stops at the first "w" word or "l" word found in the text due to limited reading stamina.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 8 students in this context often face a "threshold" issue where their functional English vocabulary is significantly below grade level. In many Indian government schools, English is taught as a subject rather than used as a medium, leading to high "word blindness" during scanning tasks. "Breeze" is a specific Tier 2 vocabulary word that may not be in the active or passive vocabulary of a student from an economically weaker section with limited English exposure outside school.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the task is a standard "find the synonym" item, the shift from recognition (Multiple Choice) to production/recall (Open-ended) significantly increases the difficulty for L2 learners. The requirement to locate a specific word within a block of text, rather than choosing it from a list, introduces multiple failure points in the scanning and mapping process.
