Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall the definition of LCM (Least Common Multiple) and distinguish it from HCF (Highest Common Factor).
2. Set up a division table or prime factorization trees for 12, 15, and 20.
3. Perform sequential division using prime numbers (2, 3, 5).
4. Correct dividend reduction: If a number is not divisible, it must be "brought down" unchanged.
5. Continue until all quotients are 1.
6. Multiply the resulting divisors (factors) correctly to find the final product.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "HCF for LCM" Bug: Students perform the procedure but stop once no single prime divides all three numbers, or simply list common factors.
2. "Bringing Down" Bug: Students may try to force-divide a non-divisible number (e.g., 15/2 = 7) or skip it entirely.
3. "Prime-only" Violation: Using composite numbers like 4 or 6 as divisors, which can lead to missing factors.
4. "Incomplete Multiplication": Correctly identifying the prime factors but failing to multiply them all together, or making a basic multiplication error in the final step.
5. "Addition instead of Multiplication": Adding the prime factors instead of multiplying them.

Step 3: Population Context
Grade 6 is the introductory year for formal LCM algorithms in this curriculum. Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the acronym "L.C.M." if the concept hasn't been bridged to "Laghuttam Samapavartak" (लघुत्तम समापवर्त्य). Given the open-ended nature and the multi-step multiplication required, the probability of a "slippage" (random error) or a "bug" (systematic error) is high.

Step 4: Holistic Estimation
While the procedure is a staple of the curriculum, the transition from rote memorization to procedural fluency is often incomplete in under-resourced settings. The combination of multiplication errors and the confusion between HCF/LCM procedures typically results in a significant "funnel" effect where students lose marks at various stages.
