Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Visual Recognition: Decode the visual cues in the picture to identify the specific iconography of Rajasthani deities (specifically the idols of Isar and Gangaur).
2. Semantic Retrieval: Recall the specific name of the festival from long-term memory (Gangaur) without a word bank.
3. Language Encoding: Formulate a description of the ritualistic practices (pujas, processions, dressing of idols) in English, as per the medium of instruction.
4. Orthographic Execution: Correctly spell the festival name and construct syntactically coherent sentences.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. Visual Overgeneralization: Identifying any Rajasthani festival as "Teej" or "Pushkar Mela" due to overlapping cultural markers (vibrant clothing, idols).
2. Phonetic Approximation (Spelling): Spelling "Gangaur" as "Gaugor," "Gongor," or "Gangore," which may be penalized depending on strictness.
3. Language Switching Interference: Conceptualizing the answer in Hindi but failing to translate "pujan" or "visarjan" into English, leading to incomplete or abandoned responses.
4. Description Omission: Providing the name but failing to "describe how" because the cognitive load of identifying the image exhausts the student's focus (a common "stop-at-first-success" bug).

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often face a "literacy-language gap." While they likely possess the cultural capital to recognize the festival, the transition from recognition (knowing it's Gangaur) to formal English description is a high hurdle. The low point value (0.5) further disincentivizes the effort required for a multi-sentence description.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the cultural familiarity is high, the open-ended requirement to describe the "how" in English, combined with the lack of scaffolding for Hindi-medium students, significantly lowers the success rate for a "fully correct" response according to a formal rubric.
