Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Scan the table to identify the variable "Time Taken" across three categories (A, B, C).
2. Compare the numerical values associated with time (e.g., 5 mins, 15 mins, 45 mins).
3. Apply the inverse relationship logic: "Fastest" = "Shortest/Least Time" (Mathematical-Scientific mapping).
4. Extract the label "Liquid A" or "Petrol" associated with the minimum value.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. Magnitude Mapping Bug: "Fastest/Most" = "Largest Number." The student selects Liquid C (45 mins) because 45 is the largest value in the set.
2. Labeling Confusion: Correctly identifies the minimum value (5 mins) but provides the label "Petrol" when the question asks "Which liquid" (minor, but can lead to hesitation) or provides the time "5 mins" instead of the name of the liquid.
3. Language Processing Bug: Misinterpreting "evaporate" or "fastest" due to limited English proficiency, leading to a random choice or a choice based on familiarity (e.g., choosing "Water" because it is a common word).

Step 3: Target student population considerations
- Grade 7 students are generally comfortable with basic inequalities (5 < 15 < 45).
- Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the word "fastest" in a temporal context, frequently conflating "more time" with "more speed."
- The "Shortest Time = Fastest" concept is a frequent stumbling block in early middle school science in India, where direct proportionality is the default mental model.
- Because part (a) is a precursor to a more difficult part (b), students may overthink the simplicity of the data.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the numerical comparison is simple, the "Largest Number = Fastest" buggy rule is extremely prevalent in this demographic (approximately 30-40% of students in these settings typically select the highest value). Language barriers further increase the noise in the data.
