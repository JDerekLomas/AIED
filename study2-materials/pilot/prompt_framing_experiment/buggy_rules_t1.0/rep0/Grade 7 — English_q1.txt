Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English question ("What," "three questions," "king").
2. Retrieve the specific narrative content from memory (Leo Tolstoy’s "Three Questions").
3. Translate internal concepts (often stored in L1/Hindi) back into English syntax.
4. Distinguish between the three distinct variables: Time, People, and Action.
5. Construct a grammatical sentence that satisfies the rubric's requirement for all three components.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. **The "Keyword Match" Bug:** Students identify "King" and "Questions" and transcribe the first three questions they find in the text, even if they are questions asked *to* the king by others.
2. **The "List Completion" Bug:** Students remember the "Right Time" (the most famous part) but fail to recall or distinguish "Right People" from "Right Action," conflating them into a single point.
3. **The "Syntactic Overload" Bug:** Due to limited English proficiency, the student understands the answer but fails to produce a legible sentence, resulting in a 0 based on strict rubric adherence.
4. **The "L1 Interference" Bug:** Translating "Right People" as "Good people" or "Right Action" as "Work," which may fall outside the rubric's specific criteria for a full point.

Step 3: Population Considerations
The open-ended format is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice for this demographic. While "Three Questions" is a standard Grade 7 NCERT text, the transition from Hindi-medium to English-medium assessment creates a "bottleneck" where cognitive load is split between content recall and language production. In a population from economically weaker sections, exposure to academic English outside the classroom is minimal, increasing the likelihood of "buggy" sentence construction.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that the rubric requires all three specific components for a single point (no partial credit mentioned) and the high linguistic barrier for this specific population:
