Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Read and decode the English text, overcoming the grammatical error ("has ate") and identifying the core premise.
2. Filter the provided information to identify what is present (fruits, vegetables) versus what is explicitly noted as absent (milk).
3. Map "milk" to its nutritional category (Calcium/Protein) or recognize it as the missing "component" requested by the prompt.
4. Synthesize the second part of the prompt ("Prepare diet chart") with the first part, determining if the "Maximum score: 1" applies only to the identification or the construction task.
5. Formulate a written response in English (or a mix of Hindi/English) that matches the rubric's requirement.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. "The Completion Bug": Students answer only the first question ("Milk") and ignore the second instruction ("Prepare diet chart") because the rubric only rewards the first part, or vice-versa.
2. "Category Error": Students list a specific vitamin (e.g., Vitamin C) because they associate "health" with vitamins generally, rather than linking milk to calcium/protein.
3. "The Language Interference Bug": Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle to translate the concept of a "diet chart" or "missing component" into a formal response, leading to a blank or irrelevant answer.
4. "The Reality Bug": Students might answer based on what they *actually* eat (which may not include milk due to economic constraints) rather than the theoretical "balanced diet" expected by the curriculum.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students in this demographic often face a "threshold effect" where their conceptual understanding of nutrition is higher than their ability to express it in English. Since the question is open-ended (recall) rather than multiple-choice (recognition), the cognitive load is significantly higher. The dual-task nature of the question (Identify + Prepare chart) for a single mark is highly confusing and often leads to incomplete responses.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the answer "milk" is literally in the question text, the complexity of the "diet chart" instruction and the linguistic barriers for English Language Learners in this demographic typically result in a high rate of partial or misplaced answers.
