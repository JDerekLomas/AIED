Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Visual Identification: Recognize the geometric properties of the figure (e.g., a parallelogram or a triangle within parallel lines).
2. Property Recall: Identify that opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal OR that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180° OR linear pair relationships.
3. Equation Formulation: Set up the equation (e.g., $x + 100 = 180$ or $x = 80$).
4. Arithmetic Execution: Perform subtraction/calculation correctly.
5. Justification: Articulate the geometric reason (e.g., "Adjacent angles are supplementary") in English/mathematical terms.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- "Equal-Angle Bias": Assuming all unknown angles in a quadrilateral are equal to the given angle ($x = 100$).
- "Linear Pair Overgeneralization": Treating any two visible angles as supplementary regardless of their spatial relationship.
- "Language-Logic Gap": Finding the correct numerical value through intuition but failing the "reason/calculation" rubric requirement due to limited English proficiency.
- "Operation Reversal": Adding the given angle to 180 instead of subtracting.

Step 3: Student Population Context
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face "The Fourth-Grade Slump" in geometry. While they may have intuitive spatial reasoning, the formalization (stating reasons) is a significant barrier. Open-ended questions in a second language (English) significantly increase the cognitive load, leading to "omission errors" where students find the number but skip the required "reason," resulting in a zero per the rubric.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement for both the correct value AND the written reason in a second language, many students who understand the concept will still fail the strict rubric.
