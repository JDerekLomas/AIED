Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Access the mental schema for "Fundamental Rights" (distinguishing them from duties, preamble features, or general laws).
2. Itemization: Recall at least two distinct items from the specific list of six (e.g., Equality, Liberty, Religion).
3. Linguistic Translation: Convert the conceptual understanding (likely stored in Hindi/Hinglish as "Samvidhan" or "Adhikar") into written English terms.
4. Validation: Verify that the two items are distinct and not overlapping (e.g., not listing "Right to Equality" and "Abolition of Untouchability" as two separate rights if they perceive them as the same).

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. Category Displacement (Substitution Error): Providing "Fundamental Duties" (e.g., "Respect the flag") instead of Rights.
2. Label Generalization (Semantic Bug): Using vague descriptors like "Freedom" or "Justice" without the technical "Right to..." prefix or specific constitutional phrasing.
3. The "Preamble Bug": Recalling keywords from the Preamble (Justice, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity) as the names of the Rights.
4. Language Interference (Translation Bug): Attempting to phonetically spell the English term based on Hindi pronunciation, leading to unrecognizable responses.
5. The "Single-Right" Truncation: Providing only one right due to working memory limitations or misreading the "any two" instruction.

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 8 students in EWS contexts often have high conceptual familiarity with the *existence* of the Constitution but struggle with technical English terminology. The "Open-ended Recall" format is significantly harder than a "Multiple Choice" format, as it requires active retrieval of specific academic vocabulary ("Exploitation," "Constitutional Remedies") rather than mere recognition.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While "Right to Equality" and "Right to Freedom" are high-frequency phrases in textbooks, the transition from Hindi-medium to English-medium assessment creates a bottleneck. The "Preamble Bug" and "Duties vs. Rights" confusion are very common systematic errors in Indian classrooms at this level.
