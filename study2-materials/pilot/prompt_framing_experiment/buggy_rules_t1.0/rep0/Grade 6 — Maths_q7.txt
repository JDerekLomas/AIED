Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Time Interval Calculation: Determine the duration between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM (12-hour cycle crossing).
2. Rate Multiplication: Multiply the elapsed time (6 hours) by the rate of increase (2°C/hr).
3. Addition: Add the total increase (12°C) to the initial temperature (30°C).

Step 2: Buggy Rules/Cognitive Obstacles
- "Subtraction Bug" (Time): Students may subtract 4 from 10 to get 6 by coincidence, or 10 from 4 (treating it as 10 - 4), but many will struggle with the 12-hour boundary, potentially calculating 10 to 4 as 4 hours (ignoring the 12-1-2-3-4 progression) or failing to convert 4:00 PM to 16:00.
- "Static Interpretation": Treating the "2°C per hour" as a one-time addition (30 + 2 = 32) rather than a rate.
- "Language Interference": In Hindi-medium contexts, the shift from "morning" to "evening" (PM) in an English-medium question may lead to a literal interpretation of digits without context of the diurnal cycle.
- "Calculation Slip": Basic multiplication or addition errors under time pressure.

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 6 students in this demographic often face challenges with English word problems. The rubric specifically rewards the intermediate step of "6 hours," but the question asks for the final temperature. In open-ended formats, the lack of scaffolding (multiple choice) significantly increases the error rate. The concept of "rate" (linear growth) is also a transitional concept in Grade 6.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While the calculation is simple (6 * 2 + 30), the multi-step nature of the word problem combined with the "PM/AM" transition and English language barriers for Hindi-medium learners creates high cognitive load. A significant portion of students will likely provide "32" (adding only once) or "38" (miscalculating hours as 4).
