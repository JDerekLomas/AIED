Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Recall the specific name of the microorganism associated with curd (Lactobacillus).
2. Transcribe/spell the scientific name "Lactobacillus" correctly in English.
3. Identify the biological classification/category (Bacteria).
4. Map the English terminology to the conceptual understanding (often learned in Hindi as "जीवाणु" / "Lactobacillus").

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. Over-generalization of "Virus": Assigning any microscopic pathogen or agent to the category of "Virus" due to its prevalence in common parlance.
2. Phonetic spelling errors: Producing "Lactobasila," "Lacto-plus," or "Lactobasillus" which may be marked wrong in strict rubrics.
3. Category mismatch: Providing the name but failing to provide the category (Bacteria) due to the two-part nature of the question.
4. Language interference: Knowing the function in Hindi but being unable to retrieve the technical English term under exam pressure.

Step 3: Population considerations:
1. Grade 8 students are expected to know this, but open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice recognition.
2. Economic and language barriers often lead to "rote-learning gaps" where the student remembers "curd" and "milk" but the specific scientific nomenclature remains a hurdle.
3. The 0.5-point weight suggests a minor item, but the cognitive load of a two-part recall question is high for an ESL/Hindi-medium student.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While the "Lactobacillus" fact is a staple of Indian Science curricula (NCERT), the requirement to provide both the specific name and the category in English, coupled with the spelling difficulty, creates a high attrition rate for full correctness.
