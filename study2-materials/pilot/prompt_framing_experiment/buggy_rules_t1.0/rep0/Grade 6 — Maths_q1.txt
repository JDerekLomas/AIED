Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehension: Translate the English term "factors" into the mathematical concept of divisors (often mentally translating to the Hindi term *gunankhand*).
2. Systematic Search: Employ a strategy to find pairs (e.g., 1x68, 2x34) or test divisibility starting from 1.
3. Multiplication/Division execution: Correctly perform mental or scratchpad division (e.g., 68 ÷ 4 = 17).
4. Exhaustion: Recognize when the search is complete (finding the "gap" between 4 and 17).
5. Transcription: List all six values without omission.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- The "Small Factor" Bug: Listing only 1, 2, and 4, then stopping because mental division becomes harder past 10.
- The "One-Pair" Bug: Providing only one pair (e.g., 2 and 34) instead of "all."
- The "Multiples" Confusion: Confusing factors with multiples (listing 68, 136, etc.).
- Divisibility Failure: Missing 4 and 17 because 68 is not in the standard 1-10 multiplication tables (rote memorization limit).
- Parity Bias: Assuming only even numbers are factors of an even number (ignoring 17).

Step 3: Student Population Considerations
- Grade 6 is the transition year where abstract number theory is introduced.
- English proficiency: If the student doesn't know the word "factor," they cannot attempt the problem despite having the math skills.
- Recall vs. Recognition: The open-ended format is significantly harder than multiple choice, as missing a single factor (like 17) results in 0 marks according to the binary rubric.
- 17 is a prime number and 68 is "off the grid" for many students who only memorize tables up to 10 or 12.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the binary rubric (0 or 1) and the high probability of missing the 4/17 pair due to table-dependency and the linguistic barrier, the success rate is likely low.
