Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the sentence structure and identify the sentence type (assertive/positive vs. negative/interrogative).
2. Recognize the noun "apples" as a countable plural noun.
3. Recall the grammatical rule: "some" is generally used for affirmative sentences, while "any" is used for negatives and questions.
4. Apply the rule to select the word that fits the affirmative context of the sentence.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. The "Any-Default" Bug: Students often over-apply "any" because it is frequently introduced alongside "some" and they fail to distinguish between positive and negative polarities.
2. The "Singular/Plural" Bug: Students may associate "some" only with uncountable masses (like water) and "any" with countable items, or vice versa, based on limited exposure to examples.
3. The "Translation Interference" Bug: In Hindi, the word "kuch" (कुछ) can translate to both "some" and "any" depending on context. Students may perceive no semantic difference between the two choices in English.
4. The "Positional Guessing" Bug: In multiple-choice or bracketed formats, students often pick the first option if they are unsure.

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 6 students in this demographic often face a "literacy gap" where their functional English lags behind the curriculum level. Because "some" and "any" are abstract quantifiers (determiners) rather than concrete nouns, students rely on rote syntactic rules rather than "ear" or intuition. The Hindi-to-English transition is particularly difficult here because the distinction is purely grammatical/syntactic (polarity) rather than lexical.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While "some" is a high-frequency word, the systematic confusion with "any" in a formal testing environment for ESL learners from this demographic is high.
