Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Decode the Prompt:** Read and interpret English text ("expands the most") while filtering out parts (b) and (c) which are irrelevant to the 1-point rubric score.
2. **Data Retrieval:** Locate the "Table" (implied in the prompt but often printed on a separate page or section) and scan the "expansion" column.
3. **Magnitude Comparison:** Compare numerical values (likely decimals or scientific notation) to identify the maximum value.
4. **Mapping:** Link the maximum value back to the corresponding row label ("Aluminium").
5. **Encoding:** Write the English word "Aluminium" correctly.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. **Language Interference (Semantic Narrowing):** Students may misinterpret "expands the most" as "hardest material" or "most useful material" due to limited English vocabulary.
2. **Column Misalignment:** Looking at a "Melting Point" or "Density" column instead of "Expansion" if the table has multiple variables.
3. **Decimal Magnitude Error:** If expansion values are decimals (e.g., 0.000023), students often treat longer numbers as "larger" (0.000023 > 0.00003) or ignore decimal places entirely.
4. **Instructional Noise Error:** Students may provide a paragraph explaining *why* it expands (answering the "why" of the phenomenon) instead of simply naming the material, or they may answer parts (b) and (c) and omit (a) if they find the subsequent questions more familiar.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often struggle with "Multi-step literacy" (reading a table while following a specific English prompt). In many Indian government schools, Science is taught in English but explained in Hindi; while "Aluminium" is a familiar term, the procedural bridge between a data table and a comparative superlative ("the most") is a high-cognitive-load task for ELL (English Language Learner) students. The 1-point rubric is unforgiving—it does not allow for partial credit if they explain expansion but name the wrong metal.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the calculation is simple, the combination of English-language table navigation, decimal comparison, and the distraction of sub-questions (b) and (c) will lead to significant attrition.
