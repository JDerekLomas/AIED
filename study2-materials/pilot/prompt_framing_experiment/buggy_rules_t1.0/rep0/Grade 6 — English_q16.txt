Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Decoding and Comprehension**: Translate the English prompt into a mental representation (likely via Hindi translation) to understand the task.
2.  **Semantic Retrieval**: Access the specific English vocabulary word for a season (e.g., retrieving "Winter" or "Monsoon" rather than "Sardi" or "Baarish").
3.  **Orthographic Encoding**: Correctly spell the name of the season.
4.  **Constraint Satisfaction**: Integrate the name of the season into a written format as part of the paragraph (though the rubric only awards the mark for naming it).

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1.  **Phonetic Mapping Error**: Using Hindi phonetics to spell English words (e.g., writing "Manson" for Monsoon or "Samar" for Summer).
2.  **Language Interference (Code-Switching)**: Writing the name of the season in Hindi script or Romanized Hindi (e.g., "Mera favorite season *Sardi* hai").
3.  **Category Blur**: Providing a month (e.g., "January") or a weather condition (e.g., "Rainy") instead of the formal name of a "season" as requested.
4.  **Prompt Neglect**: Writing about "My School" or a general topic because "My favorite..." triggers a memorized essay template that doesn't match the specific prompt.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 6 students from EWS backgrounds in Indian government schools often face a "literacy gap" where their functional English writing skills lag behind the curriculum. While the rubric is lenient (only requiring the name), the open-ended nature of a "paragraph" task is intimidating. Students often leave the entire question blank if they cannot compose the first sentence, even if they know the word for a season.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While naming a season is a low-level recall task, the requirement to produce it within a written paragraph—combined with the high likelihood of spelling errors or using Hindi terms—creates a significant barrier for this specific demographic.
