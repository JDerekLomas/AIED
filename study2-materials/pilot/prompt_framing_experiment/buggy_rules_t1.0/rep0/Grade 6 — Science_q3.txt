Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the command verb "Differentiate" (understand it requires a comparative contrast).
2. Retrieve four distinct pieces of information from long-term memory (2 characteristics for living, 2 for non-living).
3. Map characteristics to the correct category (avoiding category switching).
4. Translate internal concepts (often in Hindi, e.g., *saans lena*) into English terminology.
5. Structure the response into a format that clearly pairs or separates the two categories.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. "The Symmetry Bug": Assuming non-living things have the exact opposite property of a specific living property (e.g., "Living things move; Non-living things never move" — failing to account for cars/fans).
2. "Category Collapse": Listing characteristics of living things only, assuming the non-living characteristics are implied.
3. "The Definition/Example Swap": Providing examples (Human/Stone) instead of characteristics (Growth/Respiration).
4. "The Vocabulary Bottleneck": Using vague terms like "eat" instead of "nutrition" or "food," or "give birth" instead of "reproduce," which may be marked wrong depending on the strictness of the teacher.
5. "The Single-Trait Loop": Providing two versions of the same trait (e.g., "they grow" and "they get bigger").

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 6 is a transitional year where students move from general observation to formal scientific classification. For EWS students in Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English command "Differentiate" is a high-threshold vocabulary barrier. Furthermore, the rubric is surprisingly punitive (0.5 marks for four required items), which often correlates with strict grading where even one "bug" results in zero credit.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While "living vs non-living" is a foundational concept, the combination of English-language production, the requirement for four distinct points (recall vs. recognition), and the specific "bug" of providing examples instead of characteristics significantly lowers the success rate in this specific demographic.
