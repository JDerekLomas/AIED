Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Recall the multiplication fact for $3 \times 4$.
2.  Identify the signs of both integers (negative and negative).
3.  Recall the specific sign rule for multiplication (specifically that $(-)\times(-) = (+)$).
4.  Synthesize the absolute value and the sign to produce the final integer product.

Step 2: Buggy rules and systematic errors
1.  **Additive-Multiplicative Interference:** Applying addition rules to multiplication (e.g., "negative plus negative stays negative," leading to $-12$).
2.  **Absolute Difference Error:** Interpreting the parentheses or the proximity as an addition/subtraction problem rather than multiplication (e.g., $-3 - 4 = -7$).
3.  **Sign Over-generalization:** Believing a negative sign in the problem must always result in a negative sign in the answer.
4.  **Language Interference:** Misinterpreting the word "value" or the notation "$\times$" due to weak English/Math vocabulary transition.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 7 students in this demographic are often transitioning from rote arithmetic to symbolic algebra. While the multiplication table for 3 and 4 is likely mastered, the conceptual "why" behind $(-)\times(-) = (+)$ is often weak, leading to high reliance on memorized rules that are easily "corrupted" by competing rules from integer addition (which is usually taught just before multiplication). The open-ended format removes the 50/50 chance of a sign guess provided by multiple-choice options.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the high frequency of the "negative stays negative" bug and the common confusion between addition and multiplication rules for integers in early middle school, a significant portion of the cohort will likely produce $-12$ or $-7$.
