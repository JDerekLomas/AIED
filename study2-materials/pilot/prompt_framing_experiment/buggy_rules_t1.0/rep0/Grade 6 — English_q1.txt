Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the question "Where did she find..." into a search for a location (adverbial of place) related to a specific past action.
2. **Key Word Scanning**: Identify "old book" as the anchor phrase to locate the relevant section in the source text.
3. **Retrieval/Extraction**: Isolate the specific noun phrase "the attic" from the surrounding text.
4. **Syntactic Reconstruction**: Formulate a response that satisfies the rubric (either a phrase or a full sentence with subject-verb-object-place structure).
5. **Orthographic Execution**: Correctly spell "attic," a low-frequency word for Hindi-medium learners.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. **"Keyword Matching Only"**: The student finds the word "book" and copies the entire sentence it appears in, regardless of whether it answers "where" (e.g., "It was a very old book").
2. **"Tense-Shift Failure"**: If writing a full sentence, the student uses "find" instead of "found" due to the "did" in the question, or misapplies the past tense.
3. **"Vocabulary Substitution"**: Substituting "attic" with a more familiar but incorrect word (e.g., "room," "house," or "top") because "attic" is not in their active vocabulary.
4. **"Literal Translation Interference"**: Attempting to translate the concept of an attic into a Hindi-equivalent structure that doesn't map correctly to English syntax.

Step 3: Target Population Constraints
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often have significant gaps in English literacy. The "attic" is a culturally specific architectural feature (a space between the ceiling and roof) that is rare in the urban slums or rural housing typical of this demographic, making the word an abstract, non-contextualized noun.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the open-ended nature of the question and the specific vocabulary hurdle ("attic"), a significant portion of students will struggle to retrieve the exact word even if they understand the text.
