Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the English syntax and vocabulary (e.g., "contribute," "expansion," "dominance").
2. Retrieve the historical anchor: Identify 1757/Plassey as the conflict between Robert Clive and Siraj-ud-Daulah.
3. Access the causal link: Recall the political aftermath (Mir Jafar/Puppet Nawab) rather than just the military event.
4. Translate historical concepts from Hindi/Internal thought into a coherent English sentence.
5. Filter irrelevant facts: Distinguish Plassey from Buxar (1764) or later expansionist policies.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules":
1. **The "Definition for Cause" Bug**: Providing a definition of the battle (who fought) instead of explaining the *contribution* to power.
2. **The "Chronological Merge" Bug**: Attributing outcomes of the Battle of Buxar (like Diwani rights) to Plassey.
3. **The "Keyword Salad" Bug**: Using words like "British," "Win," and "India" without establishing the specific mechanism of political control (Puppet Nawab).
4. **The "Language Threshold" Bug**: Understanding the concept in Hindi but being unable to formulate "political dominance" or "puppet ruler" in English, leading to an empty or non-responsive answer.

Step 3: Population factors:
Grade 8 students from low-SES, Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with open-ended English prompts. The jump from rote recognition to explaining causal mechanisms in a second language is a high cognitive barrier. "Puppet Nawab" is a specific concept often taught, but articulating the *shift* from trade to political control is a complex abstraction for this level.

Step 4: Holistic estimate:
Given the linguistic barrier and the requirement for a specific causal explanation (not just "The British won"), a significant majority will likely provide incomplete, factually merged, or linguistically broken responses.
