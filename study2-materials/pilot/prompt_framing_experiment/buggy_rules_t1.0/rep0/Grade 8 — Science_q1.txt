Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Observation Decoding**: Translate the visual descriptions ("green patches," "darker patches") into the biological phenomenon of decay.
2. **Retrieval**: Recall the specific scientific category (Fungi/Mould) or process (Microbial growth) associated with food spoilage.
3. **Linguistic Encoding**: Formulate the answer in English (the medium of instruction/examination) or a recognizable scientific term, overcoming the barrier of Hindi-medium primary education.
4. **Causal Attribution**: Distinguish between the *symptom* (patches) and the *cause* (microorganisms) as requested by the prompt.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. **Descriptive Bug**: Students describe the change instead of the cause (e.g., "The bread became dirty" or "It changed color").
2. **Abiotic Bug**: Attributing changes to physical factors rather than biological ones (e.g., "Water," "Air," or "Humidity" as the *sole* cause).
3. **Terminology Substitution**: Using vague vernacular terms (e.g., "Kide" or "Germs") which may not meet the scientific rigor required by the rubric for "Mould/Fungi."
4. **Temporal Misinterpretation**: Focusing on the timeline (Day 3 vs Day 5) rather than the underlying agent.

Step 3: Target student population considerations
- **Language Barrier**: Students may know the concept in Hindi ("Phaphoondi") but fail to recall the English equivalent "Fungi" or "Mould."
- **Open-ended Recall**: Without options (MCQ), students cannot rely on recognition; they must generate the term, which is cognitively more demanding for ESL/ELL learners.
- **Socio-economic context**: Limited exposure to standardized scientific discourse at home increases reliance on rote classroom memorization.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the phenomenon is common, the requirement to name the *biological agent* specifically in an open-ended format—compounded by the transition from Hindi to English terminology—creates a significant hurdle for students in this demographic.
