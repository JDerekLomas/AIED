Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Retrieval of specific geographical data (recalling two distinct natural resources specific to the state of Rajasthan).
2. Translation of vernacular concepts (e.g., *khanij*, *balu*) into English terms.
3. Selection of one resource for functional analysis.
4. Causal reasoning (linking a resource to socio-economic impact, e.g., livelihoods, architecture, or water scarcity).
5. Syntactic construction (forming an English sentence that conveys the relationship between the resource and human life).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. "Specific-to-General Bug": Identifying general resources (air, soil) rather than resources specific to Rajasthan’s unique profile as required by the context.
2. "Listing-only Bug": Providing a list of resources but failing to execute the second procedural step (explanation) due to cognitive load or misunderstanding the multi-part prompt.
3. "Vague Impact Bug": Providing an explanation that is a tautology (e.g., "Water is used for living") rather than an "influence" on life/culture/economy.
4. "Translation/Lexical Gap": Knowing the resource in Hindi but lacking the English vocabulary to write it down, leading to omission.

Step 3: Population factors:
The open-ended nature of the question (recall vs. recognition) is a high barrier. Grade 6 students at this proficiency level often struggle with the "explain" component in a second language. While students may know Rajasthan is famous for "stones" or "sand," articulating the influence on "lives of people" requires a higher-order cognitive shift from fact-retrieval to analysis. The rubric's 1-point maximum suggests a "binary" success criteria where any failure in the multi-step process results in zero.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
Given the shift from Hindi to English, the requirement for both recall and causal explanation, and the "all-or-nothing" rubric for a multi-part question:
