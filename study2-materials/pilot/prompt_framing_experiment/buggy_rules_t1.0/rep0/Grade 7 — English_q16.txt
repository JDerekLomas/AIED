Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic decoding: Understand the English prompt, specifically identifying the target (grandmother) and the two required speech acts (expressing longing and making a request).
2. Content retrieval/translation: Formulate the message in a primary language (Hindi) and translate the concepts of "missing someone" and "visiting" into English.
3. Syntactic construction: Formulate sentences using correct word order (SVO) and verb tense (present/future).
4. Lexical retrieval: Correctly spell and use words like "miss," "visit," "grandmother/grandma," and "soon."
5. Pragmatic formatting: Apply the conventions of a "message" (salutation and closing, though often simplified).

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. Subject-Object Inversion: Writing "You miss me" instead of "I miss you" (common in L1 interference where the direction of emotion is confused).
2. Literal Translation Error: Using "Coming" instead of "Visit" (e.g., "Grandmother, you come soon").
3. Tense Dropping: Omitting the auxiliary verb in requests (e.g., "You come my home").
4. Phonetic Spelling: Writing "soon" as "sun" or "grandmother" as "grandmader."
5. Prompt Grafting: Copying the prompt's instructional text (e.g., "telling her how much you miss her") instead of generating an original statement.

Step 3: Target student population
Grade 7 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds often face a "threshold effect" where their receptive vocabulary allows them to understand the prompt, but their productive capacity is limited to "formulaic sequences." While "I miss you" is a common phrase, "asking her to visit soon" requires a higher level of independent syntax. The open-ended format increases the cognitive load significantly compared to multiple-choice questions.

Step 4: Estimated proportion of correct answers
Considering the requirement for two distinct communicative acts and the high likelihood of L1-interference bugs in a population with limited English exposure, many students will fail to execute both parts of the rubric with enough clarity to satisfy the binary scoring (0 or 1).
