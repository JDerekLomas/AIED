Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the command verb "Explain" and the domain-specific term "significance" (requiring abstract causal reasoning beyond mere description).
2. Retrieve stored knowledge regarding Ashoka's historical timeline (Mauryan Empire, Kalinga War).
3. Select two distinct "key aspects" that satisfy the criteria of "rule" or "reign" (e.g., Dhamma, inscriptions, animal welfare, non-violence).
4. Synthesize these aspects into a coherent explanation of his "impact" on history (transformation from conquest by force to conquest by dharma).
5. Encode the answer in English, maintaining grammatical structure sufficient to convey complex historical relationships.

Step 2: Buggy rules:
1. "The Keyword Bug": Identifying the name "Ashoka" and recalling any fact (e.g., "He was a king") without addressing "significance" or "reign."
2. "The List-to-Explain Bug": Listing two facts (e.g., "He fought Kalinga," "He liked lions") without explaining their historical significance or impact.
3. "The Language-Constraint Bug": Attempting to translate "significance" or "governance" from Hindi (Prabhav/Mahatva) to English and losing the logical connection, resulting in fragmented or unintelligible sentences.
4. "The Moralizing Bug": Focusing solely on Ashoka being a "good man" rather than analyzing his rule as a political/historical shift.

Step 3: Population considerations:
Grade 7 students in this demographic often struggle with the transition from recognition (MCQs) to open-ended recall. For Hindi-medium students, "significance" is a high-tier vocabulary word. In EWS contexts, rote memorization of textbooks is common, but synthesizing "impact" is a higher-order cognitive task. The 1-point rubric is "all-or-nothing," meaning partial "bugs" lead to a score of 0.

Step 4: Holistic estimate:
Given the linguistic barrier, the requirement for two distinct aspects, and the cognitive leap from "fact" to "significance," many students will provide a partially correct but technically incomplete or linguistically broken response.
