Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Linguistic Decoding: Translate "Assess the impact" into the functional requirement of identifying a cause-and-effect relationship.
2. Conceptual Retrieval: Access the mental schema for "Kingdoms" (Medieval/Ancient history) and "Economic life" (treasury, trade, agriculture, taxes).
3. Causal Linking: Isolate a specific consequence of war (e.g., looting, high military expenditure, destruction of crops).
4. English Encoding: Formulate a coherent sentence in English that satisfies the "clearly identifying" criteria of the rubric.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. The "Definition Bug": Providing a definition of "war" or "kingdom" instead of an impact.
2. The "Affective Bug": Describing emotional or human impacts (people died, sadness) rather than economic impacts.
3. The "Generic Positive Bug": Assuming "impact" means a positive development (e.g., "The kingdom became famous").
4. The "Translation/Syntax Bug": Producing a "word salad" where Hindi-to-English literal translation obscures the economic logic, failing the "clearly identifying" rubric requirement.

Step 3: Population Considerations
The open-ended nature (recall vs. recognition) is a high barrier. Grade 7 students in this demographic often struggle with the abstract category of "economics." Limited English proficiency significantly increases the "failure to encode" rate, even if the student understands the historical concept in their mother tongue.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement to write an original sentence in English and the high probability of the "Affective Bug" (confusing human loss with economic loss), many students will fail to hit the specific rubric target despite having general historical knowledge.
