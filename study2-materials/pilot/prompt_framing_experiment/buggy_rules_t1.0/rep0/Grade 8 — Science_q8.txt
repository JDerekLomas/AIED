Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Lexical Retrieval: Access the specific definition of "weeds" from memory (distinguishing from generic "plants" or "grass").
2. Functional Attribution: Identify the negative impact of weeds (competition for nutrients/light/water).
3. Linguistic Encoding: Translate the internalized concept from Hindi (खरपतवार) into English.
4. Syntactic Assembly: Construct a coherent sentence connecting the definition and the justification using appropriate causal markers (e.g., "because").

Step 2: Buggy rules:
1. Semantic Overgeneralization: Defining weeds simply as "small plants" or "unwanted things" without the agricultural context.
2. Incomplete Reasoning: Stating what weeds are but omitting the "why" (the importance of removal), or vice versa.
3. Code-Switching/Loanword Error: Using the Hindi term within an English sentence structure, which may be marked incorrect depending on the rigidity of the scoring.
4. Functional Misconception: Assuming weeds are removed because they are "poisonous" or "dirty" rather than because of resource competition.

Step 3: Population considerations:
Grade 8 students in this context often struggle with the "double burden" of content recall and English literacy. While the concept of weeding is culturally familiar to students with rural backgrounds, the requirement to produce an open-ended English explanation (recall vs. recognition) significantly increases the cognitive load.
