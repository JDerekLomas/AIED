Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English syntax: Identify "Name any two" (command/quantity), "famous kings" (target category), and "medieval period of Rajasthan" (spatiotemporal constraints).
2. Retrieve historical entities: Access long-term memory for figures associated with Rajasthan.
3. Filter by temporal attribute: Distinguish medieval rulers from ancient (e.g., Harappan) or modern/British-era figures.
4. Filter by geographic attribute: Ensure the king is specifically from Rajasthan, not broader Indian history (e.g., Ashoka or Akbar).
5. Transliterate/Write: Convert phonetic Hindi names into English script (given the limited English proficiency).
6. Verify quantity: Ensure two distinct names are produced.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. The "Pan-Indian Generalization" Bug: Providing the most famous Indian kings regardless of region (e.g., "Akbar," "Ashoka") because "famous king" triggers a general schema.
2. The "Temporal Blur" Bug: Recalling figures from the Independence movement (e.g., "Mahatma Gandhi," "Bhagat Singh") because "history" is stored as a singular "past" category.
3. The "Phonetic-Orthographic" Bug: Abandoning the answer because the student can recall the name in Hindi but lacks the confidence/procedure to map the sounds to English letters.
4. The "Single-Entity" Bug: Providing only one name despite the prompt asking for two, often caused by cognitive load during the retrieval of the first difficult item.
5. The "Mythological Overlap" Bug: Providing names from religious epics (e.g., "Ram," "Krishna") due to high cultural salience in Rajasthan.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
The target population faces a "double burden": they must perform historical retrieval while navigating a language barrier. In Grade 6, students are transitioning from primary social studies to more specialized history. In Hindi-medium contexts, the names "Prithviraj Chauhan" and "Maharana Pratap" are culturally ubiquitous (high-frequency input), but the requirement to produce them in an English-medium test format introduces significant friction. The open-ended format is significantly harder than multiple-choice for this demographic.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the cultural salience of figures like Maharana Pratap is extremely high in Rajasthan, the linguistic barrier and the "two-item" retrieval requirement in an English-medium assessment for EWS students often result in partial credit or avoidance.
