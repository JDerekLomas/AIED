Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the English text to understand the physical setup (two bar magnets, specific poles identified).
2. Retrieve the relevant physical law (Law of Magnetic Poles: Like poles repel, unlike poles attract).
3. Apply the rule to the specific case (North + North = Like poles).
4. Select the appropriate scientific term ("repel") or descriptive phrase ("push away").
5. Translate the internal conceptual conclusion into a written English response.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. "General Magnetism Bug": Associating all magnet interactions with "sticking together" (attraction) because that is the most common everyday experience with magnets on fridges or pins.
2. "Pole-Matching Bug": Thinking "North + North" is a "match," and in many cognitive domains, matches are associated with joining/positive outcomes, leading to a "they will join" conclusion.
3. "Terminology Swap": Confusing the words "repel" and "attract" due to limited English fluency, even if the physical concept is understood.
4. "North-South Confusion": Assuming that because it is a magnet, it must have a South pole involved for anything to happen, or misidentifying North as a "positive" force that seeks another "positive" force to grow stronger.

Step 3: Student population considerations:
1. Grade 6 is the introductory year for formal physics concepts in this curriculum.
2. The "open-ended" format is significantly harder than multiple choice for ESL/ELL students who may know the concept but struggle to retrieve the specific word "repel."
3. Students from economically weaker sections often have less access to "discovery-based" kits, making the concept more abstract/rote-learned rather than experiential.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While the concept is foundational, the combination of linguistic barriers (English medium) and the strong "common sense" intuition that magnets "stick" (attraction bias) leads to a high error rate in recall-based testing.
