Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English text to identify the specific geographic constraint (Rajasthan) and the subject (rural occupations).
2. Retrieve relevant geographical/sociological facts from long-term memory (Agriculture, Animal Husbandry).
3. Select two distinct items to satisfy the "main occupations" plural requirement.
4. Select one of the retrieved items and retrieve descriptive details (e.g., crops grown or animals reared).
5. Encode the response back into English, maintaining semantic clarity.
6. Map the multi-part instruction ("Name" + "Describe any one") to the final written output.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. "The Overgeneralization Bug": Assuming all rural India is identical; mentioning "fishing" or "jute cultivation" (common in textbooks but incorrect for Rajasthan).
2. "The Keyword Matching Bug": Seeing "Rajasthan" and "Rural" and writing about "water scarcity" or "camel rides" (associating symbols rather than answering the "occupation" prompt).
3. "The Single-Task Bug": Naming the occupations but forgetting the "describe any one" component (common in multi-part questions).
4. "The Language Interference Bug": Thinking of the correct Hindi term (Pashu Palan) but failing to retrieve or spell the English equivalent (Animal Husbandry), leading to an empty or partial response.
5. "The Rubric Mismatch": Providing only one occupation when the rubric requires two for the full mark.

Step 3: Population Considerations
7th-grade students from economically weaker backgrounds often face a "scissor effect": they possess high practical knowledge of rural life (funds of knowledge) but low academic English proficiency to express it. The open-ended nature of the question (recall vs. recognition) significantly increases the cognitive load compared to a multiple-choice question.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the content is culturally relevant, the combination of a two-part instruction (List + Describe) and the English-medium requirement for Hindi-medium learners typically leads to high rates of "partial" answers that do not meet the full rubric criteria.
