Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Decoding/Translation**: Decipher the English question words (What, did, love) and map them to the Hindi equivalents (क्या, किया, पसंद/प्यार).
2. **Information Retrieval**: Access long-term or short-term memory of the specific narrative text to locate the target activity ("reading books") associated with the character "Riya" and the temporal marker "evening."
3. **Grammatical Transformation**: Convert the interrogative "What did Riya love to do" into a declarative structure, requiring the past tense inflection of the verb (love → loved).
4. **Syntactic Mapping**: Correctly place the direct object ("books" or "reading") within the English SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) sentence structure, which differs from the Hindi SOV structure.
5. **Orthographic Execution**: Spell the keywords ("read," "books," "loved") correctly to meet the rubric requirements.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **Tense-Transfer Bug**: Using the base form of the verb because "did" is present in the question (e.g., "Riya love to read").
2. **Keyword Matching Bug**: Extracting a random noun from the text that appears near the word "Riya" or "evening" without verifying the action.
3. **SOV Interference Bug**: Ordering the sentence as "Riya books read" (Mirroring Hindi syntax).
4. **The "To + Verb-ing" Bug**: Confusing infinitive and gerund forms (e.g., "She love to reading").
5. **Phonetic Spelling Bug**: Spelling "read" as "reed" or "red" based on phonetic sounding-out common in ESL learners.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students from EWS backgrounds often face "Matthew Effects" in literacy; the gap between their decoding skills and the grade-level expectations is significant. In Hindi-medium contexts, English is often taught via translation. An open-ended recall question is significantly harder than a multiple-choice question (recognition), as it requires productive rather than receptive language skills.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
While the rubric is somewhat generous ("Accept: read books"), the combination of retrieving the specific fact and navigating the English syntax/tense change presents a high cognitive load for students with limited English exposure.
