Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Translate the linguistic operator "of" into the mathematical operation of multiplication.
2. Execute fraction multiplication for the first pair: (1 * 3) / (2 * 4) = 3/8.
3. Execute fraction multiplication for the second pair: (2 * 2) / (5 * 3) = 4/15.
4. Compare two fractions with unlike denominators (3/8 vs 4/15).
5. Find a common denominator (e.g., 120) or use cross-multiplication (3 * 15 vs 4 * 8).
6. Correctly identify the larger value (45 > 32, so 3/8 is greater).

Step 2: Buggy rules:
- "Of" confusion: Adding or dividing instead of multiplying.
- Additive fraction bug: Adding numerators and denominators (1/2 + 3/4 = 4/6).
- Comparison by "Larger Components": Deciding 4/15 is larger because 4 and 15 are larger numbers than 3 and 8.
- Comparison by Denominator: Deciding 4/15 is smaller because 15 is a "larger" part (confusing unit fractions).
- Cross-multiplication direction: Swapping results (assigning 32 to 3/8 and 45 to 4/15).

Step 3: Population considerations:
- Grade 7 students often struggle with the multi-step nature of "compare results of operations."
- Limited English proficiency may lead to misinterpreting "of" or the question "Which is greater."
- As an open-ended item worth only 1 mark, students may skip the rigorous comparison step or make a calculation error in one of the three distinct sub-tasks.
