Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Access the concept of "adaptation" and "desert" from long-term memory.
2. Attribute Mapping: Identify specific anatomical features (e.g., spines, waxy cuticle) or physiological traits (e.g., deep roots) linked to Cactaceae or similar desert flora.
3. Functional Linking: Connect the physical trait to the specific survival benefit (saving or getting water) as required by the rubric.
4. Linguistic Translation: Encode the conceptual knowledge into English (the medium of the test) while ensuring the technical term and the explanation align.
5. Constraint Satisfaction: Ensure the response is an "explanation" (linking 'how' or 'why') rather than just a one-word label.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. The "Labeling Bug": Students provide a noun (e.g., "Cactus") instead of a process or trait because they equate the category with the adaptation.
2. The "Over-generalization Bug": Stating a trait that is not desert-specific (e.g., "it has green leaves") because all plants have them.
3. The "Teleological Bug": Explaining that the plant "wants" to save water or "decides" to grow roots, failing to describe the structural mechanism.
4. The "Translation Substitution Bug": For English Language Learners (ELL), substituting a similar-sounding but incorrect word or reverting to Hindi syntax that obscures the causal link required by the rubric.
5. The "Partial Retrieval Bug": Mentioning the trait (long roots) but failing to mention the function (getting water), which may fail some interpretations of "explain."

Step 3: Target Population Considerations
Grade 6 students are in a transitional cognitive stage (concrete to formal operational). For students from economically weaker sections in Indian government schools, the "Science as English" barrier is significant. While they may intuitively understand how a desert plant looks, the "open-ended recall" format is significantly harder than a multiple-choice "recognition" format. The gap between vernacular understanding and English production often leads to "blank paper" syndrome or fragmented answers that don't meet the rubric's "clearly describing" threshold.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement to explain (not just name) and the linguistic hurdles for Hindi-medium students in an English-medium assessment, the success rate is
