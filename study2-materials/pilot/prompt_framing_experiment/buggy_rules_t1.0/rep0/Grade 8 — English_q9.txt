Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the academic vocabulary in the prompt ("Synonym" and "Antonym").
2. Access the semantic representation of the target word "quiet."
3. Retrieve a word with a similar meaning (Synonym) from long-term memory.
4. Retrieve a word with the opposite meaning (Antonym) from long-term memory.
5. Encode the retrieved words into written English, ensuring the orthography is recognizable to the grader.
6. Map the correct category (same vs. opposite) to the correct numbered slot in the response.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. Category Swapping: Systematically providing the antonym for the synonym and vice versa due to a failure to distinguish the Greek roots/labels.
2. Associative Priming: Providing a word related to the context of "quiet" (e.g., "library" or "shhh") rather than a word of the same grammatical class (synonym).
3. Translation-Retrieval Gap: Students may know the Hindi concept (शान्त - Shanti) and its opposite (शोर - Shor), but fail to retrieve the specific English lexical labels "Silent" or "Noisy."
4. "Same-Meaning" Over-generalization: Treating "Antonym" as another word for "another name," providing two synonyms instead of one of each.
5. Phonetic Spelling Bugs: Producing "silant" or "noiesy," which, depending on grader severity, may result in a zero score under a strict rubric.

Step 3: Population Considerations
For Grade 8 students in this demographic, "Synonym" and "Antonym" are often "learned-and-forgotten" academic labels rather than part of active vocabulary. While "quiet" is a high-frequency word, the open-ended recall format is significantly harder than a multiple-choice format. Limited English proficiency increases the likelihood of "Category Swapping" or the inability to retrieve the specific orthographic form of "noisy" or "silent."
