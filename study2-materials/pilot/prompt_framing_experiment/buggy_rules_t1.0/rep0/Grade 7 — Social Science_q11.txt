Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decipher the English prompt: Translate and comprehend high-level academic verbs ("Evaluate," "Valid argument") into a functional task (Compare/Contrast).
2. Retrieve from long-term memory at least two distinct characteristics of Public Healthcare.
3. Retrieve from long-term memory at least two distinct characteristics of Private Healthcare.
4. Execute a comparative mapping: Ensure the features selected represent "differences" (contrastive pairs) rather than isolated facts.
5. Formulate two coherent sentences/arguments in English (or a functional bilingual hybrid) that satisfy the rubric's demand for "one valid argument or example for each."

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules"
1. The "Keyword Association Bug": Student sees "Public Healthcare" and "Private Healthcare" and defines them (e.g., "Public is Govt") but fails to provide the "differences/arguments" required for the "Evaluate" command.
2. The "Asymmetric Comparison Bug": Student provides a feature for public (e.g., "It is cheap") but fails to provide the corresponding private counterpoint, or provides an unrelated private feature.
3. The "Linguistic Substitution Bug": Due to limited English, students substitute the complex "Evaluate" with "Write about," leading to descriptive lists rather than the required analytical contrast.
4. The "Example-Argument Conflation": Providing an example (e.g., "AIIMS") without the underlying feature/argument, which may fail the rubric's specific "feature" requirement.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students in this demographic often possess strong "street-level" knowledge of healthcare disparities (lived experience) but struggle with the "open-ended recall" format in a second language. The cognitive load of switching from Hindi-medium conceptual thought to English-medium formal output often results in "fragmentary responses" that may miss the specific "two features/one argument for each" threshold required for a full 1 point.

Step 4: Estimated success rate
Given the high linguistic barrier of the word "Evaluate," the requirement for four distinct pieces of information (two features + two arguments/examples) for a single point, and the shift from recognition to recall:
