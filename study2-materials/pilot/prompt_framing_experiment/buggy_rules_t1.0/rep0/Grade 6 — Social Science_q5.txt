Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic decoding: Translate/interpret the English terms "main occupation" and "Vedic period" into conceptual meaning (often via mental translation to Hindi: *mukhya vyavasay* and *Vaidik kal*).
2. Temporal retrieval: Isolate the specific historical era (Early vs. Later Vedic) and recall the primary economic activity associated with it.
3. Selection/Priority: Decide between pastoralism (Early) and agriculture (Later), ensuring the choice aligns with the "main" descriptor provided in standard NCERT/State textbooks.
4. Descriptive retrieval: Recall one specific detail (e.g., cattle as wealth, use of iron plows, importance of cows/Gavyuti).
5. Synthesis and Encoding: Formulate a coherent English sentence that satisfies both parts of the prompt (identification + description) while managing grammatical and spelling constraints.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. Era Displacement (Chronological Bug): Confusing Vedic occupations with Harappan (trade/urban) or Mauryan (state-led farming).
2. The "Modernity" Heuristic: Assuming historical people did what rural people do now (general agriculture) without distinguishing the specific pastoralist emphasis of the Early Vedic period.
3. Part-Task Completion Bug: Answering only the first half ("Agriculture") and omitting the "describe one key aspect" because the rubric value (1 mark) signals a single-word response to the student.
4. Vocabulary Over-extension: Using "Work" or "Job" instead of technical terms, or being unable to retrieve the English word "Pastoralism," leading to a blank answer despite conceptual knowledge.
5. The "Dominant Strategy" Bug: Writing everything known about the Vedas (gods, rajas) instead of filtering for "occupation."

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 6 is a transitional year where students move from environmental studies to formal history. For Hindi-medium students in government schools, the shift to English-medium Social Science terminology is a significant barrier. Open-ended "Describe" prompts are significantly harder for this cohort than multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank questions due to the "active recall + English construction" double burden.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While many students will know the answer is "cows" or "farming" in their native tongue, the requirement to provide a description in English, combined with the confusion between Early/Later Vedic transitions and the low-point value (which discourages multi-step effort), suggests a high failure rate.
