Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Isolate the variable `y` by applying the additive inverse (subtracting 9 from both sides).
2. Recognize that the operation results in a subtraction where the subtrahend is larger than the minuend ($4 - 9$).
3. Execute integer subtraction involving a negative result.

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
- **"Smaller-from-larger" bug:** Students habitually subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger ($9 - 4 = 5$), ignoring the sign or the direction of the operation.
- **Transposition sign error:** Moving $+9$ to the other side without changing the sign ($y = 4 + 9 = 13$).
- **Sign neglect:** Solving correctly to "5" but omitting the negative sign because the concept of negative magnitude is abstract or not fully internalized.
- **Rule confusion:** Applying multiplication sign rules (positive + positive = positive) to addition/subtraction.

Step 3: Contextual Constraints
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face "cumulative deficit" where foundational gaps in Grade 6/7 integers persist. While the equation is a "one-step" problem, it moves into the negative number domain, which is a significant cognitive hurdle. The English medium instruction for Hindi-background students often leads to rote memorization of "rules" (e.g., "plus-minus is minus") without conceptual understanding, increasing the likelihood of applying a "buggy rule."

Step 4: Holistic Estimation
The simplicity of the equation is deceptive. While the arithmetic is basic, the combination of the "smaller-from-larger" bug and the requirement to produce a negative result (recall vs. recognition) typically results in a high error rate in this specific socioeconomic and linguistic context.
