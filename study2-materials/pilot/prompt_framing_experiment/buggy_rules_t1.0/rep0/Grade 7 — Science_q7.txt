Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehension: Decode the technical terms in English ("stunted growth," "yellowing," "nutrient deficiency") and map them to the biological concept of plant nutrition.
2. Diagnosis: Identify that the symptoms described correlate with specific mineral requirements (NPK).
3. Retrieval: Recall the specific terminology for soil amendments (fertilizers or manures) and the names of specific chemical elements (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium).
4. Synthesis/Production: Formulate a coherent sentence in English prescribing the addition of these substances to the soil.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. Semantic Over-generalization: Treating "fertilizer" and "pesticide/insecticide" as synonyms (common in rural contexts where all chemicals are "dawai").
2. Nutrient Mis-mapping: Associating yellowing with water deficiency (irrigation) rather than mineral deficiency.
3. Language-Switching Failure: Knowing the concept in Hindi (खाद - Khaad) but being unable to retrieve the English term "manure" or "fertilizer" under testing pressure.
4. Categorical Error: Recommending a change in crop or more sunlight rather than soil input, missing the specific cue of "soil analysis."

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 7 students from Hindi-medium backgrounds face a dual-load challenge. The question is open-ended (recall), which is cognitively more taxing than multiple-choice (recognition). While students may understand the farmer's plight intuitively, the rubric requires specific technical vocabulary in English. In economically weaker sections, exposure to formal English terminology for science is often limited to rote memorization of textbooks.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is foundational, the combination of English-language production, the specific requirement to name a nutrient, and the systematic confusion between different agricultural chemicals leads to a high error rate.
