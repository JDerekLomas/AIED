Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the question’s syntax, identifying "ruminant" and "human" as the subjects of comparison.
2. Recall the biological concept of "ruminants" and their specific digestive anatomy (four-chambered stomach/rumen).
3. Recall the dietary input (cellulose/grass) that necessitates this anatomical difference.
4. Compare and isolate a single differentiating factor (multiple stomach compartments vs. single stomach).
5. Translate the abstract biological concept into a written English sentence that matches the rubric's requirement for a "key difference."

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- "The Vocabulary Bug": If the term "ruminant" is not decoded, students default to general animal facts (e.g., "cows eat grass, humans eat food") without addressing the system/stomach.
- "The Category Error": Conflating the process (chewing the cud) with the anatomical structure (the stomach) required by the rubric.
- "The Holistic Difference Bug": Stating a difference in output or behavior (e.g., "cows eat faster") rather than the internal "system" requested.
- "The Language-Switch Interference": Attempting to translate the Hindi concept of "jugali" (chewing the cud) into English and losing the anatomical focus on the "rumen" or "sections."

Step 3: Population Considerations
The open-ended nature of the question is significantly more difficult than a multiple-choice item for this demographic. Limited English proficiency often leads to "silent knowledge," where the student understands the concept in Hindi but cannot formulate the specific English terminology required to hit the rubric's "system/sections" criteria. In Grade 7, the distinction between "diet" and "digestive system" is frequently blurred in student responses.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement for a specific anatomical difference (multiple stomachs) rather than just a dietary one, and the language barrier involved in explaining biological processes in English for this specific population:
