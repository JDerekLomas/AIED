Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall and translate the abstract concept of "rights" from Hindi (अधिकार) to English or identify specific examples taught in the curriculum (e.g., Right to Education, Right against Exploitation).
2. Retrieve two distinct, valid rights from long-term memory (Recall vs. Recognition).
3. Select one of those rights for further elaboration.
4. Formulate an "importance" argument, which requires higher-order causal reasoning (linking a legal entitlement to a social or personal outcome).
5. Synthesize these components into a written English response that satisfies the rubric's demand for "distinct rights" and "explanation."

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. "Naming vs. Listing" Bug: Students provide a list of needs (food, toys) rather than legal rights.
2. "The Single-Task" Bug: Students identify two rights but omit the explanation, or provide one right and one explanation, failing to execute the multi-part command.
3. "Semantic Overlap" Bug: Listing two things that are functionally the same (e.g., "Right to go to school" and "Right to study") which may not be counted as "distinct" under strict rubrics.
4. "Circular Explanation" Bug: Defining the importance by simply restating the right (e.g., "Education is important because children need to be educated").
5. "Linguistic Bottleneck": The student knows the concept in Hindi but cannot retrieve the specific English terminology required for a "1-mark" precision answer.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 is the transitional year for abstract social concepts. For students from economically weaker sections in India, "Rights" are often taught theoretically but may conflict with lived realities (child labor, domestic duties), creating cognitive dissonance. The open-ended nature of the question (Recall) is significantly harder than a Multiple Choice Question (Recognition), especially for English Language Learners (ELL) who struggle with syntax and vocabulary.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The rubric is demanding for a 1-point question; it requires three distinct cognitive outputs (Right A + Right B + Explanation). In this demographic, while many may identify "Education," the requirement for a second distinct right and a causal explanation in a second language creates a high "bug" probability.
