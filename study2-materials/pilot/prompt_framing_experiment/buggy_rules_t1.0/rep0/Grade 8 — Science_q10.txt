Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the definition of pasteurization as a thermal processing method.
2. Identify the specific medium (milk).
3. Recall the "Heat" step: Milk is heated to a high temperature.
4. Recall the "Time" step: The heating is held for a specific duration (even if the rubric is lenient, the concept of a "burst" of heat is required).
5. Recall the "Cold" step: The milk must be cooled rapidly/suddenly.
6. Synthesize these steps into a coherent "process" description.
7. Formulate an "explanation": Link the process to the killing of microorganisms/bacteria to prevent spoilage.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. "Boiling Bug": Equating pasteurization with simple boiling (ignoring the rapid cooling phase).
2. "Unidirectional Thermal Bug": Remembering the heating step but forgetting the necessity of the sudden temperature drop (chilling).
3. "Reverse Process Bug": Swapping the order (cooling then heating).
4. "Vague Preservation Bug": Stating it "cleans" or "purifies" the milk without mentioning germs or microbes.
5. "Linguistic Encoding Bug": Students understand the cycle (Heat-Cold) but lack the English vocabulary to describe "sudden/rapid" cooling, leading to incomplete descriptions.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often rely on rote memorization (ratta) for science definitions. While "Pasteurization" is a high-frequency keyword, the requirement to "Describe the process" (open-ended recall) rather than "Define" or "Select" (recognition) significantly increases cognitive load. Limited English proficiency often results in students providing only one half of the process (usually the heating) or losing the "rapid" qualifier for cooling, which, despite the lenient rubric, often results in an incomplete "description" of the process.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric is generous (not requiring specific numbers), the "process" requires a two-part thermal shock (Heat + Quick Cold). Many students will fail to mention the cooling aspect or the specific purpose of microbial control, instead giving a generalized answer about "making milk safe."
