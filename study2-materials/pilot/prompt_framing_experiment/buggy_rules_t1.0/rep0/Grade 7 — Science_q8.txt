Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the role of turmeric and hibiscus as pH indicators.
2. Formulate a plan to test the liquid (e.g., make a turmeric paste/strip or add the powder/extract directly to the liquid).
3. Identify the color change for turmeric (Red in base; stays yellow in acid).
4. Identify the color change for hibiscus (Green/Yellow in base; Pink/Dark Red in acid).
5. Synthesize these observations into a coherent "if-then" conclusion to identify the unknown liquid.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. **Indicator Swap:** Correctly identifying the indicators but swapping the color outcomes (e.g., "Turmeric turns red in acid").
2. **The "Everything is Red" Bug:** Generalizing that "red" always signifies a positive reaction for any indicator (leading to confusion between hibiscus and turmeric results).
3. **Single-Indicator Omission:** Only describing one indicator because the rubric only specifically mentions turmeric, despite the prompt providing two.
4. **The "Mix-All" Procedure:** Suggesting mixing all ingredients together (liquid + turmeric + hibiscus) simultaneously, which renders color changes uninterpretable.
5. **Neutrality Confusion:** Assuming no change in turmeric means the substance *is* an acid, forgetting it could be neutral.

Step 3: Population considerations
1. **Language Barrier:** In Hindi-medium backgrounds, the transition to English "Science" often leads to "memorized fragments" rather than procedural descriptions. Students may know the words "base" and "red" but fail to construct the conditional logic (If/Then) required by the open-ended format.
2. **Recall vs. Recognition:** Unlike a multiple-choice question, this requires high-level retrieval of specific chemical interactions without cues.
3. **Contextual Constraints:** Students in under-resourced schools may have seen these indicators in textbooks but may lack the hands-on lab experience to anchor the procedural memory.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
The multi-step nature of the response, the likelihood of mixing up color changes across two different indicators, and the linguistic challenge of explaining a process rather than identifying a term suggest a high error rate.
