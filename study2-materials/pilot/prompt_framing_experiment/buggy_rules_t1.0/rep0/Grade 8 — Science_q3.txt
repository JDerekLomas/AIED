Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English text to identify the core scientific definition (beaten into thin sheets).
2. Access long-term memory to retrieve the specific technical term associated with this physical property of metals.
3. Distinguish the term from related but distinct properties (e.g., ductility, conductivity, sonorousness).
4. Retrieve the orthographic representation (spelling) of the term "Malleability."
5. Transcribe the word into written English.

Step 2: Buggy rules and systematic errors
- Terminology Swap: Systematically substituting "Ductility" for "Malleability" (the most common conceptual bug in this unit).
- Linguistic Transfer Error: Using the descriptive Hindi term (आघातवर्धनीयता/Aghatvardhaniyata) instead of the English term due to code-switching habits.
- Phonetic Encoding Bug: Spelling the word based on its sound (e.g., "Malyabilty" or "Maleebility"), which may be marked incorrect depending on the strictness of the evaluator.
- Property-Object Confusion: Naming the object or the metal (e.g., "Aluminium" or "Softness") instead of the abstract property.

Step 3: Target student population considerations
- Grade 8 is the transition point where academic vocabulary becomes more complex.
- For Hindi-medium students, "Malleability" is a high-syllable, non-intuitive Latinate word.
- An open-ended recall format is significantly more difficult than a multiple-choice format (recognition), as it lacks the "Ductility vs. Malleability" cueing.
