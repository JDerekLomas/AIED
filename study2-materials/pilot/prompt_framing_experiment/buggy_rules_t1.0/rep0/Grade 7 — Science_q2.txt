Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the English text (Identify "steel spoon," "hot tea," and "handle becomes hot" as a thermal scenario).
2. Retrieve the domain-specific vocabulary for heat transfer (Conduction, Convection, Radiation).
3. Discriminate between the three modes based on the medium (solid metal vs. fluid).
4. Recall the specific term "Conduction" (Correct spelling/identification).
5. Explain the mechanism (Part B) involving particle-to-particle vibration/transfer without actual movement of matter.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. "Medium-Mode Mismatch": Identifying any heat transfer in a liquid environment (tea) as convection, ignoring the material of the spoon (the solid).
2. "Generalization Bug": Using the colloquial term "heating up" or "passing" instead of the scientific term "conduction."
3. "Phonetic Retrieval Error": Confusing "Conduction" with "Convection" due to similar prefixes.
4. "Macro-Movement Bug": Explaining heat travel as the "movement of hot tea particles" inside the spoon.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. English proficiency: Students may understand the concept in Hindi (चालन - Chaalan) but fail to recall the English term "Conduction."
2. Linguistic interference: Confusion between the scientific meaning of "conductor" (electricity) and "conduction" (heat).
3. Low-stakes/Open-ended: Recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice recognition for ESL learners.
4. Rubric constraint: Only 0.5 marks for part (a) suggests a high-stakes precision requirement for a very specific word.
