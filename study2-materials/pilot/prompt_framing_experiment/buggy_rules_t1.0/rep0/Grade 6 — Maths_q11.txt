Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Linguistic Decoding: Identify the keywords "maximum value" and "exact number of times" as indicators for Highest Common Factor (HCF).
2. Strategy Selection: Choose a method for HCF (Prime Factorization or Long Division).
3. Execution (Factorization): Correctly divide 75 by 3 then 5, and 69 by 3 then 23.
4. Identification: Recognize that 3 is the only common factor.
5. Verification/Context: State the final answer as "3 kg."

Step 2: Buggy Rules and Cognitive Obstacles
- Semantic "Keyword" Bug: Students often mistake "maximum" for "total" and perform addition (75+69), or associate "large" numbers with Least Common Multiple (LCM).
- Prime Number Bug: Students frequently struggle to identify 23 as a prime number, attempting to divide it by 3, 7, or 9.
- Division Bug: Errors in dividing 69/3 (getting 13 or 33 instead of 23).
- Conceptual HCF Bug: After finding factors, students may multiply all factors together (confusing HCF with LCM).

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
The target population faces a significant "Language Gap" (interpreting a word problem in English while thinking in Hindi). The cognitive load of translating the phrase "exact number of times" into a mathematical operation is high. Furthermore, a 0.5-point weightage suggests this may be seen as a "quick" problem, leading to rushed execution and lack of checking. Prime factorization of 69 is a known stumbling block for 6th graders who have only recently mastered divisibility rules.
