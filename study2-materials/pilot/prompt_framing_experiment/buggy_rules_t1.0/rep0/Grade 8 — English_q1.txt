Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Decoding and Translation:** Parse the English syntax (WH-question "How did...") and translate the conceptual meaning into the student's primary language (Hindi).
2.  **Information Retrieval:** Recall the specific descriptive passage from the textbook or source text regarding the sunset.
3.  **Semantic Mapping:** Select the specific color adjectives (orange, pink) from memory that satisfy the rubric's requirement for "shades."
4.  **Syntactic Encoding:** Construct an English sentence using the past tense ("The sky looked...") or a fragment that maintains subject-verb-adjective agreement.
5.  **Orthographic Execution:** Correct spelling of non-phonetic words like "shades," "orange," or "pink."

Step 2: Buggy rules (systematic errors)
1.  **Tense Mismatch Bug:** Using the present tense ("The sky is...") because the question uses "did" (auxiliary) and "look" (base), leading students to believe "look" is the correct form to use in the answer.
2.  **Single-Attribute Bug:** Listing only one color (e.g., "It was red") due to a cognitive heuristic where one salient feature represents the whole, failing the rubric's "both colors" requirement.
3.  **L1 Interference (Hindi-to-English) Bug:** Using Hindi syntax or transliterated vocabulary (e.g., "Sky orange tha") or phonetic spelling errors (e.g., "ornge," "pinc").
4.  **Keyword Matching Bug:** Providing a general description of a sunset (e.g., "The sun goes down") rather than the specific visual description requested, because the student recognizes "sunset" but not the "How... look" constraint.

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face a "literacy gap" where their cognitive ability to understand a sunset is high, but their English production is limited. Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice for this group. The requirement to name *two* specific colors is a high-threshold constraint that many "partially correct" students will fail.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account the requirement for two specific colors and the linguistic barriers for Hindi-medium learners:
