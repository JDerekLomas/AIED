Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Read and comprehend the English text, identifying the "pitcher plant" as the subject.
2. Recall the specific biological term "insectivorous" (or "heterotrophic/partial heterotrophic").
3. Relate the "trap-like structure" to the nitrogen-deficiency in soil.
4. Formulate an English sentence explaining the trade-off between photosynthesis (carbon) and insect digestion (nitrogen).
5. Recall a secondary example (e.g., Venus flytrap, Sundew).
6. Transcribe these terms correctly in English.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. **Semantic Over-generalization**: Labeling the mode as "Carnivorous" (common in general speech) but failing the specific rubric requirement for "Insectivorous."
2. **The "Green Plant" Paradox Bug**: Students believe green color = autotrophic ONLY. They may conclude the plant eats insects for "energy" rather than "minerals/nitrogen," missing the nuance of (b).
3. **Phonetic Approximation Bug**: Writing "Insticvorus" or "Insecvorus" due to the gap between Hindi phonology and English orthography.
4. **Vocabulary Substitution**: Using "non-veg plant" or "shikari (hunter) plant" due to limited English academic vocabulary.
5. **The "Sunlight" Bug**: Misattributing the need for insects to a lack of sunlight or "weak" photosynthesis.

Step 3: Target population considerations
- Grade 7 is the transition point where academic vocabulary becomes highly technical.
- For Hindi-medium students, "Insectivorous" is a multi-syllabic, foreign-root word (unlike "Keet-bhakshi" which is intuitive in Hindi).
- Economic disadvantage often correlates with lower exposure to science media (documentaries/books) that reinforce these concepts outside the classroom.
- Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice for ESL/ELL students.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is a staple of the curriculum, the requirement to produce the specific term "insectivorous" correctly in English, combined with the multi-part reasoning in (b) and the recall in (c), creates multiple failure points for a student with limited English proficiency.
