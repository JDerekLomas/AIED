Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the text to identify that the first question asks for the "minimum number required" for equal distribution, implying finding the next multiple of 80 greater than 300.
2. Perform division ($300 \div 80$) or skip counting to find the quotient (3) and remainder (60).
3. Recognize the "round up" logic: to give everyone an equal amount without having leftovers from the initial pool, the nearest higher multiple ($80 \times 4 = 320$) is needed.
4. Subtract or add to find the total (320).
5. Solve the second part: Divide the total chocolates (320) by the number of classes (8).
6. Execute the division $320 \div 8 = 40$.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- "Remainder as Answer": Students provide the remainder (60) as the "number required" because they associate "required" with "what is left over."
- "Quotient as Answer": Students provide "3" because they map "equal quantity" to the result of a standard division.
- "Keyword Mapping": Seeing "minimum," students may attempt to subtract 80 from 300.
- "Independent Sub-questions": Students may solve the second part using the original 300 ($300 \div 8$) instead of the "new" total of 320, leading to a remainder and confusion.
- "Language Barrier": Limited English proficiency leads to missing the nuance of "required to distribute" (finding a target total) versus "remaining" or "extra needed."

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 8 students in this demographic often struggle with multi-step word problems (non-routine) even if they can perform basic operations.
- The leap from "300 divided by 80" to "320" requires high-level semantic modeling of the situation.
- The dual-question format increases the "total-path" difficulty; failing the first part usually leads to failing the second.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The complexity of the "round-up" logic (finding the next multiple) combined with the linguistic load for ESL learners makes this a high-difficulty item for this specific population.
