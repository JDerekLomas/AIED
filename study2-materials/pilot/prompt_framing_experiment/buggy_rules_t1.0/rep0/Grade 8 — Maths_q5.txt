Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Pattern Recognition: Identify $9/16$ as the common factor across two terms.
2. Factoring (Inverse Distribution): Rewrite the expression as $9/16 \times [4/12 + (-3/9)]$.
3. Fraction Simplification (Optional but likely): Reduce $4/12$ to $1/3$ and $-3/9$ to $-1/3$.
4. Signed Rational Addition: Calculate $4/12 + (-3/9)$ or $1/3 - 1/3$.
5. Final Multiplication: Multiply $9/16$ by the result of the parentheses (0).

Step 2: Buggy rules
- Distributive failure: Multiplying $9/16$ by $4/12$ first, then adding $-3/9$ without multiplying by $9/16$ again (Failure to see the structure).
- Operator confusion: Treating $4/12 + (-3/9)$ as $4/12 - (-3/9)$ and adding the absolute values.
- Common Denominator Errors: Adding numerators and denominators directly (e.g., $(4-3)/(12+9)$).
- Sign Error: Dropping the negative sign in $(-3/9)$ during the factoring process.
- Cancellation Bug: Incorrectly "canceling" numbers across addition signs rather than multiplication.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often struggle with the abstract nature of properties (distributive vs. commutative). While the "zero" result is a mathematical "low-bridge" (making the final multiplication easy), the multi-step requirement of identifying a common factor and handling signed fractions creates a high cognitive load. English-medium phrasing for Hindi-medium learners can lead to "Keyword Shuffling" where they perform any operation they recognize (like multiplication) rather than the one requested (distribution).

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement for a fully correct application of the property (not just the answer 0 via brute force calculation) and the high probability of signed-fraction errors:
