Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Identify the start of the sentence and capitalize the first letter ('R' in Riya).
2. Identify "Meena" as a proper noun (name) and capitalize the first letter ('M').
3. Identify "Sunday" as a proper noun (day of the week) and capitalize the first letter ('S').
4. Identify the end of a declarative sentence and add a terminal punctuation mark (full stop/period).
5. Transcribe the remaining words correctly without introducing spelling or syntax errors.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. "First-Letter Only" bug: Capitalizing the start of the sentence but ignoring internal proper nouns.
2. "Name-Only" bug: Capitalizing human names (Riya, Meena) but treating days of the week (Sunday) as common nouns.
3. "Visual Similarity" bug: In Hindi/Devanagari, there is no distinction between upper and lower case; students may struggle to perceive the "size" difference in letters like 's' vs 'S' or 'm' vs 'M' as a formal grammatical requirement.
4. "Missing Terminal" bug: Omitting the full stop because the sentence feels "finished" conceptually without the graphic mark.
5. "Lowercase Proper Noun" bug: Failing to capitalize "Meena" because it appears in the middle of the sentence (positional bias).

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 6 students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often face "interference" from Devanagari script, which lacks capitalization. In economically weaker sections, exposure to English text outside the classroom is minimal. The open-ended format is significantly harder than a multiple-choice format because it requires simultaneous execution of four distinct mechanics (Start Cap, Name Cap, Day Cap, Full Stop) with zero margin for error under a binary (1 or 0) rubric.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that the student must hit 100% of the markers (R, M, S, and .) to receive the 1 point, and the high frequency of omitting the capitalization of "Sunday" or the period among ESL learners in this demographic:
