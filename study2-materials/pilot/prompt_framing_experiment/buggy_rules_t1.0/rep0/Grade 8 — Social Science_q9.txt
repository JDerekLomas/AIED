Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English prompt into Hindi/native conceptual framework, identifying "Parliament" (Sansad) and "Democracy" (Loktantra).
2. **Conceptual Retrieval**: Access the semantic network connecting "Parliament" to its functions (law-making, representation, oversight).
3. **Constraint Satisfaction**: Map retrieved concepts to the rubric requirements (selecting "law-making" or "voice/representation" over secondary functions like "budget" or "selecting the executive").
4. **Syntactic Encoding**: Formulate a coherent sentence in English that establishes a causal link ("necessary because...").

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. **The "Definition for Function" Bug**: Students provide a definition of Parliament (e.g., "It is a building in Delhi") instead of explaining its necessity/function.
2. **The "Identity Mapping" Bug**: Treating Democracy and Parliament as synonyms (e.g., "Parliament is necessary because India is a democracy"), failing to provide the functional link.
3. **The "Vocabulary Substitution" Bug**: Using words like "rules" or "decisions" which may be too vague for a strict rubric requiring "law-making" or "will of the people."
4. **The "English-as-Formula" Bug**: Attempting to use memorized "stock phrases" from the textbook that don't actually answer the specific "Why" of the question.

Step 3: Target Population Considerations
Grade 8 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds often face a "language-content gap." While they may intuitively understand that the Parliament is where "leaders sit," translating the abstract concepts of "sovereignty" or "legislative function" into the specific English terms required by a 1-point rubric is a high-order task. Recall (open-ended) is significantly harder than recognition (MCQ) for this demographic.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement to hit specific rubric keywords in a second language and the commonality of the "Identity Mapping" bug in civics, many students will provide answers that are conceptually "near" but procedurally "incomplete" or linguistically garbled.
