Step 1: Procedural Steps
1.  **Cross-Multiplication**: Correctly identify that the denominator of one side multiplies the entire numerator of the opposite side: $5(x - 5) = 3(x - 3)$.
2.  **Distributive Property**: Correctly distribute the coefficients across both terms inside the parentheses: $5x - 25 = 3x - 9$.
3.  **Variable Isolation (Transposition)**: Move terms involving $x$ to one side and constants to the other, requiring sign changes: $5x - 3x = -9 + 25$.
4.  **Arithmetic Simplification**: Perform integer addition/subtraction correctly: $2x = 16$.
5.  **Final Division**: Divide the constant by the coefficient of $x$: $x = 16/2 = 8$.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
*   **Partial Distribution**: $5(x-5)$ becomes $5x - 5$ (forgetting to multiply the second term).
*   **Sign Change Errors during Transposition**: Moving $-25$ to the other side and keeping it as $-25$, or $3x$ becoming $3x$ instead of $-3x$.
*   **Cross-Multiplication Misalignment**: Multiplying numerators together or denominators together ($x-5 \cdot x-3$ or $3 \cdot 5$).
*   **Additive Interference**: Seeing $(x-5)/3$ and trying to subtract 3 from both sides rather than multiplying.
*   **Integer Arithmetic**: Errors with directed numbers, specifically $-9 + 25$.

Step 3: Population Considerations
*   **Grade 8 Context**: This is a standard "linear equations" topic, but it combines multiple algebraic domains (fractions, distribution, transposition).
*   **Language and Background**: For Hindi-medium students in EWS contexts, the symbolic manipulation is often taught via rote "rules" (e.g., "side change, sign change"). Without strong conceptual grounding, these rules "decay" or interfere with one another under exam pressure.
*   **Recall vs. Recognition**: The open-ended format prevents "plug-and-chug" testing of options, increasing the likelihood that a single procedural "bug" results in a zero score based on the 1-mark rubric.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the steps are foundational, the "cascading" nature of the errors—where a mistake in step 1 or 2 makes the rest of the problem incorrect—significantly lowers the success rate in this specific demographic.
