Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English scenario (gardener, pit, waste) into the concept of "decomposition" or "composting."
2.  **Observation Identification**: State the physical change (waste becomes dark, crumbly, or disappears/shrinks).
3.  **Scientific Reasoning**: Attribute the change to the action of microorganisms/decomposers (biological process).
4.  **Evaluative Judgment**: Link the resultant product (manus/compost) to specific soil benefits (nutrients, humus, fertility).
5.  **English Composition**: Synthesize these three parts into a coherent written response.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1.  **Semantic Over-generalization**: Identifying a change (e.g., "it smells bad" or "it rotted") but failing to link it to a scientific process.
2.  **Keyword Missing**: Describing the process but lacking the specific English vocabulary (e.g., "microbes," "decomposition") required for full marks in a science context.
3.  **Process-Product Confusion**: Stating that it is beneficial without explaining *why* (e.g., "it's good for plants" vs. "it increases soil nutrients").
4.  **Language Interference (L1 to L2)**: Thinking in Hindi (Khada/Khaad) but unable to translate the causal reasoning into English, leading to incomplete sentences or "Hinglish."
5.  **Partial Completion Bug**: Answering the "Does he notice a change?" and "Is it beneficial?" (binary yes/no) while skipping the "Give reasons" and "Evaluate" components.

Step 3: Target student population analysis
Grade 8 students from economically weaker sections often have high conceptual familiarity with composting (due to proximity to agricultural or rural practices) but low English literacy. The open-ended nature of "Give reasons and evaluate" is a high-order cognitive task. In many Indian government school contexts, students struggle to transition from rote memorization of short definitions to synthesizing a three-part evaluative answer in a second language.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
The complexity of the three-part prompt (Observation + Reason + Evaluation) combined with the language barrier significantly reduces the likelihood of a "fully correct" response according to a standard rubric, even if the student understands the underlying science.
