Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English prompt and identify the core task ("Write theme/central idea") and the specific subject ("The Last Bargain").
2. Retrieve from long-term memory the episodic or semantic content of the poem (the encounters with the King, the Rich Man, and the Fair Maid).
3. Abstract the moral/philosophical concept (freedom/happiness) from the narrative events (refusing gold/power).
4. Translate the abstract concept from Hindi/L1 internal thought into English syntax.
5. Apply vocabulary that maps to the rubric (e.g., "money cannot buy happiness," "freedom is better than power").

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" (Cognitive/Linguistic)
1. Narrative-Theme Confusion: Providing a summary of plot points (the man met a king) instead of an abstract theme (the bug of "summarizing instead of analyzing").
2. Title-Mapping Error: Associating the word "Bargain" with its literal meaning of "shopping" or "negotiating" rather than its metaphorical meaning.
3. Translation Interference: Producing ungrammatical English strings that obscure the meaning (e.g., "Man no want money he want free").
4. Keyword Retrieval Failure: Recalling that the poem is about a "deal" but failing to identify the specific third party (the child) that represents the correct theme.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face "The Fourth Grade Slump" in L2 acquisition. While they may understand the poem's sentiment in Hindi, the open-ended "Write" command requires high-level production. In a government school context with limited English exposure, recall-based tasks have significantly higher failure rates than recognition-based tasks (MCQs).

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The combination of requiring abstract reasoning (theme vs. plot) and the linguistic barrier of articulating that theme in a second language makes this a high-difficulty item for this specific cohort.
