Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Visual Recognition: Identify the core activity in the image (deforestation/tree felling).
2. Semantic Retrieval: Recall the specific term ("Deforestation") or a descriptive phrase in English.
3. Causal Reasoning: Connect the visual stimuli to long-term ecological consequences (global warming, soil erosion, loss of habitat).
4. Linguistic Encoding: Synthesize the observation and the consequence into a grammatically coherent English sentence.
5. Scope Management: Recognize that both part (a) and (b) must be answered correctly to satisfy the "1 mark" rubric requirement, despite it being a two-part question.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. Labeling Bug: Providing a concrete noun instead of the process (e.g., writing "Axe" or "Tree" for part a).
2. Tautological Error: Defining the consequence as the action itself (e.g., "Consequence is trees are gone").
3. Language Interference (Hinglish/Transliteration): Mapping Hindi syntax onto English, resulting in unintelligible or partial sentences (e.g., "Ped katna bad hai").
4. Single-Part Completion: Answering (a) but omitting (b) due to the low point value (1 mark) creating a false sense of required effort.
5. Concept Overgeneralization: Attributing any environmental damage to "Pollution" regardless of the specific context of deforestation.

Step 3: Population Considerations
The open-ended format is significantly harder than multiple-choice for students with limited English proficiency. While "Deforestation" is a Tier 2 vocabulary word common in Grade 8, the "long-term consequences" require abstract reasoning and command of future tense ("will be faced"), which often acts as a barrier for Hindi-medium learners even if the underlying scientific concept is understood.
