Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Comprehend the English prompt "Describes the poet’s writing style" (parsing syntax and vocabulary).
2. Retrieve the definition of "writing style" from long-term memory (distinguishing it from "theme," "mood," or "plot").
3. Analyze the provided text/poem to identify literary characteristics (linguistic register, sentence structure, imagery).
4. Select a specific English adjective from an internal lexicon that matches the identified characteristics.
5. Apply correct grammatical form (ensuring the word is an adjective describing the style, not a noun or a verb).

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules"
1. **The Content-Label Swap:** Students provide a summary of *what* the poem is about (theme) rather than *how* it is written (style).
2. **The Affective Error:** Students describe how the poem makes them feel (e.g., "happy," "sad") rather than the author's technical approach.
3. **The Simple Translation Bug:** Students identify a style in Hindi but lack the specific English academic vocabulary to translate it, leading to "good" or "nice."
4. **The All-Purpose Descriptor:** Using a memorized word (like "simple") for every poem regardless of its actual complexity because it worked on a previous task.
5. **The Literal Interpretation Bug:** Describing the physical handwriting or the use of a pen/paper rather than the literary style.

Step 3: Target student population considerations
Grade 7 students in this context are transitioning from concrete to abstract reasoning. The "open-ended" format is significantly harder than multiple-choice for Hindi-medium learners because it requires *active recall* of abstract literary terms (e.g., "informal," "descriptive") which are rarely used in daily conversation. The lack of a word bank (recognition vs. recall) creates a high barrier for students with limited English exposure.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Considering the abstract nature of "writing style" vs. "summary," the linguistic barrier of retrieving specific English adjectives, and the high probability of the "Content-Label Swap" bug:
