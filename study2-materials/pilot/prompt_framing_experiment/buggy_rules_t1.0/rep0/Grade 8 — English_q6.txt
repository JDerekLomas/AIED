Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the command word "Define" and the vocabulary term "fable" from English to conceptual understanding.
2. Retrieve the three core attributes of the schema from long-term memory: (a) genre: short story, (b) characters: animals/personification, (c) purpose: moral lesson.
3. Formulate a syntactically correct English sentence (Subject-Verb-Complement) to express the definition.
4. Translate internal conceptual understanding into written English output, managing spelling and grammar.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" (Procedural errors)
1. **The "Example as Definition" Bug:** Providing an example (e.g., "The Ant and the Cricket") instead of a categorical definition.
2. **The "Feature Omission" Bug:** Identifying only one attribute (e.g., "it is a story about animals") while omitting the "moral" or "short" components required by the rubric.
3. **The "Category Error" Bug:** Confusing "fable" with "fairytale" or "myth" due to overlapping features (magic/fiction).
4. **The "Linguistic Translation" Bug:** Thinking of the definition in Hindi ("Kahaani jisse shiksha milti hai") but failing to find the specific English equivalents for "imparts" or "moral."

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students in this context face a "double burden": they must recall a specific literary definition (recall is harder than recognition) and encode it in a second language. In economically weaker sections/Hindi-medium backgrounds, English is often taught via rote memorization of specific textbook definitions. If the exact phrasing from the textbook isn't memorized, the student lacks the linguistic "scaffolding" to construct the definition independently, even if they understand what a fable is.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
While many students will recognize a fable, the requirement to *define* it in English with all rubric-specific components (animals + moral + story) creates a high threshold. Systematic errors (partial definitions or examples-only) are highly prevalent in this demographic for open-ended English items.
