Step 1: Specific procedural steps:
1. Decode the English instruction "Write the antonym (opposite word)."
2. Access the semantic meaning of the stimulus word "ancient."
3. Map the meaning of "ancient" to its Hindi equivalent (e.g., *pracheen*).
4. Retrieve the opposite concept in Hindi (e.g., *adhunik* or *naya*).
5. Translate the target concept back into the English target words "modern" or "new."
6. Orthographically encode the retrieved English word (spelling).

Step 2: Common "buggy rules" or systematic errors:
1. **Instruction Confusion (Synonym for Antonym):** Providing a synonym ("old") instead of an antonym due to confusion between the terms.
2. **Phonetic Spelling Bug:** Writing "modren" or "morden" (very common in Indian ESL contexts), which may be marked incorrect depending on strictness.
3. **Semantic Proximity Bug:** Providing a word that is related but not an antonym (e.g., "history").
4. **Vocabulary Gap:** Knowing the concept but lacking the specific English lexical item "modern."

Step 3: Target population considerations:
Grade 7 students from economically weaker sections often have high "word poverty" in English. "Ancient" is a Tier 2/Tier 3 academic word. While "new" is a common word, the academic context of "ancient" often triggers a search for "modern," which is a harder retrieval and spelling task. The open-ended format prevents guessing, which is possible in multiple-choice formats.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
Given the shift from recognition to recall and the linguistic transition from Hindi to English, many students will either provide the synonym "old" or struggle to spell "modern" correctly.
