Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English prompt into a mental representation (likely in Hindi) while correctly identifying keywords like "colonial rule," "tribal," and "distinct."
2. **Concept Retrieval**: Access the specific schema for Grade 8 History (Tribals, Dikus, and the Golden Age) and recall the shift from traditional to colonial land laws.
3. **Synthesis**: Identify the causal link between British policy (Forest Acts) and the consequence (loss of livelihood).
4. **Differentiation**: Select two *distinct* examples (e.g., Shifting Cultivation vs. Forest Laws) to satisfy the prompt’s constraint.
5. **Output Generation**: Construct a coherent explanation in English, ensuring the response moves beyond a simple list to show "impact."

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules"
1. **Keyword Association Bug**: Student sees "British" and "Tribal" and writes a generic response about "fighting" or "Independence" without addressing specific life changes or examples.
2. **The "Copy-Paste" Bug**: Reciting a memorized definition of "Colonialism" that does not answer the specific effect on "Tribal communities."
3. **The "One-for-All" Bug**: Providing one example and repeating it in different words for the second, failing the "distinct" requirement.
4. **Language Interference Bug**: Attempting to translate a complex Hindi thought into English and losing the causal markers (e.g., "Forest law bad. Tribal go away."), which may fail the "clear explanation" rubric requirement.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face a "threshold effect" where their historical knowledge exceeds their English expressive capacity. Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice for this group. The rubric requires an "explanation" for only 1 mark, which creates a high cognitive load-to-reward ratio.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the transition to English-medium testing for Hindi-medium learners and the high demand for "two distinct examples" in an open-ended format, many students will provide partial or generic answers that fail the rubric's "clear explanation" or "distinct" criteria.
