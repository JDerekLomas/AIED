Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Identify and remove quotation marks and replace the comma with the conjunction "that."
2. Execute pronoun shift (deixis): Convert "I" (first person) to "she" (third person) to match the reporting subject.
3. Apply backshifting of tense: Identify "am reading" (present continuous) and convert it to "was reading" (past continuous).
4. Maintain the reporting verb "said" and ensure proper sentence structure/word order.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. **The "Copy-Paste" Bug:** Students retain the original pronoun ("She said that I was reading...") because they treat the quoted text as a fixed unit.
2. **The "Tense-Freeze" Bug:** Students change the pronoun but fail to backshift the verb ("She said that she is reading...") due to the influence of Hindi, where indirect speech often maintains the original tense for universal or current truths.
3. **The "Mixed Deixis" Bug:** Students change the verb but forget the pronoun, or vice-versa.
4. **The "That-Omission" Bug:** Failing to use the linker "that" (though often accepted in casual English, it is frequently marked wrong in formal Indian rubrics).
5. **Over-generalization of "Told":** Changing "said" to "told" without an object ("She told that..."), a common hyper-correction in ESL environments.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **L1 Interference:** In Hindi, indirect speech often uses the "कि" (that) conjunction but keeps the original pronoun/tense structure of the direct speech, leading to high interference.
2. **Cognitive Load:** This is a "production" task, not "recognition" (multiple choice). For a Grade 7 student from an under-resourced background, managing three simultaneous transformations (punctuation, pronoun, tense) without a scaffold is a high-order task.
3. **Vocabulary vs. Grammar:** While the words "reading" and "novel" are simple, the structural transformation rules are often taught as rote formulas which are easily conflated.
