Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English question (lexical retrieval for "sounds," "heard," and "scene").
2. Access the mental representation of the specific text or narrative provided.
3. Identify the temporal marker ("sunset") within the text.
4. Locate the specific auditory imagery associated with that timeframe.
5. Translate the internal conceptualization (likely in Hindi: "चिड़ियों की चहचहाहट") into a coherent English phrase.
6. Produce a syntactically acceptable English sentence or phrase that aligns with the rubric's specific requirement (birds returning/bird sounds).

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules"
- "Keyword Matching Bug": Searching for the literal word "sounds" in the text; if the text uses "chirping" or "rustling" without the word "sound," the student fails to retrieve it.
- "Literalism Bug": Providing a visual description of sunset instead of an auditory one because "scene" is visually biased.
- "L1 Interference/Translation Bug": Formulating the idea in Hindi but failing to find the English nouns/verbs (e.g., using "birds coming" instead of "returning to nests").
- "Prompt Over-reliance": Copying the question stem ("The sounds could be heard...") but being unable to complete the predicate.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students in this context often struggle with the transition from "learning to read" to "reading to learn." While they may understand the story conceptually, the gap between their receptive vocabulary and their productive English output is significant. An open-ended recall task is significantly harder than a multiple-choice task for this demographic, as it offers no "scaffolding" or recognition cues.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
Given the requirement for specific content (birds/nests) and the linguistic barrier of producing an original English phrase, many students will likely provide a visual answer or a generic answer about the sun, or fail to bridge the gap between the Hindi concept and the English rubric requirement.
