Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the English prompt and identify it as a subjective preference task.
2. Access the mental representation of the poem (recall) or scan the provided text.
3. Select a specific segment that constitutes a "line" (rather than a word or a stanza).
4. Transcribe or quote that line accurately.
5. Formulate a reason for the preference in English (reasoning step).
6. Encode that reason into a syntactically coherent English sentence (e.g., "I like it because...").

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. **The Labeling Bug**: Identifying a stanza or a single word instead of a "line."
2. **The "Copy-All" Bug**: Copying the entire poem or the title because the student cannot discriminate specific parts.
3. **The "Because" Loop**: Writing "I like this line because I like it," failing the rubric's requirement for a "why."
4. **Translation Freeze**: Having a reason in Hindi/L1 but being unable to translate "beautiful," "brave," or "happy" into English, leading to an empty response.
5. **The Circularity Bug**: Re-stating the prompt as the answer (e.g., "The line I like most is this line").

Step 3: Population Considerations
For Grade 6 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds, an open-ended "Why" question is significantly more difficult than a multiple-choice question. While "denoting a line" is a low-level task (copying), providing a "why" in a second language acts as a high-barrier filter. In many government school contexts, rote memorization is prioritized over expressing personal opinion, meaning students often struggle with the "subjective-justification" format.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While many students will successfully copy a line (0.75 or 1 mark), the rubric requires *both* the line and the "why" for full marks (1.5). The linguistic jump required to articulate a reason in English will be the primary failure point for a majority of the population.
