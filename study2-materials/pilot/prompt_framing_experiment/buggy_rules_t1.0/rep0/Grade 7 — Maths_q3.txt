Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall the specific formula for the area of a triangle ($1/2 \times b \times h$).
2. Identify and extract the numerical values for base (8) and height (6) from the text.
3. Substitute the values into the formula correctly ($1/2 \times 8 \times 6$).
4. Perform the multiplication of the two integers ($8 \times 6 = 48$).
5. Perform the division/fractional multiplication ($48 / 2$ or $1/2 \times 48$).
6. State the final numerical result.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
- Formula Confusion (The "Rectangle/Parallelogram Bug"): Students often omit the $1/2$ and simply multiply $base \times height$, assuming the area formula for 4-sided figures applies to all polygons.
- Additive Bug: Instead of multiplying dimensions, students add them ($8 + 6 = 14$ or $1/2(8+6) = 7$).
- Division Failure: Students perform the multiplication ($48$) but forget to divide by 2, or they divide only one dimension by 2 and then forget to multiply by the other.
- Misinterpretation of "Base/Height": In more complex diagrams, students struggle, but in text-based items, the primary bug is linguistic—failing to associate the English words "base" and "height" with the variables $b$ and $h$.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 7 students in this demographic often struggle with "recall" vs. "recognition." Without a provided diagram or a multiple-choice list, the cognitive load of retrieving the $1/2$ coefficient is high. English language proficiency is a significant barrier; "base" and "height" are technical terms that may not be deeply rooted in their vocabulary compared to their Hindi equivalents (आधार and ऊँचाई), leading to "no-attempt" or random operations.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the arithmetic is simple (single digits), the combination of formula retrieval and the common error of treating triangles like rectangles significantly lowers the success rate. In economically weaker section (EWS) contexts with language barriers, the "omission of 1/2" bug is the most frequent distractor.
