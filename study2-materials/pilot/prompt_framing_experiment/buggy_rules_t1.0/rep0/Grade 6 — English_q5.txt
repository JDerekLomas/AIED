Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode and comprehend the English-language question prompt ("most important thing").
2. Scan and parse the poem to identify key nouns and thematic sentiments.
3. Distinguish between literal objects mentioned and abstract thematic values (friendship/blessings).
4. Map the identified theme to the specific evaluative phrase "most important."
5. Formulate an English sentence or phrase that aligns with the rubric's requirement for thematic agreement.

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules" or systematic errors
1. **The Literalism Bug:** Selecting the first concrete noun mentioned in the poem rather than the abstract theme.
2. **The Keyword Match Bug:** Searching for the word "important" in the text; if absent, failing to respond or choosing a random line.
3. **The L1-to-L2 Translation Bug:** Attempting to translate a complex thought from Hindi but producing an unintelligible English string that fails the rubric’s "relevant phrase" requirement.
4. **The Wh-Question Confusion Bug:** Misinterpreting "What" as "Who" or "Where" based on common phonetic/orthographic confusion in ESL learners.
5. **The Copy-Paste Bug:** Transcribing the final line of the poem regardless of its relevance to the question.

Step 3: Target student population considerations
- Grade 6 students in this context are often transitioning from functional literacy to abstract analysis.
- Open-ended questions are significantly higher-order than multiple-choice for Hindi-medium students, as they lack "recognition" anchors.
- The rubric is generous ("overall theme without evidence"), but the "English-only" output requirement acts as a high barrier for students from economically weaker sections with limited exposure to the language outside the classroom.

Step 4: Holistic estimation
The combination of abstract thematic extraction and English-language production creates a high cognitive load that will likely lead to a significant "no-response" or "irrelevant copying" rate.
