Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Draw a straight initial ray using a ruler.
2. Align the protractor’s midpoint (vertex) exactly with the endpoint of the ray.
3. Align the 0° line (baseline) of the protractor perfectly over the ray.
4. Select the correct scale (inner vs. outer) based on the direction of the ray.
5. Identify the tick mark for the specific degree (110° or 40°).
6. Mark a point at the degree measurement.
7. Use a ruler to connect the vertex to the marked point to form the second ray.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- Scale Confusion (The "Supplementary Bug"): Reading the wrong scale, resulting in drawing 70° instead of 110°, or 140° instead of 40°.
- Vertex Misalignment: Aligning the bottom edge of the physical plastic protractor with the ray instead of the actual 0°/center crosshair.
- Inner/Outer Scale Reversal: Starting from the left side of the protractor but reading the scale intended for the right side.
- Directional Bias: Difficulty drawing an obtuse angle (110°) because of a cognitive "prototype" that angles should look acute.
- Linguistic/Instructional Bug: Confusing the term "protractor" with "compass" or "divider" due to limited English vocabulary.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 6 students are often just transitioning from informal geometry to formal tool use.
- In Hindi-medium contexts, "Protractor" is often called "Chanda" (D-scale); if the English term is used in the question without the Hindi equivalent, students may stall.
- The open-ended "draw" format (recall) is significantly harder than "measure" (recognition), as it requires precise motor coordination and tool stabilization.
- 110° is a high-error item because it crosses the 90° threshold, frequently triggering the "Supplementary Bug."

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While 40° is a high-success item, the requirement to draw 110° introduces a high probability of scale-reading error. In a population with limited English proficiency and high-stakes/formal testing pressure, the technical alignment and scale selection are major hurdles.
