Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the English text to understand two distinct queries (process name and specific plant part).
2. Retrieve the technical term "Photosynthesis" from long-term memory.
3. Retrieve the functional location "Leaf" from long-term memory.
4. Transcribe the term "Photosynthesis" with legible spelling.
5. Synthesize the two answers into a written response.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. **The "Label Swap" Bug:** Confounding "process" with "part" (e.g., naming the kitchen as photosynthesis).
2. **The Phonetic Approximation Bug:** Attempting to spell "Photosynthesis" based on Hindi phonology, leading to unrecognizable variations (e.g., "Futosanthesis") which may be marked wrong in strict rubrics.
3. **The Single-Tasking Bug:** Answering only the first part of the question and ignoring the second due to cognitive load in translation.
4. **The Vocabulary Mapping Bug:** Associating "Kitchen" with "Food" but lacking the specific English noun "Leaf," leading to general answers like "Plant" or "Green."

Step 3: Population considerations:
Grade 6 students in this demographic often understand the concept in Hindi (*Prakash Sanshleshan*) but struggle with the English orthography of "Photosynthesis." The open-ended format removes the scaffolding provided by multiple-choice options. The low point value (0.5) suggests it might be part of a high-density test where time pressure increases error rates.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While the concept is foundational, the combination of English-language recall, the complexity of spelling "Photosynthesis," and the dual-requirement nature of the question (Kitchen + Process) creates significant barriers for students with limited English proficiency.
