Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall and retrieve at least two distinct historical monuments located specifically within the geopolitical boundaries of Rajasthan.
2. Filter/verify that the recalled items are "historical monuments" (not natural landmarks or modern buildings).
3. Select one of the two and retrieve its specific city of location.
4. Retrieve a specific historical or architectural reason for its fame.
5. Translate internal knowledge into English syntax (given the medium of instruction context).
6. Organize the response to fulfill the multi-part structure (List 2 -> Choose 1 -> City -> Reason).

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. **The "Famous City" Bug:** Substituting a famous city name for a monument name (e.g., writing "Jaipur and Udaipur" instead of "Hawa Mahal and City Palace").
2. **The "Boundary Blur" Bug:** Recalling famous monuments from neighboring northern states (e.g., Taj Mahal or Red Fort) due to shared "historical/old" categorization.
3. **The "Incomplete Execution" Bug:** Providing two names but failing to provide the city/reason, or providing the city/reason for the wrong monument.
4. **The "Generalization" Bug:** Providing a vague reason for fame (e.g., "it is very beautiful" or "it is very old") which may not meet the threshold for "why it is famous" depending on teacher grading rigor.
5. **The "Labeling" Bug:** Confusing the monument with the ruler who built it.

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 6 students are transitioning from rote recognition to structural recall. For students from economically weaker sections in Indian government schools, English proficiency often acts as a "bottleneck" where the student knows the fact in Hindi (e.g., "Hawa Mahal, Jaipur mein hai") but struggles to construct the "Why" sentence in English. Furthermore, the rubric offers only 1 mark for a multi-step task, meaning any single procedural "bug" results in a score of 0, making the item "all-or-nothing" despite its high cognitive load.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement of three distinct pieces of information (two names, one city, one reason) for a single mark, and the linguistic barrier for Hindi-medium background students, the "Incomplete Execution" bug is likely to be very high.
