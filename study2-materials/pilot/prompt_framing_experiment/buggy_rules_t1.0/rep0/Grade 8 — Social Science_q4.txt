Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of "primary role" and "Panchayati Raj system" across a potential language barrier (English-to-Hindi mental translation).
2. Retrieve the conceptual framework of the three-tier administrative structure from long-term memory.
3. Isolate the specific function (governance/development) from the structural features (Gram Panchayat/Sarpanch).
4. Synthesize a coherent sentence in English that connects "local level" with "administration" or "self-rule."

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **The Nominal Bug:** Substituting a definition of a term for its "role" (e.g., "It is a system with three levels").
2. **The Concrete-Example Bug:** Providing a specific task instead of the primary role (e.g., "They build roads and wells").
3. **The Transliteration Bug:** Using Hindi phonetics or syntax that fails to meet English rubrics (e.g., "Village people rule self").
4. **The Structural Confusion Bug:** Confusing the role of the Panchayati Raj with the role of the State or Central government.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often rely on rote memorization (parroting) of textbook definitions. In an open-ended format without cues, the lack of English fluency acts as a significant "bottleneck," where a student may understand the concept of *Gram Swaraj* but fail to produce the technical English phrase "local self-governance" required by the rubric.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
The combination of linguistic translation overhead and the abstraction required to define a "primary role" (as opposed to listing a duty) suggests a high error rate.
