Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English sentence: Identify "How" (manner/description), "squirrel's tail" (subject), and "described" (action).
2. Retrieve the specific poem "The Squirrel" by Mildred Bowers Armstrong from memory (recall-based task).
3. Isolate the specific imagery associated with the tail from other descriptions (e.g., "he sat up straight to eat a nut").
4. Map the visual image "question mark" to the English phrase.
5. Synthesize a grammatically coherent English sentence or phrase that matches the rubric’s requirement.

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules" / systematic errors
1. **Semantic Misalignment (Keyword Matching):** Students see "How" and "Squirrel" and provide a general action (e.g., "He eat nut") because they recognize the character but not the specific attribute requested.
2. **L1 Interference (Hindi-to-English):** Students may know the shape (hook/curve) but cannot recall the specific English metaphor "question mark," leading to a blank or a Hindi-influenced description that fails the rubric.
3. **Literalism Bug:** Interpreting "How is the tail" as a question of state (e.g., "It is good" or "It is long") rather than a request for the poetic metaphor.
4. **The "Recall vs. Recognition" Gap:** Unlike a multiple-choice item, students must generate the specific technical term. In the absence of the word "question," they often default to "bent" or "curved," which may be marked incorrect depending on the strictness of the evaluator.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the "Question Mark" metaphor because it requires both high-level vocabulary and an understanding of English punctuation marks, which may not be as familiar or visually emphasized in their primary language literacy. The jump from "I see a tail" to "The tail is a question mark" is cognitively dense for an English Language Learner (ELL).

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Considering the requirement for exact recall of a specific metaphor in a second language without the aid of a text or options:
