Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Horizontal setup: Correctly placing the binomials in parentheses side-by-side or using a grid.
2. Distributive property (FOIL or splitting): Multiplying the first term of the first binomial by both terms of the second, then doing the same for the second term.
3. Coefficient multiplication: Calculating 3×2, 3×3, -2×2, and -2×3 correctly.
4. Variable exponent laws: Recognizing $a \cdot a = a^2$ and $b \cdot b = b^2$.
5. Sign management: Correctly applying integer rules, particularly $(-2b) \cdot (+3b) = -6b^2$ and $(-2b) \cdot (+2a) = -4ab$.
6. Identifying and combining like terms: Recognizing that $+9ab$ and $-4ab$ can be combined to $+5ab$.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- "Partial Distribution": Only multiplying the first terms $(6a^2)$ and last terms $(-6b^2)$, ignoring middle terms.
- "Sign Neglection": Treating all terms as positive regardless of the subtraction signs in the binomials.
- "Exponent Addition Failure": Writing $3a \cdot 2a$ as $6a$ instead of $6a^2$.
- "Variable Mismatch": Treating $ab$ and $ba$ as unlike terms and failing to combine them.
- "Integer Addition Bug": Calculating $+9 - 4$ as $+13$ or $-5$.
- "The $a+b$ trap": Adding coefficients and variables instead of multiplying (e.g., $3a + 2a = 5a$ instead of $6a^2$).

Step 3: Population Context
Grade 8 is the introductory year for formal algebraic expansion in the NCERT/State curriculum. For students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, linguistic barriers in word problems are absent here, but procedural "fluency gaps" are high due to lack of remedial support and rote-heavy instruction. The open-ended format is significantly harder than multiple-choice, as it provides no "corrective feedback" (if their answer doesn't match an option). In government schools, a significant "learning poverty" gap often exists where basic integer operations remain unmastered by Grade 8.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the steps are standard, the cumulative probability of error across six distinct procedural steps (especially signs and exponents) is high. A single slip in any of these results in a score of 0 according to the binary rubric.
