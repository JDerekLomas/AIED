Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall the formula for the Area of a rectangle ($A = L \times B$).
2. Recall the formula for the Perimeter of a rectangle ($P = 2(L + B)$ or $L+L+B+B$).
3. Substitute the values: $15 \times 8$ for Area and $2(15 + 8)$ for Perimeter.
4. Execute the multiplication: $15 \times 8 = 120$.
5. Execute the addition and scaling: $15 + 8 = 23$; $23 \times 2 = 46$.
6. Assign correct units: $cm^2$ or $sq. cm$ for Area; $cm$ for Perimeter.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- Formula Confusion: Using the perimeter formula for area and vice versa.
- Operational Mixing: Adding the two numbers instead of multiplying ($15 + 8 = 23$) for area.
- Incomplete Perimeter: Adding only two sides ($15 + 8 = 23$) instead of four.
- Unit Neglect/Swap: Providing units as $cm$ for area or $cm^2$ for perimeter, or omitting them entirely.
- Multiplication Error: Errors in multi-digit multiplication (e.g., $15 \times 8 = 80$ or $130$).

Step 3: Student Population Context
- Language Barrier: Students may struggle with the English terms "breadth," "length," "area," and "perimeter" if they primarily think in Hindi terms (*lambai*, *chaudai*, *kshetraphal*, *parimap*).
- Rubric Rigidity: The rubric requires the area and the specific unit. If a student calculates the perimeter correctly but fails the area or misses the units, they score 0.
- Open-ended Recall: Unlike multiple choice, there are no cues to trigger formula recall.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the arithmetic is relatively simple, the requirement to perform two distinct operations correctly, manage English terminology, and apply specific units in a constructed-response format creates multiple points of failure for students in this demographic.
