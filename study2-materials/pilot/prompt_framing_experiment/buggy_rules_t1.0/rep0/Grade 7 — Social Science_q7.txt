Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the command verb "Analyze" (requiring decomposition of money's function in a macro-context).
2. Retrieve specific functions of money (medium of exchange, store of value) from long-term memory.
3. Link these functions to the abstract concept of "economic development" (e.g., investment, trade, infrastructure).
4. Decode the command verb "Evaluate" (requiring a judgment of utility/pros/cons).
5. Retrieve contemporary knowledge of "digital money" (UPI, net banking, mobile wallets).
6. Synthesize these thoughts into a coherent written response in English.
7. Align the response to the rubric's specific demand for "at least one significant role."

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. "The Definition Bug": Providing a literal definition of money instead of analyzing its *role* in development.
2. "The Keyword Matching Bug": Writing everything known about "money" (e.g., coins, notes) without addressing "economic development" or "digital money."
3. "The Binary Evaluation Bug": Stating digital money is simply "good" or "bad" without the evaluative reasoning required.
4. "The Language Interference Bug": Inability to translate complex cognitive thoughts from Hindi/vernacular into English, leading to incomplete or nonsensical sentences.
5. "The Single-Task Bug": Answering only the first part of the prompt and ignoring the second (digital money), or vice versa.

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 7 students are in the early stages of formal operational thought. The abstract nature of "economic development" is a high-threshold concept. For students from economically weaker sections in Indian government schools, English proficiency often acts as a significant barrier to expressing complex socio-economic ideas, even if the conceptual understanding exists in their native language. The open-ended format significantly increases the cognitive load compared to multiple-choice questions.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric is lenient (requiring only one role for the full mark), the multi-part nature of the prompt ("Analyze" and "Evaluate") combined with the language barrier and the abstractness of the topic suggests a high failure rate in producing a "correct" synthesized answer in English.
