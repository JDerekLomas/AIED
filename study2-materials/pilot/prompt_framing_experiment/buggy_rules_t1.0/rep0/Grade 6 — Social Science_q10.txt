Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Language Decoding: Translate the English prompt into Hindi/native conceptual framework (given limited English proficiency).
2. Retrieval (Factual Knowledge): Access long-term memory to recall at least two distinct events specific to Rajasthan (e.g., Pushkar Fair, Teej, Gangaur).
3. Verification: Filter out national festivals (Diwali, Holi) that are not "specific" to Rajasthan or do not fulfill the "Rajasthan" constraint in a grader's mind.
4. Selection: Choose one of the two for the second part of the task.
5. Functional Description: Recall a specific "attraction" (camels, folk dance) or "significance" (marital devotion, seasonal change).
6. Syntactic Construction: Formulate a coherent sentence in English that connects the festival to its attribute while adhering to the "one sentence" constraint.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. The "Generality Bug": Listing pan-Indian festivals (Holi/Diwali) because they are celebrated in Rajasthan, failing to recognize the implicit requirement for regional specificity.
2. The "List-Only Bug": Providing two names but skipping the description entirely (common in students used to rote-learning short facts).
3. The "Subject-Object Swap": Attributing the significance of one festival to the other (e.g., "Pushkar is for Goddess Parvati").
4. The "Language-Barrier Bug": Knowing the answer in Hindi but being unable to translate "significance" or "attraction" into a valid English sentence, leading to an incomplete or unintelligible response.
5. The "Redundant Rubric Bug": The rubric asks for two names to get 1 point, but the question asks for a description. Students may follow the question and fail on the description, or follow a perceived "shorthand" and only provide names.

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 6 students in this demographic often struggle with open-ended recall versus multiple-choice recognition. The requirement to write a descriptive sentence in English acts as a high-threshold barrier, even if the cultural knowledge is present.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the cultural knowledge is local, the combination of multi-step execution, English language production, and the specific "Rajasthan-only" constraint significantly lowers the success rate for a fully correct (names + sentence) response.
