Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the target phrase "shining brightly" (requires English vocabulary proficiency).
2. Scan the provided passage to identify potential candidate words.
3. Apply a semantic mapping rule: evaluate if a candidate word in the text (e.g., 'glowing') is a synonym for the target phrase.
4. Verify the constraint: ensure the selected word exists verbatim in the passage (rather than providing an external synonym like 'bright').
5. Transcribe the word correctly onto the answer sheet.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules"
1. **Keyword Match Error:** Student scans for the word "shining" or "brightly" in the text and writes the sentence containing them, rather than finding a synonym.
2. **External Knowledge Bug:** Student provides a common synonym they already know (e.g., "star," "sun," "light") instead of extracting the specific word from the text.
3. **Partial Decoding Bug:** Student interprets "shining" only and selects any word related to light (e.g., "fire," "yellow") without accounting for the "brightly" intensity.
4. **Copying/Transcription Bug:** Student identifies the word but makes a spelling error or grammatical change (e.g., writing "glow" instead of "glowing"), which may fail the rubric depending on strictness.
5. **Contextual Guessing:** Student selects a word based on its position in a "important-looking" sentence rather than semantic equivalence.

Step 3: Population-specific factors
1. **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, "shining" and "brightly" are academic English. If these words aren't in their active vocabulary, the search criteria are lost.
2. **Format Demand:** This is a supply-type (open-ended) task. Unlike multiple-choice, there is no recognition anchor to narrow the search space.
3. **Vocabulary Depth:** "Glowing" is a Tier 2 vocabulary word. Students from low-resource backgrounds often have narrower Tier 2 exposure in English compared to their L1.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
The task requires a high-level integration of semantic retrieval and text scanning. Given the linguistic transition (Hindi to English) and the specific requirement to retrieve a synonym from text—a common "cold" spot in remedial literacy—the failure rate is typically high.
