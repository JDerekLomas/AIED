Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English prompt ("key features," "Constitution") into functional concepts, likely mentally translating to Hindi terms like *mukhya visheshthayein* and *samvidhan*.
2. **Domain Retrieval**: Access the specific schema for Grade 8 Civics Chapter 1.
3. **Selection/Filtering**: Isolate one specific "feature" from a list of related but distinct concepts (e.g., distinguishing a "feature" from a "history" or a "value" like justice).
4. **Production/Transcription**: Write the term in English (as required by the medium of the exam) with enough phonetic accuracy for the examiner to recognize it.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. **Category Displacement**: Providing a Fundamental Right (e.g., "Right to Equality") when asked for a feature, or providing a name (e.g., "B.R. Ambedkar") due to associative priming rather than structural understanding.
2. **Semantic Over-extension**: Using generic positive attributes (e.g., "It is a good book," "It gives us freedom") instead of technical constitutional terminology.
3. **Phonetic/Orthographic Corruption**: Attempting to write "Parliamentary" or "Secularism" but mangling the spelling so severely (due to English being a second or third language) that it becomes unidentifiable to the grader.
4. **Keyword Matching Error**: Conflating "Constitution" with "Government" or "Democracy," leading to answers like "Voting" or "Prime Minister."

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Open-ended Recall vs. Recognition**: Unlike a multiple-choice question, this requires active retrieval. In low-resource settings, rote memorization of headers is common, but linguistic barriers often impede the transition from "knowing" to "writing."
2. **Socio-Economic/Language Context**: Hindi-medium backgrounds often lead to high "interference" where students know the concept in Hindi but cannot produce the specific English "key feature" term demanded by the rubric.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
The rubric is highly generous (only one feature required), which significantly lowers the barrier to entry. However, the requirement for English production and the tendency for students to confuse "features" with "rights" or "historical facts" in a recall-heavy format suggests a significant portion will fail to provide a technically correct term.
