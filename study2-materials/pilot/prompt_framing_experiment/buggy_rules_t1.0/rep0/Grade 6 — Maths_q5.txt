Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the term "palindrome" and its application to a 5-digit numerical constraint.
2. Recall/Identify the smallest 5-digit palindrome (10,001).
3. Recall/Identify the largest 5-digit palindrome (99,999).
4. Perform multi-digit addition with multiple "carrying" operations (10,001 + 99,999).
5. Decode the second instruction ("Write their difference also").
6. Perform multi-digit subtraction with multiple "borrowing/regrouping" operations (99,999 - 10,001).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
- "Smallest 5-digit" bug: Identifying 10,000 as the smallest (ignoring the palindrome constraint).
- "Palindrome definition" bug: Confusing palindromes with "repdigits" (e.g., thinking 11,111 is the smallest).
- "Carrying/Regrouping" bug: Writing 10,001 + 99,999 as 109,910 (failing to carry across multiple place values).
- "Secondary task" bug: Completely omitting the "difference" calculation due to the cognitive load of the first part or misreading the two-part prompt.
- "Language/Translation" bug: Misinterpreting "sum" vs. "difference" due to limited English proficiency in a Hindi-dominant context.

Step 3: Population considerations:
Grade 6 students in this demographic often struggle with multi-step word problems in English. While the addition (99,999 + 10,001) is conceptually simple, the requirement to generate the numbers (recall/synthesis) rather than just operate on given numbers significantly increases the failure rate. Furthermore, the rubric only allocates 1 mark for the sum, but the question asks for both sum and difference, often leading to incomplete responses that are technically incorrect under strict grading.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
Given the high probability of linguistic interference (decoding "palindrome" and "difference"), the likelihood of the "10,000" error for the smallest 5-digit number, and the procedural complexity of multi-step carrying/borrowing, the success rate for a fully correct dual-answer response is low.
