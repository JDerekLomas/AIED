Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the syntax of the question (noting the grammatical error "Why the king felt..." vs "Why did the king feel...").
2. Retrieve the specific narrative schema from Leo Tolstoy's "Three Questions" (NCERT Grade 7 curriculum).
3. Map the concept of "failure" to the "three answers" (Time, People, Action).
4. Translate internal thought/knowledge from L1 (Hindi) or simplified English into 2-3 coherent sentences.
5. Apply the "if-then" logical structure required by the causal inquiry of the question.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. **The "Keyword Match" Bug:** Students search for the word "fail" in the text and copy the immediate sentence surrounding it without explaining the underlying logic requested by "Explain."
2. **The "Grammar-Meaning Swap" Bug:** Due to the phrasing "Why the king felt...", students may interpret this as a statement to be confirmed rather than a question to be answered, leading to circular reasoning (e.g., "The king felt he would not fail because he knew the answers").
3. **The "List vs. Explain" Bug:** Students provide the three questions themselves but fail to link them to the concept of avoiding failure, which is the "Why" component.
4. **L1 Interference Bug:** Constructing sentences using Hindi syntax (SOV) but English vocabulary, leading to fragmented output that may not meet rubric "clarity" thresholds.

Step 3: Population Context
Grade 7 students from economically weaker sections in Indian government schools often face a "literacy gap" where their functional English writing level lags 2-3 years behind the grade-level textbook. Open-ended "Explain" questions are significantly more difficult than "Who/What" questions because they require synthesis and "productive" language skills rather than "receptive" skills.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the story is a core part of the syllabus, the transition from recognizing the story to explaining the causal logic in a second language—while avoiding the "keyword copying" trap—is a high hurdle for this specific demographic.
