Step 1: List the specific procedural steps:
1. Decode the academic vocabulary in English ("Differentiate," "Archaeological," "Literary").
2. Retrieve the conceptual definition of "archaeological sources" (physical/material remains) and "literary sources" (written records).
3. Synthesize a comparative statement (using "whereas" or a table) that distinguishes the two based on their nature (physical vs. written).
4. Recall a specific, valid example for archaeological sources (e.g., coins, monuments).
5. Recall a specific, valid example for literary sources (e.g., Vedas, manuscripts).
6. Encode the response in English (or a mix of English/Hindi) while maintaining the structural requirements of the rubric to earn the single available point.

Step 2: Identify "buggy rules":
1. **The "Example-as-Definition" Bug**: Providing only examples (e.g., "Coins and Books") without stating the categorical difference.
2. **The "Synonym" Bug**: Defining archaeological as "old things" and literary as "new things" or "story things," missing the material/written distinction.
3. **The "Category Collapse" Bug**: Mixing examples (e.g., listing "Inscriptions" as literary because they have writing, though the rubric often classifies them as archaeological/material).
4. **The "All-or-Nothing" Scoring Bug**: Since the rubric is for 1 mark total, a student who correctly identifies examples but fails the formal definition (or vice-versa) receives a 0.

Step 3: Target population considerations:
Grade 6 is a transitional year where students move from general environmental studies to specialized history. For Hindi-medium students in government schools, "Archaeological" (Puratatvik) is a high-register word that is difficult to map to the English term. The open-ended format requires high-stakes recall. In economically weaker sections, lack of exposure to museums or diverse reading materials makes these abstract categories harder to anchor.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
The complexity of the word "Archaeological," the binary (all-or-nothing) nature of the 1-point rubric, and the language barrier for ESL learners significantly lower the success rate.
