Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Identify the lexical items and their grammatical functions (Subject, Verb, Auxiliary, Object).
2. Apply the English S-V-O (Subject-Verb-Object) syntactic template.
3. Identify the auxiliary "is" and the present participle "reading" to form the continuous tense.
4. Place the indefinite article "a" correctly before the noun "book."
5. Execute the mechanics of writing (starting with a capital "He" and ending with a full stop, though often ignored in simple word-ordering rubrics).

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors):
1. **L1 Interference (Hindi/SOV):** Placing the object before the verb ("He a book reading is") due to native language syntax (Subject-Object-Verb).
2. **Auxiliary Misplacement:** Placing the auxiliary at the end of the sentence ("He reading a book is").
3. **Article Detachment:** Placing the article at the end or before the subject ("A he is reading book").
4. **Keyword Salience:** Starting with the most "important" noun ("Book is reading he").

Step 3: Population Considerations:
- **English as a Second Language:** For Hindi-medium students, the transition from SOV (Hindi) to SVO (English) is a primary cognitive hurdle.
- **Recall vs. Recognition:** The open-ended format is significantly harder than a multiple-choice question where the correct rhythm of the sentence can be sensed.
- **Vocabulary:** While the words are basic, the "is reading" construction requires a grasp of tense that is often still being internalized in Grade 6 for this demographic.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While the vocabulary is high-frequency, the syntactic inversion required from their native language, combined with the lack of scaffolding in an open-ended format, suggests a significant portion will fail on word order or auxiliary placement.
