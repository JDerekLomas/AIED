Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English text: Understand that "Name one major factor" requires a single term recall, and "influences soil formation" refers to the geographical process of pedogenesis.
2. Access long-term memory: Retrieve the specific list of five factors associated with soil formation (Parent rock, Relief, Flora/Fauna, Climate, Time).
3. Select and verify: Choose one factor that fits the schema.
4. Translate and Encode: If the student thinks in Hindi (e.g., *jalvayu* or *chattan*), they must translate it to the correct English technical term (Climate, Rock).
5. Transcription: Write the term legibly.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. Over-generalization/Category Error: Providing a component of soil (sand, silt, minerals) rather than a *factor* that *forms* it.
2. Semantic Blurring: Confusing "soil formation" with "soil conservation" or "soil erosion" (e.g., answering "planting trees" or "deforestation").
3. Language Interference: Providing the answer in Hindi or a phonetic English misspelling that obscures the technical meaning.
4. Keyword Association Bug: Seeing "Soil" and providing a type of soil (Alluvial, Black) instead of a formation factor.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Grade 8 students in this demographic often rely on rote memorization of "keywords."
2. Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice recognition for students with limited English fluency.
3. The term "influences" is a high-level academic verb that may be a bottleneck for decoding.
4. "Parent rock" and "Relief" are abstract concepts compared to "Climate" or "Time," which are more likely to be recalled but often confused with weather.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the question is a standard textbook item, the linguistic barrier and the high probability of category confusion (formation vs. types vs. conservation) in a second language significantly lower the success rate for the median student in this specific population.
