Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Identify and extract relevant data from the word problem ($n(\text{black}) = 4, n(\text{white}) = 6$).
2. Compute the sample space/total outcomes by summing the parts ($4 + 6 = 10$).
3. Recall the theoretical probability formula ($P(E) = \frac{\text{favorable}}{\text{total}}$).
4. Correctly map "black" to the numerator ($4$) and the sum to the denominator ($10$).
5. Represent the relationship as a fraction, decimal, or percentage.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. **Part-to-Part Bug:** Students define probability as $\frac{\text{favorable}}{\text{unfavorable}}$, resulting in $4/6$. This is the most common systematic error in early probability.
2. **Denominator Choice Bug:** Using the larger number as the denominator regardless of its meaning, or using a "standard" number (like $100$) because of confusion with percentages.
3. **Keyword Neglect:** Ignoring the specific color requested and providing the probability for white ($6/10$) or providing both.
4. **Operation Bug:** Multiplying the numbers instead of adding them for the total ($4 \times 6 = 24$).

Step 3: Population Considerations
- **Language Barrier:** English-medium testing for Hindi-medium learners often leads to "number grabbing" where students skip the context and simply perform operations on the integers found in the text.
- **Recall vs. Recognition:** As an open-ended question, students cannot use "back-solving" from options, increasing the likelihood of unforced arithmetic or structural errors.
- **Socio-economic Context:** Limited access to manipulative-based learning (actual marbles/bags) often results in a purely rote, formulaic understanding that is highly susceptible to the "Part-to-Part" bug.
