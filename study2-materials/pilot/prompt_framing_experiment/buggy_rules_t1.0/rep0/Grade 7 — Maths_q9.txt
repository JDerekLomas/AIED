Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the word problem and identify the relationship between distance and fuel (multiplicative reasoning).
2. Convert the mixed fraction $5 \frac{3}{4}$ into an improper fraction $\frac{23}{4}$ (or a decimal $5.75$).
3. Set up the multiplication expression: $10 \times \frac{23}{4}$ (or $10 \times 5.75$).
4. Perform the multiplication of a whole number by a fraction (multiplying the numerator) or perform decimal multiplication.
5. Simplify the resulting fraction $\frac{230}{4}$ or perform division to reach the final value ($57.5$).

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
- Fraction conversion bug: Adding the whole number to the numerator instead of multiplying by the denominator (e.g., $5 \frac{3}{4} \rightarrow \frac{8}{4}$).
- Operator selection bug: Dividing instead of multiplying (especially common when students see "how far" and "litres" and assume a rate-finding division).
- Whole number multiplication bug: Multiplying the whole number by both the numerator and denominator (e.g., $10 \times \frac{23}{4} \rightarrow \frac{230}{40}$).
- Decimal placement bug: If converting to decimals, misplacing the point during multiplication ($10 \times 5.75 = 5.750$ or $575$).
- Ignored fraction: Simply multiplying $10 \times 5$ and ignoring the $\frac{3}{4}$ or adding it ($50 \frac{3}{4}$).

Step 3: Student Population Considerations
- Grade 7 students in this demographic often struggle with the transition from whole numbers to rational numbers. 
- Limited English proficiency may lead to "keyword searching" (looking for numbers) rather than conceptualizing the situational model of the bus travel.
- The open-ended format removes the "safety net" of multiple-choice options that might trigger self-correction.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the "nested" nature of the errors—where a student must successfully navigate linguistic comprehension, fraction conversion, and then the arithmetic of multiplication—the success rate is typically low in this specific demographic for mixed-fraction word problems.
