Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English sentence to identify the semantic constraints: "green pigment," "plant leaves," and "essential for photosynthesis."
2. Access long-term memory to retrieve the specific biological term associated with these constraints.
3. Transliterate or map the phonological representation of the term (/ˈklɔːrəfɪl/) to its English orthographic form.
4. Execute the motor task of spelling "Chlorophyll" correctly according to the rubric's standard.

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules" / Systematic errors
1. Phonetic Encoding Error: Writing the word as it sounds in a Hindi-vernacular accent (e.g., "Clorophil," "Chlorofill," or "Klorofyl").
2. Concept Displacement: Substituting the pigment with the process (Photosynthesis), the organelle (Chloroplast), or the gas (Oxygen/Carbon Dioxide) due to semantic clustering.
3. Translation Gap: Knowing the concept in Hindi ("Harit lavak") but being unable to retrieve the English technical term.
4. Letter Inversion/Omission: Omitting the 'h' after 'c' or 'p', or failing the double 'l' at the end.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds often face a "bottleneck" where conceptual understanding exists, but the high-stakes requirement of correct English spelling in an open-ended format acts as a barrier. While "Chlorophyll" is a high-frequency term in Science, the lack of scaffolding (no multiple choice) increases the retrieval and orthographic burden significantly for second-language learners.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account that many students will provide phonetically recognizable but technically "incorrect" spellings, and the rubric requires "Correctly naming" (which in strict government grading often demands near-accurate spelling), the success rate is dampened by the English-language barrier.
