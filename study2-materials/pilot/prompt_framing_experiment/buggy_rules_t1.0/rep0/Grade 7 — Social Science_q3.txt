Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the English prompt (linguistic comprehension).
2. Recall the specific constitutional definition of equality (Article 14/15 or the concept of "equal before the law").
3. Translate abstract legal concepts into concrete daily scenarios.
4. Construct a coherent sentence in English (or a mix of English/Hindi depending on school norms) that links the concept to the example.
5. Filter irrelevant examples (e.g., confusing "sameness" with "equality").

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. **"Equality as Sameness" Bug:** Defining equality as everyone having the exact same things, rather than equal rights or opportunities.
2. **"Narrow Scope" Bug:** Limiting equality only to gender or caste, failing to generalize the "guaranteed" constitutional aspect.
3. **"Concept-Example Disconnect":** Providing a correct definition but an unrelated example, or a good example without explaining the principle (though the rubric helps mitigate this).
4. **"Linguistic Interference":** Understanding the concept in Hindi (Samanta) but being unable to retrieve the English terminology required for a "Social Science" response.
5. **"Moralizing" Bug:** Treating equality as a "good habit" (being kind to others) rather than a constitutional guarantee.

Step 3: Population considerations:
Grade 7 students in this demographic often struggle with open-ended recall. While the rubric is generous (accepting *either* a definition or an example), the linguistic barrier of an English-medium assessment for Hindi-medium backgrounds creates a high floor for entry. Many students will rely on rote-memorized definitions which they may misapply.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
The generous rubric (allowing for an example *or* a definition) significantly raises the success rate compared to a strict multi-part requirement. However, the cognitive load of translating abstract constitutional principles into English for first-generation learners remains a high barrier.
