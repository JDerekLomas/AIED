Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English sentence structure (Question word + Auxiliary + Subject + Verb + Object).
2. Retrieve the specific narrative context (likely Leo Tolstoy's "The Three Questions") from long-term memory.
3. Identify the causal link (The "Why") between the action (announcing a reward) and the goal (obtaining answers).
4. Synthesize a response in English using correct syntax (e.g., "The king announced a reward because...").
5. Map the semantic meaning of "reward" to the corresponding plot point in the text.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. **Keyword Matching Bug**: Searching for the word "reward" in the text but copying the entire sentence/paragraph surrounding it without filtering for the specific "why."
2. **Tense Misalignment Bug**: Using the present tense or base form from the question in the answer (e.g., "He announce reward...") because of an incomplete grasp of the "did + verb = past tense" rule.
3. **L1-L2 Interference Bug**: Thinking the answer in Hindi and translating literally, leading to idiosyncratic syntax (e.g., "Reward king give for questions answer").
4. **The "Because" Start Bug**: Starting the sentence with "Because..." but failing to complete a functional clause, which may be penalized depending on the strictness of the evaluator.
5. **Retrieval Error (Narrative Displacement)**: Confusing the "reward" with other plot elements (e.g., "to give to the hermit" or "to help the bearded man").

Step 3: Target Population Analysis
Students from economically weaker sections in Grade 7 often face a "literacy gap" where their reading level in English is significantly lower than their grade level. In an open-ended format, the transition from recognition (multiple choice) to production (writing) is a steep cognitive hurdle. Limited English proficiency means that even if a student understands the story in Hindi, the systematic "bugs" in English grammar and vocabulary retrieval will prevent a "fully correct" written output according to standard rubrics.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement for an open-ended English response, the likelihood of multiple procedural "bugs" occurring simultaneously—specifically the struggle to synthesize a grammatically coherent explanation in a second language—is high.
