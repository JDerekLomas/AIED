Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English phrasing of the question (syntactic and semantic processing).
2. Retrieve the specific academic definition of "human environment" from long-term memory (distinguishing it from "natural environment" or "human-made environment").
3. Translate the internalized Hindi concept back into a formal English sentence.
4. Identify a causal relationship (human action → environmental modification).
5. Formulate an example that illustrates "modification" (e.g., building a road) rather than just a component (e.g., a car).

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules"
1. **Component-for-Category Bug**: Listing human-made objects (buildings, parks) instead of defining the *environment* as the interaction/creation process.
2. **The "Everything is Environment" Bug**: Defining it too broadly (e.g., "everything around us"), failing to distinguish the "human" subset.
3. **The Static Example Bug**: Providing a noun (e.g., "Bridge") instead of an action showing how humans *modify* (e.g., "cutting trees to build a bridge").
4. **Linguistic Interference Bug**: Using "human environment" synonymously with "society" or "population" due to common Hindi usage of *manav* (human).
5. **Score-to-Effort Mismatch**: Since the item is only worth 0.5 marks, students may skip the definition and provide only the example, or vice versa, assuming partial credit is the goal.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students in this demographic often face a "literacy gap" where their conceptual understanding in their mother tongue exceeds their ability to express it in English. The open-ended nature of the question requires high-stakes recall. In Indian government school contexts, "human environment" is often confused with "human-made environment," a distinction emphasized in NCERT textbooks but frequently conflated by students.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the 0.5-point weight (which suggests a minor sub-question), the English language barrier, and the specific technical distinction required between "human-made" and "human" environments, many students will provide a partially correct or "buggy" response that fails to meet the full rubric criteria.
