Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Read and comprehend the sentence "We ran around" despite limited English proficiency.
2. **Syntactic Isolation**: Identify the specific word "around" and its grammatical relationship to the verb "ran."
3. **Categorical Recall**: Access the mental taxonomy of the eight parts of speech (learned in English, a second or third language).
4. **Functional Analysis**: Determine if "around" functions as a preposition (requiring an object) or an adverb (modifying the verb "ran" by describing direction/location).
5. **Terminology Matching**: Correctly map the functional analysis to the English term "adverb" and retrieve the correct spelling for an open-ended response.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **"Preposition Bias"**: Students often memorize "around" exclusively as a preposition (e.g., "around the tree"). They apply the rule "around = preposition" regardless of the presence of an object.
2. **"Position = Subject/Object"**: A buggy rule where the last word in a short sentence is automatically categorized as a noun or object.
3. **"Definition Over-extension"**: Defining an adverb only as a word ending in "-ly." Since "around" doesn't end in "-ly," students rule it out.
4. **"Translation Error"**: Translating "around" to a Hindi equivalent (like *aas-paas* or *chaaron aur*) which may function differently or be perceived as a noun/adjective in the student's mental model.

Step 3: Target student population
The students are Grade 7, meaning they are at a transitional stage of grammar acquisition. The open-ended format is significantly harder than a multiple-choice format; it requires active recall and correct spelling. For English Language Learners (ELLs) from economically weaker sections, the distinction between an intransitive prepositional use (adverbial particle) and a preposition is one of the most sophisticated "nuance" tasks in English grammar.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the high probability of the "Preposition Bias" bug and the difficulty of distinguishing adverbs from prepositions without an object in a second language, most students will likely misidentify the word or fail to recall the specific English term "adverb."
