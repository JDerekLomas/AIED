Step 1: Specific procedural steps:
1. Identify the object ("the leaves") and move it to the subject position.
2. Identify the tense of the verb ("blew" = past simple).
3. Select the correct form of the auxiliary verb "to be" matching the new subject and original tense ("the leaves" + past plural = "were").
4. Identify the past participle of the irregular verb "blow" ("blown").
5. Position the particle "away" correctly in relation to the verb.
6. Identify the agent ("the wind") and move it to the end preceded by the preposition "by."

Step 2: Common "buggy rules":
1. **Tense Mismatch:** Using "are" instead of "were" (applying present tense by default).
2. **Subject-Verb Agreement Error:** Using "was" instead of "were" (treating "leaves" as a collective singular or failing to match number).
3. **Irregular Verb Regularization:** Writing "blowed" instead of "blown."
4. **V3/V2 Confusion:** Using the simple past form in the passive slot ("were blew").
5. **Preposition Omission/Substitution:** Omitting "by" or "away," or misplacing "away" (e.g., "The leaves were blown by the wind away").
6. **Literal Translation Bug:** Attempting to translate the Hindi passive structure (*ke dwara*) into English with incorrect word order.

Step 3: Population Considerations:
- **Grade 7:** This is the introductory stage for complex voice transformations in many state curricula.
- **English Proficiency:** For Hindi-medium students, irregular English verbs (blow-blew-blown) are a high-frequency failure point.
- **Open-ended recall:** Unlike multiple-choice, this requires perfect orthography and synthesis of multiple grammatical rules simultaneously.
- **Economic context:** Limited exposure to "natural" English outside of rote-learned textbook examples.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
The combination of an irregular verb ("blown"), a plural subject ("leaves"), and the necessity of the auxiliary "were" creates three distinct "trap" points where a systematic error can occur. In a typical Indian government school setting, while many may understand the *concept* of switching subject and object, the morphological accuracy required for the 1-point rubric is a high barrier.
