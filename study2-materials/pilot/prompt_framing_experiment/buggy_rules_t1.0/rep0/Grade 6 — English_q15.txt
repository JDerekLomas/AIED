Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Recall specific attributes or facts about a "best friend."
2. L2 Lexical Selection: Translate these concepts into English nouns, adjectives, and verbs (e.g., name, age, "good," "likes").
3. Syntactic Construction: Apply Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) or Subject-Linking Verb-Complement structures.
4. Morphological Application: Correct usage of third-person singular "is" or "has" and verb endings (e.g., "he plays").
5. Orthographic Execution: Apply capitalization and terminal punctuation (full stops).
6. Compliance: Ensure exactly two distinct sentences are produced to satisfy the prompt and rubric.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. The "Is" Insertion Bug: Using "is" as a universal marker for any verb (e.g., "He is play cricket").
2. The Null-Copula Bug: Omitting the linking verb due to L1 (Hindi) influence where the copula is often at the end or implied (e.g., "My friend name Rahul").
3. The Pronoun Gender Swap: Using "He" for a female friend or vice versa (common in L1 transition).
4. The Run-on Bug: Combining multiple ideas into one long string without punctuation, failing the "two sentences" requirement.
5. The Literal Translation Bug: Direct translation from Hindi syntax (e.g., "My best friend's name Rahul is").

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often face "the fourth-grade slump" in English proficiency. While "Best Friend" is a familiar topic, the jump from recognition (multiple choice) to production (writing) is steep. The binary rubric (1 mark for "grammatically correct") is punishing; a single missing "s" or a missing full stop technically results in a score of 0.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While many students can communicate the idea, producing two *perfectly* grammatical sentences (as required by the 1/0 rubric) is a high bar for this demographic.
