Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Identify the adjective/adverb that follows the intensifier ("weak").
2. Replace the intensifier ("very") with the adverb "too".
3. Identify the infinitive verb in the second sentence ("walk").
4. Strip the second sentence of its subject and modal negation ("He cannot").
5. Connect the two clauses using the particle "to" followed by the base form of the verb.
6. Maintain the logical relationship between the sentences while ensuring correct syntactic structure (omitting the second "He").

Step 2: Systematic procedural errors ("Buggy rules")
1. **Redundancy Bug:** Including both the intensifier and the new marker (e.g., "He is too very weak to walk").
2. **Negation Retention Bug:** Keeping the "not" because the student perceives the original meaning as negative (e.g., "He is too weak to not walk").
3. **Subject Retention Bug:** Keeping the second subject (e.g., "He is too weak he to walk").
4. **Tautological Confusion:** Using "to" and "too" interchangeably due to phonetic similarity (e.g., "He is to weak too walk").
5. **Full Infinitive Error:** Treating "can" as part of the verb phrase (e.g., "He is too weak to cannot walk").

Step 3: Target population considerations
- Grade 8 students in this context often learn English via grammar-translation methods. 
- Limited English proficiency (LEP) increases reliance on rote memorization of patterns rather than syntactic understanding.
- Open-ended "Rewrite" tasks are significantly harder than multiple-choice tasks for this demographic, as they require active production and correct spelling of functional words.
- In Hindi-medium contexts, the "too...to" construction has no direct parallel in simple sentence structure, often leading to literal translation errors.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account the multi-step nature of the transformation and the high probability of "buggy" interference (especially retention of the negative and confusion between 'to/too'), the success rate for a perfect production in this demographic is typically low.
