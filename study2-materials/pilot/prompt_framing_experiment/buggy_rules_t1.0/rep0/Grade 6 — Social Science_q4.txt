Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the sentence structure, specifically the grammatical conflict between "the one" and "landforms" (plural).
2. Retrieve geographical data for the state of Rajasthan from long-term memory.
3. Select one specific landform (Thar Desert or Aravalli Range) from the retrieved set.
4. Recall descriptive attributes of the chosen landform (e.g., sandy, dry, old, hilly).
5. Translate internal knowledge from Hindi/regional concepts (e.g., *Registan*) into English.
6. Synthesize the name and description into a written English sentence.

Step 2: Buggy rules:
- **Number Agreement Bug:** Students see "landforms" (plural) and list multiple features (e.g., "desert and mountains") without the required description, failing the specific "describe it" prompt.
- **Region-State Misalignment:** Associating Rajasthan only with "heat" or "sand" as a climate rather than a specific landform (naming "Hot weather" instead of "Thar Desert").
- **Language "Translation-Transliteration" Bug:** Using phonetic Hindi terms in English script (e.g., writing "Retila ilaka") which may not be recognized by strict rubrics.
- **The "Name-Only" Bug:** Providing the name but omitting the description due to the low point value (0.5), assuming the name is sufficient for the mark.

Step 3: Population considerations:
Grade 6 students in this demographic often face a "literacy gap" where their conceptual understanding of geography exceeds their ability to express it in written English. The open-ended format is significantly harder than a multiple-choice question for this group. The 0.5-point allocation also creates a psychological deterrent, where students may not exert the effort required for a multi-part procedural task for a negligible grade increase.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
