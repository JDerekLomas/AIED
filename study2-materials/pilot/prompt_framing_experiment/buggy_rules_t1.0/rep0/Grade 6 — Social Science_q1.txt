Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English sentence "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" into a conceptual query (often involving mental translation to Hindi: *Bharat ki do pramukh parvat shrinkhalaon ke naam likho*).
2. **Geographical Retrieval**: Access long-term memory to retrieve specific entities categorized as "mountain ranges" (differentiating them from individual peaks like Mt. Everest or K2).
3. **Spatial Filtering**: Verify that the retrieved ranges are "located in India" (a common point of failure for the Himalayas, which are often associated with Nepal/Tibet, or identifying ranges outside the territory).
4. **Cardinality Execution**: Ensure exactly two distinct items are retrieved and written.
5. **Orthographic Encoding**: Translate the mental concept into written English or Hindi script (phonetic spelling of "Himalayas," "Aravalli," etc.).

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. **Category Displacement (Peak-for-Range)**: Providing the name of a specific peak (e.g., Mount Everest, K2, Kanchenjunga) instead of a range.
2. **The "Boundary Confusion" Bug**: Identifying ranges that are proximal but not primarily "in" India (e.g., Alps, Rockies, or assigning the Andes to India due to general "mountain" keyword matching).
3. **State-for-Range Bug**: Naming a mountainous state (e.g., Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand) instead of the range itself.
4. **Language Interference (Transliteration Error)**: Being unable to recall the English term and failing to provide the Hindi term due to perceived English-only test constraints.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Grade 6 Transition**: This is a pivotal year where students move from general environmental studies to specific Geography. Conceptual clarity between "Peak" and "Range" is often weak.
2. **Language Barrier**: For Hindi-medium students in EWS contexts, "Mountain Ranges" is a complex English phrase compared to the simpler "Pahad" (Mountain).
3. **Open-Ended Recall**: Unlike multiple-choice, this requires active retrieval, which significantly increases the cognitive load and the likelihood of leaving the answer blank.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the Himalayas are a high-frequency "safe" answer, the requirement to name *two* distinct ranges, coupled with the common confusion between peaks and ranges, poses a significant hurdle for students with limited academic English support.
