Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Scan the text to identify words located at the ends of lines (standard position for rhyming patterns).
2. Phonologically process "rain" and "grain" to identify the shared rime /eɪn/.
3. Phonologically process "borrow" and "tomorrow" to identify the shared rime /ɒroʊ/.
4. Select one pair based on the phonetic match.
5. Orthographically transcribe the selected pair onto the answer sheet in a format that indicates a relationship (e.g., "rain-grain").

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. "Last-Word-First-Word" Bug: Students pair the last word of a line with the first word of the next line regardless of sound.
2. "Semantic Association" Bug: Students pair words that are contextually related rather than phonetically related (e.g., "rain" and "shelter").
3. "Visual Match" Bug: Students look for identical letter strings at the end of words but may fail if the spelling is complex (though "rain/grain" is a strong visual match, "borrow/tomorrow" has a deceptive visual similarity that may lead to misspelling or confusion).
4. "Positional Bias" Bug: Assuming rhyming words must be in adjacent lines only (Lines 1 & 2).
5. "Grammar/Translation" Bug: Due to ESL/Hindi-medium background, translating words into L1 to understand meaning, which disrupts the phonological loop required to "hear" the English rhyme.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 8 students in this demographic often have high "functional illiteracy" in English. While "rain/grain" is a simple phonetic pair, the grammatical errors in the provided text ("He had repay it") indicate a low-quality input environment. Students often struggle with open-ended tasks where they must write the words rather than circle them. The phonological awareness required to distinguish rhyme from simple word association is often under-developed in rote-learning environments.
