Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Parsing: Interpret "equal number in each box" as a division operation (112 ÷ 10).
2. Division Execution: Perform 112 ÷ 10 to find the quotient (11) and the remainder (2).
3. Goal Identification (Part A): Understand that "minimum number of pencils required" refers to the deficit needed to reach the next multiple of 10 (10 - 2 = 8) OR interpret it as the total needed (120), though the phrasing is linguistically ambiguous.
4. Goal Identification (Part B): Identify the quotient (11) as the number of pencils in each box.

Step 2: Buggy rules and systematic errors
- Interpretation Bug: Misinterpreting "minimum number of pencils required" as the remainder (2) instead of the complement (8).
- Division Bug (Zero in Quotient): When dividing 112 by 10, students may skip the zero-place value or misplace the decimal, though less common with 10.
- Keyword Strategy Bug: Students often see "minimum" and "total" and default to subtraction (112 - 10 = 102) without conceptualizing the grouping.
- Language Interference: In Hindi, "कितनी और पेंसिल चाहिए" (How many more...) is clearer; the English "minimum number... required" is syntactically complex for ESL learners.

Step 3: Target population considerations
- Grade 6 students in this demographic often struggle with multi-step word problems involving "remainder logic."
- The rubric only awards 0.5 marks for finding the quotient/remainder, suggesting the test-setter expects many to fail the "minimum required" logic.
- Limited English proficiency makes the distinction between "how many in each box" and "how many more needed" a high-order linguistic barrier.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
The ambiguity of the first question ("pencils required" could be interpreted as 8 more, or 120 total) combined with the division requirement for ESL learners in a low-resource context suggests a low success rate for the *fully* correct answer.
