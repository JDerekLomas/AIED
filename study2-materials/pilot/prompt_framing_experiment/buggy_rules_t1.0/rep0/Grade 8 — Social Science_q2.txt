Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English prompt ("Describe," "key feature," "urban planning") and translate concepts into a mental model of the Indus Valley Civilization.
2. Retrieve specific factual data points from long-term memory related to Harappan archaeology (grid system, drainage, bricks, or citadel).
3. Select one feature that specifically satisfies the category of "urban planning" (distinguishing it from social or religious features).
4. Formulate a descriptive sentence in English that conveys the mechanical or structural logic of that feature.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Procedural Errors)
1. **Category Displacement:** Students provide a correct fact about the civilization that is not "urban planning" (e.g., "They worshiped Pashupati" or "They used seals").
2. **Vague Generalization:** Providing a non-descriptive positive attribute (e.g., "The planning was very good/advanced") without naming a feature.
3. **Keyword Association Bug:** Recognizing "Harappan" and "Urban" and simply writing "City," failing to execute the "describe" and "feature" procedures.
4. **Linguistic Transliteration Error:** Attempting to translate a complex Hindi concept (e.g., *Naliyo ki vyavastha*) into English but losing the technical meaning, resulting in an unintelligible sentence.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Language Barrier:** Grade 8 students in this demographic often understand the history conceptually in Hindi but struggle with the "English-only" output requirement for a 1-mark "Describe" question.
2. **Recall vs. Recognition:** Unlike a Multiple Choice Question (MCQ), this requires active retrieval. In high-stakes or high-pressure environments, retrieval of technical English vocabulary (e.g., "citadel," "perpendicular," "baked bricks") is a high-failure task.
3. **Curricular Rote:** Most successful students will rely on a single rote-memorized phrase (e.g., "Grid system") rather than a conceptual understanding.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The shift from recognition to production, combined with the English language proficiency gap in Hindi-medium backgrounds, creates a significant barrier. While the content is a "pillar" of the Grade 6 and 8 curriculum, the procedural execution of writing a descriptive sentence in English will cause many students to fail the rubric despite possessing the historical knowledge.
