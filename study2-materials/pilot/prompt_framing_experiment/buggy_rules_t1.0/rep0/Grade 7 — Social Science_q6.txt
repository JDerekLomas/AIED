Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English prompt ("significance," "subcontinent," "stating any two points") into a known conceptual framework (likely mental translation to Hindi).
2. **Retrieval**: Access stored geographical knowledge regarding the Himalayas from long-term memory.
3. **Selection/Filtering**: Isolate specific "significant" impacts (e.g., climate barrier, water source, defense) from general descriptive facts (e.g., highest peaks).
4. **Coordination**: Organize two distinct points as requested.
5. **Encoding/Production**: Formulate a written response in English that matches the semantic requirements of the rubric.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. **Keyword Association Bug**: Student ignores the operator ("Explain the significance") and simply writes everything they know about the topic ("Himalayas is high mountain," "Mount Everest").
2. **The "One-is-Enough" Bug**: Student provides only one point despite the prompt asking for two, or provides two points that are functionally identical (e.g., "It brings rain" and "It stops clouds").
3. **Transcription/Translation Bug**: Student knows the concept in L1 (Hindi) but lacks the L2 (English) vocabulary to express "barrier" or "perennial," leading to incoherent sentences that a grader might mark wrong.
4. **Generalization Bug**: Providing vague, non-significant points (e.g., "It is very beautiful," "It has many trees") that do not meet the rubric's "significant impact" threshold.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Recall vs. Recognition**: Open-ended questions are significantly harder for ESL/ELL students than multiple-choice.
2. **Language Barrier**: In Indian government schools, Social Science is often taught in a bilingual environment, but exams are in English. Students often "memorize by rote" (cramming); if the question phrasing varies slightly from the textbook, they fail to retrieve the "chunk."
3. **Socio-Economic Context**: Limited access to supplementary reading or digital aids means students rely solely on classroom lecture quality and rote textbook memorization.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the Himalayas are a core topic, the combination of multi-point retrieval, the need for English production, and the specific requirement for "significance" (functional role) rather than "description" (physical traits) creates a high probability of "buggy" outputs for this specific demographic.
