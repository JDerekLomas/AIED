Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Identify variables for axes (Independent: Classes; Dependent: Number of children).
2. Draw and label the X-axis (Classes) and Y-axis (Number of children).
3. Determine the range of the data and select an appropriate scale (e.g., 1 unit = 10 units) that fits the provided space.
4. Mark equal intervals/increments on the Y-axis based on the chosen scale.
5. Plot the height of each bar corresponding to the data values.
6. Draw bars of uniform width and equal spacing between them.
7. Identify the highest value (Maximum) and lowest value (Minimum) from the data or the drawn graph.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- "Scale Inconsistency": Changing the value of the interval midway up the Y-axis (e.g., 0, 10, 20, 50, 100).
- "Origin Neglect": Starting the Y-axis at the first data point rather than zero, or failing to use a "kink" if necessary.
- "Label Swap": Placing numerical data on the X-axis and categories on the Y-axis, or omitting labels entirely.
- "Non-Uniform Bars": Drawing bars with varying widths or inconsistent gaps, confusing a bar graph with a histogram.
- "Literal Plotting": Placing the raw numbers from the data set directly onto the Y-axis at equal intervals regardless of their numerical distance (e.g., 80, 95, 112 spaced equally).
- "Language Interference": Misinterpreting "Maximum" and "Minimum" due to English proficiency gaps.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 7 students are transitioning from concrete to abstract representations.
- Open-ended graphing is significantly harder than reading a graph; it requires a high "load" on executive function (planning the scale).
- Hindi-medium students may struggle with the rubric's requirement for English labels or may misread the instructions if they are not bilingual.
- Limited access to graph paper in economically weaker sections often leads to students drawing freehand, which increases the likelihood of "Scale Inconsistency."

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While identifying the maximum and minimum is a low-difficulty task, the rubric for part (a) is binary (Maximum score: 1) and requires a correct scale, labels, and axes. Data from similar socio-economic contexts suggests that while many students can draw "a graph," the "Scale Inconsistency" and "Literal Plotting" bugs are highly prevalent (often exceeding 50% of the cohort). The requirement to choose an *appropriate* scale is the primary cognitive hurdle.
