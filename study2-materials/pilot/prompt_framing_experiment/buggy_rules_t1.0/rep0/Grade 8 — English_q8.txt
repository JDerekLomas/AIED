Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Identify the Object ("a delicious meal") and move it to the Subject position.
2. Identify the Tense of the active verb ("prepared" = Simple Past).
3. Recall and conjugate the auxiliary "to be" to match the new subject and the original tense ("was").
4. Recall the Past Participle of the main verb ("prepared").
5. Append the prepositional phrase ("by the chef") to indicate the agent.
6. Maintain grammatical agreement and orthography (capitalization/punctuation).

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. **Tense Preservation Bug:** Using the present tense auxiliary ("is prepared") regardless of the source sentence's tense.
2. **The "Been" Overgeneralization:** Inserting "been" or "being" into all passive forms (e.g., "was been prepared") due to interference from other voice lessons.
3. **Agent-Subject Confusion:** Keeping the original subject as the head of the sentence but changing the verb form (e.g., "The chef was prepared...").
4. **Vocabulary/Transitive Blindness:** Treating "delicious" as a separate entity or omitting the article "a."
5. **V3 Mapping Error:** Using the base form or -ing form instead of the past participle (though "prepared" is regular, this is a high-frequency bug in irregular forms).

Step 3: Population Considerations
For Grade 8 students in this context, the transition from Hindi (an SOV language with a different passive construction) to English (SVO) poses a significant syntax hurdle. Passive voice is often taught as a rote formula ("Object + is/am/are + V3"), leading to "is" being used as a default even for past tense. English proficiency levels in these schools often lag behind grade-level expectations, and the open-ended nature of the task means no scaffolding (like a word bank) is provided to mitigate retrieval failure.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the sentence is relatively "clean" (regular verb, clear object), the requirement for perfect execution of tense-matching and auxiliary selection in a second language makes this a high-error task for this specific demographic.
