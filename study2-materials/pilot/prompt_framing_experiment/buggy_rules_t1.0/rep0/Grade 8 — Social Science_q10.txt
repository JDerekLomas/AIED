Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Linguistic Decoding: Parse the English syntax of the question, identifying the "How/Why" relationship between "traders" and "rulers."
2. Historical Retrieval: Access schemas related to the East India Company (EIC), specifically the transition from the 1600s (Charter) to 1757/1764 (Plassey/Buxar).
3. Selective Extraction: Filter information to satisfy the specific rubric requirement (mentioning trading origin or factories) rather than just detailing wars.
4. Linguistic Encoding: Construct a sentence in English that grammatically links the entity (EIC) to the action (trading/establishing posts).

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. The "Narrative Skip" Bug: Students skip the "trader" premise and jump straight to the "ruler" conclusion (e.g., "They fought the Battle of Plassey and won") because they focus on the conflict/outcome rather than the origin requested by the rubric.
2. The "Translation Interference" Bug: Translating "Vyapari" (Hindi) or "Traders" incorrectly or using vague terms like "businessmen" which may not trigger the rubric's keywords in a rigid marking environment.
3. The "Recognition vs. Recall" Bug: Students recognize the EIC but cannot independently retrieve the specific term "factories" or "trading posts" without a word bank.
4. The "Length-Bias" Bug: Students write long, garbled paragraphs about British cruelty, failing to include the specific technical detail required for the 1-mark credit.

Step 3: Population Considerations
For Grade 8 students in this demographic, English is often a tertiary language. The cognitive load of translating a complex historical process into a foreign language often leads to "cognitive overload," where the student provides a one-word or fragmented answer that misses the specific procedural requirement of the rubric (the "trading" origin).

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the question is conceptually simple, the requirement to produce a specific historical fact in a non-native language, combined with the "Narrative Skip" bug common in history testing, significantly lowers the success rate for a fully correct answer that meets the rubric.
