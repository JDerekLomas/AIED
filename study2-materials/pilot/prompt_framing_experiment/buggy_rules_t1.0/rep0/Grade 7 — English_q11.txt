Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object).
2. Recall the definition of an "adjective" (a word that describes a noun).
3. Identify the nouns in the sentence ("bird", "nest", "balcony").
4. Evaluate which words modify those nouns.
5. Isolate the specific word "tiny" as the modifier of "bird".
6. Write/state the word "tiny" as the final answer.

Step 2: Systematic procedural errors (Buggy Rules)
1. "Noun-as-Modifier Bug": Identifying a noun that feels descriptive as an adjective (e.g., selecting "balcony" or "nest" because they are the "main things").
2. "Position-Based Bug": Assuming the adjective must always be the second word in a sentence or must follow the verb.
3. "Prepositional Phrase Bug": Mistaking "in our balcony" as the descriptive element because it provides "detail" about the bird's location.
4. "Vocabulary Gap": Not knowing the meaning of the word "tiny," leading to a random guess or selecting a more familiar word like "bird."
5. "Rubric Conflict Bug": The question asks for an "adjective phrase," but the rubric only accepts the single word "tiny." A student who correctly identifies the phrase "A tiny bird" might be marked wrong depending on the teacher's strict adherence to the rubric's focus on the single word.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 7 students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds often struggle with the distinction between parts of speech in English due to code-switching and limited exposure to formal English syntax. While "adjective" is a standard curriculum item, the disconnect between "adjective phrase" (in the prompt) and "adjective" (in the rubric/expected answer) creates a cognitive trap for higher-performing students, while lower-performing students will struggle with basic vocabulary decoding.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account the linguistic barrier, the specific vocabulary "tiny," and the common confusion between nouns and adjectives in a second language:
