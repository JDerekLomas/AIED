Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Read and comprehend the sentence structure in English.
2. Identify the three noun phrases requiring articles (elephant, tiger, zoo).
3. Apply the phonological rule for "an" before a vowel sound (e).
4. Apply the phonological rule for "a" before a consonant sound (t).
5. Apply the situational/uniqueness rule for the definite article "the" (specific context of a zoo visit).
6. Rewrite the entire sentence manually without omitting words or changing the base structure.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. Phonological Overgeneralization: Using "a" for all nouns regardless of starting letter (ignoring vowel sounds).
2. Orthographic Bug: Using "an" for any word starting with a vowel letter even if it’s a consonant sound (though not applicable here, it indicates a weak rule set).
3. Definite/Indefinite Swap: Using "a zoo" because the student has not visited that specific zoo, or "the elephant" because they are thinking of a specific one they saw.
4. "The-as-Default": Using "the" for everything because it is the most common article in textbook English.
5. Copying/Transcription Error: Forgetting to "rewrite the whole sentence" and only writing the three missing words (violating the rubric/instruction).

Step 3: Student Population Factors
- Seventh-grade students in this demographic often struggle with the "rewrite the whole sentence" instruction, frequently providing just the missing words.
- Interference from Hindi (L1): Hindi does not have articles (a, an, the). Concepts of "a/an" are often mapped to the number "one" (ek), making the distinction between "a" and "the" cognitively taxing.
- Limited English proficiency means high-frequency errors in spelling "elephant" or "tiger" during the rewrite, even when the prompt provides them.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
The requirement to rewrite the *entire* sentence correctly—combined with the three-part article hurdle (especially the a/an distinction and the definite article usage)—creates a high probability of at least one procedural "bug" or transcription error.
