Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Semantic Decoding:** Decode the terms "biodiversity" and "sustainable development" from English to conceptual meaning (often requiring mental translation to Hindi: *jaiv vividhata* and *satat vikas*).
2.  **Relational Mapping:** Identify the functional link between biological variety and the long-term maintenance of human systems.
3.  **Recall of Ecosystem Services:** Retrieve specific examples (pollination, nutrient cycling, etc.) from long-term memory.
4.  **Synthesis/Explanation:** Formulate a sentence in English that connects these variables using causal language (e.g., "because," "leads to," "essential for").

Step 2: Buggy rules
1.  **Definition-Substitution Bug:** Replacing an "explanation of importance" with a simple "definition of the term" (e.g., "Biodiversity means many plants and animals").
2.  **Keyword Association Bug:** Writing a memorized but irrelevant sentence containing the keywords (e.g., "We must save biodiversity for future").
3.  **The "Good Thing" Generalization:** Using vague positive attributes instead of specific services (e.g., "Biodiversity is very good for nature and we like it").
4.  **Linguistic Bottleneck Bug:** Having the conceptual understanding in the native language but being unable to translate the technical "ecosystem services" into an English sentence that meets rubric requirements.

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often rely on rote memorization (*rattamar*) due to high-stakes testing. In an open-ended format without options, the "recall" burden is high. For many, "sustainable development" is an abstract construct difficult to link concretely to "pollination" or "soil fertility" under exam pressure, especially when English is a third language.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account the complexity of linking two abstract concepts and the specific rubric requirement for "ecosystem services" (rather than just general conservation), the success rate is likely low.
