Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Visual Identification: Recognize the geometric configuration (e.g., a triangle with two known angles or an exterior angle relationship).
2. Recall Property: Recall the Angle Sum Property of a triangle ($180^\circ$) or the Linear Pair postulate.
3. Arithmetic Setup: Set up the equation (e.g., $50 + 50 + x = 180$ or $180 - (angle A + angle B)$).
4. Calculation (Addition): Sum the given angles correctly.
5. Calculation (Subtraction): Subtract the sum from 180 correctly.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- "Sum to 100/90": Students often assume angles must sum to a "round" number like 100 or 90 rather than 180.
- "Visual Matching": If the angle "looks" like an acute/obtuse angle, they may guess a value (e.g., 60 or 90) rather than calculate.
- "Subtraction Bug": When subtracting from 180, students may fail to regroup (borrow) across zeros, resulting in $180 - 100 = 80$ but $180 - 115 = 75$ or $135$ (incorrectly handling the tens/units).
- "Exterior/Interior Confusion": If the figure includes an exterior angle, students may equate the interior angle to the exterior one.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 6 is the transition year where formal Euclidean geometry is introduced. 
- Hindi-medium students often struggle with English-language prompts; however, "Find the angle x" is visually driven, mitigating some language barriers. 
- Open-ended formats typically see a 20-30% drop in success compared to multiple-choice due to the lack of "answer cues."

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that the rubric awards 0.5 marks for a specific intermediate step ($C = 80^\circ$), it implies the question likely involves a multi-step process (like a linear pair leading into a triangle). In a Grade 6 demographic from economically weaker sections with limited formal geometry exposure, the "Sum of 180" rule is frequently misapplied or forgotten in favor of visual guessing.
