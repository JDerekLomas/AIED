Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Parse the English sentence to distinguish between the subject and the predicate.
2. Isolate the action component (the verb) from the noun phrase ("the children") and the object ("football").
3. Recognize that the verb is "complex" (multi-word) rather than a simple present tense verb.
4. Retrieve the grammatical definition of a "verb phrase" as inclusive of both the auxiliary/helping verb ("are") and the main verb ("playing").
5. Transcribe the exact segment "are playing" without including the object or omitting the auxiliary.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "Action-Only Bug": Identifying only the lexical verb ("playing") as the verb, common in L2 learners who equate "verb" with "action word."
2. "Noun-Object Inclusion Bug": Identifying the entire predicate ("are playing football") because the student cannot distinguish between the verb phrase and the complete predicate.
3. "First-Word/Last-Word Bug": Selecting "children" (first noun) or "football" (last noun) due to a lack of English vocabulary/syntax knowledge.
4. "Auxiliary Omission": Systematically ignoring the auxiliary "are" because it lacks a concrete semantic equivalent in many Hindi-to-English translations (where tense is often marked via suffixes rather than separate auxiliary words).

Step 3: Population Considerations
For Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency (LEP), "verb phrase" is a technical metalanguage term. In Hindi-medium contexts, the concept of a "Kriya" (verb) is taught, but the structural "auxiliary + participle" construction in English is often a point of grammatical interference. Since it is an open-ended recall task (not multiple choice), the probability of error increases as they must decide where the phrase starts and ends.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the technicality of the term "verb phrase" (often confused with just "verb") and the commonality of omitting the auxiliary in this demographic:
