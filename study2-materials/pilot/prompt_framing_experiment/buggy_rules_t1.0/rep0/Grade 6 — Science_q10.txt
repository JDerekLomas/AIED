Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Parse the English-language prompt and the tabular data simultaneously.
2. Locate the "growth" variable (height/leaf count) in the table across three categories.
3. Compare three numerical values to identify the maximum (most favorable).
4. Formulate a causal explanation in English linking light to energy/food.
5. Retrieve the specific scientific term "Photosynthesis" from long-term memory (Recall).
6. Encode the written response using correct syntax and spelling.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "The First-Row Bug": Picking the first condition listed in the table without comparing data.
2. "The Everyday Language Bug": Explaining growth through "breathing" or "drinking water" rather than the specific biological process.
3. "The Label Confusion": Mistaking "most favorable" for "most common" or "least."
4. "The Phonetic Retrieval Bug": Recalling the process but misspelling it significantly (e.g., "photosis") or using Hindi terms like "Prakash Sanshleshan" which may not be credited in an English-medium evaluation.
5. "Attribute Matching": Selecting "Full Sunlight" because it "sounds" best for plants, skipping the data analysis step entirely (successful for part A, but fails for evidence-based reasoning).

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 6 is the transition year where students move from general observations to formal biological terminology. For students from economically weaker sections in India, language barrier is the primary cognitive load. While they may conceptually understand that plants need sun, the requirement to "Explain why" (b) and "Name the process" (c) in English moves the task from low-order recognition to high-order retrieval and synthesis.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While many will get (a) correct, the rubric requires a "fully correct answer" (which, based on the three-part structure, typically implies getting all parts right to satisfy the question's demands). The bottleneck is part (c) and the linguistic demand of (b).
