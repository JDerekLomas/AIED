Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English prompt and identify the "constraint" (perspective-taking: being a bird).
2. Retrieve relevant vocabulary (fly, sky, wings, nest, wings, eat) in English.
3. Apply syntax rules for first-person singular ("I am," "I fly," "I see").
4. Formulate a semantic idea that represents a "day" (action-based).
5. Execute orthographic rules (capitalization, spacing, terminal punctuation).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. Perspective Bug: Writing about a bird in the third person ("The bird flies") instead of as a bird ("I fly").
2. Translation-Interface Bug: Thinking in Hindi ("Main udta hoon") and applying a literal word-for-word translation that fails English auxiliary or verb-ending rules ("I flying").
3. Tense-Mixing Bug: Attempting to describe a "day" using past tense irregularly or mixing "is/am" with action verbs (e.g., "I am fly in sky").
4. Semantic Narrowing: Providing a single word or a noun phrase (e.g., "Sky blue") instead of a complete sentence.
5. Punctuation/Case Bug: Starting with lowercase or omitting the full stop, which violates the "grammatically correct" rubric requirement.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds often face a "language wall." While they understand the concept of a bird, the transition from recognition (multiple choice) to production (recall and synthesis) is a high cognitive load. For many, English is treated as a set of memorized rules rather than a generative tool. The rubric is strict ("clear, creative, and grammatically correct"), meaning minor mechanical errors that are common in this demographic (like missing an 's' or a period) would technically result in a zero according to the 1-point binary rubric.
