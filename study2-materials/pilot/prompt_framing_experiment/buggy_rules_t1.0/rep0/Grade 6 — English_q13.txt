Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the written English sentence (syntax and vocabulary: "The opposite of").
2. Retrieve the semantic meaning of the stimulus word "slow" in a bilingual context (mapping English "slow" to Hindi concept *dhīrā*).
3. Access the semantic network to identify the antonym concept (mapping *dhīrā* to *tez*).
4. Retrieve the English lexical equivalent for the antonym (mapping *tez* to "fast" or "quick").
5. Execute the orthographic encoding (spelling) of the word "fast" correctly without phonetic interference.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. **Translation Loop Error:** Student identifies the concept in Hindi but lacks the English vocabulary, leading to "no response" or a Hindi transliteration.
2. **Synonym Substitution:** Student confuses the instruction "opposite" with "meaning" (a common bug in second-language acquisition), providing a synonym like "lazy" or "soft."
3. **Phonetic Spelling Bug:** Writing "fast" as "pfast" or "past" due to L1 (Hindi/regional) phonetic interference or phonemic awareness gaps.
4. **Association Bug:** Providing a word that is contextually related but not an antonym (e.g., "slow" -> "motion" or "slow" -> "walk").
5. **Over-generalization of Suffixes:** Applying "un-" or "dis-" to the stem (e.g., "unslow") based on recently learned grammar rules for opposites.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often face "The Matthew Effect" in vocabulary acquisition. In an open-ended recall task (unlike multiple choice), the lack of a word bank significantly increases the cognitive load. For Hindi-medium students, the word "opposite" itself is often a barrier if they are more familiar with the term "antonym" or the Hindi *vilom*.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While "fast" is a high-frequency Tier 1 word, the requirement for correct spelling and the interpretation of the English prompt in a recall format—compounded by the systemic transition from vernacular to English-medium instructions in Grade 6—suggests a significant portion of the cohort will struggle with the output even if they understand the concept.
