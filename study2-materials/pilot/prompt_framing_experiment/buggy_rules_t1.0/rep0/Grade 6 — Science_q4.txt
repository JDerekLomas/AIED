Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Semantic Decoding:** Comprehend the term "preference" and "property" in an English-language context.
2.  **Domain Retrieval:** Access the scientific concept of "absorption" or "porosity" from long-term memory (recall, not recognition).
3.  **Causal Linkage:** Connect the physical property (absorbs sweat) to the physiological benefit (cooling/evaporation).
4.  **Linguistic Encoding:** Formulate a coherent sentence in English that correctly attributes the property to the material.

Step 2: Common "Buggy Rules"
1.  **Feature-Benefit Swap:** Stating the benefit ("it keeps us cool") instead of the property ("it absorbs water"), failing the specific rubric requirement.
2.  **Generic Positive Attribute:** Assigning a non-specific or incorrect property (e.g., "cotton is soft" or "cotton is white") because it is a true but irrelevant fact about the material.
3.  **Transliteration Error:** Thinking of the concept in Hindi (e.g., *pasina sokhna*) but lacking the specific English vocabulary (*absorb/porous*), leading to vague terms like "it takes water."
4.  **Keyword Over-extension:** Using words related to heat but incorrectly (e.g., "cotton gives us air" or "cotton is a good conductor of cold").

Step 3: Population Considerations
1.  **Open-Ended Format:** Unlike multiple-choice, this requires active recall and synthesis, which significantly increases cognitive load for ESL (English as a Second Language) learners.
2.  **Medium of Instruction Gap:** Students often understand the "why" in their mother tongue but fail the rubric by being unable to name a specific "property" in technical English.
3.  **Socio-economic context:** Limited exposure to supplemental reading materials may result in a reliance on rote-memorized phrases that might not align perfectly with the specific question prompt.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is familiar to daily life, the transition from "common sense" to "scientific explanation" in a second language creates a high probability of "benefit-only" answers or linguistic failure.
