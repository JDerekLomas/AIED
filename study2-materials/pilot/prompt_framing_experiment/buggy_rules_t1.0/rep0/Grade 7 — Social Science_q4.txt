Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Linguistic Decoding: Translate the English terms "transparency" and "governance" into known conceptual frameworks (e.g., *pardarshita* and *shasan*).
2. Domain Retrieval: Access the specific Social Science schema related to Democracy, RTI (Right to Information), or Accountability.
3. Divergent Idea Generation: Formulate a plausible strategy (e.g., digitizing records, public hearings, or strengthening RTI).
4. Syntactic Encoding: Construct a grammatically coherent sentence in English (the medium of the test) to communicate the abstract suggestion.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. Keyword Association Bug: Students see "governance" and provide a generic definition of democracy instead of a specific improvement.
2. Vocabulary Substitution Bug: Misinterpreting "transparency" as "cleanliness" (common in transliteration confusion) or "honesty" without the systemic context.
3. Scope Error: Suggesting improvements for personal behavior (e.g., "we should not tell lies") rather than institutional transparency.
4. L1-L2 Interference Bug: Thinking of a correct concept in Hindi but failing to translate it into an English response that meets the examiner's rubric.

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 7 students in this demographic are transitioning from concrete to abstract reasoning. The open-ended format is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice for this group because it requires active recall and productive language skills. Limited English proficiency acts as a high "bottleneck" filter, even for students who understand the civic concepts.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric is generous (requiring only one suggestion), the linguistic barrier and the abstraction of "transparency" are significant hurdles for 12-year-olds with limited English exposure.
