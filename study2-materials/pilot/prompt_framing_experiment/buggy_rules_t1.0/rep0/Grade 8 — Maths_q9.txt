To analyze this item through the lens of mathematical cognition and systematic errors:

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. **Discount Calculation:** Calculate $10\%$ of $₹1200$ ($1200 \times 0.10 = 120$).
2. **Selling Price (SP) Calculation:** Subtract discount from Marked Price ($1200 - 120 = 1080$).
3. **Cost Price (CP) Algebraic Setup:** Recognize that $SP = CP + \text{Profit}$, specifically $1080 = CP \times (1 + 0.08)$ or $1080 = 108\% \text{ of } CP$.
4. **Division/Inverse Operation:** Solve for CP ($1080 \div 1.08$).

**Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules" and Cognitive Obstacles**
*   **The "Profit on MP" Bug:** Students often calculate the $8\%$ profit based on the Marked Price ($₹1200$) or the Selling Price ($₹1080$) rather than the unknown Cost Price.
*   **Additive vs. Multiplicative Reasoning:** A common bug in percentage problems is subtracting the percentage points directly (e.g., thinking "10% discount and 8% profit means the net change is 2%").
*   **Reverse Percentage Bug:** Students often try to find the CP by taking $8\%$ of the SP and subtracting it ($1080 - [0.08 \times 1080]$), which is a fundamental misunderstanding of the base in percentage increases.
*   **Language Interference:** For Hindi-medium students, the terms "Marked Price" (अंकित मूल्य), "Selling Price" (विक्रय मूल्य), and "Cost Price" (क्रय मूल्य) are distinct; in English-medium assessments, linguistic "noise" increases the cognitive load, leading to retrieval errors of the correct formula.

**Step 3: Population Context**
Grade 8 students in this demographic often rely on "recipe-based" learning. While the rubric only requires finding the SP ($₹1080$) for a full mark (which is unusually lenient for the question asked), the question asks for the **Cost Price**. In an open-ended format without cues, students frequently stall after the first subtraction or commit the "Reverse Percentage" bug. The gap between "calculating a discount" (Level 1) and "finding CP from SP and Profit %" (Level 3) is where most students fail.

**Step 4: Holistic Estimate**
Given the multi-step nature, the high probability of the "Profit on SP" bug, and the linguistic transition challenges for Hindi-medium learners, the success rate for the full correct CP calculation is low. However, since the rubric surprisingly awards a full mark just for the SP calculation, the success rate is slightly elevated, though many will still struggle with the initial percentage application.
