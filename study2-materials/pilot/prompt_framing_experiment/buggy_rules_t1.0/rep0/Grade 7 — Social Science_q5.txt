Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall the definition and characteristics of igneous rocks (origin from magma/lava).
2. Identify the specific geological processes (weathering/breaking down) required to change solid rock into fragments.
3. Recall the specific terminology for these fragments ("sediments").
4. Identify the secondary process (erosion/transport/deposition) required to move these fragments to a site of accumulation.
5. Synthesize these steps into a coherent English sentence or phrase that aligns with the rubric’s requirement for two distinct phases (breaking down + moving).

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- "State-Change Confusion": Students often think rocks transform instantly through heat/pressure (metamorphism) rather than the multi-stage mechanical process of sedimentation.
- "Vocabulary Mapping Error": Confusing "sedimentary" with "sediment" or "sedimentation," leading to a description of the rock itself rather than the process of formation.
- "Process Omission": Describing the "what" (sediments) but forgetting the "how" (weathering or transport).
- "Linguistic Approximation": Due to limited English, using vague terms like "it becomes small" or "it changes" which may not satisfy a rubric requiring "weathering" or "erosion" concepts.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 7 is the introductory level for detailed lithospheric cycles.
- Recall vs. Recognition: This is a high-demand recall task. In a second language (English), cognitive load is split between retrieving scientific facts and linguistic encoding.
- Economically weaker sections often have less access to visual aids or laboratory samples, making the rock cycle an abstract memorization task rather than a conceptual understanding.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The requirement to hit both "break down" and "moved" in a foreign language makes this a multi-gated task where a failure at any linguistic or conceptual node results in a zero.
