Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of the term "protective foods" (associating "protect" with "defense").
2. Retrieve the biological function of vitamins/minerals from long-term memory (immune support/disease prevention).
3. Synthesize a functional explanation in English (as required by the medium of instruction).
4. Recall a specific Vitamin-Disease pair (e.g., Vitamin A-Night blindness).
5. Recall a specific Mineral-Disease pair (e.g., Iodine-Goitre or Iron-Anemia).
6. Differentiate between vitamins and minerals to ensure the examples are categorized correctly.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. **Category Displacement:** Listing two vitamins or two minerals instead of one of each (misclassification of nutrients).
2. **Keyword Association Bug:** Associating "protective" with "strength" or "energy" (confusing vitamins with carbohydrates/proteins).
3. **Semantic Over-generalization:** Stating they "keep us healthy" without the specific mechanism of "fighting diseases" required by the rubric.
4. **Medium-Switching Error:** Understanding the concept in Hindi ("bimari se bachana") but failing to retrieve the specific English technical vocabulary ("deficiency," "protective").
5. **Retrieval Interference:** Swapping the nutrient and the disease (e.g., "Scurvy causes Vitamin C").

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students in English-medium government schools, "protective" is a Tier 2 vocabulary word that may not be intuitively linked to "fighting diseases" in their L2.
2. **Open-ended Recall:** Unlike multiple-choice questions, this requires active retrieval and sentence construction, which significantly increases the cognitive load for students with limited English proficiency.
3. **Instructional Style:** Rote memorization of tables is common, but the "Explain why" (Part A) requires conceptual synthesis which is often a weak point in under-resourced settings.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While many students can memorize the deficiency table (Part B), the combination of Part A (conceptual explanation) and Part B (correct classification) in a second language creates a high probability of at least one procedural "bug" or retrieval failure.
