Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English text to identify the target digit (5) and the number (7560).
2. Scan the number from right to left (ones, tens, hundreds) or left to right to locate the digit 5.
3. Determine the positional rank of the digit 5 (the "Hundreds" place).
4. Translate that positional rank into a value (5 * 100) or identify the name of the place.
5. Provide the output in the required format (numeric "500" or linguistic "Hundreds").

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
- Digit-as-Value: Student provides only the face value "5" instead of the place value.
- Column-Miscount: Student starts counting from the left, identifying 5 as being in the "tens" place (counting 7 as 1, 5 as 2).
- Internal Name Confusion: Swapping "Hundreds" and "Thousands" due to phonetic similarities in second-language acquisition or confusion with the Indian numbering system terms (Lakhs/Crores) versus International.
- Zero-Padding Error: Writing "50" or "5000" due to miscounting the trailing digits.
- Concept Confusion: Providing the "Face Value" when "Place Value" is asked, or providing the "Place Name" incorrectly.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 6 students in this demographic often struggle with the transition from the Indian "units-tens-hundreds" (Hindi: ikai, dahai, sekda) to English terminology.
- The open-ended format removes the "clue" provided by multiple-choice options, making "face value" (5) a very high-frequency error.
- Limited English proficiency may lead to students ignoring the word "place" and simply seeing "value of 5," reinforcing the face-value error.
