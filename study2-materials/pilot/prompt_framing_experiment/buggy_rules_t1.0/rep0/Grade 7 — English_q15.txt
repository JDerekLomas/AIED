Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Identify a personal interest and map it to the English vocabulary word for that "hobby."
2. Syntactic Encoding: Construct at least four grammatically coherent sentences in English using Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structures.
3. Content Mapping: Address three specific prompts (what, when, why) within the paragraph.
4. Tense Consistency: Maintain the simple present tense throughout the description.
5. Orthographic/Mechanical Execution: Apply correct capitalization, punctuation, and spelling.

Step 2: Common "Buggy Rules" (Systematic Errors)
1. L1 Interference (The "Translation Bug"): Translating directly from Hindi/Regional syntax to English, leading to incorrect word order (e.g., "My hobby gardening is").
2. The "List vs. Paragraph" Bug: Writing bullet points or fragments instead of a cohesive paragraph structure.
3. The "Subject-Verb Agreement" Bug: Failing to inflect verbs correctly for the third person or plural subjects (e.g., "I likes playing").
4. The "Prompt Omission" Bug: Forgetting to include the "when" or "why" components, focusing only on the "what."
5. The "Vocabulary Substitution" Bug: Using a Hindi word for the hobby when the English word is unknown (e.g., "My hobby is *shatranj*").

Step 3: Population Considerations
The open-ended nature of the task (recall and production) is significantly more difficult than recognition tasks for English Language Learners (ELLs). In the context of Grade 7 students from economically weaker sections with limited English exposure, the cognitive load of simultaneous translation, grammar monitoring, and content adherence is high. The rubric is binary (0 or 1), meaning a single systematic error in addressing the "why" or "when" results in a score of zero.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While many students may be able to name a hobby, the requirement for a multi-sentence paragraph with specific temporal and causal explanations in a second language creates a high barrier. The strict rubric (requiring all three elements + paragraph structure) acts as a "conjunctive" task where the probability of success is the product of the probability of succeeding at each sub-step.
