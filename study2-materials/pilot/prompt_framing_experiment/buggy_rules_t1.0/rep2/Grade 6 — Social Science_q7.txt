Step 1: Specific procedural steps:
1. Retrieval: Access specific geographical knowledge of Rajasthan’s natural resources from long-term memory.
2. Selection: Identify two distinct items that qualify as "natural resources" (distinguishing from man-made infrastructure).
3. Linguistic Encoding: Translate these concepts into English (if the medium of instruction is English) or articulate them clearly.
4. Causal Reasoning: Identify a functional link between one resource and human activity (e.g., economy, lifestyle, or diet).
5. Syntactic Construction: Formulate a sentence explaining the "influence" (requires use of subordinating conjunctions or causative verbs).

Step 2: Potential "buggy rules" / Systematic errors:
1. Categorical Over-extension: Listing man-made landmarks (e.g., "Forts", "Palaces") as natural resources.
2. Quantity Error: Providing only one resource or listing two but failing the second half of the prompt (the explanation).
3. Vague Attribution: Using "The Sun" or "Sand" but failing to explain the *influence* beyond "It is hot" (missing the socio-economic dimension required by "lives of the people").
4. Semantic Confusion: Confusing "Natural Resources" with "Natural Vegetation" or "Crops" (e.g., listing Wheat or Bajra).
5. Language Barrier "Bug": Attempting to explain complex socio-economic influences in English but losing the logical connection due to limited vocabulary, leading to an incomplete or incoherent response.

Step 3: Population considerations:
- Grade 6 is a transitional year where abstract reasoning (influence/causality) is still developing.
- For students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency, the "Explain" component is a significant hurdle compared to simple recall.
- The rubric is binary (Max score 1), meaning any partial failure (e.g., listing resources but failing the explanation) results in a zero.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
Given the multi-step nature of the prompt (Recall + Recall + Explain) and the "all or nothing" rubric for a 1-point open-ended question in a second language, the failure rate for the "influence" explanation is high.
