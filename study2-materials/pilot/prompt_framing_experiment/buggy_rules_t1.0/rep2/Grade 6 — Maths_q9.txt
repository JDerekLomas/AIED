Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Visual Recognition: Identify that the figure contains a triangle and that the unknown angle $x$ (Angle C) is an interior angle.
2. Conceptual Retrieval: Recall the Angle Sum Property of a triangle (the sum of interior angles is 180°).
3. Arithmetic Setup: Formulate the equation (e.g., $40 + 60 + x = 180$ or $180 - (40 + 60)$).
4. Operation 1 (Addition): Correct sum of given angles (100°).
5. Operation 2 (Subtraction): Subtract the sum from 180° to find $x$.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- The "Linear Pair" Bug: Mistakenly using 90° or 360° as the sum instead of 180°.
- The "External Angle" Bug: Students might mistakenly apply the exterior angle theorem if the diagram has any extended lines.
- Operation Bug (Smaller from Larger): If subtraction is required (e.g., $180 - 100$), a student might struggle with place value if they carry out the calculation vertically, though 180 and 100 are relatively "friendly" numbers.
- The "Equilateral" Bug: Assuming all angles are equal and dividing 180 by 3 despite the given values.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 6 is the introductory year for formal geometry in the Indian curriculum.
- In Hindi-medium contexts, the term "Angle Sum Property" (त्रिभुज के कोणों का योग गुण) is well-drilled, but translating the English prompt "Find the angle x" can be a barrier if the visual cues are not immediate.
- Students from economically weaker sections often have high "procedural fluency" in rote-learned properties but struggle if the diagram is non-standard.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the calculation is simple (180 - 100), the transition from arithmetic to geometry in Grade 6 often sees a significant drop in accuracy due to the inability to recall the constant 180 or misinterpreting the visual diagram.
