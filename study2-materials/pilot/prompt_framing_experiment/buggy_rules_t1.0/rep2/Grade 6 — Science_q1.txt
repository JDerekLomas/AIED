Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English text to understand the physical setup (North pole to North pole).
2. Retrieve the relevant physical rule from memory (Like poles vs. Unlike poles).
3. Determine the interaction (Repulsion).
4. Translate the conceptual understanding back into an English written response ("repel" or "push away").

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
1. **"Magnetic Attraction Bias"**: A primitive rule where students believe magnets always "stick" to things, leading to the response "they will stick" regardless of polarity.
2. **"Opposites Law Reversal"**: Confusing the specific mapping of the rule (Thinking "Like attracts Like").
3. **"Linguistic Mapping Error"**: Understanding the concept but lacking the specific English vocabulary ("repel") or using "repel" and "attract" interchangeably due to phonetic similarity or rote memorization without meaning.
4. **"Default to Neutrality"**: Stating "nothing happens" because they do not associate two similar poles with an active force.

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 6 students in this demographic often face a "language barrier tax." While they might intuitively know how magnets behave from play, the shift from recognition (multiple choice) to recall (open-ended) in a non-native language increases the cognitive load significantly. Many will rely on rote-learned keywords; if the keyword "repel" was not heavily reinforced or if the student confuses "North/North" with "North/South" due to scanning the text quickly, the error rate climbs.
