Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the English prompt and identify the task requirements (selection + justification).
2. Recall or locate a specific line from the poem (memory/scanning).
3. Transcribe the selected line accurately.
4. Formulate an internal reason for preference (metacognition).
5. Translate the reason into an English sentence using correct syntax and vocabulary.
6. Connect the two parts using a logical conjunction (e.g., "because").

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules" / Procedural Errors
- The "Literal Copy" Bug: Copying the first or last line of the poem regardless of personal preference because it is the most salient.
- The "Fragment" Bug: Providing only the line but omitting the "why" due to lack of English sentence-construction skills.
- The "Circular Reasoning" Bug: Writing "I like it because it is good" or "I like it because I like it" (Common in ESL/EFL learners with limited descriptive vocabulary).
- The "Code-Switch" Bug: Identifying the line in English but writing the justification in Hindi/Hinglish.
- The "Transliteration" Bug: Applying Hindi syntax to English sentences (e.g., "This line me good is"), leading to illegible justifications.

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often experience "Matthew Effects" in literacy. While they may recognize the poem, the shift from recognition (multiple choice) to production (open-ended) is a significant cognitive hurdle. The 1.5-mark weighting suggests a low-stakes item, but the "Why" component requires a level of English proficiency (productive language) that many students in this demographic have not yet mastered.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account that many students will provide the "line" but fail the "why" or produce an unintelligible justification, the proportion of fully correct (rubric-compliant) responses is low.
