Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall the definition and objective of L.C.M. (Least Common Multiple).
2. Select a method: Prime Factorization (finding factors for each number individually) or Common Division (the "L-shape" ladder method).
3. Execute division: Correctly identify the smallest prime factor (2, 3, or 5) that divides at least one (or two) of the numbers.
4. Maintain placeholders: Correctly carry down numbers not divisible by the current divisor.
5. Termination: Continue dividing until all quotients are 1.
6. Final Calculation: Multiply all divisors (the factors on the left/outside) correctly.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- The "HCF Confusion" Bug: Finding the Highest Common Factor instead of the LCM because they confuse the two acronyms.
- The "Addition instead of Multiplication" Bug: Summing the prime factors instead of multiplying them.
- The "Division Stop" Bug: Stopping the division as soon as one number reaches 1, rather than continuing for all.
- The "Calculation Slip": Errors in basic multiplication tables (e.g., 2 × 2 × 3 × 5), especially under the pressure of an open-ended format.
- The "English/Acronym Gap": Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may recognize "Laghuttam Samapavartak" (ल.स.) but struggle with the English acronym "L.C.M." if the transition to English terminology is incomplete.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 6 is the transitional year for secondary math. For students from economically weaker sections, procedural fluency is often hampered by "math anxiety" and irregular foundational practice. Open-ended questions (recall) are significantly harder for this demographic than multiple-choice (recognition), as there are no cues to signal an arithmetic error.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the common division method is a heavily drilled "recipe" in Indian schools, the multi-step nature of the task (division -> tracking -> multiplication) creates multiple "failure points" where a single bug results in a score of zero.
