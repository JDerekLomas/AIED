Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Language Decoding: Interpret the English prompt into the mental model of the subject matter (Social Science/Geography).
2. Retrieval (Recall): Access the long-term memory schema for "Rajasthan" and filter for "Fairs/Festivals" (e.g., Pushkar, Gangaur, Teej).
3. Selection: Identify two distinct items that meet the criteria.
4. Descriptive Retrieval: Recall a specific attribute (significance/attraction) for at least one selected item.
5. Synthesis/Sentence Construction: Formulate a coherent sentence in English connecting the festival to its attribute.
6. Orthography/Grammar: Write the names and the sentence with sufficient clarity for the grader to recognize.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. The "List-Only" Bug: Students often stop after the first part of a two-part prompt, ignoring the "Describe" instruction (procedural truncation).
2. The "Category Shift" Bug: Confusing "National Festivals" (Diwali/Holi) with state-specific cultural festivals (Pushkar/Gangaur) due to overgeneralization.
3. The "Translation/Syntax" Bug: For EL learners, the inability to construct a "full sentence" leads to fragments or "keyword-only" responses (e.g., "Pushkar Camel").
4. The "Naming Overload" Bug: Providing more than two names but failing to provide the required description.
5. The "Synonym Error": Confusing the fair name with the location (e.g., calling the festival "Ajmer" instead of "Pushkar").

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Recall vs. Recognition: The lack of a word bank significantly increases the cognitive load for students with limited English fluency.
2. Rubric Constraint: The rubric specifies the score is for "Naming any two," but the question asks for a description. If the rubric is strictly followed, the description is a "hidden" requirement or a distractor; however, if the student fails the second half of the prompt, they often doubt their first half and leave it blank or perform poorly.
3. Medium Shift: Translating cultural knowledge from a Hindi/Regional context into English often results in cognitive "bottlenecking" where knowledge is present but expression fails.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that this is an open-ended recall task requiring both specific regional knowledge and English sentence construction for Grade 6 students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds, the success rate is likely limited by the "Describe" requirement and the specificity of the state-based recall.
