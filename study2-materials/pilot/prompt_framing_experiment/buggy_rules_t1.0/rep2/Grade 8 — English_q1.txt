Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Decoding/Translation**: Decipher the English interrogative ("How") and the subject/predicate ("sky look," "sunset") into a mental representation (likely in Hindi: "Suraj dubte samay aakash kaisa dikha?").
2. **Textual Retrieval**: Recall the specific descriptive imagery from the memorized or read passage (specifically the colors "orange" and "pink").
3. **Syntactic Encoding**: Formulate an English sentence structure (Subject + Verb + Preposition/Adjective).
4. **Lexical Retrieval**: Recall the English words for the specific colors and the past tense of the verb ("looked" or "was").
5. **Transcription**: Physically write the sentence with correct spelling and punctuation.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. **Keyword Matching Bug**: Searching for the word "sunset" in the text but failing to synthesize the descriptive adjectives around it.
2. **Tense-Transfer Bug**: Answering in the present tense ("The sky look...") due to the influence of the base form in the question "did... look."
3. **L1-L2 Mapping Bug**: Using Hindi syntax in English (e.g., "Sky orange pink was") or substituting "sun" for "sky."
4. **Binary Color Bug**: Identifying only one color (orange) instead of the required pair because the student treats "color" as a single-item slot.
5. **Phonetic Spelling Bug**: Spelling "orange" as "orenge" or "pink" as "pinke" based on local phonetic approximations.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students from economically weaker sections often rely on rote memorization (the "bazaar guide" culture). Since the rubric requires *both* colors for a single point (all or nothing), students who recall the general scene but lack the specific English vocabulary or the precise dual-color requirement will fail. The gap between functional Hindi and academic English at this level is significant.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the "all or nothing" nature of the 1-point rubric and the requirement for two specific descriptors in a non-native language:
