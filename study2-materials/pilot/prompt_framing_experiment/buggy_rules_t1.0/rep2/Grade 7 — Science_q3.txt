Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English sentence to identify the core semantic requirements: "green pigment," "leaves," and "photosynthesis."
2. Retrieve the specific biological term "Chlorophyll" from long-term memory (recall task).
3. Transliterate the phonemes of the technical term into the correct English orthography (spelling).
4. Record the term accurately on the answer sheet.

Step 2: Buggy rules and systematic errors
1. **Phonetic Encoding Bug**: Students often use Hindi phonetic logic to spell English technical terms, resulting in "Klorofyl" or "Clorofill."
2. **Semantic Blur**: Confusing the pigment with the organelle (*Chloroplast*) or the process (*Photosynthesis* itself).
3. **Retrieval Block**: Recognizing the concept in a multiple-choice format but failing to produce the specific term in an open-ended format.
4. **Linguistic Interference**: Misinterpreting the word "essential" or "pigment" due to limited English vocabulary, leading to answers like "Water" or "Sunlight."

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students from Hindi-medium backgrounds in EWS contexts often have high conceptual exposure to this topic but significant barriers in English academic language (CALP). While "Chlorophyll" is a high-frequency term in Science, the transition from recognition to correct English spelling is a significant hurdle for this specific demographic.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account the shift from recognition to recall and the high probability of spelling-related disqualification or term confusion (Chloroplast vs. Chlorophyll) in an English-language assessment:
