Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Identify the medium (solid/metal) and the context (direct contact within a single object).
2. Recall the specific term for heat transfer in solids ("Conduction") from long-term memory.
3. Distinguish "Conduction" from phonetically or conceptually similar terms (Convection, Radiation, Insulation).
4. Map the Hindi concept ("Chalan") to the English technical term.
5. Provide a molecular-level explanation: energy transfer via vibration/collision of particles without bulk movement of matter.

Step 2: Buggy rules:
1. "Fluid Bias": Mistaking heat transfer for the movement of the hot liquid itself (Convection) because the tea is a liquid.
2. "Label Swapping": Systematic confusion between "Conduction" and "Convection" due to identical prefixes.
3. "Macroscopic Displacement": Explaining that "heat particles" or "hot atoms" travel physically from the bowl to the handle (akin to fluid flow) rather than through vibration.
4. "Linguistic Approximation": Using descriptive phrases (e.g., "it travels through metal") instead of the required technical nomenclature.

Step 3: Population factors:
The open-ended nature (recall vs. recognition) is a significant barrier for ESL/Hindi-medium students. While the concept is intuitive, the English vocabulary requirement ("Conduction") and the "explain" portion (Part B) demand high linguistic output. The low point value (0.5) may also lead to low effort or "one-word" answers that fail the "explain" criteria of the rubric.
