Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Translate the word problem into a geometric relationship (Perimeter = 2(l + w)).
2. Substitute the given values into the formula (32 = 2(10 + w)).
3. Solve the linear equation:
   a. Divide by 2 or distribute the 2.
   b. Isolate the variable $w$ through subtraction.
4. Use the derived width to calculate the area (Area = l × w).
5. Perform multiplication (10 × 6).
6. Ensure correct units (cm and cm²).

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- "Perimeter-Area Confusion": Using the area formula for perimeter or vice-versa.
- "Semi-Perimeter Error": Adding length and width but forgetting to multiply by 2 (10 + w = 32).
- "Additive Error": Calculating $w = 32 - 10$.
- "Partial Distribution": If distributing, $2(10 + w)$ becomes $20 + w = 32$.
- "Operation Reversal": Subtracting 32 from 10 or 10 from 2.
- "Computation Stop": Finding $w=6$ but forgetting to perform the second half of the prompt (finding the Area).

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Seventh-grade students in this demographic often struggle with multi-step word problems in English (semantic barriers).
- Algebraic manipulation ($2(x+y)=z$) is a transitional skill at this grade level.
- The rubric is "all or nothing" (Max score 1), meaning students who find the width but miss the area, or vice-versa, receive 0.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the two-step requirement (Width AND Area) and the high probability of the "Semi-Perimeter" bug or "Computation Stop" after finding the first variable, the success rate for a 1/1 score is significantly lower than for a single-step calculation.
