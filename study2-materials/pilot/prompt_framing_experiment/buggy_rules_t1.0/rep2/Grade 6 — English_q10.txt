Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Read and decode the sentence structure "There are ___ apples in the basket."
2. Recognize the sentence type as "Affirmative" (declarative/positive).
3. Identify the noun "apples" as a plural countable noun.
4. Recall the grammatical rule governing the distribution of "some" vs "any" (some for affirmative; any for negative/interrogative).
5. Compare the options against the sentence type and select "some."

Step 2: Systematic procedural errors (Buggy Rules)
1. The "Sound-Right" Bug: Students choose the word that "sounds" more familiar. In many ESL environments, "any" is frequently over-generalized due to its use in common negative commands or questions.
2. The "Negative Bias" Bug: Students may have recently learned "any" in the context of "I don't have any..." and apply it to all plural contexts.
3. The "Translation" Bug: Students translating from Hindi (where "kuch" can represent both "some" and "any" depending on context) may perceive the words as interchangeable synonyms.
4. The "Indefinite" Bug: Treating all plural/uncountable quantifiers as a single category without distinguishing between polarity (positive vs negative).

Step 3: Target student population analysis
Grade 6 students from Hindi-medium, economically weaker backgrounds often face a "vocabulary gap." While this is a multiple-choice/selection task (easier than recall), the nuance between "some" and "any" is a high-level grammatical abstraction. In Indian government school curricula, English is often taught via rote translation rather than immersion, making the polarity rule for "any" a common point of confusion.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
Considering the linguistic interference from Hindi and the common pedagogical focus on simple nouns over functional grammar (determiners), many students will guess or use a buggy rule.
