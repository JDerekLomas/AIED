Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the English question (identifying "three questions" and the "king" as the subject).
2. Retrieve the specific narrative details from long-term memory or the provided text (Leo Tolstoy's 'Three Questions').
3. Map the retrieved concepts to English vocabulary (e.g., "right time," "important people," "necessary action").
4. Synthesize these three distinct components into a coherent grammatical structure.
5. Manually produce the written output in English.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. **The "Partial Retrieval" Bug:** Recalling only one or two of the three components but believing the task is complete (especially since the question asks "What were..." and lists are cognitively taxing).
2. **The "L1 Interference" Bug:** Thinking of the answers in Hindi and failing to find the precise English correlates, leading to abandonment or "Hinglish" responses.
3. **The "Key-Word Matching" Bug:** Identifying the word "King" and "questions" and instead of listing the questions, describing the king's actions or the hermit he met.
4. **The "Vague Generalization" Bug:** Writing a moralizing statement (e.g., "The king was good") instead of the specific procedural content required by the rubric.

Step 3: Population considerations:
The open-ended format is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice for students with limited English proficiency. In Grade 7, students often struggle with the syntax required to list three distinct abstract concepts. The requirement to hit all three specific points for a single mark (all-or-nothing rubric) is a high barrier.

Step 4: Holistic estimate:
Given the "all-or-nothing" scoring and the linguistic demand of recalling three specific abstract nouns/phrases in a second language, even students who understand the story often fail to produce a grammatically and factually complete list of all three.
