Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Identify the Subject (noun/pronoun) to initiate the sentence.
2. Identify the auxiliary verb ("is") and its relationship to the subject.
3. Identify the main verb with the correct suffix ("reading") to form the continuous tense.
4. Correctly place the article ("a") before the object.
5. Identify the Object ("book") to complete the semantic unit.
6. Apply English syntax rules (Subject-Verb-Object) as opposed to native language syntax (Subject-Object-Verb).
7. Apply mechanics (Capitalization of "He" and ending with a full stop, though often overlooked in scoring).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. **L1 Syntax Transfer (SOV Bug):** Students apply Hindi/vernacular word order (Subject-Object-Verb), resulting in "He a book reading is."
2. **Article Misplacement:** Placing "a" after the noun or randomly due to lack of equivalent in native tongue ("He is reading book a").
3. **Is-Attachment Bug:** Treating "is" as a sentence closer (common in Hindi "hai"), leading to "He reading a book is."
4. **Keyword Starting:** Starting with the most "important" content word rather than the pronoun ("Book is reading he").

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often have high "affective filters" regarding English. Since the item is open-ended (recall), they cannot rely on elimination. In many Indian government schools, English is taught as a set of memorized rules; however, "He is reading a book" is a prototypical sentence structure often found in early chapters of textbooks.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the sentence is a "base-level" prototype, the transition from SOV (Hindi) to SVO (English) remains a significant cognitive hurdle for Grade 6 learners who are not immersed in the language.
