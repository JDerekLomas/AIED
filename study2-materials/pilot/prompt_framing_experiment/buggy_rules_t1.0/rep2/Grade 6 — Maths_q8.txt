Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall the formula for the Area of a rectangle ($A = L \times B$).
2. Substitute the values: $15 \times 8$.
3. Execute the multiplication algorithm ($15 \times 8 = 120$).
4. Assign the correct units for area ($\text{cm}^2$ or sq. cm).
5. Recall the formula for the Perimeter of a rectangle ($P = 2(L + B)$).
6. Execute addition ($15 + 8 = 23$) and multiplication ($23 \times 2 = 46$).
7. (Note: Per the rubric, only the Area is required for the score, but the prompt asks for both, creating a cognitive load distraction).

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
- **Formula Confusion:** Swapping formulas (calculating Perimeter when asked for Area, or vice versa).
- **Additive Area Bug:** Adding the dimensions ($15 + 8 = 23$) instead of multiplying.
- **Operator Interference:** Calculating $15 \times 15$ or $8 \times 8$ (confusing with square area).
- **Unit Error:** Using linear cm for area instead of sq. cm (critical per rubric).
- **Incomplete Multi-step:** Providing only one of the two requested values (Area or Perimeter) due to cognitive overload or reading comprehension issues.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- **Language Barrier:** English-medium terminology ("breadth" vs "width" or Hindi "chaudaai") can cause decoding delays.
- **Rote Learning:** High reliance on memorized formulas often leads to misapplication under pressure.
- **Rubric Constraint:** The "all or nothing" 1-point score for a multi-part question (Area AND Perimeter) creates a high "slip" probability; even if they know Area, a mistake in Perimeter or units results in a zero.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that students must correctly identify the operation, execute multiplication correctly, include the specific units required by the rubric, and manage the dual requirement of the prompt, the "success bottleneck" is high for this demographic.
