Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Semantic Decoding:** Translate the prompt from English to a mental representation (understanding "oldest," "appearance," "history," and "community").
2. **Retrieval/Ideation:** Recall or invent a specific tree and identify three distinct attributes (visuals, time-scale, social value).
3. **Sentence Construction:** Synthesize 5-6 grammatically coherent sentences in English.
4. **Vocabulary Mapping:** Select specific adjectives and nouns (e.g., "trunk," "branches," "ancestors," "shade") to meet the descriptive requirement.
5. **Structural Cohesion:** Organize the sentences into a single paragraph format that adheres to the specific thematic constraints of the rubric.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules"
1. **The "Topic Sentence as Only Sentence" Bug:** Writing one descriptive sentence and stopping, failing to meet the length requirement.
2. **The "Translitteration" Bug:** Using Hindi syntax with English words (e.g., "My village in one big tree is there").
3. **The "List-not-Paragraph" Bug:** Writing bullet points or disjointed fragments instead of a cohesive paragraph.
4. **The "Tense Inconsistency" Bug:** Mixing past tense for history and present tense for appearance in a way that breaks grammatical logic.
5. **The "Generic Substitution" Bug:** Writing about trees in general rather than a specific "oldest tree," failing the "descriptive" constraint.

Step 3: Target student population considerations
- **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students from economically weaker sections, the transition to Grade 8 English requires moving from basic interpersonal communication skills (BICS) to cognitive academic language proficiency (CALP).
- **Open-ended Recall:** This is a high-stakes cognitive task compared to multiple-choice. Students must generate both content and form simultaneously.
- **Rubric Density:** The rubric requires three specific thematic elements. Students often miss the "history" or "community" aspects, focusing only on appearance.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While many students may attempt the prompt, producing a "fully correct" answer that satisfies all three rubric points (appearance, history, importance) in 5-6 grammatically sound English sentences is a high threshold for this demographic at Grade 8.
