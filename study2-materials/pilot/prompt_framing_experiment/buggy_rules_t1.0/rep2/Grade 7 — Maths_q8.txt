Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Identify the relationship between distance and fuel (Unitary Method or Proportionality).
2. Calculate the unit rate (Mileage): $55 \div 5 = 11$ km/liter.
3. Apply the unit rate to the new quantity: $11 \times 12$.
4. Execute multi-digit multiplication ($11 \times 12 = 132$).
5. Distinguish between the two separate questions asked (total distance vs. mileage).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. **Operator Confusion:** Multiplying when division is required ($55 \times 5$) or vice versa ($12 \div 11$).
2. **Additive Error:** Treating the relationship as additive rather than multiplicative ($5 + 7 = 12$, so $55 + 7 = 62$).
3. **Incomplete Execution:** Finding the mileage (11) but failing to perform the second step, or vice versa.
4. **Keyword Dependency:** Searching for "how much" and simply adding all numbers in the prompt.
5. **Language Interference:** Misinterpreting "mileage" or "average" as a request for a different statistical mean.

Step 3: Population considerations:
- Grade 7 students in this demographic often struggle with multi-step word problems due to the "translation" gap from English to conceptual math.
- The rubric only awards 1 mark for the final distance, but the question asks two distinct things ("How much distance..." and "Find how much mileage..."). This phrasing often leads to "Satisficing," where a student provides one answer and stops.
- Open-ended formats without multiple-choice cues significantly increase the retrieval load and risk of computational slips.
