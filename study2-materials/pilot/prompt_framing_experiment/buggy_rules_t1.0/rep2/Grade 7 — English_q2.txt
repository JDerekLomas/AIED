Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English question syntax (interrogative "Why," auxiliary "did," and main verb "announce").
2. Retrieve the specific narrative memory from the text (Leo Tolstoy’s "The Three Questions").
3. Map the intent (seeking answers/wisdom) to the action (announcing a reward).
4. Formulate a response in English that preserves semantic meaning (e.g., "to get answers").
5. Apply grammatical rules to translate the thought into a written sentence (subject-verb agreement or infinitive phrases).

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. **The "Copy-Paste" Bug:** Students identify the word "reward" in the text and copy the entire sentence it appears in, often including irrelevant surrounding text, which may fail the rubric's specificity.
2. **The "Tense-Shift" Bug:** Misinterpreting "did announce" and responding with "The king announce..." or "The king announces," common in ESL learners.
3. **The "Keyword Association" Bug:** Associating "King" and "Reward" with common folklore tropes (e.g., "to find a brave man") rather than the specific text-based reason.
4. **The "L1 Interference" Bug:** Thinking the answer in Hindi and using literal translation, resulting in "For answer three questions," which may be penalized depending on the strictness of the evaluator.

Step 3: Population Considerations
The open-ended nature of the question is significantly harder than a multiple-choice format for students with limited English proficiency. While the story is a staple of the curriculum, the leap from comprehension to production in a second language is a high cognitive barrier for students from economically weaker sections with limited out-of-school English exposure.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the reliance on recall and the linguistic hurdle of formulating an original sentence, many students will provide partially correct but fragmented English, or "buggy" copies from the text.
