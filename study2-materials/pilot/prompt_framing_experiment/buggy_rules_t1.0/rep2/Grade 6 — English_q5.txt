Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode and comprehend the English-language prompt (identifying the keyword "important").
2. Scan the poem text to locate thematic markers or repeated sentiments.
3. Distinguish between literal objects/actions in the poem and abstract values (the "thing" vs. "theme").
4. Synthesize the poet's perspective (inferential reasoning) rather than just retrieving a literal fact.
5. Formulate a response in English that aligns with the rubric's requirement for "agreement with themes."

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. Literal Matching Bug: Searching for the exact phrase "The most important thing is..." and failing if it is not explicitly stated.
2. Personal Preference Bug: Answering what is important to the *student* rather than the *poet*.
3. Keyword Association Bug: Identifying a high-frequency noun from the poem (e.g., "house," "tree") as the answer, regardless of its thematic weight.
4. Language Interference Bug: Conceptualizing the answer in Hindi but being unable to translate the abstract theme (e.g., "friendship") into the English required for the rubric.
5. Over-extension of "Thing": Interpreting "thing" as a physical object only, thereby missing abstract concepts like "being blessed."

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often face a "double burden": developing foundational literacy in a second language while simultaneously being asked to perform higher-order inferential tasks. In Indian government school contexts, teaching often leans toward rote memorization of textbook answers. An open-ended question requiring synthesis and "agreement with themes" is significantly more difficult than a multiple-choice or "fill-in-the-blank" item for this demographic.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric is generous (accepting themes without evidence), the combination of language barriers, the requirement for abstract inference, and the lack of recognition cues (multiple choices) creates a high probability of error for a Grade 6 student in this specific socio-linguistic context.
