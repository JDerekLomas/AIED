Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English question ("What sounds," "heard," "scene") to understand the specific auditory requirement.
2. Retrieve the specific narrative context from memory (the scene of sunset) or locate the relevant portion of the text.
3. Identify the specific sensory detail (birds returning/chirping) required by the rubric from the general scene description.
4. Translate the internal conceptual understanding into an English phrase.
5. Apply syntactical rules to form a coherent response (subject-verb agreement or appropriate noun phrase).

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" or procedural errors
1. **The "Keyword Match" Bug:** Searching the text for the word "sound" and copying the sentence containing it, even if it refers to a different sound (e.g., wind or footsteps) or if the word "sound" isn't explicitly used in the target sentence.
2. **The "Visual-Auditory Swap" Bug:** Providing a visual description of the sunset (e.g., "The sun is red") instead of an auditory one, failing to discriminate between different sensory modalities.
3. **The "L1-L2 Mapping" Bug:** Translating the Hindi concept of "panchhi" or "chahachahana" into incorrect English phonetics or unrelated vocabulary (e.g., "Birds coming home").
4. **The "Fragment-Only" Bug:** Writing only "Birds," which may be marked incorrect if the rubric or evaluator requires an action/context (returning to nests).

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 8 students in this context often face a "threshold" effect where their conceptual understanding of the story is high, but their ability to map specific rubric-required English phrases is low. In open-ended formats without multiple-choice cues, recall failure is high. Limited English proficiency often leads to leaving the question blank or copying irrelevant "safe" text from the passage.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
Given the reliance on specific vocabulary ("birds," "returning," "nests") and the cross-modal requirement (hearing vs. seeing), many students will likely provide a visual description or a grammatically broken fragment that misses the rubric's specific "sunset context."
