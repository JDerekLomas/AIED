Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the text-heavy word problem (English proficiency demand).
2. Interpret "minimum number of chocolates required" as finding the next multiple of 80 greater than 300, rather than just the remainder or the quotient of 300/80.
3. Perform division (300 ÷ 80) or skip-counting (80, 160, 240, 320) to find the target total (320).
4. Identify that "each class" refers to the distribution of the *new* total (320) or the *intended* per-student amount (4) across the specific class structure.
5. Calculate 320 ÷ 8 (or 40 chocolates per class).

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules" and Cognitive Errors
- "Remainder-as-Answer" Bug: Students perform 300 ÷ 80 and provide the remainder (60) or the quotient (3) as the final answer, failing the "round up" logic.
- "Keyword Matching" Bug: Seeing "minimum" and "300," students may subtract 300 - 80 or 300 - (80*3) without understanding the directional requirement of "required."
- "Operational Drop-off": Solving the first part of the multi-step problem but ignoring the second question about the 8 classes.
- "Division by First Encountered Number": Dividing 300 by 8 instead of using the derived 320.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 8 students in this demographic often struggle with multi-step word problems in English.
- The "Minimum number... to distribute... in equal quantity" is linguistically dense and counter-intuitive; many students will assume they must use the 300 provided rather than find a number *greater* than 300.
- In EWS/Hindi-medium contexts, "equal quantity" is often taught as a simple division (sharing) task; the "rounding up" constraint is a high-level modeling task not typically practiced in rote computation.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The item is a "trap" for students who rely on standard algorithms. Most will calculate 300/80 = 3 (rem 60) and either stop or provide 3. The leap to 320 requires a level of semantic processing and logical modeling that is frequently absent in high-stakes, English-language testing for this demographic.
