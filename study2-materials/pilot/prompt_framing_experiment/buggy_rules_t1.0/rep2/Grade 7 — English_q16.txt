Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Recall appropriate vocabulary for family members (Grandmother/Nani/Dadi) and emotional states (miss, love).
2. Syntactic Encoding: Construct a declarative sentence expressing a current state ("I miss you") and an imperative or interrogative sentence for the invitation ("Please visit us/come soon").
3. Morphological/Grammatical Execution: Apply correct subject-verb agreement and verb tensing (present simple vs. present continuous).
4. Orthographic Execution: Correct spelling of "grandmother," "miss," and "visit."
5. Structural Mapping: Adhere to the functional requirements of a "message" (Address + Body).

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. The "Transliteration Bug": Mapping Hindi syntax directly to English (e.g., "Grandmother soon come" or "I you miss").
2. The "Phonetic Spelling Bug": Spelling words based on Indian English pronunciation (e.g., "vijeet" for visit, "mish" for miss).
3. The "Subject-Object Confusion Bug": Reversing the direction of the action (e.g., "You miss me" instead of "I miss you").
4. The "Tense Consistency Bug": Using "missing" without the auxiliary verb "am" or using the base form "visit" in an ungrammatical frame.
5. The "Script-Switching Bug": Using English script to write Hindi words (Hinglish) because the English vocabulary for "visit" or "soon" is not retrieved.

Step 3: Target student population
Grade 7 students from economically weaker sections often face "cumulative disfluency." While they understand the concept of a grandmother, the "open-ended" nature of the task (recall vs. recognition) is a high cognitive load. In Hindi-medium contexts, English is often taught via rote translation rather than functional composition. A 1-mark "all-or-nothing" rubric is unforgiving to minor grammatical bugs that nonetheless convey the message.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The requirement for a "fully correct" answer (implying standard English syntax and spelling) is a high bar for this demographic. While many will convey the *intent*, the "buggy rules" of L1-to-L2 interference and limited vocabulary recall will likely lead to technical errors in a significant majority of scripts
