Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Linguistic Translation/Decoding: Decode the complex academic English vocabulary ("Assess," "impact," "economic life").
2. Contextual Retrieval: Recall specific historical narratives of kingdoms and warfare from the Grade 7 curriculum (e.g., Delhi Sultanate, Mughals, Cholas).
3. Concept Mapping: Isolate "economic" factors (treasury, trade, agriculture, taxes) from political or social consequences.
4. Causal Reasoning: Link the physical act of war to a fiscal outcome (e.g., "wars cost money," "crops were destroyed," "looting increased wealth").
5. Linguistic Encoding: Construct a coherent sentence in English to communicate this distinct impact.

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
1. The "Keyword Association" Bug: Students see "war" and "kingdom" and describe *how* a war is fought or who won, rather than the economic impact.
2. The "Category Confusion" Bug: Providing a social or physical impact (e.g., "many people died") instead of an economic one, failing to distinguish between types of "impact."
3. The "Generic Positive/Negative" Bug: Writing a vague value judgment (e.g., "It was very bad for the king") without identifying a specific economic mechanism.
4. The "Translation Artifact" Bug: Misinterpreting "Assess" as "Tell a story about" or "Economic" as "Eco-friendly/Environment."

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 7 students in this demographic often face a "threshold effect" where their conceptual understanding of history (often learned via rote memorization in Hindi or simplified English) fails to translate into the high-stakes academic English required for "Assess." The open-ended nature removes the "recognition" scaffold, making the retrieval of specific economic terms (like "revenue" or "expenditure") significantly harder.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric only requires *one* impact, the combination of linguistic barriers, the abstract nature of "economic life," and the systematic tendency to provide narrative rather than analytical responses suggests a high failure rate.
