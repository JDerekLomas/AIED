Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Identify the operation (multiplication).
2. Retrieve the absolute product ($3 \times 4 = 12$).
3. Identify the signs of both factors (negative and negative).
4. Apply the integer sign rule for multiplication ($- \times - = +$).
5. Synthesize the magnitude and the sign into the final result.

Step 2: Buggy rules:
- **Sign Overgeneralization (Addition Rule):** Applying the rule for adding negative integers ($-3 + -4 = -7$) to multiplication, resulting in $-12$.
- **Rule of "Greater Magnitude":** Thinking the sign of the answer depends on which number is "bigger," leading to confusion or an arbitrary sign.
- **Negative + Negative = Negative:** A linguistic/logical bug where students believe "more negative" results in a negative, often reinforced by daily language.
- **Operator Confusion:** Misinterpreting the parentheses or the proximity of signs as an instruction to subtract or add ($(-3) - 4 = -7$).

Step 3: Population considerations:
- Grade 7 is the introductory year for formal integer operations in the NCERT curriculum. 
- Hindi-medium students often learn the rule as "Minus-Minus Plus," which is catchy but leads to the "Buggy Addition Rule" where they apply it to $(-3) + (-4)$ and get $+7$.
- Economically weaker sections (EWS) often experience higher rates of rote memorization without conceptual grounding (the "why" behind the sign rule), making them more susceptible to systematic bugs.
- Open-ended format eliminates the 50/50 chance of a multiple-choice guess between $12$ and $-12$.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While the multiplication itself is simple ($3 \times 4$), the "Negative $\times$ Negative" rule is one of the most persistent sites of systematic error in middle school mathematics globally, and particularly in environments where pedagogical focus may be on drill rather than conceptual mastery of the number line.
