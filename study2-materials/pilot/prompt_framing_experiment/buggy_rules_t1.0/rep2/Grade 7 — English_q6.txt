Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of the question (specifically the abstract concepts of "poet" and "writing style").
2. Access the mental representation of the specific poem read in class.
3. Analyze the text to identify linguistic characteristics (e.g., vocabulary difficulty, tone, structure).
4. Map these characteristics to a meta-cognitive vocabulary word in English (e.g., "descriptive," "simple").
5. Retrieve the correct spelling and syntax to produce the word in written form.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" or cognitive errors
1. **The "Content vs. Style" Bug:** Students describe *what* the poem is about (theme/plot) instead of *how* it is written (e.g., writing "nature" instead of "descriptive").
2. **The "Affective Response" Bug:** Students describe their own feelings rather than the author's style (e.g., writing "nice" or "good").
3. **The "Translation Gap" Bug:** Students identify the style in Hindi (e.g., *saral*) but cannot retrieve the English equivalent ("simple").
4. **The "Term Misalignment" Bug:** Misinterpreting "style" as "title" or "story," leading to the retrieval of the wrong category of information.
5. **The "Blanket Adjective" Bug:** Applying a memorized, generic word that doesn't fit the specific poem (over-generalization).

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 7 students from economically weaker sections often have significant gaps in English vocabulary. The question is open-ended (recall), not multiple-choice (recognition). Without a "word bank," the cognitive load of retrieving abstract literary terms in a second language is high. Most students may understand the poem but lack the academic English "labels" required by the rubric.
