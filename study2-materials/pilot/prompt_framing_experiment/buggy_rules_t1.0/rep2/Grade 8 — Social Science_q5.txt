Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Semantic Decoding:** Decode the complex English terms "biodiversity" and "sustainable development" and translate them into conceptual frameworks (likely involving code-switching to Hindi/L1).
2.  **Relational Mapping:** Establish a functional link between biological variety and long-term resource availability (sustainability).
3.  **Recall of Ecosystem Services:** Retrieve specific scientific examples (pollination, purification, fertility) from long-term memory.
4.  **Syntactic Synthesis:** Construct an English sentence that grammatically connects these concepts to satisfy the rubric’s requirement for "explanation."

Step 2: Buggy rules
1.  **Keyword Association Bug:** If "biodiversity" is present, write a memorized definition of "variety of plants and animals" regardless of the "importance" or "sustainability" prompt.
2.  **Circular Logic Bug:** Defining the term using the term (e.g., "Biodiversity is important because it makes development sustainable").
3.  **The "Environment is Good" Bug:** Providing generic, moralistic statements (e.g., "We should save trees") rather than explaining functional ecosystem services.
4.  **Translation Gap Bug:** Understanding the concept in Hindi but failing to retrieve the specific technical English vocabulary (e.g., "pollination") required for the rubric.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face a "language barrier" where cognitive load is doubled by content and medium of instruction. Open-ended recall is significantly harder than recognition (MCQs). "Sustainable development" is an abstract concept that is frequently misunderstood as simply "planting trees" at this level.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement to connect two high-level abstract concepts through the lens of ecosystem services in a second language, the "Buggy Rules" of generic responses and vocabulary gaps will be highly prevalent.
