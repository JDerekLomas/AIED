Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English text to identify the target digit (5) and the number (7560).
2. Distinguish between the concept of "place value" (positional weight) and "face value" (the digit itself).
3. Map the positions from right to left (Ones, Tens, Hundreds, Thousands).
4. Identify that 5 is in the "Hundreds" position.
5. Translate that position into a value (5 * 100) or retrieve the name of the place.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- **Face Value Bug:** Providing the digit itself ("5") instead of its positional value.
- **Left-to-Right Bug:** Counting places from left to right (7=Ones, 5=Tens), resulting in "50" or "Tens."
- **Column Misalignment Bug:** Miscounting the zero or skipping a place, resulting in "5000" or "50."
- **Terminology Confusion:** Providing the successor or predecessor because of linguistic confusion between "place value" and "place name" (though the rubric accepts both here).

Step 3: Population Considerations
For Grade 6 students in this demographic, "place value" is a foundational but often brittle concept. While the number 7560 is not complex, the open-ended nature of the question removes the scaffolding of multiple choice. Hindi-medium students often learn "Sthaniya Maan" (ಸ್ಥಾನೀಯ ಮಾನ್); if the English term "place value" is not fully internalized, they may stall at Step 1.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the commonality of the "Face Value Bug" and the linguistic barrier, a significant portion of the cohort typically fails to provide the calculated value (500) or the specific place name (Hundreds).
