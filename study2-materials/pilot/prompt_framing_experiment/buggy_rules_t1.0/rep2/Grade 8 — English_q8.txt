Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Identify the Object ("a delicious meal") and move it to the Subject position.
2. Identify the Subject ("The chef") and move it to the end (usually preceded by "by").
3. Analyze the Tense of the active verb ("prepared" = Simple Past).
4. Select the correct form of the auxiliary verb "to be" matching the tense and the new subject's number ("was").
5. Convert the main verb into its Past Participle form ("prepared").
6. Synthesize the components into a grammatically coherent English sentence.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. **Tense Preservation Error:** Converting to the wrong tense (e.g., "is prepared" or "has been prepared") because the student recognizes the passive structure but cannot map the specific tense.
2. **The "By-Default" Rule:** Assuming all passive voices use "is" or "was" regardless of the original sentence's complexity.
3. **Subject-Object Confusion:** Keeping the original subject at the start but changing the verb form (e.g., "The chef was prepared...").
4. **The Participle Bug:** Using the base form or the -ing form instead of the past participle (e.g., "was prepare" or "was preparing").
5. **V2=V3 False Equivalence:** Students may get sentence A right because "prepared" is the same in V2 and V3, but fail sentence B because they don't understand the "has found" to "has been found" shift.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 8 students in this context often treat English as a set of memorized "patterns" rather than a functional language. Passive voice is a high-order transformation. In an open-ended format (no multiple choice), there is no scaffolding. Hindi-medium backgrounds present a "Transfer Bug": the passive voice in Hindi is constructed differently (using the verb 'jana'), leading to literal translation errors.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
While "The chef prepared a delicious meal" is a standard textbook example, the requirement for perfect syntax, correct auxiliary verb selection, and the linguistic distance between Hindi and English syntax for EWS students suggests a high failure rate. Many will produce "near-misses" (e.g., "A delicious meal is prepared by chef") which, under a strict rubric for a "correct" answer, score 0.
