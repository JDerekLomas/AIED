Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the English prompt and technical terms "define" and "human environment."
2. Access long-term memory to retrieve the specific social science definition (differentiating it from "natural environment").
3. Translate the internalized concept (often stored in a mix of Hindi/English) into a formal English sentence.
4. Recall the cause-effect relationship of "modification" (humans acting on nature).
5. Generate a concrete example (e.g., building roads, cutting trees) that fits the modification criteria.
6. Transcribe the definition and example onto paper with legible syntax.

Step 2: "Buggy rules":
1. Tautological Definition: Defining "human environment" simply as "the environment of humans" (circular reasoning).
2. Category Confusion: Providing examples of the natural environment (trees, water) instead of human creations/activities.
3. Modification Error: Describing how the environment affects humans (e.g., "it rains on us") instead of how humans modify the environment.
4. Language Interference: Using Hindi-English transliteration that lacks the technical precision required by the rubric.
5. Scope Error: Limiting the definition to just "people" rather than the interactions and creations mandated by the rubric.

Step 3: Population considerations:
Grade 7 students in this demographic often struggle with "recall" tasks in a second language. The term "human environment" is an abstract construct in NCERT textbooks. While "modification" is intuitive, the formal "definition" requires a high level of academic literacy. The 0.5-mark allocation is disproportionately low for a two-part open-ended question, which may lead to students providing brief, incomplete answers that miss rubric criteria.
