Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of "transparency" and "governance" in an English-medium context.
2. Translate these abstract concepts into the socio-political framework of the Indian administration (e.g., RTI, digitalization, public hearings).
3. Retrieve a specific, plausible mechanism from long-term memory (recall task).
4. Formulate a sentence in English that grammatically links the "way" to the "outcome" (improvement).

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. Semantic Over-generalization: Treating "transparency" as "honesty" or "kindness," leading to answers like "be good people."
2. Keyword Association Bug: Seeing "governance" and providing a general fact about government (e.g., "India is a democracy") rather than a suggestion.
3. Language Switching Interference: Understanding the concept in Hindi (पारदर्शिता) but failing to find the English equivalent, leading to a blank response or "hinglish" that may not meet rubric standards.
4. Scale Mismatch: Suggesting personal-level solutions (e.g., "don't lie") for systemic institutional problems.

Step 3: Population Considerations
For Grade 7 students from economically weaker sections, "transparency" is a high-register academic word. While the rubric is lenient (only one way required), the open-ended recall format is significantly harder than multiple-choice for students with limited English proficiency. The conceptual leap from "government" to "transparency in governance" is steep at age 12-13.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account the abstract nature of the vocabulary and the requirement for generative English output rather than recognition:
