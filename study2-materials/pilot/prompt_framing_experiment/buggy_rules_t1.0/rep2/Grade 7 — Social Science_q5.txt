Step 1: Procedural steps required:
1. Recall the definition/nature of igneous rocks (formed from magma/lava).
2. Recall the process of "weathering" or "breaking down" (mechanical/chemical disintegration).
3. Identify the output of breaking down as "sediments" or "smaller pieces."
4. Recall the process of "erosion" or "transportation" (movement by wind/water).
5. Synthesize these steps into a coherent English sentence explaining the transformation.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. "Metamorphic bypass": Skipping the sedimentary stage and assuming igneous rocks turn directly into metamorphic rocks via heat/pressure (misapplying a different part of the cycle).
2. "Naming bug": Confusing the names of the rocks (e.g., saying sedimentary rocks break down to form igneous rocks).
3. "The Melting Error": Assuming all rock transformations require melting (applying the igneous process to the sedimentary formation).
4. "Static Bug": Identifying that rocks break, but failing to mention the movement/transportation required by the rubric.
5. "Linguistic Substitution": Using vague terms like "it changes" or "it becomes" without identifying the specific mechanisms (weathering/erosion) due to limited English vocabulary.

Step 3: Population considerations:
Grade 7 students are at a transitional stage between concrete and formal operational thinking. In Indian government schools, Science/Social Science is often taught via rote memorization of definitions. The open-ended format requires high-level retrieval. For Hindi-medium students, translating "weathering" and "erosion"—concepts that are linguistically distinct but physically similar—into English creates a significant cognitive load, often leading to "omission bugs" where they provide the result (sediments) but not the process.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While the concept is foundational, the combination of multi-step causality, specific vocabulary requirements, and the linguistic barrier for this specific population suggests a high error rate.
