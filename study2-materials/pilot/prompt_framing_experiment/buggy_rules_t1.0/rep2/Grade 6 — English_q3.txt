Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English sentence structure to identify the subject (Riya), the verb (love), and the temporal constraint (evening).
2. Retrieve the specific semantic information from the source text (reading/books).
3. Transform the question's syntax into an answer format (changing "What did... love" to "Riya loved").
4. Formulate an English sentence or phrase that aligns with the rubric's acceptable grammatical structures.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. The "Keyword Match" bug: Searching for the word "evening" in the text and copying the entire sentence, even if it contains irrelevant information.
2. The "Tense Consistency" bug: Keeping the verb in the base form ("Riya love read") instead of the past tense or gerund required by the context.
3. The "Direct Translation" bug: Thinking of the answer in Hindi and translating word-for-word, leading to incorrect syntax (e.g., "Riya evening in books read").
4. The "Question Word" bug: Including the question word in the answer (e.g., "What Riya love read books").

Step 3: Target student population considerations
Grade 6 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds often face a "threshold effect" where their conceptual understanding (knowing Riya likes books) exceeds their linguistic ability to encode that knowledge in English. An open-ended format is significantly harder than multiple choice because it removes the "recognition" scaffold, requiring students to generate syntax.

Step 4: Holistic analysis
While the fact is simple, the requirement to produce an English sentence without grammatical support is a high barrier. Many students will likely provide the correct information ("read books") but may lose marks if the teacher enforces strict syntax, though the rubric is somewhat flexible.
