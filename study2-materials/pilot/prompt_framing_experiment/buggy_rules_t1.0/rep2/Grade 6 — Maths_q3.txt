Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Count the number of digits in each numeral to identify the magnitude (recognizing 736 has three digits while others have four).
2. Compare the leftmost digit (thousands place) of the remaining four-digit numbers (3, 5, and 4).
3. Order the numerals based on the value of the leading digits ($3 < 4 < 5$).
4. Arrange the sequence horizontally from left to right using commas or inequality symbols.
5. Translate the linguistic instruction "ascending" into the mathematical action of "smallest to largest."

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. **Magnitude Neglect (The "Line-up" Bug):** Treating all numbers as having equal length by aligning them to the left (viewing 736 as "7xx" and placing it as the largest because 7 is greater than 3, 4, and 5).
2. **Lexicographical Ordering:** Comparing only the first digit regardless of place value (common in students who treat numbers like strings of text).
3. **Instruction Inversion:** Confusing "ascending" with "descending," resulting in a perfectly reversed list.
4. **Vocabulary Barrier:** Not knowing the meaning of the English word "ascending," leading to random ordering or no response.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 6 students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the English terms "ascending/descending." While the numerical task is developmentally appropriate for Grade 3 or 4, the linguistic shift and the specific trap of the three-digit number (736) among four-digit numbers create high interference. In EWS contexts, rote memorization of "ascending = bante kram" (increasing order) is common, but application in a second language increases cognitive load.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the math is "easy," the combination of the 3-vs-4 digit trap and the English vocabulary requirement significantly reduces the success rate in this specific demographic.
