Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the text (identify quantities and the target category).
2. Calculate the sample space (sum of balls: $4 + 6 = 10$).
3. Identify the frequency of the favorable outcome (black balls = 4).
4. Construct the probability ratio ($P = \text{favorable} / \text{total}$).
5. Express as a fraction ($4/10$), decimal ($0.4$), or simplified fraction ($2/5$).

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. **The "Ratio" Bug:** Providing the ratio of black to white balls ($4:6$) instead of black to total.
2. **The "Inverse" Bug:** Placing the total in the numerator ($10/4$).
3. **The "Denominator Only" Bug:** Identifying the total (10) as the answer.
4. **The "Difference" Bug:** Subtracting the subsets ($6 - 4 = 2$) as the numerator.
5. **The "Language/Keyword" Bug:** Confusing "black" and "white" due to reading speed or limited English proficiency.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Recall vs. Recognition:** As an open-ended item, students must generate the structure $n/N$ without prompts.
2. **Language Barrier:** In Hindi-medium contexts, "drawn at random" and "favorable outcomes" are often learned as rote procedures; any variation in phrasing can trigger cognitive load.
3. **Arithmetical vs. Conceptual:** While the addition is simple ($4+6$), the conceptual leap to "total outcomes" is where economically disadvantaged students with inconsistent schooling often falter.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the arithmetic is Grade 3 level, the conceptual application of probability in a second language, combined with the "Ratio Bug" (which is highly prevalent in Indian middle school curricula), significantly reduces the success rate.
