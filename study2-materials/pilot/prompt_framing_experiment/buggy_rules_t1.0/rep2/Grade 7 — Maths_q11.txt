Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Identify variables for axes (Independent: Classes; Dependent: Number of children).
2. Determine the range of data and select a constant, proportional scale (e.g., 1 unit = 10).
3. Draw horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) axes.
4. Mark equidistant points on the X-axis for categories and uniform increments on the Y-axis.
5. Label axes (Class, Number of Children).
6. Draw bars to the precise height corresponding to the numerical data.
7. Interpret the data visually to identify the highest and lowest values (Part B).

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- Scale Inconsistency: Writing values based on the data provided rather than equal increments (e.g., marking 80, 95, 110, 125 on the Y-axis at equal intervals).
- Zero-Point Error: Starting the Y-axis at the lowest data value instead of zero without using a "kink" or break.
- Mislabeling/No Labeling: Leaving axes blank or swapping categories.
- Bar Width Inconsistency: Drawing bars of different widths or touching bars (confusing bar graphs with histograms).
- Scale Selection Bug: Choosing a scale where data points fall "between" marks and failing to estimate height correctly.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 7 students in this demographic often face "language-interference" where terms like "appropriate scale" are not fully internalized.
- Limited access to graph paper in some government school contexts leads to free-hand drawings, which increases the likelihood of measurement errors.
- The rubric for (a) is "all-or-nothing" for 1 mark, meaning a single error in scale consistency or labeling results in zero credit despite procedural knowledge.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While Part (b) is high-success, Part (a) is a complex multi-step construction task. In a population where rote memorization often supersedes spatial-procedural reasoning, the "Scale Inconsistency" bug is extremely prevalent. The requirement for a "fully correct" graph (including labels and consistent increments) to earn the mark is a high barrier.
