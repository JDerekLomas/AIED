Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Scan the text to identify words at the end of each line (positional strategy).
2. Phonologically process the word "rain" to identify its rime (/eɪn/).
3. Phonologically process the word "grain" to identify its rime (/eɪn/).
4. Compare rimes to establish a phonetic match.
5. Identify the pair "borrow" and "tomorrow" (visual/phonetic match).
6. Select one pair and transcribe both words into the answer space.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. **The Visual Match Bug**: Identifying words that look similar (e.g., "borrow" and "tomorrow") but failing to confirm phonetic rhyme, or assuming rhyme based solely on suffix length.
2. **The "Last Word Only" Bug**: If the student doesn't understand "pair," they may only write one word (e.g., "rain").
3. **The Semantic Association Bug**: Pairing words that are contextually related rather than phonetically related (e.g., "rain" and "shelter").
4. **The Orthographic Constraint Bug**: Refusal to pair words if the spelling patterns differ slightly, even if they rhyme (not applicable here, but common in English learners).
5. **The Transcription/Decoding Bug**: Misreading "grain" as "gain" or "rain" as "ran" due to phonetic interference from Hindi (e.g., difficulty with vowel digraphs).

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Language Interference**: Hindi speakers may struggle with English vowel length and silent letters, though "rain/grain" is a relatively stable phonemic pair.
2. **Vocabulary Deficit**: If "shelter" or "borrow" are unknown, the cognitive load of decoding the stanza distracts from the pattern-finding task.
3. **Grammatical Error in Prompt**: The stanza contains a typo ("He had repay it tomorrow"), which can trigger a "Repair the Sentence" instinct in Grade 8 students accustomed to grammar drills, distracting them from the rhyming task.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While rhyming is a primary-level skill, the open-ended nature of the task in a second language, combined with decoding hurdles and the "borrow/tomorrow" distractor, often leads to partial or incorrect responses in this specific demographic.
