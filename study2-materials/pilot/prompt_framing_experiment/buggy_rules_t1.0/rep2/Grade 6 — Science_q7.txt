Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Read and decode the English text, overcoming potential language barriers (Hindi-to-English translation).
2. Synthesize the premise: "fruits and vegetables" are present, "no milk" is the specific exclusion.
3. Recall biological knowledge regarding the nutritional categories of milk (Calcium/Protein/Vitamin D).
4. Map the exclusion ("no milk") to the missing nutrient or category required by the rubric.
5. Identify that the second part of the prompt ("Prepare diet chart...") is irrelevant to the 1-point rubric but must be filtered out cognitively to avoid confusion.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" (Cognitive errors)
1. "The Inclusion Error": Students see "milk" in the text and assume it is present rather than absent (misreading "no milk" as "milk").
2. "The Generic Healthy Rule": Students provide a general list of healthy foods (carbohydrates, fats) instead of isolating the specific deficiency of milk.
3. "The Task Overload Bug": Students focus on the complex second command (drawing a chart) and fail to explicitly state the missing component from the first part.
4. "The Language Interference Bug": Inability to recall the specific English term for "Calcium" or "Nutrients," leading to vague or blank responses.
5. "The Literal Recopying Bug": Repeating "fruits and vegetables" because they are the only nouns the student recognizes in the sentence.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students in this demographic often struggle with the transition from rote memorization to application-based questions. The open-ended format (no multiple-choice options) removes recognition cues. The English proficiency gap is a significant barrier for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds when navigating a Science question phrased as a word problem.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the question seems simple, the combination of multi-clause English syntax, the distraction of the "diet chart" instruction, and the requirement for specific recall (Calcium/Dairy) suggests a high error rate.
