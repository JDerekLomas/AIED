Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the English sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object).
2. Understand the technical term "verb phrase" (a grammatical metalanguage requirement).
3. Distinguish between the "action" (playing) and the "auxiliary" (are).
4. Isolate the constituent parts from the object (football).
5. Combine the auxiliary and the main verb into a single string for the written response.

Step 2: Common "buggy rules":
1. "Action-only bug": Identifying only the lexical verb ("playing") as the verb, ignoring the auxiliary.
2. "Noun-proximity bug": Including the object ("playing football") because the action is perceived as inseparable from the thing being acted upon.
3. "First-word-after-subject bug": Identifying only "are" as the verb because it occupies the immediate post-subject slot.
4. "Labeling bug": Identifying the whole sentence because of a lack of familiarity with the specific boundary of a "phrase."

Step 3: Population considerations:
- Grade 6 students in this demographic often treat English as a functional tool rather than a structural system.
- "Verb phrase" is a high-level metalinguistic term often confused with "verb."
- Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the English auxiliary system (is/am/are), as the copula/auxiliary function works differently in Hindi (often placed at the end of the sentence).
- The open-ended format removes the "cueing" effect of multiple-choice options.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While "playing" is easily identified, the inclusion of "are" to satisfy the rubric for "verb phrase" is a significant hurdle for students at this level and linguistic background.
