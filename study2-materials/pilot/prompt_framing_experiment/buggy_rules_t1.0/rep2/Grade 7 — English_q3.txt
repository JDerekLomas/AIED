Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the syntax of the question (noting the grammatical error "Why the king felt" instead of "Why did the king feel").
2. Retrieve the specific narrative schema from the text "Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy.
3. Identify the causal link between "knowledge of the three answers" and "avoidance of failure."
4. Translate the internal conceptual model (likely in Hindi/L1) into English.
5. Apply syntactic rules to construct 2-3 sentences as per the prompt instructions.
6. Align the response with the rubric's specific requirement (listing the three specific categories of knowledge).

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. **The "Topic Match" Bug:** Students provide a general summary of the story instead of answering the specific "why" regarding failure.
2. **The "Direct Copy" Bug:** Copying any sentence from the passage containing the word "king" or "fail," regardless of context.
3. **The "L1 Interference" Bug:** Using Hindi syntax structure with English words (e.g., "King thought that answers knowing then failure not happen").
4. **The "Wh-Question Misinterpretation" Bug:** Treating "Why" as "What," leading to a list of the questions without explaining the king's motivation/belief about success.
5. **The "Instruction Overlook" Bug:** Providing a one-word or one-phrase answer because the cognitive load of constructing 2-3 sentences in a second language is too high.

Step 3: Target Population Analysis
Grade 7 students in this demographic often face a "threshold barrier" where their reading comprehension in English lags significantly behind their cognitive maturity. While they may understand the story's moral in Hindi, the transition to open-ended English production (recall) is significantly harder than multiple-choice (recognition). The requirement for "2-3 sentences" for a 1-mark question creates a high effort-to-reward ratio, often leading to omission or minimal effort.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the complexity of retrieving three specific narrative points and synthesizing them into grammatically coherent English sentences, many students will fail to hit the specific rubric requirements even if they understand the story.
