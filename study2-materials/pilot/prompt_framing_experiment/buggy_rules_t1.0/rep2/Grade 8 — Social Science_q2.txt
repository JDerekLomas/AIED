Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English prompt ("Describe," "key feature," "urban planning") and translate the academic concepts into mental models.
2. Access long-term memory to retrieve the specific schema for "Harappan Civilization/Indus Valley."
3. Filter retrieved information to isolate "urban planning" specifically (distinguishing it from trade, religion, or tools).
4. Select one distinct feature (e.g., drainage, grid pattern, citadel).
5. Formulate a descriptive sentence in English that maintains semantic accuracy despite limited vocabulary.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. Semantic Over-extension: Providing any true fact about Harappa (e.g., "They traded with Mesopotamia") regardless of its relevance to urban planning.
2. Category Displacement: Confounding "urban planning" with "lifestyle" or "agriculture."
3. Keyword Association Bug: Seeing "Harappan" and writing a memorized "safety" sentence (e.g., "It is a very old city") that lacks a specific feature.
4. L1-L2 Translation Interference: Using Hindi syntax or terminology that fails to meet the "describe" criteria in English, leading to incomplete thoughts.
5. The "List vs. Describe" Bug: Providing a single word (e.g., "Bricks") without the descriptive context required by the rubric.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face a "scissor effect": the cognitive load of history is high, and the linguistic barrier of English-medium testing for Hindi-medium learners creates a bottleneck. While urban planning is a core " rote-learned" topic, the open-ended nature (recall) is significantly harder than recognition (multiple choice).

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the topic is foundational, the combination of English-language production hurdles and the requirement to filter for "urban planning" specifically (rather than general facts) suggests a significant portion of students will provide partially correct but technically "buggy" or irrelevant answers.
