Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the role of turmeric and hibiscus as natural indicators.
2. Formulate a method to apply the indicator (e.g., mixing the liquid with turmeric or creating a turmeric paper strip).
3. Observe the color change (specifically that turmeric turns red in a base).
4. Perform the inverse logical check (turmeric remains yellow in acid).
5. (Optional but implied by the prompt) Repeat/verify with hibiscus extract to confirm.
6. Translate these procedural observations into a written English explanation.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. **The "Binary Indicator" Bug**: Assuming one indicator changes color for *both* states (e.g., thinking turmeric turns blue for acid and red for base).
2. **The "Neutrality" Bug**: Failing to distinguish between an acid and a neutral substance because turmeric remains yellow for both.
3. **The "Hibiscus Confusion" Bug**: Hibiscus has complex color changes (dark pink/red in acid, green in base). Students often swap these or confuse them with litmus results.
4. **The "Material Omission" Bug**: Explaining only one indicator when the prompt provides two, leading to an incomplete procedural description.
5. **The "Linguistic Encoding" Bug**: Possessing the conceptual "mental model" but failing to structure the "If-Then" logic correctly in English.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Grade 7 Development**: Students are transitioning from concrete to formal operational thought; multi-step logical "if-then" chains are still unstable.
2. **Socio-Economic/Language Factors**: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with "open-ended" recall questions in English. They may know the color change but lack the functional English to write a coherent "how-to" sequence.
3. **Recall vs. Recognition**: Unlike multiple-choice, this requires active retrieval of specific color-change pairs, which has a much higher failure rate in low-resource settings.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the complexity of coordinating two different indicators, the language barrier for written production, and the common confusion between acid/base color results in middle school science, the success rate for a *fully* correct procedural description is low.
