Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall and name two distinct historical monuments located specifically in Rajasthan.
2. Filter recalled information to ensure both monuments are in the correct state (Rajasthan).
3. Select one of those two monuments and recall its specific city of location.
4. Recall a specific historical or architectural reason for that monument's fame.
5. Translate these internal facts into English (as per the medium of the test) and write them out.
6. Verify that the answer meets all four constraints (Two names, one city, one reason).

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "State-City Confusion": Listing a monument from a different state (e.g., Taj Mahal) because it is a "famous monument" generally.
2. "Category Blurring": Naming a city (Jaipur) or a person (Maharana Pratap) instead of a specific monument.
3. "Constraint Satisfaction Failure": Naming two monuments but forgetting to provide the city or the reason for one of them (cognitive overload).
4. "The 'Famous' Tautology": Providing a circular reason for fame (e.g., "It is famous because it is very famous" or "because it is beautiful").
5. "Linguistic Bottleneck": Knowing the facts in Hindi but being unable to retrieve the English terminology or structure required to express the "why" component.

Step 3: Population Considerations
For Grade 6 students in this demographic, "open-ended recall" is significantly more difficult than "recognition" (multiple choice). The rubric is unusually harsh (1 mark for four distinct pieces of information), meaning any single "bug" in the multi-step process results in a score of 0. Students with limited English proficiency often struggle with the "why" component, even if their factual knowledge is intact.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the "all-or-nothing" nature of the 1-mark rubric for a multi-part question, the high probability of omission errors, and the linguistic transition challenges:
