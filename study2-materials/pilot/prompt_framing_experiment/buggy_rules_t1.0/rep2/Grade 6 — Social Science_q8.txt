Step 1: List the specific procedural steps:
1. Retrieval/Recall: Access specific legal or social entitlements categorized specifically as "Child Rights" (e.g., Right to Education, Right against Exploitation).
2. Discrimination: Distinguish between general Human Rights and specific Child Rights.
3. Selection: Choose exactly two distinct rights.
4. Functional Explanation: Formulate a causal link explaining *why* one specific right is "important" (linking the right to a developmental or protective outcome).
5. Linguistic Encoding: Translate these concepts from Hindi (mother tongue) into English sentences, maintaining grammatical coherence for the "explain" portion.

Step 2: Identify "buggy rules":
1. "Identity Substitution": Providing duties (e.g., "Respect elders") instead of rights.
2. "Category Broadening": Listing general needs (e.g., "Food and toys") rather than rights.
3. "The List-Only Bug": Providing two rights but omitting the explanation (treating "Name" as the sole command).
4. "The Tautological Explanation": Explaining importance by restating the right (e.g., "Education is important because children should be educated").
5. "Linguistic Attrition": Successful recall in L1 but failure to produce a scorable sentence in L2 (English).

Step 3: Consider the target population:
Grade 6 is a transitional year where students move from rote naming to conceptual explanation. For ESL/EWS students, the "cost" of the explanation step is high. The rubric offers only 1 mark for a multi-step task (naming AND explaining), meaning any single bug results in a score of 0.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While many students can name "Education," the requirement for *two* distinct rights plus a functional explanation in a non-native language, combined with the all-or-nothing nature of a 1-point rubric, creates a high probability of "buggy" partial responses.
