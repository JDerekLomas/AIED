Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. **Recognition of Form:** Identify the equation as a proportion requiring cross-multiplication.
2. **Cross-Multiplication (Distribution Setup):** Correctly multiply the numerator of one side by the denominator of the other: $5(x-5) = 3(x-3)$.
3. **Distributive Property:** Multiply the constant into both terms of the binomial (e.g., $5x - 25$ and $3x - 9$).
4. **Variable Isolation (Transposition):** Move $3x$ to the left and $-25$ to the right, necessitating sign changes ($5x - 3x = -9 + 25$).
5. **Arithmetic with Integers:** Correctly compute $2x = 16$.
6. **Final Division:** Divide by the coefficient to find $x = 8$.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- **Partial Distribution:** Distributing only to the first term ($5x - 5 = 3x - 3$).
- **Sign Error during Transposition:** Failing to flip the sign when moving a term across the equals sign (e.g., $5x + 3x$ or $-9 - 25$).
- **Cross-Multiplication Confusion:** Multiplying across numerators or denominators instead of diagonally, or multiplying the same side ($3(x-5)$).
- **Integer Arithmetic Errors:** Mistakenly calculating $-9 + 25$ as $-34$ or $16$ as negative.

Step 3: Population Considerations
In Grade 8 Indian government schools, students often struggle with the transition from arithmetic to symbolic algebra. For Hindi-medium students, the "cross-multiplication" (vajra-gunan) concept is standard, but the multi-step nature of this open-ended problem creates "procedural leakage," where a student knows the start but fails a middle step. The lack of multiple-choice cues means there is no opportunity for "back-solving" from options.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that this requires the successful concatenation of at least five distinct algebraic sub-skills, even students who understand the concept often trip on integer signs or distribution. In this specific demographic, the cumulative probability of error-free execution across all steps is low.
