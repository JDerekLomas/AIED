Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Visual Recognition: Identify specific cultural markers in the provided image (idols, attire, ritual objects) to distinguish it from other Rajasthani festivals (e.g., Teej vs. Gangaur).
2. Retrieval: Recall the specific proper noun "Gangaur" or "Dhinga Gavar" from long-term memory without cues (recall vs. recognition).
3. Linguistic Translation: Formulate the internal Hindi concept into a written response, navigating the English-medium requirement of the prompt if applicable.
4. Descriptive Execution: Describe the rituals (processions, clay idols, singing) as requested in the second part of the prompt.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. Overgeneralization: Labeling any Rajasthani festival involving women and idols as "Teej" due to visual similarity.
2. Partial Execution: Providing the name of the festival but failing to describe "how" it is celebrated (a common error in multi-part prompts).
3. Language Switching Interference: Attempting to write the description in English but failing due to limited proficiency, leading to an incomplete or unintelligible answer.
4. Phonetic Spelling Bug: Misspelling the festival name in a way that may not align with the rubric if the evaluator is strict (though less common in local contexts).

Step 3: Target population considerations
1. Socio-economic context: Students may participate in these festivals but may not have seen them formalised in textbooks or high-quality color prints, leading to recognition gaps.
2. Language barrier: The prompt is in English ("Which festival... describe how..."); students with limited English may understand the image but fail to comprehend the "how" instruction, leading to a half-score or zero based on rubric strictness.
3. Low Reward-to-Effort Ratio: The maximum score is very low (0.5), which can lead to "satisficing"—students providing a one-word answer and skipping the description.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the festival is culturally salient, the combination of an open-ended "describe" prompt in English, the potential for confusion with similar festivals (Teej), and the specific recall required for a 0.5-point item suggests a high rate of partial or incorrect responses.
