Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the English prompt and vocabulary ("Imagine," "bird," "sentence," "perspective").
2. Perform a cognitive shift to a non-human persona (decentering).
3. Retrieve relevant L2 (English) vocabulary related to avian actions (fly, sky, wings, eat).
4. Construct a syntactically correct sentence in the first person ("I...").
5. Apply grammatical rules (Subject-Verb agreement, tense consistency, punctuation).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. "Literal Translation Bug": Directly translating from Hindi (SOV) to English (SVO), resulting in incorrect word order (e.g., "I sky in fly").
2. "Third-Person Default": Writing about the bird rather than as the bird (e.g., "Bird is flying") due to failure to process the "Imagine you are" constraint.
3. "The 'A' Article Overgeneralization": Placing "a" before verbs or pronouns.
4. "Omission of Auxiliary/Copula": Dropping "am" or "is" in continuous tenses (e.g., "I flying").
5. "Vocabulary Substitution": Using a Hindi word for a specific action (e.g., "I chidiya hoon").

Step 3: Student population considerations:
Grade 6 students in this context often struggle with the transition from rote memorization to creative production. The open-ended nature of "Imagine" requires high-level executive function and linguistic synthesis that exceeds simple recognition. English proficiency is often limited to basic nouns and familiar phrases; constructing an original, grammatically perfect sentence is a significant leap.
