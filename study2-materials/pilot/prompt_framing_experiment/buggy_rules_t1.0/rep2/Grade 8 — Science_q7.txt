Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Recall the biological concept of decomposition (the change from complex organic waste to compost/humus).
2. Predict the physical change (decay, reduction in volume, color change, smell).
3. Identify the causal agent (microorganisms/decomposers).
4. Connect the process to soil health (nutrient recycling/manure).
5. Translate these internal scientific concepts into English sentences.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. "Visible = Gone" bug: Students may think the waste simply "disappears" rather than transforms, failing to explain the *change*.
2. "Good/Bad" conflation: Students often associate rot/decay with "germs" or "dirt" and conclude it is harmful rather than beneficial to soil.
3. "Noun-only" bug: Providing a single word (e.g., "Manure") instead of the required multi-part explanation (reasons + evaluation).
4. "Translation bottleneck": The student understands the process in Hindi (Apghatan/Khaad) but lacks the English vocabulary ("decomposition," "nutrients," "fertility") to fulfill the "Give reasons" requirement.

Step 3: Population factors:
Grade 8 students in this demographic often struggle with open-ended synthesis questions in English. While the concept of "khaad" (compost) is culturally familiar, the rubric requires three distinct cognitive moves: Observation, Explanation (Process), and Evaluation (Impact). The 0.5 marks suggested by the rubric implies a very low weighting, which often leads to low student effort or "fragmentary" responses.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
The requirement to provide "reasons" and "evaluate" in a second language, combined with the cognitive leap from physical rot to chemical soil health, makes this a high-error-rate item for this specific population.
