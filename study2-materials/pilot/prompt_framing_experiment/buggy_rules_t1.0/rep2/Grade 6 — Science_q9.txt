Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of the term "protective foods" (connecting the word 'protect' to 'disease prevention').
2. Retrieve the specific functional role of vitamins and minerals from long-term memory.
3. Formulate a functional explanation in English (as the language of instruction/assessment) linking intake to immune defense.
4. Recall a specific Vitamin + Deficiency Disease pair (e.g., Vitamin A - Night Blindness).
5. Recall a specific Mineral + Deficiency Disease pair (e.g., Iodine - Goitre or Iron - Anaemia).
6. Categorize the pairs correctly to ensure the Vitamin is not labeled a Mineral and vice versa.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "The Label Bug": Students define "protective foods" based on the literal word 'protect' but apply it to physical protection (e.g., "they protect our skin" or "they protect our organs from injury") rather than immunological defense.
2. "Category Conflation": Treating vitamins and minerals as a single category, leading to providing two vitamins or two minerals, or swapping their labels (e.g., naming Iron as a vitamin).
3. "The Energy Bug": Generalizing all nutrients to "gives us energy," a common overextension from lessons on carbohydrates and fats.
4. "Recall-Recognition Gap": Students may recognize "Scurvy" as a disease but fail to retrieve the specific name when prompted in an open-ended format without options.
5. "Linguistic Approximation": Hindi-medium students often know the concept (e.g., "beemari se bachana") but fail to translate "deficiency" or "essential" into a coherent English sentence, leading to incomplete responses that miss the rubric's specific link.

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 6 is the transitional year from primary to upper-primary. For students in economically weaker sections, nutritional literacy might be high due to government health programs (Mid-day meals), but English literacy is a significant barrier. The "Maximum score: 1" for an multi-part open-ended question is high-stakes; if the rubric is applied strictly, a mistake in any one of the three components (explanation, vitamin name, mineral name) results in a zero.
