Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of "Evaluate" and "Key differences" (Translate from English to conceptual understanding).
2. Retrieve the conceptual categories for "Public Healthcare" and "Private Healthcare" from long-term memory.
3. Perform a comparative operation (mapping contrastive attributes: e.g., Cost, Accessibility, Quality).
4. Select one valid argument or example for *each* category (requires two distinct pieces of evidence).
5. Encode the answer in English (or the medium of instruction) while adhering to the constraint of the 1-point rubric (which surprisingly only requires mentioning two features of public healthcare, despite the question asking for a comparison).

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" or procedural errors
1. **The "Definition for Comparison" Bug:** Providing a definition of one term without the contrasting feature of the other.
2. **The "Symmetry Error":** Assuming if public is "free," private must be "expensive," without providing a specific example or further nuance requested.
3. **The "Rubric-Question Mismatch" Bug:** Students follow the prompt (compare) but fail the specific rubric check (two features of public), or vice versa.
4. **Keyword Association Bug:** Writing everything they know about "Government Hospitals" (overcrowding, dirtiness) without addressing the "private" half of the prompt.
5. **Language Interference:** Misinterpreting "Evaluate" as "Define" or "List."

Step 3: Target student population considerations
- Grade 7 students are transitioning from concrete to formal operational thought; "Evaluate" is a high-level Bloom's command.
- For EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English vocabulary (Evaluate, Public, Private) acts as a significant barrier.
- Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice recognition for this demographic.
- The rubric is actually *easier* than the prompt (only requiring two public features), but students don't see the rubric; they see the harder prompt.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric is surprisingly lenient (only requiring two features of public healthcare), the complexity of the "Evaluate" prompt and the linguistic barrier for the specific demographic suggests a high rate of partial or incorrect responses.
