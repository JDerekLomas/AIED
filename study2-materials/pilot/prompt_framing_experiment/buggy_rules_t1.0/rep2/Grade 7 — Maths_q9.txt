Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Identify the relationship as multiplicative (total distance = rate × quantity).
2. Convert the mixed number $5 \frac{3}{4}$ into an improper fraction $\frac{23}{4}$ or a decimal $5.75$.
3. Set up the multiplication: $10 \times \frac{23}{4}$ or $10 \times 5.75$.
4. Perform the calculation (e.g., $230 \div 4$ or $10 \times 5 + 10 \times 0.75$).
5. Finalize the numerical value (57.5 or $57 \frac{1}{2}$).

Step 2: Common "buggy rules":
- **Mixed Number Multiplication Error:** Multiplying the whole number and ignoring the fraction ($10 \times 5 = 50$).
- **Improper Fraction Conversion Bug:** Adding the denominator instead of multiplying ($5 \times 4 + 3$ becomes $5 + 4 + 3 = 12$, or $5 \times 3 + 4 = 19$).
- **Decimal Placement Bug:** If converting to decimals, misplacing the point in $10 \times 5.75$ (e.g., $5.750$ or $575$).
- **Operation Choice Bug:** Using division ($10 \div 5 \frac{3}{4}$) due to "keyword" confusion or difficulty conceptualizing distance with non-integers.

Step 3: Target population considerations:
- Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with the English phrasing "How far can it travel on...", potentially leading to a misinterpretation of which value is the rate and which is the quantity.
- Seventh-grade students in EWS contexts often face "learning gaps" where foundational fraction arithmetic (taught in grades 5-6) is not yet automated.
- The open-ended format eliminates the possibility of "back-solving" from options, increasing the likelihood of uncorrected procedural slips.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While the rubric only asks for identifying the operation, the prompt asks for the proportion who produce the *fully correct answer*. Given the cumulative probability of error across fraction conversion and decimal multiplication, the success rate is significantly impacted.
