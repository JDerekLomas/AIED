Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the syntax of the question (handling the grammatical error "the one major landforms").
2. Retrieve specific geographical data related to the state of Rajasthan from long-term memory.
3. Select one distinct feature that qualifies as a "major landform" (Thar Desert or Aravalli Range).
4. Formulate a descriptive sentence in English detailing the characteristics of the chosen landform.
5. Apply English syntax and vocabulary rules to communicate the description clearly enough to meet rubric standards.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "State-Capital Confusion": Providing the name of a city (Jaipur) or the state itself instead of a physical landform.
2. "Keyword Matching Bug": Associating "Rajasthan" only with "Hot/Desert" but failing to recall the formal name "Thar" or "Marusthali."
3. "The Translation Bottleneck": The student knows the concept in Hindi (रेगिस्तान/अरावली) but cannot retrieve the English terminology or construct a "brief description" in English.
4. "Category Error": Listing a climate characteristic (e.g., "very hot") as the name of the landform itself.
5. "The Singularity Overgeneralization": Ignoring the "describe" constraint because the point value (0.5) is so low it suggests a single-word answer is sufficient.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. English Proficiency: For students in Hindi-medium or low-resource English-medium schools, "describe" is a high-threshold command compared to "point" or "circle."
2. Low Stakes/Low Value: A 0.5-mark item often triggers low cognitive effort; students may provide a one-word answer and lose the description component.
3. Open-ended Recall: Unlike multiple-choice, there are no cues to trigger memory, increasing the likelihood of blank answers or "I don't know" in English.
