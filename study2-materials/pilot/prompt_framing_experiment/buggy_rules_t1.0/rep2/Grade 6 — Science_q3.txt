Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English command verb "Differentiate" and the phrase "key characteristics."
2. Access long-term memory to retrieve specific biological criteria for life (growth, respiration, etc.).
3. Distinguish between "living" and "non-living" categories.
4. Select two distinct characteristics for each (total of four points of data).
5. Formulate a comparative structure (either a table or sentences) in English or a mix of English/Hindi.
6. Verify that the selected characteristics are "key" (scientific) rather than superficial (e.g., "living things have names").

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules"
1. **Asymmetric Comparison:** Providing a characteristic for living things (e.g., "they eat") but failing to provide the corresponding negation for non-living things (or providing a totally unrelated trait).
2. **Category Collapse:** Listing examples (dog, stone) instead of characteristics (growth, movement).
3. **Over-extension of Motion:** Defining living things solely by observable displacement (e.g., "living things move"), leading to the bug that cars are living or plants are non-living.
4. **Anthropomorphic Bias:** Assigning only human-centric traits (e.g., "they have eyes," "they talk") as key characteristics.
5. **Language-Switching Syntax Error:** Attempting to translate a concept from Hindi (e.g., *sajiv/nirjiv*) but losing the technical precision in English.

Step 3: Target student population considerations
The rubric is surprisingly lenient (0.5 marks for just one characteristic), but the prompt asks for "two key characteristics for each," creating a disconnect between the task demand and the scoring. Grade 6 students in this demographic often struggle with the "recall" aspect of open-ended English questions. While they may intuitively know what is alive, the formal requirement to articulate "characteristics" in a second language is a high cognitive barrier.
