Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Visual Decoding: Interpret the sequential images (Fox and Goat/Well) to identify the specific narrative arc (falling, entrapment, deception).
2. Lexical Retrieval: Recall specific English vocabulary for key elements (fox, well, fall, climb, escape).
3. Syntactic Construction: Formulate sentences in the past tense (fell, was, could not) to describe a sequence of events.
4. Narrative Synthesis: Link the images into a cohesive story or paragraph that meets the specific rubric requirement (cause of falling + inability to escape).
5. Orthographic Encoding: Write the words with legible spelling and punctuation.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. Tense Switching: Mixing present and past tense (e.g., "The fox fall in well") or over-regularizing (e.g., "falled").
2. Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) Mismatch: Applying L1 (Hindi) syntax (Subject-Object-Verb) to English output.
3. Article Omission: Skipping "the" or "a" (e.g., "Fox fell in well") common in L2 learners.
4. Literal Translation: Using a Hindi word when the English word is forgotten (code-mixing).
5. Descriptive-Action Gap: Describing the objects in the pictures (e.g., "There is a fox") rather than the narrative action required by the rubric.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 8 students from economically weaker sections often face a "cumulative deficit" in English. While they may understand the story in their L1, the transition from recognition (knowing what a well is) to production (writing "could not escape") is a high cognitive load. The open-ended nature of the task means there is no scaffolding; a student who cannot recall the word "well" or the past tense of "fall" will fail to meet the rubric despite understanding the logic.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
The requirement is strict: the student must describe both the *cause* and the *consequence*. In many under-resourced settings, while students can identify the characters, writing a grammatically functional paragraph in English that satisfies specific rubric constraints results in a high failure rate.
