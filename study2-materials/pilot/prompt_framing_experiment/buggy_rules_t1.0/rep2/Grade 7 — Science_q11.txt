Step 1: Specific procedural steps:
1. Decode the table structure (identifying columns and rows).
2. Interpret the numerical value in the "Time" column (Quantitative Literacy).
3. Recognize the inverse relationship between "Time" and "Speed" (Mathematical Cognition: Smallest value = Fastest rate).
4. Extract the correct labels (Liquid A/Petrol) corresponding to the minimum numerical value.
5. Translate the finding into the required English response.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. **Magnitude Matching Error:** Identifying the largest number as the "fastest" because "fastest" is semantically associated with "most" or "highest" (choosing Liquid C/120 minutes).
2. **Column Misalignment:** Misreading the row-column intersection under exam pressure.
3. **Unit Confusion:** Treating time as a direct measure of speed rather than an inverse measure.
4. **Linguistic Barrier:** Misunderstanding the word "fastest" in an English context, leading to a random guess or selecting the most familiar substance (Water).

Step 3: Population considerations:
1. Grade 7 students are transitioning from concrete to abstract reasoning; inverse relationships remain a significant cognitive hurdle.
2. For Hindi-medium students, the linguistic "switch" between "kam samay" (less time) and "tez" (fast) may not be automatic in a second language.
3. Open-ended formats (even for 1 mark) lack the scaffolding/cues provided by Multiple Choice Questions.

Step 4: Estimation:
The "Smallest = Fastest" inverse logic is a notorious "bug" in middle-school science across all demographics, but it is compounded here by language processing delays. While Step (a) is simpler than (b), the conceptual trap of the highest number remains the primary barrier.
