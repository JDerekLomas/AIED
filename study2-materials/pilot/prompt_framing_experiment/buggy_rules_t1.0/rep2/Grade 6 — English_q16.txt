Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English prompt and identify the core requirement (identifying a season).
2. Retrieve the English vocabulary word corresponding to a preferred season (e.g., Summer, Winter, Rainy/Monsoon).
3. Synthesize the context of "6-8 lines" and "what you eat/wear" to realize the output must be a paragraph.
4. Correctly spell the name of the season within the written response.

Step 2: Buggy rules and systematic errors
1. **The "Topic Label" Bug:** Students often provide only the name of the season (e.g., "Winter") instead of writing the requested paragraph, or conversely, they write a paragraph but forget to explicitly name the season.
2. **Translation Interference (L1 to L2):** Students may think of the season in Hindi (e.g., "Sardi") and attempt to phonetically spell it or fail to retrieve the English equivalent.
3. **Task Complexity Overload:** Students may focus so heavily on the secondary prompts (food/clothes) that they fail to explicitly state "My favorite season is..." which is the specific metric for the 1-mark rubric.
4. **The "Empty Page" Bug:** Due to low English proficiency, students often skip "Short Paragraph" questions entirely, fearing they cannot fulfill the 6-8 line requirement, even if they know the name of the season.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often have significant gaps in English literacy. While they can identify seasons in their mother tongue, the transition to writing a multi-sentence paragraph in English is a high cognitive load. Since the rubric awards the mark solely for *naming* the season, the success rate depends on whether they attempt the paragraph at all or if they simply list the season. The "open-ended" nature is a significant barrier compared to multiple-choice.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the discrepancy between the complex task (6-8 lines) and the narrow rubric (naming the season), many students will fail to get the mark not because they don't know the season, but because they will leave the question blank due to the perceived difficulty of writing a paragraph in English.
