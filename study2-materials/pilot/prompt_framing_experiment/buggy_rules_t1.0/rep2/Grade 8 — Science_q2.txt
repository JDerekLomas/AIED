Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the English syntax of the question (identifying that two distinct pieces of information are required: name and category).
2. Retrieve the specific biological name "Lactobacillus" from long-term memory (recall, not recognition).
3. Map the retrieved name to its biological classification (Bacteria).
4. Transliterate or spell the technical term "Lactobacillus" correctly enough to be recognizable/graded.
5. Communicate both parts of the answer clearly in a second language (English).

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "The Familiarity Bug": Students provide the general process or the result (e.g., "yeast" or "fermentation") instead of the specific organism name because the process is more culturally salient than the microbe.
2. "Category-Name Swap": Providing the category (Bacteria) as the name or vice versa.
3. "Partial Recall Bug": Naming the organism but omitting the category (or vice versa), often triggered by the "and" being overlooked in a second language.
4. "Orthographic Mismatch": Attempting to phonetically spell "Lactobacillus" in English based on Hindi phonetics, leading to unrecognizable strings (e.g., "Lacto-basiles").
5. "The Common Knowledge Bug": Substituting "Virus" for any microorganism because it is a more common colloquial term for "germ."

Step 3: Population Considerations
Eighth-grade students in this demographic often have high "functional" knowledge (they know how curd is made) but low "academic" English vocabulary. The open-ended nature of the question removes the scaffolding provided by multiple-choice options. The 0.5 mark allocation suggests a "minor" question, which may lead students to provide a one-word answer (just the name) rather than the two-part answer required.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While "Lactobacillus" is a high-frequency fact in Indian Science textbooks, the dual requirement (name + category) plus the English-language barrier for technical spelling significantly increases the "bug" rate. Many students will provide only half the answer or struggle with the spelling of the specific genus.
