Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Identify the Object ("the leaves") and move it to the Subject position.
2. Identify the Verb Tense ("blew" is Simple Past).
3. Select the correct form of the auxiliary verb "to be" based on tense and number (Past Plural: "were").
4. Recall and produce the Past Participle of the irregular verb "blow" ("blown").
5. Move the original Subject ("the wind") to the end, preceded by the preposition "by".
6. Maintain the adverbial particle ("away") in a grammatically correct position.

Step 2: Common "buggy rules"
1. Tense Mismatch: Using "are" instead of "were" (presenting as a default "to be" form).
2. Subject-Verb Agreement Failure: Using "was" instead of "were" because "wind" is singular, or failing to recognize "leaves" as plural.
3. Irregular Verb Regularization: Writing "blowed" or "blewn" instead of "blown."
4. Passive/Active Confusion: Keeping the verb in the past tense without the auxiliary ("The leaves blew away by the wind").
5. Preposition Omission: Dropping "by" or "away."

Step 3: Population Considerations
For Grade 7 students in this demographic, English is often a tertiary language. The transition from Hindi (a Subject-Object-Verb language) to English (Subject-Verb-Object) complicates the structural inversion required for passive voice. Irregular past participles (blow/blew/blown) are a high-frequency failure point in rote-memorization contexts. The open-ended format removes the "recognition" scaffold, requiring high-load retrieval of the participle and the specific auxiliary.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While some students will grasp the "Subject-Object" swap, the combination of the plural object ("leaves"), the irregular verb ("blown"), and the past tense creates multiple "bottlenecks" where a student can lose the single point available.
