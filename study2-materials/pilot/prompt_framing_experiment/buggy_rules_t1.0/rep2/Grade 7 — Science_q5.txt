Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the English scientific terminology ("differentiate," "autotrophic," "heterotrophic," "nutrition").
2. Recall the conceptual definitions from long-term memory.
3. Formulate a comparative structure (linking the "self-making" attribute to autotrophs and "dependent" attribute to heterotrophs).
4. Retrieve specific biological examples for both categories.
5. Encode the response in written English (syntax and spelling).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. **The "Definition for Distinction" Bug:** Providing a definition for only one term, assuming the other is implied.
2. **The "Etymological Confusion" Bug:** Swapping the prefixes "auto-" and "hetero-" (systematic reversal).
3. **The "Example-Attribute Mismatch":** Providing correct examples but incorrect definitions (or vice-versa).
4. **The "Phonetic Encoding" Bug:** Misspelling terms based on Hindi phonetics in a way that obscures meaning (e.g., "autotrof").
5. **The "Category Narrowing" Bug:** Defining autotrophs only as "plants" rather than the process of making food.

Step 3: Population considerations:
- Grade 7 is the transition point where academic vocabulary becomes more abstract.
- For Hindi-medium students, "Autotrophic/Heterotrophic" are high-lexical-load words compared to "Swaposhit/Parposhit."
- The "1-mark" rubric is punishing; it requires both definitions and both examples for a single point, meaning a minor "bug" in any of the 4-5 sub-steps results in a zero.
- Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice recognition for ESL learners.

Step 4: Holistic estimate:
Given the multi-step requirement (2 definitions + 2 examples) for a single mark and the linguistic barrier, many students will provide partially correct answers (e.g., just examples) that fail the rubric's binary requirement.
