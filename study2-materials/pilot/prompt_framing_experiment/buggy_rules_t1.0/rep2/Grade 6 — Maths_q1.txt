Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Recall the definition of a "factor" (distinguishing it from "multiple").
2. Execute systematic divisibility testing starting from 1 (1x68, 2x34).
3. Identify 4 as a factor through division (68 ÷ 4 = 17).
4. Verify primality or composite nature of intermediate numbers (recognizing 17 is prime to know the list is exhaustive).
5. Compile the final list without omissions.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
- **Factor/Multiple Confusion:** Listing multiples (68, 136...) or stopping after 1 and 68.
- **Divisibility Gaps:** Missing 4 and 17 because 4 is not a "basic" multiplication table fact (1-10) and 17 is a double-digit prime.
- **Incomplete Search:** Finding 1, 2, 34, 68 but failing to check for factors between 2 and 8.
- **Calculation Errors:** Incorrectly concluding 68 is divisible by 3 (6+8=14, often miscalculated as 12 or 15) or failing the long division for 4.

Step 3: Population considerations:
- **Language Barrier:** In Hindi-medium backgrounds, the term "factor" (गुणनखंड - gunankhand) is distinct; if the question is in English, students may misinterpret the command.
- **Format:** The open-ended nature (recall) is significantly harder than multiple-choice (recognition) where they could test options.
- **Table Proficiency:** Indian curricula emphasize rote memorization of tables, usually up to 10 or 20. 17x4 is less commonly internalized than 2x34.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
The requirement for a *complete* list for a single mark is a high threshold. Missing just one factor (usually 4 or 17) results in 0 marks. Given the difficulty of identifying 17 as a factor for a Grade 6 student in this demographic, the success rate is typically low.
