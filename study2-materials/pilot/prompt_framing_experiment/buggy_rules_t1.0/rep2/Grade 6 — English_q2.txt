Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the written English question ("Who", "lived", "inside").
2. Retrieve the specific narrative detail from memory (recall of the specific text read in class).
3. Distinguish between the "physical book" and the "story world" (conceptual boundary).
4. Synthesize a response that matches the semantic requirement ("Who" implies a person/creature).
5. Encode the answer in English (spelling "fairy" or "magical").

Step 2: Buggy rules:
1. Keyword Matching Bug: Student sees "Who" and "book" and provides the name of the author or the owner of the book instead of the character inside.
2. Literal Interpretation Bug: Student interprets "inside the book" physically and answers "pages," "words," or "ink."
3. Phonetic Spelling Bug: Student recalls the entity but writes "fary," "pari" (Hindi transliteration), or "fari," which may be marked wrong depending on teacher strictness despite the rubric.
4. Language Interference Bug: Student understands the concept but retrieves the Hindi word "Pari" and cannot translate it to "Fairy."

Step 3: Population considerations:
Grade 6 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds often face a "literacy gap" where their reading comprehension in English lags behind their cognitive ability. Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice recognition. In many Indian government school contexts, rote memorization of "question-answers" is the primary strategy; if this specific question was not pre-memorized from the back of a chapter, the success rate drops.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While "fairy" is a simple concept, the combination of English-language production hurdles, potential confusion between literal/figurative "inside," and the requirement for recall rather than recognition suggests a significant portion of the population will struggle.
