Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the semantic relationship "thrice his age" into the multiplication operation: $12 \times 3$.
2. Execute the multiplication to find the father's current age ($36$).
3. Understand the concept of "age difference" (subtraction: $36 - 12 = 24$).
4. Account for the temporal shift ("after 5 years").
5. Realize that age difference remains constant over time OR calculate both future ages ($12+5=17$; $36+5=41$) and subtract ($41-17=24$).

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. **The "Add Everything" Bug:** Adding all numbers in the prompt ($12 + 3 + 5 = 20$). Common in low English proficiency contexts where students hunt for keywords.
2. **The "Future Difference" Bug:** Thinking the difference also grows over time (calculating $24 + 5 = 29$ or $24 + 10 = 34$).
3. **Keyword Misinterpretation:** Interpreting "thrice" as "plus 3" or "age difference" as just the father's age.
4. **Operation Order Error:** Calculating $12 + 5 = 17$, then $17 \times 3 = 51$.

Step 3: Population Considerations
For Grade 8 students in this demographic, the term "thrice" is a significant linguistic barrier (not commonly used in basic ESL or Hindi-medium instruction). While the arithmetic is simple, the "constant difference" property is a common conceptual trap. The open-ended format prevents "back-solving" from options.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric only requires finding the father's current age ($36$) to get the point, the question asks for the "age difference... after 5 years." This misalignment between the question's goal and the rubric's requirement suggests many students will provide "24" or "36." However, the linguistic hurdle of "thrice" and the "Add Everything" strategy often seen in under-resourced settings will lead to significant failure rates.
