Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the written English sentence (syntax and vocabulary).
2. Retrieve the semantic meaning of the word "opposite" (antonym concept).
3. Retrieve the semantic meaning of the target word "slow."
4. Access the mental lexicon to identify the associated antonym "fast" (or "quick").
5. Map the retrieved phonological representation to the correct orthographic (spelling) representation.
6. Graphomotor execution of the word "fast" on the answer line.

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
- Translation Bug: Interpreting "opposite" as "meaning" (synonym) due to overexposure to "word-meanings" in rote learning.
- Spelling Phoneticization Bug: Writing "f-a-s-t-e" or "f-a-s-t-t" based on phonetic intuition rather than orthographic memory.
- Language Interference Bug: Thinking of the Hindi word "तेज़" (Tez) but failing to translate it back to the specific English target.
- Pattern Matching Bug: Providing a rhyming word (e.g., "glow," "low") instead of an antonym, a common error in early EFL learners.
- Associative Priming Bug: Providing a word that is contextually related but not an antonym (e.g., "steady" from "slow and steady").

Step 3: Target Population Analysis
Grade 6 students in these contexts often struggle with the transition from recognition (multiple choice) to recall (open-ended). While "fast" is a high-frequency word, the linguistic abstraction required to process the instruction "The opposite of..." in English, coupled with potential spelling hurdles for students with limited English literacy exposure, creates significant friction. In many Indian government school settings, lexical retrieval in a second language remains a major barrier despite the simplicity of the concept.
