Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the academic vocabulary of the prompt (specifically the verbs "Analyze," "Role," "Economic development," and "Evaluate").
2. Retrieve conceptual knowledge regarding the functions of money (Medium of exchange, store of value, etc.).
3. Link the function of money to macro-level "economic development" (growth, investment, trade).
4. Retrieve knowledge regarding "digital money" (UPI, wallets, net banking).
5. Synthesize an "evaluation" (pros/cons or current utility) of digital money.
6. Formulate a coherent response in English (the medium of the test) while navigating the transition from Hindi-medium thinking.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules"
1. "Definition for Analysis": Providing a simple definition of money instead of explaining its role in development.
2. "Contextual Conflation": Confusing "economic development" with personal wealth or "earning a salary."
3. "Example as Evaluation": Listing types of digital money (GPay, PhonePe) instead of evaluating their use or impact.
4. "Surface-Level Association": Linking money to "buying things" without the "development" bridge (infrastructure, industry).
5. "Translation Error": Misinterpreting "Role" as "Rules" or "Evaluate" as "Value" due to phonetic/orthographic similarities in a second language.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 7 students are at a transitional stage between concrete and formal operational thinking. For students from economically weaker sections in Indian government schools, "digital money" is often visible (UPI at stalls) but "economic development" remains an abstract curriculum concept. The high linguistic demand of "Analyze" and "Evaluate" in English represents a significant barrier for students whose primary cognitive processing occurs in Hindi.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The rubric is surprisingly lenient (requiring only one role to be explained), which helps. However, the gap between the sophisticated prompt ("Analyze/Evaluate") and the linguistic/conceptual scaffolds available to this specific population remains wide. Many students will likely provide a circular answer (e.g., "Money is used for development") or focus purely on the "digital" aspect without the "development" link.
