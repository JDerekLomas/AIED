Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Decoding and Translation**: Decode the English text and translate the abstract concepts (traffic rules, community, function smoothly) into Hindi or a mental model.
2.  **Concept Retrieval**: Recall specific traffic rules (e.g., stopping at red lights, wearing helmets).
3.  **Logical Mapping (Causal Reasoning)**: Link these rules to outcomes (safety, order) to generate "reasons."
4.  **Integration of Community Impact**: Synthesize how individual compliance leads to a collective benefit (the "smoothly functioning community" aspect).
5.  **English Composition**: Formulate a written response in English that expresses two distinct reasons.
6.  **Structural Verification**: Ensure the response satisfies both parts of the prompt (the "why" and the "how").

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic procedural errors)
1.  **"Keyword Association" Bug**: Providing a list of rules (Stop, Go) instead of *reasons* for the rules.
2.  **"Circular Reasoning" Bug**: Stating "It is important because we must follow them" or "It helps because it is good."
3.  **"One-for-All" Bug**: Providing two reasons that are functionally identical (e.g., "To avoid accidents" and "To stay safe"), failing the "distinct reasons" requirement.
4.  **"Language Processing Barrier"**: Misinterpreting "community" as "communication" or "commute," leading to irrelevant responses.
5.  **"Threshold Abandonment"**: Correctly identifying reasons in the mind but failing to translate them into written English, leading to an empty or fragmented response.

Step 3: Target Student Population
1.  **Open-Ended Recall**: Requires higher cognitive load than multiple-choice.
2.  **English Proficiency**: For Hindi-medium/EWS students, the shift from conceptual understanding to English production is a significant "bottleneck."
3.  **Instructional Context**: Many students in this demographic are taught via rote memorization; an application question requiring synthesis ("How does it help the community") is often not practiced.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
The rubric demands "two distinct and plausible reasons" for only 1 mark. While the concept is intuitive, the linguistic demand of the multi-part question—combined with the "distinctness" requirement—presents a high probability of students triggering the "One-for-All" bug or the "Language Processing" bug. In EWS/Hindi-medium contexts, the gap between "knowing the answer" and "writing it in English" is wide.
