Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Draw a straight initial ray using a ruler.
2. Align the protractor’s midpoint (vertex) exactly with the endpoint of the ray.
3. Align the 0° line (baseline) of the protractor perfectly over the ray.
4. Select the correct scale (inner vs. outer) based on the direction of the ray.
5. Identify the tick mark for the specific value (e.g., 110° or 40°).
6. Mark a point at the correct measurement.
7. Remove the protractor and use a ruler to connect the vertex to the marked point.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- Scale Confusion Bug: Choosing the supplementary angle (e.g., drawing 70° instead of 110°, or 140° instead of 40°) by reading the wrong scale.
- Baseline Offset Bug: Aligning the bottom edge of the plastic protractor with the ray instead of the actual 0° line.
- Vertex Displacement Bug: Placing the protractor center at a random point on the line rather than the endpoint.
- Parallax/Precision Bug: Miscounting the small tick marks or shifting the tool while drawing the second ray.
- Directionality Bug: Always reading from the left regardless of where the vertex is placed.

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 6 students in this demographic often face "language-math" interference where the English instruction "Use a protractor" may be understood, but the conceptual distinction between acute and obtuse angles is not yet solidified as a self-checking mechanism. In an open-ended format (drawing), there are no distractors to prompt a rethink; once a "buggy" angle is drawn, the student typically considers the task complete. The 110° angle is particularly "buggy" because it requires navigating past the 90° mark, where scale confusion is most prevalent.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the cumulative nature of the steps and the high frequency of the Scale Confusion Bug (estimated in literature to affect 30-50% of novice learners), combined with mechanical alignment errors common in middle school, the success rate for a perfect drawing is often lower than educators expect.
