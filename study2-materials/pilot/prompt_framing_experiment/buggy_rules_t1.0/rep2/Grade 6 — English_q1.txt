Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English question (syntax/semantics) to identify the "Wh-" target (Where) and the object (old book).
2. Scan the provided English text (reading comprehension) to locate the keyword "book" or "found".
3. Map the spatial prepositional phrase in the text ("in the attic") to the question's requirement.
4. Extract the specific noun/phrase from the text.
5. Formulate an English response (ranging from a single word to a full sentence).

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. **Keyword Matching Bug**: Searching for the word "Where" in the text instead of identifying the location.
2. **First-Noun Strategy**: Selecting the first proper noun or location mentioned in the text regardless of context (e.g., "in the house" or "at school").
3. **Pronoun-Antecedent Mismatch**: If the text says "I found it in the attic," the student may fail to map "I" to "she" or "it" to "the old book."
4. **Copying Error (Linguistic Transfer)**: Correctly identifying the location in Hindi mentally but being unable to translate "attic" or transcribe it correctly from the text.
5. **Wh-Confusion**: Treating "Where" as "When" or "What," leading to an answer like "yesterday" or "a book."

Step 3: Target Population Analysis
Grade 6 students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often face a "threshold effect" in English. While "attic" is a specific Tier 3 vocabulary word in this context, it is likely unfamiliar in daily life. In open-ended recall tasks, students lack the scaffolding of multiple-choice options. The requirement to produce English text—even a single word—acts as a significant barrier for students who primarily operate in a second language environment with limited literacy support at home.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Considering the specific vocabulary ("attic"), the linguistic shift from Hindi to English, and the systematic errors in "Wh-" question processing for second-language learners:
