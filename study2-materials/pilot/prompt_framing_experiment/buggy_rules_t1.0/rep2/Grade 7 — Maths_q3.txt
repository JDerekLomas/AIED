Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall the specific formula for the area of a triangle ($A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$).
2. Substitute the values (8 and 6) into the formula.
3. Perform the multiplication of the base and height ($8 \times 6 = 48$).
4. Apply the fractional operator ($\frac{1}{2}$) by dividing the product by 2 or multiplying by 0.5.
5. Provide the final numerical value (24).

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- **The Rectangle Bug:** Calculating $Area = b \times h$ and forgetting the $\frac{1}{2}$ (extremely common in early geometry).
- **The Perimeter Bug:** Adding the numbers ($8 + 6$ or $8+8+6+6$) instead of multiplying.
- **Operator Misinterpretation:** Treating the $\frac{1}{2}$ as a term to be added rather than a coefficient.
- **Arithmetic slips:** Errors in basic multiplication facts (e.g., $8 \times 6 = 42$).

Step 3: Population Considerations
- **Recall vs. Recognition:** This is an open-ended question. In low-stakes Indian government school contexts, formula recall is often lower than in multiple-choice settings.
- **Language Barrier:** While "base" and "height" are standard, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle if they haven't internalized the English terminology (*aadhar* for base, *unchai* for height).
- **Conceptual Confusion:** Grade 7 students often conflate area and perimeter formulas or use the triangle/parallelogram/rectangle formulas interchangeably.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
Given the high prevalence of "The Rectangle Bug" (forgetting the half) and the requirement to recall the formula from memory without a scaffold, a significant portion of the cohort will likely provide "48" or a perimeter-based sum.
