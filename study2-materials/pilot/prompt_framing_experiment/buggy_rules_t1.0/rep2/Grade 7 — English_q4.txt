Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the English text of the question.
2. Recall/Retrieve the three specific questions from the text (The Three Questions by Leo Tolstoy).
3. Evaluate the abstract concept of "importance" in a real-world context (metacognition).
4. Formulate an opinion ("Yes" or "No").
5. Construct a logical "reason" (causal link) in English.
6. Translate internal thoughts from Hindi/L1 to English using correct syntax (Subject-Verb-Object).

Step 2: Buggy rules:
1. "Literalism Bug": Providing the king's questions as the answer instead of explaining why they are important.
2. "Binary Response Bug": Answering only "Yes" or "No" and omitting the "reason" step.
3. "Translation Syntax Bug": Using Hindi sentence structure with English words (e.g., "King questions important because life success happen").
4. "Surface Feature Bug": Copying a random sentence from the provided passage that contains the word "important" or "question" regardless of context.
5. "Vocabulary Constraint Bug": Knowing the reason in L1 but being unable to retrieve the English labels for "prioritization," "circumstances," or "consequences."

Step 3: Population considerations:
Grade 7 students in this demographic often struggle with open-ended "Why" questions in a second language. While they may understand the story's moral (the present moment is most important), the cognitive load of simultaneous retrieval, evaluation, and L2 production is high. Without a word bank or sentence starters, many will leave it blank or provide a fragmentary response that fails the rubric's "valid reason" requirement.

Step 4: Holistic estimate:
Given the shift from recognition to production and the requirement for a logical justification in a second language:
