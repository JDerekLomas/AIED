Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the English text (linking "stunted growth/yellowing" to "nutrient deficiency").
2. Retrieve specific scientific concepts (NPK) from long-term memory.
3. Formulate a causal link: Deficiency → Addition of external substances.
4. Express the solution in written English, ensuring "fertilizer/manure" and a specific nutrient are mentioned as per the rubric.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. Semantic Overgeneralization: Using a general term like "medicine" or "water" instead of "fertilizer" because they are perceived as "plant healers."
2. The "List Everything" Bug: Listing every farming practice they know (ploughing, irrigation, harvesting) without isolating the specific intervention for deficiency.
3. Language-Switch Interference: Knowing the concept in Hindi (खाद/Khād) but being unable to recall or spell the English equivalents (Fertilizer/Manure/Potassium).
4. Keyword Matching Error: Seeing "farmer" and "soil" and defaulting to "add water" (irrigation) because it is the most common association in their experiential schema.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Recall vs. Recognition: This is an open-ended recall task, which is significantly harder than a multiple-choice question for students with low English literacy.
2. Abstract vs. Concrete: While the scenario is concrete, "Nitrogen/Phosphorus/Potassium" are abstract chemical terms that often lack local context in vernacular farming discourse.
3. Rubric Rigidity: The requirement to mention a specific nutrient (N, P, or K) is a high-threshold hurdle for students who might only reach the "add fertilizer" step.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Considering the specific requirement of naming a nutrient (NPK) in English, many students will provide a partially correct but "incomplete" answer according to the rubric, leading to a loss of the single mark.
