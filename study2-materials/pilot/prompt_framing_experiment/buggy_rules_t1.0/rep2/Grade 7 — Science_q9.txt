Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Reading and comprehension: Decode the English-language prompt ("pitcher plant," "trap-like structure," "mode of nutrition").
2. Scientific classification: Recall the specific term "insectivorous" or "heterotrophic/partial heterotrophic" from memory (Recall vs. Recognition).
3. Biological reasoning: Connect the lack of nitrogen in soil to the need for insect consumption despite the presence of chlorophyll.
4. Semantic retrieval: Recall a secondary example (e.g., Venus flytrap, Sundew).
5. Linguistic production: Encode the scientific concept into a written English sentence.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. Over-generalization of "Photosynthesis": Students often believe if a plant is green, it is purely autotrophic and cannot have another mode of nutrition (Binary classification bug).
2. Category Error: Identifying the *part* (leaves) or the *action* (eating) instead of the *mode* (insectivorous).
3. Phonetic/Orthographic Bug: Common misspelling or misuse of "insectivorous," often confusing it with "insecticide" or simply writing "insects."
4. Language Interference: Substituting the Hindi term (Ghatparni/कीटभक्षी) because the English term "Insectivorous" is high-syllable and phonetically complex for English Language Learners (ELL).

Step 3: Target population considerations
- Grade 7 is the transition point for abstract biological classification.
- Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with "Mode of nutrition" as a phrase, frequently mistaking it for "How does it eat?"
- Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice for this demographic due to the "bottleneck" of English writing proficiency.
- The rubric is strict: it requires the specific identification of "insectivorous."

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is taught, the combination of English-language production, the specific technical vocabulary required for a "correct" rubric match, and the "Green = Autotroph" cognitive bias suggests a high error rate.
