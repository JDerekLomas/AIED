Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Sentence Parsing:** Identify "We" as the subject and "ran" as the verb.
2.  **Lexical Analysis:** Recognize the word "around" and its spatial/directional meaning.
3.  **Syntactic Mapping:** Determine that "around" modifies the verb "ran" (indicating direction/path) rather than introducing a noun phrase (prepositional use).
4.  **Taxonomic Retrieval:** Access the technical grammatical category "adverb" from long-term memory.
5.  **Orthographic Encoding:** Correcting spelling the English word "adverb" (crucial for open-ended formats).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1.  **The "Preposition Bias" Bug:** Students often memorize "around" exclusively as a preposition because it is frequently taught in lists of spatial prepositions (over, under, around).
2.  **The "Noun-Follower" Bug:** If a student lacks a noun after "around," they may guess "adjective" because they associate any word following a verb with a description of an object.
3.  **The "-ly" Dependency Bug:** A common heuristic where students believe an adverb *must* end in "-ly." Since "around" does not, they reject the correct category.
4.  **The "Hindi-English Mapping" Bug:** In Hindi, spatial markers (postpositions) function differently. Students may struggle to translate the functional category into English grammatical terminology.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students from economically weaker sections often face "limited English proficiency" gaps where technical metalanguage (parts of speech) is taught via rote memorization rather than functional usage. In an open-ended format without options (no multiple choice), the cognitive load shifts from recognition to pure recall, which significantly increases the failure rate. Spelling "adverb" correctly is also a hurdle for students with low English exposure.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the "Preposition Bias" (the most common error for this specific word) and the requirement for active recall/spelling in a second language, the majority of students will either misidentify the category or leave it blank.
