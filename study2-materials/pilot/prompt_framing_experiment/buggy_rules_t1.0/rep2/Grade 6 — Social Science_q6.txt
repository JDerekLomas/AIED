Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall the distinct definition of "archaeological" (physical/material) vs. "literary" (written/texts).
2. Synthesize a "differentiation" statement (recognizing the contrast between physical remains and written records).
3. Translate abstract concepts into English (or navigate the bilingual barrier if the paper is in English).
4. Retrieve a specific, valid example for archaeological sources.
5. Retrieve a specific, valid example for literary sources.
6. Coordinate all four components (Definition A, Definition B, Example A, Example B) within the constraint of a single-mark rubric that likely requires all parts for the point.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. Category Collapse: Defining both as "things from the past" without the physical/written distinction.
2. Example-as-Definition: Providing an example (e.g., "coins") in place of a functional definition.
3. Label Swapping: Reversing the definitions of archaeological and literary.
4. Language Interference: Using Hindi terms (e.g., *puralekh* vs *sahityik*) correctly in mind but failing to map them to the English terms provided in the prompt.
5. Incomplete Execution: Providing definitions but forgetting examples, or vice versa, due to the high cognitive load of the multi-part prompt.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Grade 6 is the transition year where students move from general "Environmental Studies" to specific "Social Science," making these technical terms relatively new.
2. Limited English proficiency often leads students to leave open-ended "Differentiate" questions blank, as they cannot construct the required syntax even if they understand the concept.
3. The rubric is "all or nothing" for 1 mark, meaning a minor slip in one of the four components results in a score of 0.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement for four distinct pieces of information (two definitions and two examples) to be delivered in a second language with precise categorization, the "buggy" potential is high.
