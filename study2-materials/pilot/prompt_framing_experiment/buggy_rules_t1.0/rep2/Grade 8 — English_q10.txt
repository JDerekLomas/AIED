Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Identify the adjective/adverb that follows the intensifier ("weak").
2. Replace the intensifier ("very") with the adverb "too".
3. Identify the infinitive action in the second sentence ("walk").
4. Delete the subject and the modal negative ("He cannot") from the second sentence.
5. Insert the particle "to" before the base form of the verb.
6. Synthesize the two clauses into a single simple sentence without repeating the subject.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. **"Double Negative Bug"**: Including "not" in the final sentence because it was in the prompt (e.g., "He is too weak to not walk").
2. **"Tautology/Redundancy Bug"**: Retaining the intensifier (e.g., "He is too very weak to walk").
3. **"Pronoun Retention Bug"**: Failing to delete the second subject (e.g., "He is too weak he to walk").
4. **"Orthographic Confusion"**: Confusing "too" with "to" or "two" (e.g., "He is to weak too walk").
5. **"Connector Bug"**: Using "that" instead of "to" (e.g., "He is too weak that walk").

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students in this context often treat English as a set of memorized patterns rather than a fluid language. The transition from "So...that...not" to "too...to" is a common source of interference. Limited English proficiency increases the likelihood of "surface-level" copying (keeping the "cannot") because the student may not fully grasp that "too" inherently carries a negative affordance in this construction.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
The requirement to synthesize two sentences into one is a high-order transformation task compared to simple substitution. For students with limited English exposure, managing the deletion of the modal "cannot" while correctly placing "too" and "to" presents multiple points of failure.
