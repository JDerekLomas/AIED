Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English text to understand that the question asks for multiple occupations in a specific geographic context (Rajasthan/Rural).
2. Retrieve relevant schema from memory regarding the economy of Rajasthan (identifying Agriculture and Animal Husbandry as primary).
3. Select two distinct occupations to meet the rubric's "main occupations" requirement.
4. Select one of the two and retrieve descriptive details (e.g., types of crops or animals reared).
5. Translate thoughts from Hindi/Mother tongue into an English written response.
6. Manage the "quantity constraint": Ensure the response includes a list *and* a description within the 1-mark constraint.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. **The "Single-Answer" Bug**: Students often provide only one answer for a multi-part question, failing to recognize the plural "occupations" or the second instruction ("Describe one").
2. **The "Recognition-Recall Gap"**: Students may recognize these terms in a textbook but fail to recall the specific English terminology (e.g., writing "Kheti" instead of "Agriculture").
3. **The "Description-Omission" Bug**: Students often list items but skip the "describe in brief" step, assuming the list is sufficient for a 1-mark question.
4. **Contextual Generalization Bug**: Students may list urban occupations (e.g., "factory work") because they are familiar with their parents' migrant labor, ignoring the "rural" constraint.

Step 3: Population Considerations
7th-grade students from economically weaker sections often face a "double burden": limited English vocabulary for technical terms (Agriculture/Husbandry) and a tendency to prioritize brevity. While the content is culturally relevant, the requirement to *describe in brief* in English is a significant hurdle for students who may have the conceptual knowledge in Hindi but lack the expressive fluency to execute a two-part written instruction correctly.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that the rubric requires *two* occupations plus a description for only 1 mark, many students will provide a partial answer (only listing or only naming one), which results in a zero or half-mark depending on strictness.
