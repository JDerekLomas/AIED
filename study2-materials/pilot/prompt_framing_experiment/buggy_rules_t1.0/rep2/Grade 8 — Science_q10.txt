Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Recall the definition of pasteurization as a thermal treatment.
2. Identify the specific heating phase (high temperature/70°C).
3. Identify the temporal constraint (short duration/15–30s).
4. Identify the critical cooling phase (sudden/rapid cooling).
5. Synthesize these steps into a coherent "process."
6. Explain the functional purpose (killing microbes/prevention of spoilage).
7. Translate these conceptual steps into English sentences.

Step 2: Buggy rules:
- **The "Boiling" Bug:** Equating pasteurization with simple boiling (heating until it bubbles) rather than a controlled thermal cycle.
- **The "Incomplete Cycle" Bug:** Omitting the rapid cooling step, focusing only on the heat.
- **The "Static Temperature" Bug:** Recalling that heat is involved but failing to specify it is for a "short time," leading to a description of sterilization or cooking.
- **The "Vocabulary Substitution" Bug:** Using "cleaning" or "purifying" instead of "preserving" or "killing bacteria."
- **Linguistic Interference (Hinglish/Transliteration):** Difficulty articulating the sequence "heated then cooled" in English, leading to fragmented or logically reversed sentences.

Step 3: Population considerations:
Grade 8 students in this demographic face a "double burden": they must recall a multi-step scientific process (recall > recognition) and output it in a non-native language (English). While the rubric is lenient regarding specific numbers (70°C/15s), the student must still capture the *sequence* of heating and rapid cooling. In low-resource settings, rote memorization of the definition is common, but the requirement to "describe the process" in an open-ended format often leads to the omission of the cooling phase or the temporal element.
