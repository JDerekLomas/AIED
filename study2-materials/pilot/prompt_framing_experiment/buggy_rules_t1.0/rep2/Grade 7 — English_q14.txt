Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the written English prompt ("Write the antonym...") and map the meta-language term "antonym" to the concept of "opposite word."
2. Read and decode the target word "ancient" phonetically or orthographically.
3. Access the semantic network to retrieve the meaning of "ancient" (likely mapping it to the Hindi concept of *Prachin*).
4. Search the English mental lexicon for a word that represents the semantic inverse (Modern/New).
5. Execute the orthographic production (spelling) of the retrieved word correctly.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. **Semantic Field Bug:** Providing a synonym instead of an antonym (e.g., writing "old" because the words are strongly associated in the same semantic cluster).
2. **Translation-Retrieval Bug:** Translating "ancient" to Hindi correctly (*Prachin*), finding the Hindi opposite (*Adhunik*), but failing to retrieve the English equivalent.
3. **Phonetic Encoding Bug:** Retrieving the correct word "Modern" but spelling it phonetically based on local dialect (e.g., "modren").
4. **Keyword Association Bug:** Focusing only on the word "ancient" and ignoring the instruction "antonym," leading to a definition rather than an opposite.

Step 3: Population Considerations
In Grade 7 Indian government school contexts, "ancient" is frequently encountered in History textbooks but rarely in spoken English. While the concept is known, the productive recall (writing) is significantly harder than receptive recognition (multiple choice). Limited English proficiency increases the likelihood of "synonym-for-antonym" errors and spelling failures.
