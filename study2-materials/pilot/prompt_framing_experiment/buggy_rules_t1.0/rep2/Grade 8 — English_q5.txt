Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English prompt and identify the specific poem "The Last Bargain" from memory.
2. Retrieve the narrative arc of the poem (the speaker's encounters with the King, the Rich Man, and the Fair Maid).
3. Perform an abstraction transition: move from the concrete plot (events) to the abstract theme (intrinsic value vs. material value).
4. Synthesize the concept of "freedom" or "spiritual satisfaction" as the ultimate prize.
5. Formulate a sentence in English that grammatically links these abstract nouns (power, wealth, beauty) to their failure to provide happiness.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" (Cognitive/Linguistic)
1. **Plot-for-Theme Bug:** Replacing an abstract theme with a literal summary of the plot (e.g., "The man meets a child on the beach").
2. **Key-Word Association Bug:** Identifying a single word from the poem ("gold" or "power") but failing to articulate its relationship to the theme (e.g., writing "The theme is power").
3. **Linguistic Translation Bug:** Mentally identifying the theme in Hindi (e.g., "Azaadi" or "Khushi") but failing to find the English equivalents, leading to an empty or fragmented response.
4. **The "Bargain" Literalism:** Interpreting "bargain" only in a commercial sense rather than a metaphorical one.

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often struggle with the transition from literal comprehension to inferential reasoning. Given the open-ended nature of the question (no options to trigger recognition), students must rely entirely on recall and English production. Limited English proficiency significantly increases the "friction" between understanding the poem's message and articulating it in a way that satisfies a rubric requiring specific abstract concepts.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the poem is a standard part of the NCERT curriculum, the combination of high linguistic demand (writing in English) and high cognitive demand (abstraction) suggests a low success rate for a "fully correct" response meeting all rubric criteria.
