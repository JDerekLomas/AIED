Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the term "ruminant" and "digestive system" in English.
2. Retrieve the biological fact regarding the specific anatomy of a ruminant (four-chambered stomach/rumen).
3. Connect the anatomical difference to the dietary component (cellulose/grass) as requested by the second part of the prompt.
4. Translate the internal conceptual model (likely held in Hindi/local language) into a coherent English sentence.
5. Filter out irrelevant differences (e.g., "cows have teeth," "humans eat cooked food") to meet the specific rubric requirement.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. **The "Surface Feature" Bug:** Students focus on the act of eating (chewing) rather than the internal system (e.g., "Cows eat grass, humans eat dal").
2. **The "Size" Bug:** Attributing differences to the size of the animal or the quantity of food rather than the structural complexity.
3. **The "Language Substitution" Bug:** Using the Hindi word for stomach ("pet") or a generic "big stomach" which may not meet the technical requirement of "special/multiple sections."
4. **The "Single-Focus" Bug:** Answering why they are different but forgetting the second constraint (mentioning a diet-related difference).

Step 3: Student Population Factors
Grade 7 students in this demographic often face a "threshold effect" where they understand the concept (cows chew cud/have a rumen) but cannot retrieve the specific English vocabulary under the pressure of an open-ended recall task. The transition from Hindi-medium to English terminology (e.g., "cellulose" or "rumen") is a significant barrier.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While the concept is a core part of the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum, the combination of a two-part open-ended question, technical English vocabulary, and the need to specify *internal* anatomy rather than external behavior suggests a high error rate. Many students will provide a correct biological observation (diet) but fail to link it to the specific structural difference (multiple stomachs) required by the rubric.
