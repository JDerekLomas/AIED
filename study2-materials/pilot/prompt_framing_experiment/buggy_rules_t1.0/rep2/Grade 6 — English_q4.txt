Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the target phrase "shining brightly" (Semantic input).
2. Scan the provided passage text to identify candidate words that match the semantic category of "light" or "intensity."
3. Evaluate candidates against the target phrase to ensure synonymy.
4. Verify that the chosen word exists verbatim in the text (constraint satisfaction).
5. Transcribe the word "glowing" accurately onto the answer sheet.

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules" (Systematic procedural errors)
1. **The Contextual Match Bug**: Students select a word from the passage that appears near a light-related object (e.g., "sun," "lamp") rather than the word that means the action/adjective itself.
2. **The Partial Synonym Bug**: Students select any familiar adjective from the text regardless of meaning (e.g., "beautiful," "big") because they equate "finding a word" with "finding an adjective."
3. **The External Knowledge Bug**: Students provide a synonym they already know (e.g., "bright," "sunny," "star") that is not actually present in the provided passage.
4. **The "First Match" Heuristic**: Students stop scanning after the first word that relates to the general topic of the passage, failing to reach the specific word "glowing."
5. **The Transcription Bug**: Students understand the word but misspell it, or drop the "-ing" suffix, failing the rubric's strict requirement.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Language Barrier**: For ESL learners in Grade 6, "shining" and "brightly" are core vocabulary, but "glowing" is a tier-2 vocabulary word that may not be in their active or passive lexicon.
2. **Open-Ended Format**: Without a word bank (recognition), the student must perform a high-stakes search (recall/identification), which significantly increases cognitive load compared to multiple-choice.
3. **Medium of Instruction**: Students transitioning from Hindi-medium often struggle with nuance in English suffixes (-ing vs -ly), potentially leading them to pick the wrong part of speech.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account the necessity of knowing the specific word "glowing" and the rigorous requirement to find it within a text under English-as-a-second-language conditions:
