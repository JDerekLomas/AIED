Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Decoding: Decode the English sentence structure to identify the target period (Vedic) and the target information (main occupation).
2. Knowledge Retrieval: Access the specific historical fact from long-term memory (Pastoralism/Agriculture).
3. Evaluative Selection: Determine which occupation was "main" (Early vs. Later Vedic distinction often causes interference).
4. Procedural Composition: Formulate an English sentence that describes a "key aspect" (e.g., importance of cows or seasonal crops).
5. Linguistic Encoding: Translate the internalized Hindi concept into the required English academic vocabulary.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. The "Single-Answer Bug": If a question asks for "Occupation + Aspect," the student provides only the one-word occupation and stops, assuming the task is complete once the "answer" is found.
2. The "Modern-Lens Bug": Students project contemporary reality onto the past (e.g., answering "Service/Jobs" or "Trading" because that is what "occupation" means in their current environment).
3. The "Key Aspect Confusion": Misinterpreting "aspect" as "tool" or "reason," leading to answers like "Because they liked cows."
4. The "Language-Switch Block": The student knows the answer in Hindi (Pashupalan/Krishi) but cannot retrieve the specific English Tier-3 vocabulary (Pastoralism/Husbandry).

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 is a transitional year where students move from concrete to abstract social science concepts. For students from economically weaker sections in Hindi-medium transitions, the cognitive load of simultaneous translation and historical recall is high. Open-ended "Describe" prompts are significantly more difficult than multiple-choice for this demographic due to the "blank page" effect and fear of grammatical error.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While many students will know the answer is "farming" or "cows," the requirement to "Describe one key aspect" in English acts as a significant barrier. Many will lose the 1-mark credit by providing a one-word answer or failing to articulate the "aspect" clearly enough to meet rubric standards in a second language.
