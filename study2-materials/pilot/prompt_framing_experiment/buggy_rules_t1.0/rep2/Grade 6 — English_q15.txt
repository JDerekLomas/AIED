Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Identify a specific person and retrieve descriptive attributes (name, traits, or actions).
2. Lexical Mapping (L1 to L2): Translate these concepts from Hindi (L1) to English (L2) vocabulary.
3. Syntactic Construction (Subject-Verb-Object): Arrange words into a standard English sentence structure (e.g., "My friend is [Name]").
4. Morphological Application: Apply correct subject-verb agreement (e.g., "He play" vs. "He plays").
5. Orthographic Execution: Apply capitalization and punctuation (full stops) to demarcate two distinct sentences.
6. Quantitative Compliance: Ensure exactly two (or more) sentences are produced to satisfy the prompt.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. Subject-Drop Bug: Omitting the subject pronoun because Hindi allows for null-subjects in context (e.g., "Is very good boy").
2. COP-Deletion Bug: Omitting the auxiliary/copula "is" (e.g., "He my best friend").
3. L1 Word Order Bug: Following Hindi syntax (Subject-Object-Verb) instead of English (e.g., "He Rahul is").
4. Spelling Phonetics Bug: Spelling English words based on Hindi phonetic rules or local pronunciation.
5. Run-on/Fragment Bug: Writing a single long string of words without a full stop, failing the "two sentences" requirement.

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 6 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds often face a "threshold effect." While they have the mental concept, the cognitive load of simultaneous translation and grammatical monitoring is high. In an open-ended format (recall), students cannot rely on context clues found in multiple-choice questions. The rubric is "all or nothing" (1 mark), meaning a single grammatical bug (common at this level) results in a score of 0.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that the rubric requires *both* sentences to be "grammatically correct," the likelihood of a student avoiding all common "bugs" (especially subject-verb agreement and the copula) is low in this specific demographic.
