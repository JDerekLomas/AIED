Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English syntax of the question ("Name one major factor...") to understand the requirement is for a single noun or noun phrase.
2. Access the long-term memory schema for "Geography: Resources/Soil."
3. Distinguish between "Soil Formation" and "Soil Conservation" or "Soil Erosion" (categories often conflated in this curriculum).
4. Select one valid factor from the five-factor model (Parent Rock, Climate, Relief, Time, Flora/Fauna).
5. Translate the retrieved concept from the student's primary language (Hindi) into the required English term.
6. Transcribe the term onto the answer sheet with legible spelling.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. Category Conflation: Providing an answer related to soil (e.g., "Mulching," "Shelterbelts," "Deforestation") because the student retrieves the "Soil" chapter but cannot discriminate between "Formation" and "Conservation."
2. The "Keyword Association" Bug: Students see "Soil" and write "Agriculture," "Fertilizer," or "Water," associating common environmental terms rather than scientific factors.
3. Language Encoding Bug: The student knows the concept in Hindi (e.g., *Jalwayu*) but cannot retrieve the English equivalent (*Climate*), leading to a blank answer or a phonetic misspelling that may not be recognized.
4. The "Single-Factor Dominance" Bug: Over-reliance on "Water" or "Air" as factors for everything in nature, failing to use the specific geographic terminology required by the rubric.

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often rely on rote memorization (ratta) of textbooks. In open-ended recall tasks without options (as opposed to MCQ), the lack of recognition cues significantly increases the "retrieval failure" rate. The English barrier serves as a high-pass filter; even if the student understands the science, the production of the specific English term acts as a bottleneck.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
While the concept is foundational, the combination of linguistic translation hurdles, the high probability of conflating "formation" with "conservation" (a very common systematic error in Indian Social Science assessments), and the requirement for active recall suggests a significant portion of the population will struggle to provide a rubric-valid English term.
