Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic decoding: Translate the English prompt into the mental model of "money/coins/notes."
2. Retrieval (Iconic): Access the visual memory of the Lion Capital on currency.
3. Retrieval (Historical/Civic): Connect the visual image to the specific name "Ashoka" and the object "Lion Capital" (Sarnath).
4. Categorization: Identify the symbol's status as the "National Emblem."
5. Synthesis/Output: Construct a written sentence in English or functional Hinglish connecting these three domains (Currency -> Ashoka -> Emblem).

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. "Literalism Bug": Providing a functional/biological reason instead of a symbolic one (e.g., "Because lions are strong/brave" or "To show India has lions").
2. "Labeling Bug": Misidentifying the historical figure (attributing the lions to Gandhi because his face is also on the note, or to Akbar/Shivaji).
3. "Terminological Swap": Recognizing the symbol but lacking the specific English vocabulary "National Emblem" or "Lion Capital," leading to vague descriptions like "government symbol."
4. "Format Slip": Identifying only one component (e.g., "Ashoka") while omitting the required categorical definition (Emblem) requested by "Why" (significance).

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students in this demographic are often transitioning from rote memorization in Hindi to structured writing in English. While the Lion Capital is a standard "GK" (General Knowledge) fact, the open-ended "Why" requires retrieving specific nomenclature (Ashoka, Sarnath, Emblem) rather than just recognizing it in a multiple-choice format. Limited English proficiency often leads to "blank page syndrome" where the student knows the fact but cannot formulate the English sentence required for the 1-mark rubric.
