Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Identify the relationship between 100° and $y$ (linear pair/supplementary angles).
2. Calculate $y = 180° - 100° = 80°$.
3. Identify the relationship between angle $x$ and the 80° interior angle (alternate interior angles, assuming parallel lines which is standard in such Grade 8 textbook diagrams) or use the exterior angle property ($100° = x + \text{int. angle}$ if applicable).
4. State the geometric reason (e.g., "Linear pair" or "Alternate interior angles").
5. Execute two-step arithmetic without calculation errors.

Step 2: Common "buggy rules":
- **Equality Bias:** Assuming $y = 100°$ because they look similar or "angles are always equal" in geometry problems.
- **Complementary vs. Supplementary:** Subtracting from 90° instead of 180°.
- **Visual Guessing:** Estimating based on appearance rather than applying theorems.
- **Language Barrier:** Inability to articulate the "reason" in English, leading to a loss of marks per the rubric requirements.

Step 3: Population considerations:
- Grade 8 is a transition point where abstract reasoning is developing, but English proficiency in Hindi-medium backgrounds often creates a "knowledge-expression gap."
- Open-ended formats (recall) typically yield 20-30% lower success rates than multiple-choice (recognition) for this demographic.
- The requirement to state a "reason" is a high-hurdle step for students with limited English vocabulary.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While the calculation is basic, the combination of multi-step logic, the linguistic demand of stating reasons, and the high prevalence of "Equality Bias" in Indian Grade 8 geometry suggests a high failure rate.
