Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of the question in English (a language of instruction often different from the home language).
2. Scan the provided table to identify the "Expansion" column.
3. Perform a numerical comparison across the rows to find the maximum value.
4. Map that value back to the corresponding "Material" name in the first column.
5. Ignore the irrelevant distractors (parts b and c) which are not part of the scoring rubric but may cause cognitive load or confusion.
6. Write the specific name "Aluminium" correctly.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- "First-Row Bias": Selecting the first material in the table regardless of the value.
- "Last-Row Bias": Assuming the final entry is the "answer" or total.
- "Column Misalignment": Reading the value from one column (e.g., density or melting point if present) but attributing it to expansion.
- "Language Interference": Misinterpreting "most" as "least" or "best" due to limited English vocabulary.
- "Contextual Over-incorporation": Attempting to answer (b) or (c) within the space for (a) because they seem more "scientific" than simple table reading.

Step 3: Population Considerations
For Grade 8 students from low-SES, Hindi-medium backgrounds, the primary barriers are English literacy and "test-wiseness." While the mathematical task (comparing 3-4 numbers) is Grade 3 level, the linguistic packaging in an English-medium science assessment often acts as a gatekeeper. Furthermore, the presence of three sub-questions (a, b, and c) with a rubric that only awards 1 mark for (a) suggests a high risk of "fragmented completion," where a student might answer (b) correctly (a common rote-learned fact in Indian schools) but fail to extract the specific data for (a).

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the data extraction is simple, the linguistic barrier and the misalignment between the multi-part question and the binary rubric will likely lead to many students providing incomplete or misdirected responses.
