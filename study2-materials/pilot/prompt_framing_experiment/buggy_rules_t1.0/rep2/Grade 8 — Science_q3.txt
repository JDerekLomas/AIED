Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English text to identify the core scientific query (beating metal into thin sheets).
2. Retrieve the specific technical term associated with this physical property from long-term memory.
3. Distinguish between similar-sounding or related concepts (e.g., ductility, conductivity, sonority).
4. Map the retrieved concept to the correct English technical term ("Malleability").
5. Execute the orthographic spelling of the term correctly.

Step 2: Common "buggy rules" / systematic errors
1. **Linguistic Interference (Translation Error):** Students may know the concept in Hindi (*Aaghaatvardhaniyata*) but cannot retrieve the English equivalent due to limited proficiency.
2. **Concept Confusion (Category Error):** Systematically substituting "Ductility" (drawing into wires) for "Malleability" because both are mechanical properties of metals taught in the same lesson.
3. **Phonetic Spelling Bug:** Writing "Maliability," "Maleablity," or "Mallable" which, depending on the strictness of the rubric, may be marked incorrect in an open-ended format.
4. **Generalization Bug:** Using a more general term like "Flexibility" or "Softness" instead of the specific scientific terminology required.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face a "language-content gap." While they likely use aluminum foil and understand the physical phenomenon, the transition from intuitive understanding to formal English academic language is a high hurdle. An open-ended recall question is significantly harder than a multiple-choice question for this group.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account the specific difficulty of the word "Malleability" (a complex, multi-syllabic Latinate word) and the high likelihood of confusion with "Ductility," many students will fail at the retrieval or spelling stage even if they understand the science.
