Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English prompt and identify "colonial rule/British" and "tribal" as the core subjects.
2. Recall specific historical facts regarding the Forest Acts, shifting cultivation, or the role of tribal chiefs under British rule.
3. Synthesize "general impact" (disruption/loss of control) from specific facts.
4. Select and articulate two distinct examples (e.g., loss of forest rights, forced labor, or transition to settled agriculture).
5. Transcribe these thoughts into coherent English or a mix of English/academic keywords that satisfy the rubric.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules"
- Key-word matching bug: Students see "British rule" and provide a general answer about the independence movement or "freedom fighters" rather than specifically addressing "tribals."
- Generalization bug: Providing two examples that are conceptually identical (e.g., "they took forest" and "they took trees") failing the "distinct examples" requirement.
- Concept-substitution bug: Confusing "tribals" with "farmers/peasants" generally, leading to answers about the Zamindari system which may not earn the specific credit for tribal impact.
- Language-barrier bug: Knowing the concept in Hindi (e.g., *Adivasi*, *Van Adhiniyam*) but being unable to retrieve the English terminology required to explain "economic exploitation" or "traditional way of life."

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students from economically weaker sections often face a "literacy gap" where their conceptual understanding exceeds their expressive English capability. The open-ended nature of the question requires high-level retrieval (recall) rather than recognition. The requirement for "two distinct examples" for only 1 mark is a high cognitive load for the reward offered.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the transition from rote memorization to descriptive explanation, the language barrier for Hindi-medium students, and the specific requirement for "distinct" examples, many students will provide partially correct but technically incomplete answers.
