Step 1: Specific Procedural Steps
1. Pattern Recognition: Identify $9/16$ as the common factor across two terms.
2. Factoring (Distributive Property): Rewrite the expression as $(9/16) \times [4/12 + (-3/9)]$.
3. Integer/Rational Addition: Add the fractions inside the bracket, requiring a common denominator and handling the negative sign (subtraction).
4. Simplification: Reduce internal fractions ($4/12 \to 1/3$ and $-3/9 \to -1/3$) to simplify calculations.
5. Final Multiplication: Multiply the common factor by the result of the bracketed sum.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- Structural Bug: Distributing the $9/16$ only to the first term or failing to recognize the shared factor.
- Fraction Bug: Adding numerators and denominators directly ($4/12 + (-3/9) = 1/21$).
- Sign Bug: Ignoring the negative sign in $(-3/9)$, treating it as addition.
- Cancellation Bug: Attempting to "cross-cancel" across the addition sign before factoring.
- Property Misidentification: Using "BODMAS" to solve the terms individually instead of using the distributive property as instructed (though this may yield the correct answer, it risks failing the specific rubric requirement in some contexts).

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 8 students in this demographic often struggle with rational numbers and negative integers.
- The instruction "Using distributive property" is a high-level cognitive prompt; students often ignore the "method" constraint and try to calculate directly, increasing the surface area for arithmetic errors.
- Limited English proficiency may lead to a lack of "mathematical register," where the term "distributive property" is not mapped to the action of factoring out.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
The problem requires a "perfect" chain of logic: recognizing the pattern, handling signs, finding common denominators, and final multiplication. For a student in an under-resourced setting, the transition from arithmetic to algebraic properties (factoring) is a significant hurdle. Even if they understand the property, the negative fraction adds a high probability of a "buggy" execution.
