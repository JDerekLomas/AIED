Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. **Recognition of the additive inverse/transposition principle**: Identifying that to isolate `y`, `9` must be moved to the other side of the equation or subtracted from both sides.
2. **Execution of the sign change**: Correcting the sign from positive to negative during transposition (`y = 4 - 9`).
3. **Subtraction with a larger subtrahend**: Managing the subtraction where the absolute value of the number being subtracted is greater than the starting value.
4. **Integer arithmetic**: Correctly assigning the negative sign to the result (`-5`).

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- **"Always Subtract Smaller from Larger"**: The student calculates `9 - 4` and concludes `y = 5`, ignoring the negative sign requirement (extremely common in middle school).
- **"Sign Ignoring Transposition"**: Moving the number without changing the sign (`y = 4 + 9`), resulting in `y = 13`.
- **"Operation Switch"**: Confusing addition with division or multiplication due to the proximity of variables and numbers, though less common here than in `9y = 4`.
- **"Commutative Misconception"**: Assuming `4 - 9` is the same as `9 - 4` without understanding the directional change on a number line.

Step 3: Population Context
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face "procedural drift" where they memorize the movement of terms but lack the conceptual grounding of integers. In Hindi-medium contexts, the transition to English-variable algebraic notation can add a layer of cognitive load. Since this is an open-ended item, there are no distractors to provide "hints," requiring pure recall of the integer subtraction rule.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the equation is simple in structure, the specific combination of transposition and resulting in a negative integer is a significant hurdle. In many Indian government school assessments, the "Smaller from Larger" bug is the most prevalent error in early algebra.
