Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Translate the linguistic operator "of" into the arithmetic operator "multiplication" ($1/2 \times 3/4$ and $2/5 \times 2/3$).
2. Execute fraction multiplication for Pair A: Multiply numerators ($1 \times 3$) and denominators ($2 \times 4$) to get $3/8$.
3. Execute fraction multiplication for Pair B: Multiply numerators ($2 \times 2$) and denominators ($5 \times 3$) to get $4/15$.
4. Compare two fractions with unlike denominators ($3/8$ vs $4/15$).
5. Find a common denominator (e.g., $120$) or use cross-multiplication ($3 \times 15 = 45$; $8 \times 4 = 32$) to determine the relationship.
6. State the final conclusion based on the comparison.

Step 2: Buggy Rules & Systematic Errors
- Operator Misinterpretation: Treating "of" as addition or division, or simply ignoring it and comparing the original fractions ($1/2$ vs $2/5$).
- Multiplication via Cross-products: Attempting to "cross-multiply" to solve the multiplication step (getting $4/6$ or $1.5/4$).
- Common Denominator for Multiplication: Unnecessarily finding common denominators before multiplying, often leading to arithmetic exhaustion or errors.
- "Larger is Smaller" Bug: In the final comparison, assuming $4/15$ is larger because $15$ is larger than $8$ (ignoring the numerators or the proportional relationship).
- Additive Comparison: Comparing $3/8$ and $4/15$ by looking at the difference between numerator and denominator ($8-3=5$ vs $15-4=11$) and assuming the smaller gap is the "greater" fraction.

Step 3: Population Considerations
In Grade 7 Indian government schools, students often struggle with "word-to-symbol" translation. While the multiplication algorithm is usually drilled, the comparison of unlike fractions is a significant bottleneck. In an open-ended format without multiple-choice cues, the "of" operator acts as a linguistic barrier for English Language Learners (ELL), who may confuse it with "out of" or other relational terms. The rubric requires two correct intermediate calculations for 1 mark, meaning a single arithmetic slip in finding the common denominator results in zero credit.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the multi-step nature (multiplication followed by comparison of unlike denominators), the high probability of "denominator-only" comparison bugs, and the linguistic hurdle of the word "of," the failure rate on this specific combination of tasks is historically high.
