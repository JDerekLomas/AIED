Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Decoding the prompt: Translating "significance," "subcontinent," and "stating any two points" into conceptual requirements.
2.  Retrieval: Accessing stored geographical knowledge regarding the Himalayas (climate, defense, rivers, or biodiversity).
3.  Filtering: Selecting two points that specifically impact the "Indian subcontinent" rather than generic facts (e.g., "it has snow").
4.  Linguistic formulation: Constructing a coherent sentence in English that satisfies the "stating" requirement.
5.  Adhering to constraints: Ensuring two distinct points are provided to meet the rubric's threshold for full marks.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1.  "Keyword Matching Bug": Providing a definition of the Himalayas instead of their significance.
2.  "List-making Bug": Writing single words (e.g., "Water," "Protection") without "stating" the impact/role as required by the rubric.
3.  "Language Transfer Bug": Thinking of the point in Hindi (e.g., "monsoon rokta hai") but failing to translate "block/prevent" or "rainfall" correctly in English.
4.  "One-and-Done Bug": Providing only one strong point because the student stops after the first successful retrieval, ignoring the "two points" instruction.
5.  "Tautology Bug": Stating the same point twice using different words (e.g., "They are high mountains" and "They have great height").

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students in this demographic often face a "threshold effect" where their conceptual understanding (knowing the Himalayas are important) exceeds their English productive proficiency. In a recall-heavy, open-ended format, the absence of scaffolding (like a word bank) increases the cognitive load. Many students will likely provide a partially correct or single-point answer, which falls short of the "two points" requirement for the maximum score.
