Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic decoding: Understand the word "significance" (high-level vocabulary) and "reign" in the context of history.
2. Retrieval: Access long-term memory for the specific historical figure (Ashoka) and differentiate his rule from other Mauryan or Gupta rulers.
3. Selection: Identify two distinct "key aspects" (e.g., Kalinga War/Dhamma, pillars/edicts, Buddhism expansion).
4. Synthesis: Articulate the causal link between these aspects and their "significance" (long-term impact) rather than just listing facts.
5. Linguistic Encoding: Translate these complex historical concepts into written English (given the Hindi-medium background).

Step 2: Common "Buggy Rules" / Systematic Errors
1. Fact-Significance Confusion: Providing a biographical fact (e.g., "He was a king") instead of explaining importance/impact.
2. Narrative Oversimplification: Reducing the entire reign to "He was a good king" without mentioning specific aspects.
3. Aspect Misattribution: Attributing features of other rulers (like Akbar’s religious tolerance or Chandragupta’s conquests) to Ashoka.
4. "The First-Item Bug": Mentioning only the Kalinga War (the most famous event) but failing to provide a second distinct aspect or the broader significance.
5. Keyword Matching Error: Using the word "Ashoka" and "History" in a sentence without addressing the prompt's structural requirements (the "at least two aspects" constraint).

Step 3: Population Considerations
The open-ended nature of the question (recall vs. recognition) is a high cognitive load. For students with limited English proficiency (LEP), the word "significance" acts as a major barrier to entry. In Indian government schools, rote memorization of "Ashoka the Great" is common, but translating that into a structured 1-mark explanation in a second language often leads to partial or incorrect responses.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the content is a staple of the Grade 7 curriculum, the combination of English-language output, the multi-part requirement for a single point, and the distinction between "fact" and "significance" creates a high failure rate for the specific rubric requirements.
