Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of the English question (identifying "Battle of Plassey," "1757," and the causal link "contribute to expansion").
2. Retrieve specific historical schema regarding the outcome of the battle (defeat of Siraj-ud-Daulah).
3. Identify the mechanism of "expansion" (transition from trade to political control).
4. Synthesize the concept of "puppet ruler" or "dominance over Bengal."
5. Translate the internal conceptual model back into a coherent English sentence.

Step 2: "Buggy Rules" / Systematic Errors
1. "Narrative Substitution": Recalling the *story* of the battle (e.g., "The British won because of Mir Jafar’s betrayal") without addressing the *consequence* (expansion of power) requested.
2. "Keyword Matching": Associating "British power" with "The British ruled India for 200 years," providing a general temporal fact instead of a causal link.
3. "Chronological Compression": Conflating Plassey (1757) with Buxar (1764) or the Revolt of 1857, leading to inaccurate claims about the Diwani rights or the Crown rule.
4. "Linguistic Approximation": Attempting to use vocabulary like "dominance" or "puppet" but failing to construct a syntactically correct causal statement in English, resulting in fragmented, illegible responses.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students in Grade 8, the transition to English-medium assessment in Social Science often results in high cognitive load, leading to "rote-reproduction" of textbook sentences. If the exact sentence isn't memorized, the student fails.
2. Recall vs. Recognition: This is a high-stakes open-ended task. Without multiple-choice cues, the threshold for retrieval is much higher.
3. Socio-economic Context: Limited access to supplementary reading or academic English support outside of the classroom.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the Battle of Plassey is a "anchor event" in the curriculum, the requirement to explain the *mechanism* of power expansion (rather than just naming the winner) in a second language significantly reduces the success rate.
