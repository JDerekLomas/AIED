Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English phrasing of the question (recognizing "key features" as a prompt for characteristics).
2. Retrieve specific terminology from memory (Recall) related to the unit on the Constitution.
3. Translate the internalized concept (often learned or discussed in Hindi) into the required English technical term (e.g., "Secularism" or "Federalism").
4. Transcribe the term onto paper with sufficient orthographic accuracy for the grader to recognize it.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. **Keyword Association Bug**: Student associates "Constitution" only with "B.R. Ambedkar" or "26 January," providing a name or date instead of a structural feature.
2. **Category Displacement**: Confusing "Features" with "Preamble words" or "Fundamental Duties" (e.g., writing "Respect the flag" instead of "Federalism").
3. **Linguistic Approximation**: Attempting to phonetically spell a complex term (e.g., "Sackulrism") which, depending on the strictness of the grader, may be marked wrong if the word becomes unrecognizable.
4. **The "Definition for Feature" Bug**: Providing a narrative description of what a constitution is (a "rule book") rather than identifying a specific feature as requested by the rubric.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Recall vs. Recognition**: The open-ended format is significantly harder for ELL (English Language Learner) students than a multiple-choice format.
2. **Conceptual Load**: Terms like "Federalism" and "Secularism" are abstract and often lack direct, everyday equivalents in the students' socio-economic environment.
3. **Rubric Leniency**: The rubric only requires *one* feature, which acts as a safety net; however, the English-medium barrier in a Hindi-dominant cognitive environment remains high for Grade 8 students in EWS (Economically Weaker Section) contexts.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While the rubric is generous (requiring only one feature), the "bottleneck" is the transition from conceptual understanding in Hindi to the specific English technical vocabulary required for an English-medium test. Based on typical performance data in these demographics where "rote-learned" keywords are the primary successful strategy:
