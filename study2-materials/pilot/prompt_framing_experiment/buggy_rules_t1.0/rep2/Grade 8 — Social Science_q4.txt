Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of the English academic terms "primary role" and "Panchayati Raj system."
2. Access long-term memory to retrieve the conceptual framework of the three-tier governance system.
3. Distinguish the "primary role" (governance/administration) from specific tasks (building roads/wells) or higher-level government functions.
4. Translate the internal conceptual understanding (likely stored in Hindi or a hybrid "Hinglish" code) into a coherent English sentence.
5. Synthesize the core components: "local level" and "self-rule/administration."

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Procedural Errors)
1. **Concrete-over-Abstract Bug:** Instead of identifying the systematic role (governance), the student lists specific concrete outputs (e.g., "making toilets" or "cleaning drains").
2. **Translation/Linguistic Interference Bug:** Using phonetically similar but semantically incorrect English words, or producing "word salad" where syntax fails to convey the relationship between the village and the state.
3. **Hierarchy Confusion Bug:** Assigning roles of the State or Central government (e.g., "making laws for India") to the Panchayat.
4. **Key-term Over-reliance:** Providing a definition of "Panchayat" (e.g., "five people") rather than explaining its "role."

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Language Barrier:** In Grade 8, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with the "output" phase of open-ended English questions, even if they understand the concept.
2. **Recall vs. Recognition:** Unlike multiple-choice, this requires active synthesis of a formal definition.
3. **Socio-Economic Context:** Limited access to supplementary reading or academic English outside the classroom reduces the likelihood of "textbook-perfect" phrasing required by the rubric.

Step 4: Holistc Estimation
While the concept of the Panchayat is culturally familiar, the transition from functional understanding to formal English academic prose—coupled with the "concrete-over-abstract" bug—creates a high failure rate for the specific rubric requirements.
