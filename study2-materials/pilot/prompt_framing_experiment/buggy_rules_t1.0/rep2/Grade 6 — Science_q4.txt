Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Semantic Decoding:** Comprehend the term "preference" and "property" within the context of the question.
2.  **Scientific Retrieval:** Recall specific physical characteristics of cotton fibers (absorption or porosity) from long-term memory.
3.  **Causal Reasoning:** Link the retrieved property to the physiological need of the body in summer (cooling/evaporation).
4.  **Linguistic Encoding:** Formulate a sentence in English (the medium of instruction/testing) that connects the property to the behavior.

Step 2: Buggy rules and systematic errors
*   **The "Function as Property" Bug:** Students identify the result (e.g., "it keeps us cool") instead of the underlying physical property (e.g., "it absorbs sweat").
*   **The "Experience-Only" Bug:** Relying on personal narrative ("My mother gives me cotton") rather than scientific terminology.
*   **Vocabulary Displacement:** Misusing "transparent" for "porous" or "soft" as the reason for thermal comfort.
*   **Translation Mapping Error:** Knowing the concept in Hindi (*sookhna* for absorption) but failing to retrieve the specific English technical term "absorbent."

Step 3: Population-specific considerations
*   **Grade 6 Transition:** This is the first year science is treated as a distinct discipline from General Studies; students are still moving from descriptive to explanatory logic.
*   **Open-ended Demand:** Unlike multiple-choice, this requires active recall and syntactical construction, which is a high hurdle for English Language Learners (ELL).
*   **Rubric Rigidity:** The rubric requires a *property*. Students who provide a correct "outcome" (keeps us cool) but omit the "property" (absorption) will score 0 according to the strict criteria.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is familiar, the combination of linguistic barriers, the requirement for a specific "property" rather than an "effect," and the transition to formal scientific writing in Grade 6 creates a high probability of "near-miss" answers that fail the rubric.
