Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Linguistic Decoding: Interpret the phrase "maximum value... that can measure... an exact number of times" as a request for the Highest Common Factor (HCF).
2. Prime Factorization: Decompose 75 (3 × 5 × 5) and 69 (3 × 23) into prime factors.
3. Intersection/Identification: Identify the common prime factor(s).
4. Calculation: Multiply common factors (in this case, just 3) to find the HCF.
5. Contextual Application: State the answer with the correct unit (kg).

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
- Keyword Over-reliance: Students may see "maximum" and "two bags" and mistakenly perform addition or multiplication (Magnitude Bug).
- Factorization Errors: Division errors (e.g., 69 ÷ 3 = 13 or 23 being treated as non-prime).
- HCF/LCM Confusion: Executing the Least Common Multiple (LCM) procedure instead of HCF, a common "interference bug" when both are taught in the same unit.
- Unit Neglect: Providing the number "3" without "kg," which some strict rubrics penalize.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- English Proficiency: The phrasing "measure the weight... an exact number of times" is cognitively dense for ESL/Hindi-medium students; the conceptual link to HCF is often lost in translation.
- Open-ended Format: Unlike multiple-choice, this requires active recall of the prime factorization algorithm and the conceptual schema for HCF.
- High Stakes/Low Score: The 0.5-mark allocation often results in students rushing or skipping steps, as the effort-to-reward ratio is low.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While the calculation itself is relatively simple (3), the linguistic barrier and the systematic confusion between HCF and LCM in Grade 6 typically lead to a high error rate. Only students who have internalized the specific "keyword-to-procedure" mapping for "maximum" will succeed.
