To analyze this item through the lens of mathematical cognition and systematic errors:

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. **Discount Calculation:** Calculate 10% of ₹1200 ($0.10 \times 1200 = 120$).
2. **Selling Price (SP) Determination:** Subtract discount from Marked Price (MP) ($1200 - 120 = 1080$).
3. **Profit Relation Recognition:** Understand that $SP = CP + \text{Profit}$, specifically $1080 = CP \times (1 + 0.08)$.
4. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Isolate CP ($CP = 1080 / 1.08$).
5. **Arithmetic Execution:** Perform the division involving decimals or fractions to find 1000.

**Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"**
*   **The "Profit on MP" Bug:** Students often calculate the 8% profit on the Marked Price (₹1200) or the Selling Price (₹1080) rather than the Cost Price, due to a failure to distinguish the base of the percentage.
*   **Additive Percentage Bug:** Students may treat the 10% discount and 8% profit as additive/subtractive units of the same base (e.g., calculating $1200 - 2\%$), failing to recognize the shift in reference from MP to CP.
*   **Inverse Operation Bug:** When calculating CP from SP and Profit %, students often multiply by 0.92 (subtracting 8% from the SP) instead of dividing by 1.08.
*   **English Language Barrier (Semantic Error):** In Hindi-medium contexts, terms like "Marked Price" (अंकित मूल्य), "Cost Price" (क्रय मूल्य), and "Selling Price" (विक्रय मूल्य) are distinct; if the English terms are unfamiliar, the student may map the numbers to the wrong variables.

**Step 3: Population Context**
Grade 8 students in this demographic often struggle with multi-step word problems that require constructing an internal model of a transaction. While they might be proficient at simple discount calculations (Steps 1-2), the transition to finding CP from SP (Steps 3-5) represents a significant "cognitive cliff." The open-ended format removes the possibility of "back-solving" from options, which usually aids students with weak algebraic skills.

**Step 4: Holistic Assessment**
The rubric only awards the point for the full correct answer (or specifically mentions SP calculation, though the question asks for CP). Assuming the "Maximum score: 1" requires the final CP of ₹1000: the combination of the "Inverse Operation Bug" and the "Profit on MP Bug" typically eliminates a large majority of the cohort.
