Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Identify a personal hobby and translate the concept from Hindi/L1 to English.
2. Structural Organization: Formulate three distinct propositions (what, when, why) as required by the prompt.
3. Syntactic Construction: Apply Subject-Verb-Object patterns in English (e.g., "I like playing...").
4. Morphological Application: Correct use of tense (Present Simple) and subject-verb agreement.
5. Vocabulary Mapping: Recall specific nouns and verbs related to the hobby (e.g., "gardening," "badminton").
6. Transcription: Correct spelling and punctuation to form a cohesive paragraph.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. L1 Interference (Syntax): Applying Hindi word order (Subject-Object-Verb), e.g., "I cricket play."
2. Aspectual Bug: Using the continuous "-ing" form for habitual actions, e.g., "I am playing cricket every day."
3. The "Because" Bug: Starting a sentence with "Because" to answer "why" without an independent clause.
4. Vocabulary Approximation: Using a Hindi word when the English word is forgotten (Code-mixing).
5. Omission of Copula: Dropping the verb "to be," e.g., "My hobby reading."
6. Overgeneralization of 's': Adding 's' to all verbs regardless of person.

Step 3: Population/Context considerations
Grade 7 students from economically weaker sections often have high "affective filters" and limited exposure to English outside the classroom. The task is an "open-ended recall" task (Production), which is significantly harder than "recognition" (Multiple Choice). In this specific demographic, while many students can communicate the idea, fulfilling all three rubric constraints (what, when, why) in grammatically coherent English sentences without falling into L1 interference bugs is a high cognitive load.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the strict binary rubric (Score 1 or 0) for a multi-step production task where a single systematic error in sentence structure or failing to address one of the three prompts results in a zero:
