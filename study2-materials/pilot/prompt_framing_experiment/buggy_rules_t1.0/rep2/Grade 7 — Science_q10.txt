Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the technical terms from English to Hindi/conceptual understanding (identifying "Wasp string" as "sting," "vinegar" as an acid, and "baking soda" as a base).
2. **Fact Retrieval (Chemistry)**: Recall the specific pH nature of the toxins: Wasp sting is alkaline (basic) and Bee sting is acidic.
3. **Relational Logic**: Match the treatment to the toxin (Vinegar/Acid + Wasp/Base; Baking Soda/Base + Bee/Acid).
4. **Conceptual Categorization**: Identify that an acid + base interaction constitutes a "Neutralization" reaction.
5. **Verbal Encoding**: Formulate the explanation in English (as required by the medium of instruction) or clear scientific terminology.

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
1. **The "Opposites" Over-generalization**: Students may know they are "opposites" but cannot name the chemical principle, resulting in a "0" if the rubric strictly requires the term "neutralization."
2. **Symmetry Error (The "All Stings are Acidic" Bug)**: A very common misconception where students assume all insect stings are acidic. They may incorrectly conclude that both treatments are just "medicines" rather than realizing the wasp/bee distinction.
3. **Phonetic/Spelling Bug**: In Hindi-medium contexts, "Neutralization" is a complex multisyllabic English word often misspelled or replaced with "Naturalization" or "Neutral," which may be marked wrong depending on grader strictness.
4. **Keyword Association Bug**: Associating "Baking Soda" only with "Carbon Dioxide" or "Cooking" rather than "Base."

Step 3: Target Population Analysis
Grade 7 is the introductory year for formal Acid-Base chemistry in the NCERT curriculum. For students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency, the typo in the question ("string" instead of "sting") adds a significant cognitive load/distraction. The open-ended nature requires active recall of the term "neutralization," which is a high-level vocabulary demand for ESL learners.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is taught, the combination of the "string" typo, the need to differentiate between the two types of stings (often confused even by adults), and the requirement to produce a technical English term suggests a high failure rate.
