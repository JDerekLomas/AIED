Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Parse the English sentence to identify the parts of speech.
2. Recall the definition of an "adjective" (modifies a noun).
3. Identify the noun "bird" and the word describing it ("tiny").
4. Recall the definition of a "phrase" (a group of words) versus a single word.
5. Reconcile the conflict between the question's prompt ("adjective phrase") and the rubric's requirement ("tiny," which is a single adjective).
6. Provide the specific word "tiny" as the answer.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. "Single word = Phrase": Students may believe a single adjective constitutes a phrase due to inconsistent classroom definitions.
2. "Location-based identification": Students might assume the first word of a sentence or the word immediately following an article is always the target.
3. "Prepositional Phrase confusion": Students often mistake "in our balcony" for the adjective phrase because it contains more words and follows the noun (post-modification is common in Hindi, though the structure differs).
4. "Literalism Bug": High-performing students may refuse to write "tiny" because they know a single word is not technically a phrase, leading them to guess (e.g., "A tiny bird") and failing the specific rubric.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 7 students in this demographic often struggle with the distinction between "adjective" and "adjective phrase." Given the Hindi-medium background, the word "phrase" (shabdansha) is often cognitively heavier than "adjective" (visheshan). Furthermore, the rubric is technically flawed: "tiny" is an adjective, but the question asks for a *phrase*. This creates a "trap" where students who actually understand the concept of a phrase will provide a multi-word answer (like "A tiny bird") and be marked incorrect, while students who ignore the word "phrase" and just look for an adjective might get it right.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The misalignment between the question (phrase) and the rubric (word), combined with English language barriers and the difficulty of identifying parts of speech in a non-native language, suggests a low success rate.
