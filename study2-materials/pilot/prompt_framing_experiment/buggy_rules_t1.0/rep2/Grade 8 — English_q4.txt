Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the prompt and understand the semantic constraint (identifying a synonym for "a light wind").
2. Scan the provided text passage (search-to-sample) specifically looking for meteorological or atmospheric descriptors.
3. Match the target definition "light wind" to the specific lexical item "breeze" within the text.
4. Extract the word without altering its morphology (copying correctly).
5. Verify that the selected word exists in the passage (checking against the constraint "from the passage").

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. **The "Definition-to-Knowledge" Bug:** The student provides a synonym they know (e.g., "air," "cool," or "gust") instead of searching the passage, violating the "from the passage" constraint.
2. **The "Surface Feature" Bug:** Selecting any word related to weather found in the text (e.g., "clouds," "rain," "sky") regardless of the specific "light wind" meaning.
3. **The "Translation Gap" Bug:** Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may translate "light wind" to "hawa" (air/wind) and then back-translate to the most common English word they know ("wind"), failing to identify the specific nuance of "breeze."
4. **The "Copying" Bug:** Misspelling the word "breeze" (e.g., "breze," "breez") which, depending on rubric strictness, may lead to a zero score.

Step 3: Target Population Analysis
Grade 8 students in this context often struggle with vocabulary acquisition beyond basic sight words. While "breeze" is a common word, the shift from recognition (multiple choice) to recall/extraction (open-ended) significantly increases cognitive load. The linguistic distance between "light wind" and "breeze" requires a level of English synonymy that is often not solidified in ESL learners from economically weaker sections.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account the requirement to find a specific word in a second language, the common tendency to provide a general related word rather than the exact synonym, and the "search-to-sample" difficulty for students with limited reading fluency:
