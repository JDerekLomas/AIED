To analyze this item through the lens of systematic errors and cognitive demands:

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1.  **Deconstruction of Prompt:** Filter the "scenario" (summer/clothes) from the "constraint" (two scientific reasons related to properties).
2.  **Domain Retrieval (Heat):** Recall the relationship between color and radiant heat absorption.
3.  **Domain Retrieval (Fabric):** Recall the relationship between cotton and sweat/evaporation.
4.  **Linguistic Encoding:** Formulate the retrieved scientific concepts into English sentences that satisfy the "explain" command.
5.  **Verification:** Check if both reasons are "scientific" and "related to properties."

**Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors**
*   **The "Experience over Theory" Bug:** Students provide practical or tautological answers rather than scientific ones (e.g., "It feels comfortable" or "It looks cool") because they prioritize personal experience over abstract physics.
*   **The "Property Confusion" Bug:** Attributing the cooling property of cotton to its color or vice versa (e.g., "Cotton is white so it reflects heat").
*   **The "Keyword Missing" Bug:** Understanding the concept but lacking the English vocabulary (e.g., "absorption," "reflection," "evaporation") to articulate a "scientific reason."
*   **The "One-Reason Sufficiency" Bug:** In open-ended prompts, students often stop after one correct statement despite the prompt asking for "two," assuming the first answer is "the" answer.

**Step 3: Population Considerations**
The transition from Hindi-medium or vernacular backgrounds to English-medium science in Grade 7 is a significant barrier. While the rubric is generous ("bounce off" is accepted), the cognitive load of retrieving two distinct scientific mechanisms (reflection and evaporation/breathability) and translating them into a second language is high. In economically weaker sections, exposure to formal scientific discourse outside the classroom is often limited, increasing reliance on rote memorization which often fails in "Explain" type questions.

**Step 4: Holistic Estimate**
The requirement for *two* reasons is the primary hurdle. Many students will provide one reason (likely about light colors) or a non-scientific reason (comfort). Given the linguistic barrier and the "one-reason" bug, a majority of the population will likely provide a partially correct or non-scientific
