Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Identify the reporting verb and determine if a conjunction (that) is needed.
2. Remove quotation marks and commas.
3. Apply Pronoun Shift (1st person "I" to 3rd person "she" based on the subject).
4. Apply Backshift of Tense (Present Continuous "am reading" to Past Continuous "was reading").
5. Maintain sentence structure and subject-verb agreement in the new tense.

Step 2: Buggy rules:
1. "No-Backshift" Rule: Converting the pronoun but keeping the present tense (*She said that she is reading...*).
2. "Quote-Retention" Bug: Changing the words but keeping the quotation marks.
3. "Surface Translation" Bug: Translating thoughts from Hindi (where indirect speech often retains the original tense) directly into English.
4. "Pronoun Freeze": Keeping the original pronoun (*She said that I was reading...*).
5. "Verb Inconsistency": Changing the auxiliary but not the participle, or vice versa.

Step 3: Population considerations:
Grade 7 students in this demographic often treat English as a set of memorized strings rather than a fluid system. The transition from "is/am" to "was" is a high-interference area. In Hindi, indirect speech often uses "ki" (that) but preserves the original tense of the statement, leading to a strong "No-Backshift" bug. The open-ended format prevents guessing, which is common in multiple-choice formats.

Step 4: Holistic estimate:
Given the multi-step nature of the transformation and the high linguistic interference between Hindi and English tense systems, the probability of a student executing all steps (Pronoun + Conjunction + Tense Backshift) correctly is low.
