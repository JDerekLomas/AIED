Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Identify the start of the sentence and capitalize the first letter of 'riya'.
2. Recognize 'Meena' as a proper noun (name) and capitalize the first letter.
3. Recognize 'Sunday' as a proper noun (day of the week) and capitalize the first letter.
4. Identify the end of the declarative sentence and add a terminal full stop (period).
5. Transcribe all other words correctly without introducing spelling or syntax errors.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. **The "Start-Only" Bug:** Capitalizing only the first letter of the sentence but ignoring proper nouns mid-sentence.
2. **The "Phonetic Transfer" Bug:** Writing 'Riya' or 'Meena' as they sound in Hindi/Vernacular scripts, which do not have a case distinction (leading to total omission of capitalization).
3. **The "Proper Noun Hierarchy" Bug:** Capitalizing names (Riya/Meena) but failing to recognize days of the week (Sunday) as requiring capitalization, often treating 'sunday' as a common noun.
4. **The "Visual Closure" Bug:** Forgetting the terminal full stop because the sentence feels "finished" once the words are written.
5. **The "Case-Mixing" Bug:** Randomly using capital letters for emphasis or writing in all caps/all lowercase due to lack of fluency in English orthographic conventions.

Step 3: Population considerations
- Grade 6 students in these contexts often have a "functional literacy" gap where English is treated as a decoding exercise rather than a rule-based system.
- The open-ended "Rewrite" format is significantly harder than a multiple-choice "Identify the correct sentence" task, as it requires simultaneous execution of multiple rules (recall) rather than simple recognition.
- Because the rubric is binary (Maximum score 1), a student who gets 3 out of 4 punctuation marks correct still receives a 0.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While many students will capitalize the first 'R', the combination of a mid-sentence name, a day of the week, and the terminal punctuation creates multiple "fail points." In this specific demographic, the "Sunday" capitalization and the full stop are the most frequent points of failure.
