Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Linguistic Decoding: Translate the English prompt into internal conceptual framework (likely Hindi-dominant).
2. Historical Sequencing: Retrieve the chronological shift from the 1600s (Mercantilism) to the mid-1700s (Territorial Sovereignty).
3. Causal Linking: Identify the mechanism of transition (e.g., Battle of Plassey/Buxar, Diwani rights, or fortification for trade protection).
4. Synthesis: Condense a complex century-long process into a concise written "description."
5. Rubric Alignment: Ensure the response explicitly mentions the initial "trader" status as per the specific scoring requirement.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. Narrative Collapse: Providing a single-word or name-based answer (e.g., "Battle of Plassey") instead of describing a *process*.
2. Teleological Error: Assuming the Company arrived with the intent to rule from day one, skipping the "trader" phase.
3. Keyword Mismatch: Confusing "East India Company" with "British Government" or "Queen Victoria" (attributing 1858 dynamics to the 1750s).
4. Language Interference: Using "business" or "dukaan" logic that fails to bridge into the "ruler/administration" terminology required for the mark.
5. Transcription Bug: Copying parts of the question as the answer without adding the "process" element.

Step 3: Population Considerations
The open-ended format is high-stakes for this demographic. While the rubric is surprisingly lenient (only requiring the mention of "traders" or "factories"), the prompt "Describe the process..." suggests a high-complexity task. Students with limited English proficiency often struggle to initiate a descriptive sentence even if they understand the historical concept. However, the low bar for the 1-mark rubric (essentially just confirming the premise of the question) provides a safety net for those who can produce a basic sentence.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The disconnect between a complex "Describe the process" prompt and a very simple 1-point rubric creates a gap. Many students will fail to produce a coherent English sentence or will provide a circular response that doesn't trigger the rubric's specific requirement.
