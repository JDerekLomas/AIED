Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the English sentence structure to identify the syntactic role of the blanks.
2. Apply the phonological rule for "elephant" (starts with a vowel sound /e/) to select "an".
3. Apply the phonological rule for "tiger" (starts with a consonant sound /t/) to select "a".
4. Apply the semantic/contextual rule for "zoo" (specific place/unique context) to select "the".
5. Execute the transcription task: rewrite the entire sentence without omitting words or making spelling errors (as required by the "whole sentence" rubric).

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
1. "First Letter Rule": Looking only at the first letter (vowel vs. consonant) rather than the sound (e.g., "a honest man").
2. "Default to 'A'": Using "a" as a universal article for all nouns regardless of phonology or specificity.
3. "The for Everything": Over-applying "the" to all nouns to indicate importance or simply as a memorized pattern.
4. "Copying Decay": Omitting the verb ("saw") or the preposition ("at") when rewriting the sentence, causing a rubric failure despite correct article choice.
5. "Null Article": Omitting articles entirely because the student's native language (Hindi) does not have a direct equivalent to the English article system.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 7 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds face a "double burden." Linguistically, Hindi does not use articles, making the concept of "a/an/the" an abstract graft rather than a natural intuition. Procedurally, the requirement to "Rewrite the whole sentence" is a high-friction task; even students who know the articles often lose the point due to transcription errors (omitting words) or poor handwriting/spelling. The open-ended format eliminates the 25-33% chance of guessing correctly found in multiple-choice questions.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While "an elephant" and "a tiger" are common textbook examples, the combination of three distinct article rules plus the strict "rewrite the whole sentence" rubric significantly lowers the success rate for this specific demographic.
