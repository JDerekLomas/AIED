Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode English-language terminology in the question ("growth," "conditions," "favourable," "least," "hindered").
2. Perform a cross-comparison of quantitative data in the table to identify the maximum value (Step a).
3. Connect the absence of light to the biological mechanism of photosynthesis (Step b/c).
4. Translate internal conceptual understanding into written English or Hinglish sentences.

Step 2: Systematic buggy rules:
- "The First-Match Bug": Selecting the first row of data instead of scanning for the maximum.
- "The Label-Value Confusion": Confusing the name of the condition with the numerical value of growth.
- "Teleological Reasoning": Explaining darkness as "the plant is sleeping" or "it is cold" rather than mechanistic biological failure.
- "Keyword Truncation": Writing "Sunlight" for part (c) because they recognize the theme, but failing to name the process "Photosynthesis."

Step 3: Population considerations:
Grade 6 is the transition year where students move from general environmental studies to specific scientific terminology. For ESL/Hindi-medium students from EWS backgrounds, the "linguistic threshold" is a major barrier; even if they understand the concept of plants needing light, the demand to produce the specific English term "Photosynthesis" (which is cognitively "heavy") and explain the "why" in a second language significantly lowers the probability of a fully correct multi-part response.

Step 4: Estimation:
While many will get (a) correct, the rubric requires "the fully correct answer" (presumably for the entire item set or high accuracy across parts b and c). The jump from data reading to process naming is the primary filter.
