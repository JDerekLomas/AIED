Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the command verb "Define" (distinguishing it from "What is...").
2. Retrieve the specific literary term "fable" from long-term memory, differentiating it from "folktale," "myth," or "parable."
3. Recall three distinct criteria: narrative form (short story), character type (animals), and functional outcome (moral lesson).
4. Translate these internal concepts into English syntax.
5. Apply correct English orthography and grammar to produce a coherent sentence.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **Keyword Mapping Bug:** Student provides a list of examples (e.g., "The Tortoise and the Hare") instead of a formal definition.
2. **Feature Over-generalization Bug:** Defining a fable simply as "a story about animals," omitting the essential "moral" component.
3. **Category Error Bug:** Conflating the term with "fairy tale" (magic/fantasy) or "fiction" in general.
4. **L1-L2 Interference Bug:** Using Hindi syntax structure or "Hinglish" (e.g., "Story jisme animals moral dete hain") which may not satisfy a strict rubric.
5. **Retrieval Block/Partial Schema:** Recalling only the "moral" but forgetting the "animal" component, or vice versa.

Step 3: Population/Context considerations
Grade 8 students in this context often face "low-stakes" testing environments where rote memorization is high, but English production is low. An open-ended recall question (rather than multiple choice) significantly increases the cognitive load. For Hindi-medium students, the gap between "understanding what a fable is" and "writing a definition in English" is substantial.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept of a fable is simple, the requirement to produce a formal, three-part English definition from scratch—without prompts—poses a significant barrier for students with limited English proficiency.
