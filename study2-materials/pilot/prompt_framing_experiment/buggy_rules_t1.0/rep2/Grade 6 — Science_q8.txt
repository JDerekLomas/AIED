Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English text: Understand the descriptive terms "stunted growth" and "yellowing of leaves."
2. Recognize biological symptoms: Map "yellowing" and "stunted growth" to internal physiological stress or specific nutrient deficiencies (chlorosis).
3. Inverse reasoning (Inference): Move from the effect (symptoms) back to the cause (lack of inputs).
4. Synthesize and translate: Formulate a response in English that links the symptom to a specific missing "need" (nutrients, light, or water).

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. Semantic Mapping Error: Interpreting "stunted" as "stopped" or "broken," or misidentifying "yellowing" as a natural stage of aging/autumn rather than a deficiency.
2. Narrative Causality Bug: Assigning cause to external physical damage (e.g., "someone stepped on it") or "disease/germs" rather than the absence of essential abiotic inputs.
3. Language Production Gap: The student understands the concept in Hindi (e.g., *khad ki kami*) but cannot retrieve the English technical term (nutrients/minerals) or bridge the grammar to "infer."
4. Over-generalization: Assuming any plant problem is simply "no water," ignoring the specific prompt about yellowing/stunted growth.

Step 3: Student Population Factors
Grade 6 is a transitional year where abstract "inference" is newly introduced. In economically weaker sections (EWS) and Hindi-medium backgrounds, science is often taught through rote memorization of definitions. An open-ended "What can you infer?" question requires high-level linguistic construction and conceptual retrieval, which is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice recognition for English Language Learners (ELLs).

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
The gap between the specific symptoms provided and the abstract concept of "nutrient deficiency" is wide for a 6th grader with limited English proficiency. While "water" is a common-sense fallback, the specific phrasing "infer from this evidence" may paralyze students who struggle with English syntax, leading to blank answers or irrelevant responses.
