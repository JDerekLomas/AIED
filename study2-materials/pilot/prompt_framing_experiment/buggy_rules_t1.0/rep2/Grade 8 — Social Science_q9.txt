Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Semantic Decoding:** Translate the English sentence into an internal conceptual framework (likely Hindi-based for this demographic).
2.  **Abstract Concept Retrieval:** Access the schema for "Democracy" and "Parliament" and identify the structural link between them (Representative Governance).
3.  **Functional Identification:** Recall specific functions of Parliament defined in the NCERT curriculum (Law-making, controlling the executive, or expressing the will of the people).
4.  **Linguistic Synthesis:** Formulate a response in English that connects the "Why" (necessity) with the "What" (function), utilizing causal markers (e.g., "because," "so that").

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1.  **The "Keyword Matching" Bug:** Students provide a definition of Parliament or Democracy separately without explaining the causal necessity (e.g., "Democracy is by the people").
2.  **The "Vague Positive" Bug:** Substituting specific institutional functions with general positive traits (e.g., "Parliament is good for people," "It helps the country").
3.  **The "Literal Translation" Bug:** Attempting to translate a complex Hindi thought ("Logon ki awaaz") into English and losing the technical requirement of the rubric (e.g., "People speak there").
4.  **The "Circular Reasoning" Bug:** Stating that a democracy needs a Parliament because it is a democratic country.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1.  **Language Barrier:** Students often understand the concept in L1 (Hindi) but fail to articulate the specific technical terms (Law-making/Representation) required by the rubric in L2 (English).
2.  **Recall vs. Recognition:** Open-ended questions are significantly harder for this group than Multiple Choice, as they cannot rely on visual cues for technical vocabulary.
3.  **Abstraction Gap:** Grade 8 students at this socioeconomic level often struggle with "macro" institutional concepts compared to "micro" civic duties.
