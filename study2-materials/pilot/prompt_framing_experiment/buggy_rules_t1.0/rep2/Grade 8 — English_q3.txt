Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of the question "What did [X] mean to [Y]?" (distinguishing "meaning" as significance rather than definition).
2. Retrieve the specific narrative detail from long-term memory (Anika's relationship with drawing).
3. Synthesize the abstract concept of "expression of feelings" vs. "hobby."
4. Translate the internal conceptual model from a primary language (Hindi) into English syntax.
5. Apply English grammatical rules (subject-verb agreement, past tense "was") to construct a complete sentence.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. The "Definition Bug": Providing a literal dictionary definition of drawing rather than the character's personal significance.
2. The "Keyword Association Bug": Seeing "drawing" and "Anika" and simply writing "Anika likes drawing" (low-level retrieval instead of high-level synthesis).
3. The "Direct Translation Bug": Applying Hindi syntax to English, resulting in fragmented or unintelligible sentences (e.g., "Drawing Anika feeling is").
4. The "Binary Hobby Bug": Categorizing all extracurricular activities as "hobbies" because the nuance of "more than a hobby" is a higher-order distinction not yet solidified in L2.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face a "threshold effect" where their conceptual understanding (which might be high in L1) is bottlenecked by L2 production. Open-ended recall questions are significantly harder for this group than multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank, as they lack the scaffolding to bridge the gap between memory and formal expression.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement to express two distinct ideas (not a hobby + expression of feelings) in a second language with limited proficiency, many students will provide partially correct or grammatically broken answers that fail the rubric's specific criteria for a full mark.
