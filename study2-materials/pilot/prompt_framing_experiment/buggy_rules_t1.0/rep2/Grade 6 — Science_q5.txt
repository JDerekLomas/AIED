Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the specific reagent required for starch testing (Iodine).
2. Describe the application of the reagent (adding drops to the potato slice).
3. Identify the specific color change indicative of a positive result (Blue-black).
4. Synthesize these points into a coherent written English sentence.

Step 2: Buggy rules and systematic errors
- Reagent Confusion: Substituting "Iodine" with more common or recently learned substances like "water," "salt," or "acid."
- Incomplete Observation: Stating only one color (e.g., "it turns blue" or "it turns black") which may be marked wrong depending on strictness, or confusing it with the copper sulfate/caustic soda test for proteins (turning purple).
- Procedural Omission: Stating the result ("it turns blue-black") without stating the procedure ("add iodine").
- Language Interference (L1 to L2): Thinking of the process in Hindi but failing to translate "Iodine" or "Starch" correctly, or struggling with the verb "describe."

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 is the foundational year for formal lab chemistry in this curriculum. For students from economically weaker sections in government schools, access to hands-on "kit-based" learning is often limited; the "procedure" is often learned via rote memorization from a textbook. The requirement for recall (open-ended) rather than recognition (multiple choice) significantly increases the cognitive load, especially for English Language Learners (ELL).

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric is quite generous (awarding the point just for mentioning iodine), the combination of writing in a non-native language and the transition from concrete observations to formal scientific terminology in Grade 6 presents a significant barrier.
