Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the definitions of "autotrophic" and "heterotrophic" from long-term memory.
2. Translate scientific concepts from mental models (often in Hindi/L1) to English.
3. Distinguish the core criteria (self-nourishment vs. dependence on others).
4. Recall a specific biological example for each category.
5. Synthesize these into a structured "differentiation" format (comparative sentence or table).

Step 2: Known "buggy rules" / Systematic errors
1. Label Swapping: Correctly defining both but swapping the names (attributing self-feeding to heterotrophs).
2. Phonetic/Root Confusion: Misinterpreting "auto" as "automatic" or "automobile," leading to errors in conceptual framing.
3. Example Generalization: Providing a general category (e.g., "animals") instead of a specific example, or using examples that overlap in confusing ways (e.g., carnivorous plants).
4. Category Collapse: Defining both as "types of food" rather than "modes of nutrition."
5. Language Interference (L1 to L2): Writing "Plants make food" (correct) but failing to use the technical term "autotrophic" correctly in the comparison.

Step 3: Target student population considerations
1. Grade 7 is the introductory stage for these formal Greek-rooted terms.
2. Low English proficiency increases the "bottleneck" effect; students may understand the biology but fail to articulate the distinction in English.
3. Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice recognition for students with limited vocabulary.
4. The 1-mark rubric is "all or nothing," meaning a minor error in the example or a label swap results in a zero.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the linguistic barrier of the technical terms and the requirement for four distinct pieces of information (two definitions + two examples) for a single mark, the "bug" rate for label-swapping and language-related omission is high.
