Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the prompt (requires decoding English syntax and the meaning of "like" and "why").
2. Recall or locate specific lines from the poem (memory retrieval or scanning text).
3. Select a specific line (subjective evaluation).
4. Transcribe or quote the line accurately (orthographic mapping).
5. Formulate a reason (causal reasoning/metacognitive reflection).
6. Translate that reason into an English sentence (syntax, vocabulary, and grammar).
7. Execute the written output (mechanical writing).

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. The "Copy-Paste" Bug: Selecting a random line without regard for preference because the student doesn't understand the content, only the instruction to "pick a line."
2. The "Circular Reasoning" Bug: Answering "I like it because it is good" or "I like it because I like it" (common in early L2 learners).
3. The "Code-Switching" Bug: Thinking of a reason in Hindi but lacking the English vocabulary to translate it, leading to an incomplete or unintelligible sentence.
4. The "Identification-only" Bug: Providing the line but omitting the "why" because the cognitive load of the first half exhausted the student's working memory or linguistic resources.
5. The "Transcription Error" Bug: Miscopying the line so significantly that it no longer resembles the text, failing the "denotes a line" rubric requirement.

Step 3: Target Population Analysis
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections in India often face a "literacy gap" where their functional English lags behind the curriculum's expectations. An open-ended "Why" question is significantly more difficult than a multiple-choice question (recognition vs. recall). The lack of a provided "sentence starter" or scaffold makes the linguistic production threshold very high for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement for both selection and original linguistic production in a second language, many students will provide only the line or a tautological reason.
