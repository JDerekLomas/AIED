Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Semantic Decoding:** Translate the English sentence into conceptual meaning (identifying "Parliament," "necessary," and "democracy" as the core links).
2.  **Conceptual Retrieval:** Access the schema for "Parliament" from long-term memory (distinct from "Government" or "Constitution").
3.  **Logical Linking:** Connect the concept of "Parliament" to the functional requirements of "democracy" (Representation or Law-making).
4.  **Syntactic Encoding:** Construct an English sentence that uses causal connectors (e.g., "because," "so that").
5.  **Transcription:** Physically write the response using correct spelling and grammatical structure.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1.  **Concept Conflation (The "Government = Parliament" bug):** Students treat all state institutions as a single entity ("Government helps people"), failing to specify the legislative function.
2.  **Keyword Association (The "Democracy = Voting" bug):** Students associate "democracy" with "voting" or "elections" but fail to explain the *institution* (Parliament) that results from those elections.
3.  **Circular Reasoning bug:** Defining the term using the term (e.g., "Parliament is necessary because democracy needs a Parliament").
4.  **Linguistic Interference (The "Transliteration" bug):** Attempting to translate a complex Hindi thought ("Janata ki awaaz") into English but losing the technical terminology required by the rubric.

Step 3: Target population considerations
- Grade 8 is the transition to abstract political theory.
- Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice for students with limited English fluency.
- In EWS/Hindi-medium contexts, rote memorization of definitions often takes precedence over functional understanding of institutional roles.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While many students will understand the general idea of "leaders" or "voting," the specific requirement to link Parliament to *law-making* or *representing the will of the people* in English—without conflating it with the executive branch—presents a high cognitive and linguistic barrier.
