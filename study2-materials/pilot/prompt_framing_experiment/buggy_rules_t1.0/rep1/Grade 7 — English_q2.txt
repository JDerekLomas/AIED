Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English syntax of the question (Wh- question word + auxiliary verb + subject + verb).
2. Retrieve the specific narrative context from memory (Leo Tolstoy's "The Three Questions").
3. Identify the causal link (The "Why") between the action (announcing a reward) and the goal (obtaining answers).
4. Translate the internal conceptual reason from L1 (Hindi) or simplified English into a coherent English sentence.
5. Apply grammatical rules for the past tense (responding to "did... announce" with "announced" or "to + infinitive").

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. **The Copy-Paste Bug:** Students copy a random sentence from the passage containing the keyword "king" or "reward" without verifying causal relevance.
2. **The Tense-Matching Bug:** Failing to transition from the question's auxiliary "did" to the answer's past tense (e.g., "The king announce a reward because...").
3. **The L1 Interference Bug:** Using Hindi syntax with English words, leading to unintelligible structures (e.g., "King three question answer want for reward give").
4. **The Wh- Confusion Bug:** Treating "Why" as "What" or "Who," leading to a description of the reward rather than the reason for it.
5. **The Bare Infinite Bug:** Providing only the verb without the purposive "to" (e.g., "for get answers").

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Open-ended Recall:** Unlike multiple-choice, this requires active construction, which is significantly harder for low-proficiency English Language Learners (ELLs).
2. **Limited English Proficiency:** In many Indian government schools, English is taught as a functional subject; while students may understand the story in Hindi, the leap to written English production is a high cognitive barrier.
3. **Socio-Economic Factors:** Limited access to out-of-school English exposure (media, books, tutors) means the "correct reason" often fails at the syntax level even if the "fact" is known.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the story is a staple of Grade 7 curricula, the combination of required recall, linguistic translation from L1 to L2, and the strictness of providing a "correct reason" in a second language suggests a high error rate.
