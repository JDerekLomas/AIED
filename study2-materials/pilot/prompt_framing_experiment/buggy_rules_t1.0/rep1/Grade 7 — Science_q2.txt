Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Semantic mapping:** Translate the physical scenario (solid metal object in contact with a heat source) into the scientific category of heat transfer.
2.  **Lexical retrieval:** Recall the specific term "Conduction" from long-term memory (not provided in a word bank).
3.  **Linguistic encoding:** Formulate the explanation in English, identifying that heat moves through the material from the hotter end to the colder end.
4.  **Mechanistic explanation:** Describe the microscopic process (vibration of particles/atoms transferring energy to neighbors) without confusing it with bulk fluid movement (Convection) or electromagnetic waves (Radiation).

Step 2: Identified "Buggy Rules"
1.  **Term Confusion (Interference):** Swapping "Conduction" and "Convection" because both start with "C" and involve transfer through a medium.
2.  **State-of-Matter Bias:** Assuming heat "flows" like a liquid, leading to descriptions more suited to convection.
3.  **Literalism Bug:** Describing the result ("the tea makes it hot") rather than the process/mechanism.
4.  **Language Barrier Bug:** Knowing the concept in Hindi ("चालन" - Chaalan) but being unable to retrieve the English technical term or articulate the explanation in English syntax.

Step 3: Target Student Population
Grade 7 students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds face a high cognitive load when an item requires both specific technical recall and open-ended English explanation. While the phenomenon is familiar, the transition from "common sense" to "formal scientific terminology" in a second language is a significant barrier. The "0.5" maximum score suggests this is a low-stakes sub-item, but the requirement to *explain* (part b) is much harder than simple identification.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account the heavy penalty of English-language production for EWS/Hindi-medium students and the common confusion between the three modes of heat transfer:
