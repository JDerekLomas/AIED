Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the definition of pasteurization as a thermal treatment process.
2. Identify the specific sequence of operations: Heating followed by Rapid Cooling.
3. Identify the specific medium (Milk).
4. Identify the purpose (Preservation/killing microbes).
5. Translate these conceptual components into a coherent English sentence or structured description.

Step 2: Buggy rules and systematic errors
1. "Temporal Disconnection": Describing heating but forgetting the critical "quick cooling" step (the most common procedural omission).
2. "Purpose Confusion": Confusing pasteurization with "boiling" (a common household practice in Indian homes), leading to the error that milk must be boiled for a long time.
3. "Step Reversal": Reversing the order (cooling then heating).
4. "Incomplete Retrieval": Identifying that it kills germs but failing to describe the *process* as requested by the prompt.
5. "Linguistic Substitution": Using vague Hindi-influenced English terms (e.g., "making it hot and cold") which may not meet the scientific "describe" criteria depending on the strictness of the evaluator.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students from low-SES backgrounds often rely on rote memorization (kunjis/guides). While the rubric is lenient regarding specific numbers (70°C/30s), the "open-ended" nature of "Describe and Explain" is significantly more cognitively demanding than "Define." In Hindi-medium transitions, students often understand the concept of "uubalna" (boiling) but struggle to articulate the two-step thermal shock process (heat + sudden chill) in English.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the two-part nature of the question (process + reason) and the common systematic error of omitting the "rapid cooling" phase, many students will provide only a partial answer.
