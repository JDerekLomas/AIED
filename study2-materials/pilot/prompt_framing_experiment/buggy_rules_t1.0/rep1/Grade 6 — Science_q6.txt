Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English prompt ("adaptations," "desert plants") into conceptual meaning (likely mapping to Hindi terms like *marusthal* or *anukoolan*).
2. **Concept Retrieval**: Access the specific schema for "desert plants" (Cacti/Aloe vera) from long-term memory.
3. **Feature Selection**: Isolate a specific structural or behavioral trait (roots, leaves, or stems) that serves a functional purpose (water conservation/acquisition).
4. **Functional Linkage**: Explicitly connect the physical trait (e.g., "thorns") to the survival benefit (e.g., "to save water").
5. **English Encoding/Output**: Formulate a written sentence in English that satisfies the rubric's requirement for clarity.

Step 2: "Buggy rules" / Systematic errors
1. **The "Labeling is Explaining" Bug**: Students provide a noun (e.g., "Cactus") instead of an adaptation (the "how" or "why").
2. **The "Reverse Function" Bug**: Misidentifying the purpose of a feature (e.g., "thorns are for decoration" or "long roots are to breathe").
3. **The "Generalization" Bug**: Providing a trait true of all plants (e.g., "it has green leaves") rather than a desert-specific adaptation.
4. **The "Transliteration" Bug**: Attempting to translate a complex Hindi thought into English but losing the logical connection (e.g., "Water save leaf small").
5. **The "Synonym Confusion" Bug**: Confusing "desert" (dry land) with "dessert" or other phonetically similar words if instructions were read aloud.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 is a transitional year where English medium instruction often ramps up in Indian government schools. While the science concept is foundational, the "open-ended" nature of "Explain" is significantly harder than "Name" or "Circle." The linguistic barrier for EWS/Hindi-medium students often leads to "blank page syndrome" or "fragmentary responses" that fail the rubric's "clearly describing" threshold.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is taught, the combination of English expression, the requirement to link structure to function, and the open-ended
