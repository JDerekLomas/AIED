Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decoding the prompt: Comprehending the abstract terms "theme" and "central idea" in a second language.
2. Retrieval: Accessing the specific semantic memory of the poem "The Last Bargain" by Rabindranath Tagore.
3. Analysis: Synthesizing the narrative (the failure of the King, the Rich Man, and the Fair Maid) into the abstract concept of "freedom/spiritual satisfaction."
4. Translation: Encoding the abstract thought from a primary language (Hindi) into English syntax.
5. Composition: Formulating a coherent sentence that aligns with the rubric's requirement for specific keywords (power, wealth, pride).

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. The "Summary-for-Theme" Bug: Providing a plot summary (e.g., "A man meets a king") instead of an abstract theme.
2. The "Keyword Association" Bug: Writing down any word remembered from the poem (e.g., "sword," "gold coins," "flowers") without thematic connection.
3. The "Translation Syntax" Bug: Attempting to translate a complex Hindi thought ("Sacha sukh azadi mein hai") but failing to produce a comprehensible English sentence, leading to a loss of marks.
4. The "Prompt Echo" Bug: Repeating the question (e.g., "The theme of the poem is very good") without providing content.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 8 students from EWS backgrounds often face a "literacy gap" where their conceptual understanding (in L1) outpaces their expressive ability (in L2). The poem is philosophical/metaphorical, which is cognitively more demanding than literal texts. In an open-ended format, the lack of scaffolding (no options to choose from) significantly increases the "Floor Effect," where students who understand the poem cannot prove it in written English.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
Given the requirement to produce a concise, abstract thematic statement in a second language without any recognition cues, many students will fail at the composition or "Summary-for-Theme" stage, even if they understood the poem's classroom discussion.
