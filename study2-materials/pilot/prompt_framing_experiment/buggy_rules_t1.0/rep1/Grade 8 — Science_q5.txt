Step 1: Specific procedural steps:
1. Decode the English terms "Wheat" and "Paddy" and translate/associate them with their Hindi equivalents (*Gehun* and *Dhaan*).
2. Recall the conceptual definitions of "Kharif" and "Rabi" (categorization).
3. Associate specific crops with their respective categories (Wheat -> Rabi; Paddy -> Kharif).
4. Map categories to their corresponding Indian climatic seasons (Rabi -> Winter; Kharif -> Rainy).
5. Execute the written response in English (as required by the prompt format).

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. **Semantic Overgeneralization:** Conflating "Paddy" with "Wheat" because both are primary staples, or failing to recognize "Paddy" as "Rice."
2. **Seasonal Inversion:** Consistently swapping Rabi/Winter and Kharif/Rainy (a common systematic reversal error in memorization).
3. **Availability Heuristic Error:** Assuming Wheat is grown in the Rainy season because it is a "thirsty" crop (misapplying biological logic to climatic cycles).
4. **Vocabulary Mapping Failure:** Not knowing the English word "Wheat" despite knowing the agricultural cycle of *Gehun*.

Step 3: Target population considerations:
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face "language-switching" costs. While agriculture is culturally familiar, the technical English vocabulary ("Wheat," "Rabi," "Kharif") acts as a barrier. The open-ended nature of the question removes the 50/50 "guess" probability of a multiple-choice format, increasing the likelihood that a student with a partial "bug" (e.g., getting the category right but the season wrong) will lose the 0.5 points.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
Given the high probability of category-season inversion and the linguistic barrier for "Paddy" vs. "Rice," a significant portion of the cohort will likely provide a partially correct or inverted response.
