Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode complex English academic verbs ("Analyze," "Role," "Economic Development," "Evaluate").
2. Retrieve the concept of money as a medium of exchange/capital formation from long-term memory.
3. Link the abstract concept of "money" to the macro-concept of "development" (investment, infrastructure, trade).
4. Transition to a contemporary context (Digital Money/UPI).
5. Formulate a multi-clause explanation in English that meets the rubric's requirement for "explanation."

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" / errors:
1. **The "Definition for Analysis" Bug:** Students provide a simple definition of money (e.g., "Money is for buying things") instead of analyzing its role in development.
2. **The "Concrete-to-Abstract" Failure:** Students list things they can buy (e.g., "food," "clothes") rather than explaining systemic economic growth.
3. **The "Translation Literalism" Bug:** Students mentally translate a Hindi concept but use incorrect English syntax, resulting in an unintelligible sentence that fails the "explain" criteria.
4. **The "UPI Displacement" Bug:** Focusing entirely on the convenience of UPI/Paytm apps (the "digital" part) while ignoring the "economic development" part of the prompt.
5. **The "Prompt Weighting" Error:** Answering only the second half of the question (digital money) because it is more relatable, failing the rubric requirement for the "role of money in development."

Step 3: Population considerations:
Grade 7 students are at a transitional stage from concrete to formal operational thinking. For students from EWS backgrounds in India, the linguistic barrier is high; "economic development" is a high-register term often taught via rote memorization. In an open-ended format without cues, the cognitive load of simultaneous translation and conceptual synthesis is significant.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While the rubric is generous (only requiring "one significant role"), the linguistic complexity of the prompt and the abstraction required to link money to "development" (rather than just "spending") will exclude a majority of the cohort.
