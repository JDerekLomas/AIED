Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of the question in English (challenging for Hindi-medium learners).
2. Scan the provided table to locate the column/row for "expansion."
3. Compare numerical values or bar lengths (depending on table format) to identify the maximum value.
4. Map the maximum value back to the corresponding material name (Aluminium).
5. Ignore irrelevant sub-questions (b) and (c) to ensure the answer matches the specific rubric requirement for the 1-mark score.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- "Max-Value Blindness": Looking for the most common material rather than the highest expansion value.
- "Language Interference": Misinterpreting "expands the most" as "hardest" or "strongest" due to limited English vocabulary.
- "Column/Row Misalignment": Selecting the material adjacent to the maximum value due to a tracking error.
- "Schema Interference": Answering (b) or (c) instead of (a) because those questions rely on prior real-world knowledge (railway tracks, wires) which is more familiar than data interpretation.
- "Unit Confusion": If values are in scientific notation or decimals, treating longer strings of digits as larger numbers (e.g., 0.00025 < 0.001).

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 8 students in this demographic often struggle with "Data Interpretation" tasks if they haven't been explicitly taught to read tables as a functional literacy skill.
- The open-ended format requires writing the word "Aluminium," which may lead to phonetic spelling errors (though usually ignored by lenient graders).
- High probability of students answering part (b) or (c) because they are "general knowledge" science questions, potentially neglecting the data-specific task in part (a).

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The task is a low-level "locate" task, but the linguistic barrier and the distraction of three sub-questions for only one rubric point significantly lower the success rate for this specific demographic.
