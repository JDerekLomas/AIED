Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Calculate the discount amount: $10\% \text{ of } 1200 = 120$.
2. Determine Selling Price (SP): $1200 - 120 = 1080$.
3. Set up the relationship between Cost Price (CP) and Profit Percentage: $SP = CP \times (1 + \text{Profit}\%)$.
4. Algebraic manipulation/Arithmetic: $1080 = CP \times 1.08$ or $CP = (1080 \times 100) / 108$.
5. Final calculation to find CP.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. "Percentage Addition Bug": Adding the discount to the MP instead of subtracting ($1200 + 120$).
2. "Profit on MP Bug": Calculating 8% profit on the Marked Price (₹1200) or Selling Price (₹1080) directly as a flat subtraction/addition, rather than treating it as a ratio of the unknown CP.
3. "Reverse Percentage Bug": Calculating $CP = 1080 - (8\% \text{ of } 1080)$ instead of dividing by $1.08$.
4. "Compounding Error": Applying 8% profit to the ₹1200 before applying the discount.

Step 3: Contextual Constraints
1. Language Barrier: For Hindi-medium students, terms like "Marked Price" vs "Cost Price" are often confused in English-medium assessments (Ankit vs Lagat mulya).
2. Two-Stage Problem: Multi-step word problems significantly increase cognitive load compared to single-step computations.
3. Precision: The rubric gives the full point only for the final correct answer, meaning a computational slip in Step 5 results in a score of 0.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
While Grade 8 students are taught these formulas, the combination of "discount on MP" followed by "profit on CP" is the most common point of failure in commercial mathematics. In the specific socio-economic and linguistic context described, the "Reverse Percentage Bug" is extremely prevalent.
