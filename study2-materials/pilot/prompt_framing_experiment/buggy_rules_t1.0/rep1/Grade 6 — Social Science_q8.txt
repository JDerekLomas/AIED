Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English prompt and translate the academic terms "rights" and "importance" into internal conceptual frameworks (likely in Hindi).
2. Retrieve at least two specific rights from memory (e.g., Right to Education, Right against Exploitation).
3. Verify that the retrieved rights are "distinct" and applicable to "children in India" specifically.
4. Select one of those rights for further elaboration.
5. Formulate a causal explanation linking that right to "importance" (societal or individual benefit).
6. Encode the response back into English (or a functional bilingual mix) with enough syntactical clarity to meet the rubric’s standard for "identifying" and "explaining."

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **The "List-Only" Bug:** Students provide a list of rights but skip the "explain" portion entirely, often due to high cognitive load or misreading the multi-part instruction.
2. **The "Moral-Obligation" Swap:** Substituting "rights" (entitlements) with "duties" (e.g., "respecting elders," "studying hard").
3. **The "Tautological Explanation" Bug:** Explaining importance by restating the right (e.g., "The Right to Education is important because children must go to school").
4. **The "Generalization" Bug:** Providing human rights that are too broad (e.g., "Right to live") without the specific contextual nuance of "children’s rights" taught in the curriculum.
5. **The "Single-Entity" Error:** Providing two examples that are conceptually the same (e.g., "Going to school" and "Learning to read") and failing the "distinct" requirement.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 6 students at this developmental stage are transitioning from concrete to abstract operational thinking. For students from economically weaker sections in Indian government schools, the "Right to Education" (RTE) is highly salient, but the linguistic barrier of an English-language assessment often leads to "bottlenecking"—where the student understands the concept but cannot produce the requisite "explanation" in English. Furthermore, open-ended recall is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice recognition for this demographic.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The requirement to perform three distinct cognitive tasks (recall two items + select one + explain importance) for
