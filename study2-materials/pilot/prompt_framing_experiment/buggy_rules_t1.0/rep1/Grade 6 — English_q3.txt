Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decoding: Read the English text to recognize the phonemes/graphemes of "What", "Riya", "love", "evening".
2. Semantic Mapping: Translate English keywords into L1 (Hindi) equivalents (e.g., *kya*, *pasand*, *shaam*).
3. Retrieval: Locate the specific detail ("read books") from memory or the provided passage.
4. Syntax Transformation: Convert the question structure (Interrogative) into an Answer structure (Declarative) or a meaningful fragment.
5. Orthographic Encoding: Spell the retrieved answer correctly in English.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "Copy-the-context" bug: Copying a large chunk of the passage surrounding the keyword "evening" because the student cannot isolate the specific verb phrase.
2. "Transliteration" bug: Writing the Hindi word for "read" or "book" using English letters.
3. "Tense-clash" bug: Using the present tense "love" instead of "loved" or incorrectly applying the "did" auxiliary (e.g., "Riya did love to...").
4. "Keyword-matching" bug: Identifying the word "evening" in the text but writing the action associated with a different character or time of day found nearby.
5. "Wh-confusion": Confusing "What" with "When" or "Where," leading to an answer like "in the park."

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 6 students in this context often face a "literacy gap" where their functional English is significantly below grade level. In open-ended items, the lack of "recognition" cues (as found in MCQs) increases cognitive load. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, the transition to writing full English sentences is a high-hurdle task; many may know the answer but cannot encode it in English.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While the question is "simple," the procedural chain from decoding to orthographic output is brittle. Many students will likely produce "Read book" (which is acceptable under the rubric), but a significant portion will fall into "Copy-the-context" or "Wh-confusion" bugs, or simply leave it blank due to limited vocabulary.
