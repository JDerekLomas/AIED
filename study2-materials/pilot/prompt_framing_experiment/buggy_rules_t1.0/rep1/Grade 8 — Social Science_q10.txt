Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Linguistic Decoding: Translate the English prompt into Hindi/native conceptual frameworks, specifically identifying "East India Company," "traders," and "rulers."
2. Historical Sequencing: Retrieve the chronological shift from the 1600s (Mercantilism) to the mid-1700s (Political power).
3. Retrieval of Key Events: Identify the causal link (e.g., Battle of Plassey, Buxar, or Diwani rights) that bridged trade and governance.
4. Synthesis: Construct a sentence that connects the initial state (merchants/factories) to the final state (territorial control).
5. Output Generation: Formulate the response in English, ensuring it meets the specific rubric requirement of mentioning "traders" or "factories."

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. Keyword Over-reliance: Students see "East India Company" and write everything they know about the British Raj (e.g., the Freedom Struggle or 1947), failing to address the specific "process" of becoming rulers.
2. Narrative Flattening: Treating history as a single event rather than a transition; students may state they became rulers "by fighting" without mentioning they started as "traders," thus missing the rubric's specific trigger.
3. Language Interference: Students may conceptually understand the transition but lack the English vocabulary to distinguish between "trade," "business," "factory," and "ruling," leading to incomplete or unintelligible sentences.
4. Rubric Mismatch: Because the question asks to "Describe the process" (high cognitive load) but the rubric only requires mentioning they were "traders" (low cognitive load), many students will get bogged down in the complexity of the "process" and fail to state the obvious "starting point" required for the mark.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Grade 8 is the transition point where students move from rote memorization to causal analysis.
2. Limited English proficiency acts as a bottleneck; students often leave open-ended English questions blank if they cannot formulate a full sentence, even if they know the historical facts.
3. In many government school contexts, "factories" is a confusing term (translated as 'karkhana'), often misunderstood as modern manufacturing rather than 17th-century trading posts.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric is surprisingly lenient (only requiring the mention of "traders"), the "Describe the process" prompt is a high-hurdle linguistic task for ESL learners from economically weaker sections. Many students will likely write about the rebellion of 1857 or Gandhi (associating British with the end of the timeline) or fail to provide the English construction necessary to satisfy the "trader" mention.
