Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English prompt into a mental representation (likely in Hindi/hinglish) to understand that "currency notes" refers to *paisa* and "lions" refers to the symbols on them.
2. **Visual/Conceptual Retrieval**: Access the episodic or semantic memory of the 10, 20, 50, or 500 Rupee note to locate the lion symbol.
3. **Fact Retrieval (Source)**: Identify the historical origin of the symbol (Ashoka/Sarnath).
4. **Fact Retrieval (Significance)**: Identify the symbolic status (National Emblem).
5. **Synthesis/Encoding**: Construct a written response in English that links the symbol to the concept of national identity.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules" / Procedural Errors
1. **Literal Interpretation Bug**: Students explain why lions are *important animals* (bravery, king of the jungle) rather than why they are *historically selected* for the currency.
2. **Identification Confusion**: Attributing the lions to the British (who introduced modern paper currency) or to the jungle/nature conservation rather than Ashoka.
3. **Incomplete Retrieval**: Identifying the symbol as "The National Emblem" but failing to state *why* it is there (the historical link), or vice versa.
4. **Linguistic Substitution Bug**: Knowing the answer in Hindi (*Ashok Stambh*) but being unable to translate "Emblem" or "Capital" into English, leading to a blank answer or "Lion is king."

Step 3: Target Student Population
Grade 6 students from EWS/Hindi-medium backgrounds face a high "double burden": they must recall a specific historical fact (not just recognize it in a multiple-choice format) and express it in a second language (English). In this demographic, the Lion Capital is often taught as a rote fact, but the connection to currency is frequently a "distractor" from the primary lesson on the Mauryan Empire.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
The open-ended nature of the question significantly increases the "bugs" compared to a multiple-choice item. Many students will likely write "Because lion is brave" or "Because it is our national animal" (confusing it with the Tiger). The requirement to mention both the Lion Capital and the National Emblem for a single point is a high cognitive and recall hurdle for this specific demographic.
