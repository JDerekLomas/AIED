Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Scan the list of numbers and determine the number of digits in each.
2. Identify that "736" is a 3-digit number while others are 4-digit numbers.
3. Place "736" as the smallest based on the "fewer digits = smaller value" rule.
4. Compare the remaining 4-digit numbers by looking at the leftmost digit (thousands place).
5. Compare the digits 3, 5, and 4 to determine their relative order (3 < 4 < 5).
6. Sequence the numbers in the final string: 736, 3367, 4799, 5492.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules":
1. **The "Length-is-Value" Bug:** While this helps with 736, some students reverse it, assuming longer numbers are "harder" or ignoring the 3-digit distinction to treat all as having the same "visual weight."
2. **Left-to-Right Neglect:** Comparing numbers based on the units digit instead of the highest place value (e.g., thinking 4799 is smaller than 3367 because 7 > 9).
3. **Ascending/Descending Confusion:** Interchanging the meaning of "ascending" and "descending," especially if the Hindi equivalent (*aarohi kram*) is not provided.
4. **Anchor Bias:** Correcting the first and last numbers but failing to order the middle two correctly.

Step 3: Population considerations:
Grade 6 students in this demographic often struggle with the English term "ascending." If the medium of instruction is shifting or the vocabulary is not reinforced, the linguistic barrier acts as a primary gatekeeper even if the numerical logic is sound. Furthermore, the 0.5-mark weighting suggests this is seen as a "simple" task, but for a student with low English proficiency, it is a high-stakes vocabulary test.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While the numerical comparison is relatively straightforward (no numbers have the same thousands digit, making the comparison simpler), the vocabulary hurdle and the tendency to make "silly" sequencing errors in an open-ended format significantly lower the success rate.
