Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Linguistic Decoding: Understand the English prompt "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" (translating to mental concepts of "Pahad/Parvat" and "Bharat").
2. Retrieval: Access mental maps or rote-learned lists of geographical features.
3. Filtering/Constraint Satisfaction: Distinguish "Mountain Ranges" from individual peaks (e.g., K2, Everest) and ensure they are "located in India" (excluding Himalayas if the student perceives them as purely Nepalese, or including them if taught as the northern border).
4. Quantity Check: Ensure two distinct items are retrieved.
5. Transcription: Write the names in English (orthographic representation).

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. Peak-Range Confusion: Providing names of specific peaks (Mount Everest, K2, Kanchenjunga) instead of ranges.
2. Political Boundary Error: Naming ranges outside India (e.g., Hindu Kush, Andes) due to overgeneralization of the "mountain" category.
3. Feature Type Mismatch: Providing names of rivers or states instead of mountains (common in low-literacy contexts where "India" and "Major" act as the primary keywords).
4. Single-Item Stop: Providing only one name despite the prompt asking for "two" (a common procedural slip in multi-part questions).
5. Orthographic Failure: Phonetic spelling that becomes unrecognizable (e.g., "Himalay" is usually accepted, but extreme distortions may fail).

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often rely on rote memorization from NCERT textbooks. While "Himalayas" is a high-frequency recall item, the second range (Aravalli or Vindhya) requires more stable long-term memory. The English medium barrier is significant; students may know the answer in Hindi but struggle to retrieve the English labels or fear incorrect spelling.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While "Himalayas" is a near-universal response, the requirement for a *second* correct range and the distinction between a "peak" and a "range" (a common conceptual "bug") significantly lowers the success rate for the full 0.5 marks.
