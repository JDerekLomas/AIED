Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Identify the parts of speech/functional roles (subject, verb, object).
2. Apply the English SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) syntax rule.
3. Correct placement of the auxiliary verb "is" before the main verb "reading" (Present Continuous construction).
4. Correct placement of the article "a" before the noun "book".
5. Capitalize the first letter of the first word ("He").
6. Apply terminal punctuation (full stop).

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. Word-for-word translation bug: Reordering based on Hindi syntax (SOV), leading to "He a book reading is."
2. "The/A" attachment bug: Placing the article at the end of the sentence or immediately after the verb regardless of the noun's position.
3. Copula omission: Omitting "is" because it often lacks a direct equivalent in colloquial or simplified translations ("He reading a book").
4. First-come-first-served bug: Starting the sentence with the first noun encountered in the string rather than the pronoun.
5. Punctuation/Capitalization neglect: Writing the correct order but failing formal mechanics (often penalized in strict rubrics).

Step 3: Target student population
The Grade 6 level suggests a transition from basic vocabulary to syntax. For Hindi-medium students, the shift from SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) to SVO is the primary cognitive hurdle. While the vocabulary ("book", "reading", "he") is high-frequency, the "rearrange" format requires active synthesis rather than passive recognition. Economic constraints often correlate with less exposure to "natural" English outside the classroom, making the task a purely formal, rule-based exercise.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the vocabulary is simple, the syntactic inversion (SOV to SVO) and the requirement to manage the auxiliary "is" and article "a" simultaneously create multiple points of failure for students with limited English proficiency.
