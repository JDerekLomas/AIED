Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the domain-specific vocabulary ("ruminant," "digestive system") in English.
2. Retrieve the biological concept of "cellulose" vs. human diet.
3. Access the anatomical fact of the four-chambered stomach or "rumen."
4. Synthesize the causal link (Diet → Anatomy): Cellulose requires specialized fermentation/re-chewing.
5. Translate the conceptual understanding back into a coherent English sentence.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. **Keyword Association Bug:** Student associates "cow" and "stomach" but writes "The cow has a big stomach" (lacks the comparative "different from human" or "multi-chambered" nuance).
2. **The "Grass" Tautology:** Student states "Cows eat grass and humans don't," failing to identify the *systemic* difference required by the rubric.
3. **Language Interference (Hinglish/Transliteration):** Student knows the concept in Hindi (जुगाली/jugali) but cannot retrieve "rumination" or "rumen," leading to an abandoned response or vague "different parts" answer.
4. **Generalization Bug:** Assuming all animals have the same organs, just different sizes.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Grade 7 Cognitive Load:** Moving from concrete observation to abstract internal systems.
2. **Language Barrier:** English-medium testing for Hindi-medium backgrounds often results in "copying the prompt" or "silent failure" where the student understands the science but cannot script the output.
3. **Recall vs. Recognition:** Unlike a multiple-choice question where "rumen" would trigger memory, open-ended recall is significantly harder for students with limited English fluency.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is a core part of the NCERT Grade 7 curriculum, the combination of specific anatomical recall, the requirement to link it to diet (cellulose), and the linguistic hurdle for EWS/Hindi-background students creates a high probability of "partial but incorrect" answers that fail the 1-mark rubric.
