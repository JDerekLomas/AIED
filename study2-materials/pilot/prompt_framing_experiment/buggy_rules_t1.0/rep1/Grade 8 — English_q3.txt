Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of the question, specifically the abstract use of "mean to" (significance/value).
2. Retrieve specific narrative details from the text (Anika's relationship with drawing).
3. Distinguish between a "hobby" (surface level) and "expression" (deep level) as per the rubric's specific requirement.
4. Synthesize the abstract concepts of "thoughts" and "feelings" into a coherent English sentence.
5. Apply correct syntax and vocabulary to convey the "more than just a hobby" nuance.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" (Cognitive/Linguistic)
1. **Keyword Matching Bug:** Searching the text for "drawing" and copying the first sentence found (often a literal description of her drawing) rather than the thematic meaning.
2. **Literalism Bug:** Interpreting "mean" as a request for a dictionary definition of drawing.
3. **The "Hobby" Trap:** Identifying it as a hobby (recognition) but failing to include the "more than" qualifier required by the rubric.
4. **L1-L2 Translation Interference:** Translating the Hindi concept of "man ki baat" (thoughts of the heart/mind) into fragmented or unintelligible English.
5. **Brief Response Bias:** Providing a one-word answer (e.g., "Fun" or "Art") due to limited expressive vocabulary, failing the multi-part rubric.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Grade 8 students in this context often struggle with open-ended synthesis in a second language.
2. The rubric requires an "inference" (expression of feelings) rather than a "literal retrieval," which is a high-order cognitive task for ELLs.
3. Lack of recognition cues (multiple choice) significantly increases the failure rate for students with low linguistic confidence.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement to mention both the "not a hobby" aspect and the "expression of feelings" aspect, many students will provide partially correct but rubric-failing answers.
