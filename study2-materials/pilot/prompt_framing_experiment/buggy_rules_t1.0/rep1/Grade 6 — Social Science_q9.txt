Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall and retrieve two distinct historical monuments located specifically within the geopolitical boundaries of Rajasthan.
2. Verify that both retrieved items belong to the category "historical monument" (as opposed to geographical features or modern buildings).
3. Select one of the two recalled monuments.
4. Recall the specific city/location associated with that chosen monument.
5. Retrieve the historical or architectural significance (the "why") for that specific monument.
6. Synthesize and translate these thoughts into English sentences (given the medium of instruction/assessment context).

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
- Category Over-generalization: Naming famous landmarks that are not in Rajasthan (e.g., Taj Mahal, Red Fort) because they are "famous" and "historical."
- Attribute Misalignment: Naming a monument correctly but attributing it to the wrong city (e.g., Hawa Mahal in Jodhpur).
- "Vague Significance" Bug: Providing a circular or non-specific reason for fame (e.g., "It is famous because it is old" or "It is very beautiful"), which may not satisfy rubric requirements for "why it is famous."
- Incomplete Execution: Naming two monuments but failing to provide the city or the reason for either, often due to cognitive load or misreading the multi-part prompt.
- Linguistic Interference: Knowing the answer in Hindi but being unable to formulate the "why" in English, leading to omission.

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 6 students are transitioning from rote memorization to descriptive writing. For students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English proficiency requirement acts as a significant "bottleneck." While Rajasthani students have high local cultural capital regarding monuments, the open-ended recall format (without options) significantly increases the difficulty compared to multiple-choice questions.

Step 4: Estimate
The complexity of the three-part demand (Name 2 + City + Significance) paired with the linguistic barrier for this specific demographic often leads to partial responses that fail to achieve the full mark in a binary "correct/incorrect" rubric.
