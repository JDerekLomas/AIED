Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Visual Decoding: Correct identification of "deforestation" or "cutting of trees" from the image.
2. Conceptual Linkage: Accessing the scientific consequences of deforestation (e.g., global warming, soil erosion, habitat loss).
3. Linguistic Translation: Translating thoughts from Hindi/vernacular to English.
4. Syntactic Construction: Formulating two distinct answers (identification and consequence) into a coherent written response.

Step 2: Buggy rules:
1. Labeling Bug: Providing a literal description ("man with axe") instead of the biological process ("deforestation").
2. Single-Part Completion: Answering part (a) but omitting (b) because the rubric offers only 1 mark total (leading to the "one mark = one word" heuristic).
3. Semantic Narrowing: Interpreting "consequences" as immediate physical outcomes ("no wood") rather than ecological impacts.
4. L1 Interference: Using Hindi syntax in English, leading to unintelligible phrasing that may be marked incorrect despite correct conceptual understanding.

Step 3: Population factors:
Grade 8 students in this demographic often struggle with open-ended English prompts. While the visual is accessible, the term "consequences" is high-tier academic vocabulary. The "sustained for a long time" clause adds syntactic complexity that may trigger cognitive overload for English Language Learners (ELL).

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While the concept is familiar, the combination of a two-part open-ended requirement, the specific English vocabulary ("consequences," "sustained"), and the high probability of linguistic interference suggests a significant portion will fail to provide a "sufficient description" for both parts.
