Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the academic vocabulary in English (e.g., "Assess," "impact," "economic life").
2. Retrieve historical schemas related to "kingdoms" and "wars" from long-term memory.
3. Isolate "economic" factors from other social or political consequences (functional categorization).
4. Formulate a causal link between war and economic outcome (e.g., looting, destruction of crops, cost of maintaining armies, taxation).
5. Translate the thought into a written sentence in English that meets the rubric’s requirement for "clarity" and "plausibility."

Step 2: Buggy rules:
- **Lexical Bug (Misinterpretation):** Interpreting "economic" as "general" or "social," leading to answers about death or losing territory (category error).
- **Association Bug:** Identifying a war (e.g., Panipat) instead of an impact (recalling a fact instead of performing an assessment).
- **Conflation Bug:** Confusing "impact" with "causes" (e.g., "they fought for money").
- **Language-Switch Bug:** Being able to conceptualize the impact in Hindi/mother tongue but failing to produce a "clear" English sentence that passes the rubric.

Step 3: Population considerations:
Grade 7 students in this demographic often struggle with the transition from rote memorization of facts to the abstract reasoning required by "Assess." For ELL (English Language Learner) students from EWS backgrounds, the gap between conceptual understanding and "clearly identifying" a point in written English is significant. Recall-based open-ended items typically show much higher failure rates than recognition-based (MCQ) items in this context.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
The abstraction of "economic life" combined with English language constraints makes this a high-difficulty item for the target population.
