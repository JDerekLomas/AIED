Step 1: Specific procedural steps:
1. Identify the object ("the leaves") and move it to the subject position.
2. Identify the tense of the verb ("blew" is past simple).
3. Select the correct auxiliary verb based on the new subject's number and the original tense ("were").
4. Recall and provide the past participle of the irregular verb "blow" ("blown").
5. Append the prepositional agent phrase ("by the wind") and maintain the adverbial particle ("away").

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules":
1. **Tense Mismatch:** Using "are" instead of "were" (applying present passive to past active).
2. **Subject-Verb Agreement Error:** Using "was" with "leaves" (singular/plural confusion).
3. **Irregular Verb Regularization:** Writing "blewed" or "blowed" instead of "blown."
4. **Participle/Past Tense Confusion:** Using "were blew" instead of "were blown."
5. **Particle Dropping:** Omitting "away" during the transformation.
6. **Object-Subject Misidentification:** Reversing the roles or keeping "The wind" as the subject.

Step 3: Target population considerations:
Seventh-grade students from low-resource, Hindi-medium backgrounds often struggle with English irregular verb forms (which do not follow Hindi inflectional patterns) and the specific syntax of "be + past participle." The open-ended nature of the task prevents students from using process-of-elimination or recognizing the correct form from a list. In this demographic, "blew" is often not recognized as the past tense of "blow," leading to a failure at the first procedural step.

Step 4: Holistic estimate:
Given the combination of irregular verb morphology, plural agreement, and the cognitive load of translating grammatical structures across languages for ESL learners, the likelihood of error-free execution is low.
