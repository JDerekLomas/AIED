Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the syntax and vocabulary of the question ("most important thing," "poet").
2. Read and comprehend the source poem (likely in a second language).
3. Synthesize the poem’s stanzas to identify an abstract underlying theme (friendship/blessings).
4. Distinguish between a literal detail and the "most important" thematic element.
5. Formulate an original sentence in English that expresses this abstract concept.
6. Align the response with the rubric's specific thematic requirements (agreement with the poet's value system).

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules"
1. Literalism Bug: Instead of identifying the theme, the student extracts a random concrete noun or the last line of the poem as the "important thing."
2. Key-Word Matching Bug: The student searches for the word "important" in the poem; if it's missing, they guess or leave it blank.
3. First-Person Transfer Bug: The student answers what is important to *them* personally rather than what is important to the *poet*.
4. Language-Switch Bug: The student understands the theme but provides the answer in Hindi or a "Hinglish" hybrid due to limited English vocabulary.
5. Copying Bug: The student copies the first two lines of the poem as a placeholder for an answer.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections in Indian government schools often face a "dual-burden" of low English literacy and limited exposure to abstract reading comprehension. Open-ended questions are significantly more difficult than multiple-choice for this demographic because they require productive language skills (writing) rather than just receptive skills (reading). The rubric is generous, but the barrier to entry (understanding the question and the poem) remains high.
