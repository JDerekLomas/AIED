Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English prompt ("Describe," "key feature," "urban planning") and translate concepts into a mental model of the Harappan Civilization.
2. Retrieve specific architectural data from long-term memory (grid system, drainage, citadel, or bricks).
3. Select one distinct feature that qualifies specifically as "urban planning" (avoiding cultural or religious traits).
4. Synthesize the retrieved fact into a descriptive sentence or phrase in English.
5. Apply correct syntax to ensure the "description" meets the rubric requirement rather than just listing a single word.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. **The "Keyword Association" Bug:** Students see "Harappan" and provide a general fact (e.g., "They worshipped Pashupati") that is not related to urban planning.
2. **The "Category Error" Bug:** Confusing urban planning with general lifestyle (e.g., "They grew barley").
3. **The "Language Encoding" Bug:** The student knows the concept in Hindi (e.g., "Nali" for drainage) but cannot retrieve the English technical term ("Drainage System"), leading to an empty or unintelligible response.
4. **The "Underspecification" Bug:** Providing a one-word answer (e.g., "Bricks") that fails the "Describe" command, though it hints at the correct concept.

Step 3: Population Considerations
8th-grade students from economically weaker sections often rely on rote memorization from textbooks. While "Harappan Civilization" is a core topic, the transition from recognition (Multiple Choice) to recall (Open Ended) is a high cognitive hurdle. Limited English proficiency significantly increases the "Language Encoding" bug, where a student may understand the history but fail the English execution required for the rubric.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement to "Describe" in a second language and the specific constraint of "urban planning," many students will likely provide a correct fact that is not planning-related or fail to articulate the description clearly enough to satisfy the rubric.
