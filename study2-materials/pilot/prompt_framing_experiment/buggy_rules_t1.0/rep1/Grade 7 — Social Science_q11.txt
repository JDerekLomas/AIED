Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of the term "Evaluate" (complex command).
2. Retrieve the conceptual distinction between "Public" (Sarkari) and "Private" (Niji) healthcare from long-term memory.
3. Access specific features for each category (cost, quality, ownership, accessibility).
4. Perform a comparative operation (linking a feature of public to a contrasting feature of private).
5. Translate internal conceptual understanding into English syntax.
6. Formulate one specific "valid argument or example" for each, as per the constraint.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. "Definition for Comparison": Providing definitions of both without highlighting a difference.
2. "Category Collapse": Conflating "public" with "good/free" and "private" with "bad/expensive" without nuanced evaluation.
3. "Example-only error": Providing an example (e.g., "AIIMS") without the underlying feature or argument required for "Evaluation."
4. "The 'Public' as 'People' Bug": Misinterpreting "Public Health" as "Health of the general public" rather than "Government-run."
5. "Keyword Matching": Writing everything known about doctors/hospitals without addressing the "Public vs. Private" prompt.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 7 students in this demographic often face a "language-content gap." While they likely understand the functional difference between a government hospital and a private clinic (due to lived experience), expressing this "Evaluation" in English is a significant hurdle. The open-ended format prevents guessing, and the requirement for "one valid argument/example for each" doubles the points of failure within a single-mark question.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The 1-mark rubric is surprisingly narrow (requiring "two features of public healthcare" despite the prompt asking for "differences between" and "examples for each"). This misalignment between the prompt's high cognitive demand (Evaluate) and the rubric's specific recall demand often leads to students providing correct information that doesn't fit the rigid grading key, or failing to navigate the English-medium phrasing.
