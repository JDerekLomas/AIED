Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English vocabulary: "stunted growth," "yellowing," "infer," and "evidence."
2. Retrieve biological facts linking physical symptoms (chlorosis/growth inhibition) to environmental inputs (nutrients, light, water).
3. Distinguish between "symptoms" (the data provided) and "needs" (the underlying cause required for the inference).
4. Synthesize a causal explanation in English (e.g., "The plant needs nitrogen/sunlight").

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. Symptom-Cause Reversal: Stating the plant "needs growth" or "needs green leaves" rather than identifying the missing input.
2. Literal Interpretation Bug: Interpreting "stunted" as a permanent trait (e.g., "it is a small plant/variety") rather than a sign of deficiency.
3. Categorical Overextension: Assuming all plant problems are caused by "no water," ignoring minerals or sunlight due to over-familiarity with basic needs.
4. Linguistic Code-Switching Failure: Knowing the concept in Hindi (e.g., *khad* or *dhoop*) but being unable to retrieve or spell the English equivalents.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 6 students at this developmental stage often struggle with "inference" as a cognitive operation, frequently defaulting to "observation" (repeating the question). In Indian government schools, Science is often taught via rote memorization of textbook back-questions; an "open-ended" application question like this bypasses the student's primary strategy of pattern-matching familiar sentences. The English-medium constraint for Hindi-medium backgrounds creates a high threshold for the "Explain" component.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric is generous (accepting any of the three factors), the combination of the vocabulary barrier ("stunted," "infer") and the shift from recognition to recall-based explanation in a second language will likely lead to a high failure rate.
