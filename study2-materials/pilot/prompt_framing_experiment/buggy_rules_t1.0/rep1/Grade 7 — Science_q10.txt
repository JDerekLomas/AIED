Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of "string" as "sting" (contextual error correction).
2. Recall the chemical nature of a wasp sting (alkaline/base).
3. Recall the chemical nature of vinegar (acid).
4. Recall the chemical nature of a bee sting (acidic).
5. Recall the chemical nature of baking soda (base).
6. Categorize the interaction between these substances (Acid + Base).
7. Identify the specific chemical principle/term (Neutralization).
8. Translate the internal conceptual model into an English-written explanation.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. **The "Opposite Mapping" Bug:** Students often swap the pH of bee and wasp stings (treating bees as basic and wasps as acidic), leading to a logic failure even if they understand the principle.
2. **The "Generic Treatment" Bug:** Students assume all insect stings are acidic (generalizing from the common "formic acid" lesson) and fail to differentiate the treatments.
3. **The "Spelling/Phonetic" Bug:** In Hindi-medium contexts, "sting" vs. "string" is a significant distractor; students may search for a mechanical or physical meaning related to a "thread" or "wire" rather than a biological injection.
4. **The "Keyword Retrieval" Bug:** Students recognize the substances but cannot retrieve the formal term "Neutralization," instead describing the process as "cleaning," "cooling," or "curing."

Step 3: Target Population Analysis
Grade 7 students in this demographic face a high cognitive load due to the English-language barrier. The typo "string" (present twice in the item) is a high-risk distractor for students with limited English proficiency, who may take the word literally. Furthermore, while the concept of neutralization is taught, the specific biological application (wasp vs. bee) requires high-level rote recall of specific pH values, which is frequently confused in high-pressure testing environments without multiple-choice cues.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The combination of the "string" typo, the need for open-ended recall of a specific terminology, and the common confusion between bee/wasp pH levels suggests a high failure rate for the "fully correct" response.
