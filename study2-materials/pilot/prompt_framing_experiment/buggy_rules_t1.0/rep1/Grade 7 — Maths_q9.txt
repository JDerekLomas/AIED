Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehension: Identify the relationship (Unit Rate) and translate the word problem into a multiplication expression ($10 \times 5 \frac{3}{4}$).
2. Conversion: Convert the mixed number ($5 \frac{3}{4}$) into an improper fraction ($\frac{23}{4}$).
3. Multiplication: Multiply the whole number by the numerator ($10 \times 23 = 230$) and place over the denominator ($4$).
4. Simplification/Division: Divide $230$ by $4$ to reach a final decimal ($57.5$) or mixed number ($57 \frac{1}{2}$).

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- Mixed Number Multiplication Bug: Multiplying the whole number by the whole number and leaving the fraction unchanged ($10 \times 5 \frac{3}{4} = 50 \frac{3}{4}$).
- Conversion Bug: Adding the whole number to the numerator instead of multiplying by the denominator ($5 + 3 = 8 \rightarrow \frac{8}{4}$).
- Denominator Neglect: Multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the whole number ($10 \times \frac{23}{4} = \frac{230}{40}$).
- Decimal Misalignment: If attempting to convert $\frac{3}{4}$ to $0.75$ first, errors in multiplying $10 \times 5.75$ (e.g., $5.750$ but misplacing the decimal as $5.75$).

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 7 students in this demographic often face "language interference"; if the English phrasing "How far can it travel on..." is not perfectly parsed, they may fall back on keyword strategies (e.g., seeing two numbers and performing the operation they are currently most comfortable with, which is often addition). Open-ended formats remove the "safety net" of multiple-choice cues, and the transition from whole-number arithmetic to rational numbers is a documented "plateau" in Indian government school outcomes (NAS/ASER data).

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The combination of a mixed number (a high-error-rate construct) and the requirement of an open-ended calculation significantly lowers the success rate compared to simple integer word problems.
