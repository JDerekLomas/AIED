Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Scan the text to identify line endings (the structural location where rhymes typically occur).
2. Phonologically decode the ending words: "rain," "grain," "borrow," and "tomorrow."
3. Apply the "rhyme rule": identify words with identical terminal phonemes despite potential orthographic differences.
4. Filter for internal vs. end-of-line rhymes (though not strictly necessary here, it is a standard procedural step in poetry analysis).
5. Transcribe the identified pair onto the answer sheet as a related unit.

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
1. **The "Last Word of First Line" Bug:** Students assume the first word of the first line and the last word of the last line must be the answer, regardless of sound.
2. **The "Orthographic Matching" Bug:** Students look for words that *look* alike (same ending letters) rather than sound alike (e.g., they might reject "rain/grain" if they over-focus on the 'r' vs 'g' but might incorrectly pair words like "tough/though").
3. **The "Semantic Association" Bug:** Students pair words that are contextually related rather than phonologically related (e.g., "rain/shelter" or "grain/borrow").
4. **The "Grammar Fixation" Bug:** Correcting the text's grammar ("He had [to] repay") instead of performing the rhyming task.

Step 3: Population Considerations
For Grade 8 students from Hindi-medium backgrounds, "rain" and "grain" are high-frequency English vocabulary often taught in early primary years. The phonological structure /eɪn/ is relatively stable across English and Hindi phonetic mapping. However, the grammatical error in the source text ("He had repay it") may distract students with higher English proficiency, while lower-proficiency students may struggle with the "borrow/tomorrow" pair (which is a slant/eye rhyme in some dialects or requires specific stress patterns), potentially leading them to provide no answer if they find "rain/grain" too simple.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that "rain/grain" is a perfect, simple rhyme with identical orthographic endings (-ain), it bypasses the more complex phonological bugs. The primary barrier is the open-ended nature of the task and potential vocabulary gaps.
