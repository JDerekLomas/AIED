Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recognize the equality of two fractions (rational expressions) and identify "cross-multiplication" as the appropriate strategy.
2. Correctly distribute the denominators across the entire numerators: $5(x-5) = 3(x-3)$.
3. Execute the distributive property on both sides: $5x - 25 = 3x - 9$.
4. Isolate the variable terms ($x$) on one side and constant terms on the other using inverse operations.
5. Perform integer arithmetic correctly (specifically handling the subtraction/signs of $-9$ and $+25$).
6. Divide by the coefficient of $x$ to find the final value.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
- **Partial Distribution:** A very common bug where students multiply only the first term ($5x - 5 = 3x - 3$).
- **Sign Inversion Error:** Incorrectly moving terms across the equals sign (e.g., $5x + 3x$ instead of $5x - 3x$).
- **Cross-multiplication Directionality:** Confusing which numerator goes with which denominator, though usually less fatal if consistent.
- **Arithmetic with Directed Numbers:** Errors in calculating $-9 + 25$ (often resulting in $16$ or $-34$).
- **The "Add-Subtract" Bug:** Thinking that because $3$ is a denominator, they should add it to the other side rather than multiply.

Step 3: Student Context (Grade 8, EWS, Hindi-medium)
For Grade 8 students in this demographic, the transition from arithmetic to symbolic algebra is a major hurdle. The "open-ended" nature of the task means there are no cues (multiple choice) to trigger self-correction. English terminology like "cross-multiplication" may be a barrier if the instruction was not robustly translated into conceptual understanding.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
While the procedure is standard, the combination of the distributive property (Step 2) and integer operations (Step 5) creates a high "error surface." In government school settings where foundational arithmetic is often shaky, the distributive property error alone typically eliminates a significant portion of the cohort.
