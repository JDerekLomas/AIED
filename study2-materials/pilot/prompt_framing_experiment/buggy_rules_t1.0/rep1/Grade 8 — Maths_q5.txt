Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Pattern Recognition: Identify $9/16$ as the common factor across two terms.
2. Factoring (Reverse Distributive Property): Rewrite the expression as $9/16 \times [4/12 + (-3/9)]$.
3. Fraction Reduction/Simplification: Simplify $4/12$ to $1/3$ and $-3/9$ to $-1/3$ to facilitate easier addition (optional but strategic).
4. Signed Fraction Arithmetic: Add $4/12$ and $-3/9$ using a common denominator.
5. Zero Property Recognition: Realize the sum in the parentheses is $0$.
6. Final Multiplication: Multiply $9/16 \times 0$.

Step 2: Buggy Rules/Systematic Errors
- Distributive Bug: Multiplying $9/16$ by only the first term inside the bracket or incorrectly factoring (e.g., $9/16 + [4/12 \times -3/9]$).
- Sign Bug: Ignoring the negative sign in $(-3/9)$, leading to $4/12 + 3/9$.
- Fraction Addition Bug: Adding numerators and denominators directly (e.g., $4/12 + (-3/9) = 1/3$).
- Computational Overload: Attempting to multiply the large fractions first ($36/192$) instead of using the property, increasing the likelihood of arithmetic errors.
- Cancellation Bug: "Cross-canceling" across an addition sign.

Step 3: Population Context
Grade 8 students in this demographic often struggle with "algebraic shorthand" and the transition from rote arithmetic to properties. While "Distributive Property" is a key syllabus term, English-language phrasing in a Hindi-medium context can create a "keyword" barrier where students ignore the property instruction and try direct calculation. The open-ended format removes the safety net of multiple-choice elimination.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the final answer is a simple "0," the rubric specifically requires the correct application of the distributive property. The combination of signed numbers, fraction arithmetic, and the abstraction of factoring makes this a high-error-rate item for the target demographic.
