Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Decoding and Visual Interpretation:** Identify the figure as a parallelogram and map the variables $x$ and $y$ to specific vertices $B$ and $C$ based on the text.
2.  **Property Retrieval:** Recall the relevant geometric theorems for parallelograms (opposite angles are equal; consecutive/adjacent angles are supplementary).
3.  **Equation Formation (for $x$):** If an adjacent angle is given (e.g., $70^\circ$), set up the linear equation $x + 70 = 180$.
4.  **Arithmetic Execution:** Perform the subtraction $180 - 70$ correctly to find $x = 110$.
5.  **Relational Logic (for $y$):** Identify $y$ using the opposite angle property (if $B$ and $D$ are opposite) or consecutive property.
6.  **Justification/Explanation:** Formulate a written explanation in English (or mixed language) explaining the property used (e.g., "Adjacent angles are supplementary").

Step 2: Buggy rules and systematic errors
*   **"All angles equal" bug:** Assuming all angles in a parallelogram are equal (treating it like a square/rectangle), leading to $x = 70$.
*   **"Linear pair only" bug:** Students often only recognize supplementary angles on a straight line and fail to apply it to internal properties of quadrilaterals.
*   **"Opposite = Supplementary" bug:** Swapping properties—thinking opposite angles add to 180 and adjacent angles are equal.
*   **Calculation error:** Common subtraction errors (e.g., $180 - 70 = 90$ or $120$).
*   **Language Barrier:** Failing to provide the "explanation" required by the rubric due to limited English vocabulary, even if the numerical value is correct.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often struggle with multi-step geometry because it moves from concrete measurement to abstract property-based reasoning. The requirement for a written "explanation" is a significant hurdle for Hindi-medium students in an English-medium assessment context, as they may know the "why" but cannot articulate it in the target language.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the calculation is simple, the combination of geometric property recall, the two-variable requirement, and the mandatory written explanation (as per the rubric) significantly lowers the success rate.
