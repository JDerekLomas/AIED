Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Identify a specific person and retrieve relevant attributes (name, traits, or actions).
2. Syntactic Encoding (L2): Construct two distinct sentence structures in English (e.g., Subject-Verb-Complement).
3. Lexical Retrieval: Recall specific English vocabulary for descriptors (e.g., "kind," "tall") and high-frequency verbs ("is," "likes").
4. Morphological Application: Correctly apply Subject-Verb Agreement (e.g., "He is" vs. "He are") and pronoun gender.
5. Orthographic Execution: Apply capitalization, spacing, and terminal punctuation (periods).

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. L1 Interference (Hindi-to-English literal translation): Following SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order instead of SVO (e.g., "My friend name Rahul is").
2. The "Is-Verb" Bug: Inserting "is" before all verbs (e.g., "He is play cricket").
3. Null Copula Bug: Omitting the verb "to be" entirely (e.g., "He my best friend").
4. Generalization of Plurality: Adding "s" to verbs for plural subjects but failing to use the third-person singular "s" (e.g., "He play with me").
5. The "Sentence Boundary" Bug: Writing a single long string of words or a list without clear demarcation into two distinct grammatical sentences.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often face "The Fourth-Grade Slump" in L2 acquisition. In Indian government schools, English is often taught as a set of memorized rules rather than functional communication. An open-ended task (recall) is significantly harder than a multiple-choice task (recognition). While students might know the *concept* of a friend, the rubric's requirement for "grammatically correct" sentences is a high barrier, as a single error in tense or agreement technically disqualifies the student from the "1" score according to a binary rubric.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
Considering the "all-or-nothing" nature of the 1-point rubric and the prevalence of L1 interference and copula errors in this specific demographic:
