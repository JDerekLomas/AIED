Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Draw a straight initial ray using a ruler.
2. Align the protractor’s midpoint (vertex) exactly with the endpoint of the ray.
3. Align the 0° line (baseline) of the protractor perfectly over the ray.
4. Choose the correct scale (inner vs. outer) based on the direction of the ray.
5. Identify the 110°/40° mark on the circular scale.
6. Mark a point at the correct degree measurement.
7. Use a ruler to connect the vertex to the marked point.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- "Center-only Alignment": Aligning the center but ignoring the baseline tilt.
- "Outer-Scale Only": Always using the outer scale regardless of which side the ray points (leading to 70° instead of 110°).
- "Nearest Number": Marking the number 110 even if the scale is increasing in the wrong direction (e.g., marking 70 because it is adjacent to 110 on some protractors).
- "Edge Alignment": Aligning the bottom plastic edge of the protractor rather than the printed 0° line.
- "Inverted Supplementary Bug": Subtracting the target angle from 180 and drawing that instead.

Step 3: Population Considerations
In Grade 6 (approx. age 11-12), fine motor skills for tool manipulation are still developing. In resource-constrained environments, students often use "geometry boxes" with scratched or low-quality transparent plastic protractors. For Hindi-medium students, the English phrasing "having the following angles" may cause slight hesitation, though the numerals are universal. The 110° angle (obtuse) is a high-error item because it requires crossing the 90° perpendicular threshold, which often triggers the "acute-error" bug (drawing 70°).

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Drawing an obtuse angle (110°) is significantly more difficult than an acute one for this demographic due to the dual-scale confusion.
