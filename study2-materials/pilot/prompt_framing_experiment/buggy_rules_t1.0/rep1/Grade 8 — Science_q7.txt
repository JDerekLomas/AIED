Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the scenario (gardener, pit, waste) from English into conceptual models (decomposition/compost).
2.  **Observation Recall**: State the physical change (decomposition/turning into manure/disappearing/darkening).
3.  **Causal Reasoning**: Identify the biological process (decomposition by microorganisms/bacteria/fungi).
4.  **Evaluation of Utility**: Link the resulting product (humus/manure) to soil fertility/nutrient enhancement.
5.  **Syntactic Synthesis**: Formulate a multi-part response in English that addresses "Does...?", "Give reasons," and "Evaluate...".

Step 2: Identified "Buggy Rules"
1.  **Semantic Over-generalization**: Equating "waste" with "garbage" (kachra) generally, leading to an answer about pollution or smell rather than biological transformation.
2.  **The "Dry/Wet" Confusion**: Mistaking decomposition for simple drying out or rotting (negative connotation) without recognizing the chemical change.
3.  **Single-Part Response Bias**: Answering only the first part of a multi-prompt question (answering "Yes" and stopping).
4.  **Microbial Invisibility Bug**: Attributing changes to "nature," "time," or "the sun" because microorganisms are not visible and thus excluded from the causal chain.
5.  **Language-Switching Syntax Error**: Attempting to translate "khad" (manure) but lacking the English vocabulary, leading to "it becomes dirty" or "it goes away."

Step 3: Student Population Considerations
- Grade 8 students are developmentally capable of abstract reasoning about microbes, but English proficiency acts as a significant bottleneck for open-ended "Explain" and "Evaluate" prompts.
- Students from economically weaker backgrounds often have practical knowledge of "khad" (compost), but the formal scientific vocabulary (humus, decomposition) in a second language creates a high cognitive load.
- The 0.5 maximum score suggests a low-stakes or sub-part question, which often leads to brief, underdeveloped answers that fail the "Evaluate" criteria.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is familiar, the requirement to execute three distinct cognitive tasks (observe, reason, evaluate) in a non-native language results in high attrition at each step.
