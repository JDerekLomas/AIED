Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English prompt and identify the "if/then" hypothetical scenario (conditional reasoning).
2. Perform a "perspective shift" (theory of mind) to adopt the persona of a bird.
3. Access internal lexicon to retrieve bird-related vocabulary (fly, sky, wings, nest, seeds).
4. Construct a sentence structure in English (Subject-Verb-Object/Adverb).
5. Apply morphological rules (e.g., first-person singular "I fly" vs. "I flying").
6. Translate the conceptualized thought from Hindi/L1 to English syntax.

Step 2: Common "Buggy Rules"
1. **L1 Syntax Transfer:** Using Hindi word order (S-O-V), resulting in "I sky in fly."
2. **The "Ing" Generalization:** Using "ing" as a universal marker for any action (e.g., "I flying in sky") without the auxiliary "am."
3. **Literalism/Prompt Copying:** Copying the prompt literally due to lack of comprehension (e.g., "Imagine you are a bird").
4. **Vocabulary Mismatch:** Using the word "bird" as the subject instead of "I" (e.g., "Bird fly in sky"), failing the perspective-shift requirement.
5. **Null Copula/Auxiliary:** Dropping "to be" verbs, which are often implicit or handled differently in Hindi.

Step 3: Target Student Population
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often face "cumulative disfluency." While they can conceptualize the bird's day, the gap between their mental L1 representation and English production is wide. Open-ended "recall and construct" tasks are significantly harder than "recognition" tasks for this demographic. The requirement for a "grammatically correct" sentence according to a strict rubric creates a high barrier, as minor errors in articles or prepositions (common in this population) would technically invalidate the score.
