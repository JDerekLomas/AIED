Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the prompt and understand the target definition ("a light wind").
2. Scan the provided passage to identify potential vocabulary candidates.
3. Compare candidate words against the semantic constraints of "light" and "wind" (semantic mapping).
4. Verify that the chosen word exists verbatim in the text (constraint satisfaction).
5. Transcribe the word "breeze" correctly onto the answer sheet.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. **The "Synonym Retrieval" Bug:** Instead of scanning the passage, the student searches their internal mental lexicon for a synonym and provides a word they know (e.g., "air," "cool") that is not actually in the text.
2. **The "First-Match" Bug:** The student identifies any word related to weather or nature (e.g., "storm," "cloud") and selects it without checking for precise semantic alignment.
3. **The "Literalism" Bug:** If the word "wind" appears in the text, the student might simply copy "wind" or an adjacent adjective because they cannot distinguish between the definition and the target word.
4. **Translation Interference:** Students think of the Hindi word "hawa" or "pavan" and attempt to translate it into an English word they know, often resulting in "air" or "blowing."

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **English Proficiency:** For ESL/Hinglish learners, "breeze" is often a "tier 2" or "tier 3" vocabulary word. While common in literature, it is rarely used in daily low-income urban or rural Indian speech.
2. **Recall vs. Recognition:** This is a "fill-in-the-blank" style task without a word bank. Open-ended retrieval from a text increases cognitive load significantly compared to multiple-choice.
3. **Contextual Clues:** Success depends heavily on the complexity of the passage. If the passage describes a beach or a garden, the context helps; if the passage is dense, the search space is too large.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that "breeze" is a specific vocabulary term and the requirement is to locate a needle in a haystack (the passage) based on a definition, students with limited English exposure will likely struggle with the semantic mapping required. Many will provide "air" or "weather" or leave it blank.
