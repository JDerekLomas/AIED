Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Identify variables for axes (Independent: Class, Dependent: Number of children).
2. Draw and label the X-axis (Classes) and Y-axis (Number of children).
3. Determine the range of data and select a mathematically appropriate, consistent scale (e.g., 1:10 or 1:20).
4. Mark equal intervals on the Y-axis based on the chosen scale starting from zero.
5. Draw bars of uniform width with equal spacing between them.
6. Map numerical values to bar heights accurately according to the scale.
7. Interpret the data visually to identify the highest (maximum) and lowest (minimum) values.

Step 2: Buggy Rules/Systematic Errors
1. "Inconsistent Scaling": Changing the value of a grid unit halfway up the Y-axis (e.g., 0, 10, 20, 50, 100) to fit all data points.
2. "Label-Value Confusion": Writing the actual data values on the Y-axis tick marks instead of multiples of the scale.
3. "Origin Omission": Starting the Y-axis at the lowest data value instead of zero without using a break/kink, or misaligning the first bar.
4. "Non-Uniform Width": Drawing bars of different widths based on the length of the class name.
5. "Attribute Swapping": Plotting the number of children on the X-axis and classes on the Y-axis (though technically a bar graph, it often leads to mapping errors).

Step 3: Student Population Context
Grade 7 students in this demographic often face "linguistic interference"; while the math is conceptual, the English instructions ("Represent," "Appropriate scale," "Maximum/Minimum") may be decoded incorrectly. Limited access to graph paper in some government school settings leads to "free-hand" drawing where "consistency" (required by the rubric) is lost. The rubric is strict: a single error in scaling or labeling results in zero marks for the 1-point item.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the high procedural complexity of constructing a graph from scratch (recall and execution) versus mere interpretation, and the strict "all-or-nothing" rubric for part (a), many students will fail on the "consistent scale" requirement even if they understand the concept of a bar graph.
