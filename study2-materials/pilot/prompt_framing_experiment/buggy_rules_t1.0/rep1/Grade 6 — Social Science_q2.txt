Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English sentence structure to identify the core task (Retrieval).
2. Isolate the temporal constraint "medieval period" (12th–18th century).
3. Isolate the geographic constraint "Rajasthan."
4. Access long-term memory to retrieve names of historical figures.
5. Filter names through both constraints (must be Medieval AND from Rajasthan).
6. Recall the specific orthography/phonology of the names to produce them in written form.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. Temporal Displacement Bug: Recalling any famous king regardless of era (e.g., Ashoka, Chandragupta Maurya).
2. Geographic Displacement Bug: Recalling any famous king regardless of region (e.g., Akbar, Shivaji).
3. Protagonist-Antagonist Swap: Identifying the opponent instead of the local ruler (e.g., Alauddin Khalji).
4. Semantic Overgeneralization: Identifying a "famous person" from the region who is not a king (e.g., Meera Bai).
5. Language Interference Bug: Students recognize the names in Hindi but lack the confidence or spelling proficiency to output them in English, leading to omission.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Recall vs. Recognition: The open-ended format is significantly harder for ELL (English Language Learner) students than a multiple-choice format.
2. High Stakes of "Medieval": In Grade 6, students often conflate "Medieval" with "Ancient" or simply "History."
3. Local Content: While Rajasthan's history is culturally salient, the specific academic categorization (Medieval) is a school-based construct that often fails to bridge with home-based storytelling.
4. Scoring Disincentive: A 0.5-point maximum for a multi-step recall task often results in low effort or "skipping" behavior among students with low English confidence.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account the heavy cognitive load of linguistic translation combined with the strict temporal categorization (Medieval), many students will likely provide names of modern freedom fighters or ancient emperors, or leave the item blank due to the English medium.
