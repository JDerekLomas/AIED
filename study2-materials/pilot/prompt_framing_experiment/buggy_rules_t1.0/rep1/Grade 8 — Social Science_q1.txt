Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic decoding: Understand the phrase "Fundamental Rights" (distinct from duties or general laws) in an English-medium assessment context.
2. Retrieval: Access long-term memory for specific categories of rights learned in Civics (e.g., Equality, Freedom, Education).
3. Selection: Identify at least two distinct items from the set of six.
4. Linguistic production: Translate the conceptual memory into written English or acceptable simplified phrasing (e.g., "Right to Equality").
5. Verification: Ensure the two rights are distinct and not overlapping (e.g., not listing "Right to Freedom" and "Right to Speech" as two separate items if the rubric requires distinct categories).

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" or cognitive errors
1. Category Confusion: Providing "Fundamental Duties" (e.g., respecting the flag) or "Human Rights" (e.g., right to water/food) instead of Constitutional Fundamental Rights.
2. Terminology Overgeneralization: Using "Right to Vote" as a Fundamental Right (a common misconception that any legal/political right is a "Fundamental Right").
3. Partial Retrieval/Halt: Recalling only one right and leaving the second blank, or repeating the same right using different words.
4. Phonetic/Orthographic Approximation: Writing "Right to Quality" instead of "Equality" or "Right to Freedom" as "Right to Free," which may fail depending on the strictness of the grader despite the rubric's "simplified phrasing" clause.
5. Translation interference: Translating from Hindi (मौलिक अधिकार) but failing to find the English technical equivalent, leading to vague answers like "all are equal."

Step 3: Student population considerations
- Grade 8 is the peak of Civics instruction on the Constitution in India (NCERT curriculum).
- Limited English proficiency increases the "bottleneck" at the production stage, even if the student understands the concept in Hindi.
- Open-ended recall is significantly harder than multiple-choice recognition for this demographic.
- "Fundamental Rights" is a high-frequency, rote-learned topic in Indian schools, often emphasized through heavy drilling for exams.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the topic is a "staple" of the curriculum, the transition to English-medium testing for Hindi-medium learners, combined with the requirement for two distinct items in a recall format, creates a significant barrier for the bottom two quartiles of the class.
