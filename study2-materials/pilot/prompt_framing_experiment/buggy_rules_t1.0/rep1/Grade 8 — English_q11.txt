Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English prompt and identify the three thematic requirements (appearance, history, community significance).
2. Retrieve or invent specific vocabulary in English related to trees (trunk, branches, shade, ancestors, sacred, etc.).
3. Formulate 5-6 syntactically correct English sentences.
4. Apply grammatical rules (subject-verb agreement, tense consistency—switching between present for appearance and past for history).
5. Organize sentences into a cohesive paragraph structure.
6. Manage the "translation bottleneck" (converting thoughts from Hindi/vernacular to English).

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" / Procedural errors
1. The "Literal Translation Bug": Using Hindi syntax with English words (e.g., "Tree old very is").
2. The "Length-Accuracy Trade-off": Writing only 1-2 sentences to avoid grammatical errors, failing the quantity constraint.
3. The "Aspect Neglect Bug": Focusing entirely on one prompt element (appearance) and omitting the others (history/community).
4. The "Tense Confusion Bug": Using simple present for historical narratives (e.g., "Grandfather plant this tree").
5. The "Vocabulary Substitution Bug": Inserting a Hindi word when the English word is unknown (e.g., "The *chaya* is good").

Step 3: Target student population considerations
Grade 8 students from economically weaker sections often face "English as a foreign language" barriers. In an open-ended recall task (as opposed to multiple choice), the cognitive load of simultaneous composition, grammar, and thematic adherence is high. For many, the transition from basic functional English to descriptive, multi-sentence paragraph writing is a significant hurdle.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The requirement to hit three distinct thematic points while maintaining grammatical integrity over 5-6 sentences in a non-native language makes the "fully correct" criteria (for a 1/1 score) very difficult for this specific demographic.
