Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of "significance" and "reign" within a second-language (English) context.
2. Retrieve specific historical schemas related to Ashoka (Kalinga War, Dhamma, Edicts, or Buddhism).
3. Select two distinct "key aspects" that satisfy the criteria of "significance" (causal impact rather than just biographical facts).
4. Synthesize these facts into an explanatory sentence structure that links his rule to Indian history.
5. Apply English syntax and academic vocabulary to communicate the transformation of his governance.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. **The Nominal Recall Bug**: Students provide a list of names/places (e.g., "Kalinga," "Pataliputra") instead of explaining "significance" (process vs. label).
2. **The "Good King" Generalization**: Using vague moral descriptors ("He was a great/kind king") instead of specific policy/governance shifts (ethical governance).
3. **The Narrative-Procedural Slip**: Recounting the story of the Kalinga war (the *event*) rather than the impact of his reign (the *consequence*).
4. **Linguistic Transliteration Bug**: Attempting to translate complex Hindi concepts of "Dharma" or "shasan" into English and losing the structural coherence required for a 1-point rubric mark.

Step 3: Population Considerations
The open-ended format is high-stakes for ELL (English Language Learner) students. In Grade 7, the jump from "Who was Ashoka?" to "Explain the significance" is a significant cognitive leap. The "economically weaker section" context often implies lower exposure to academic English at home, making the word "significance" a potential "barrier word" that prevents even knowledgeable students from starting the task.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The combination of the linguistic barrier (English-medium assessment for Hindi-medium backgrounds) and the cognitive shift from rote recall to historical significance creates a high failure rate for a "fully correct" response according to a strict rubric.
