Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Arithmetic Addition: Sum the individual quantities (4 and 6) to determine the sample space ($n(S)$).
2. Identification: Correctly isolate the target subset (favorable outcomes, $n(E)$) from the text, distinguishing between "black" and "white."
3. Formula Recall/Application: Apply the classical definition of probability: $P(E) = \frac{n(E)}{n(S)}$.
4. Fractional Construction: Place the favorable outcomes in the numerator and the total in the denominator.
5. (Optional but common) Simplification: Reduce the fraction $4/10$ to $2/5$ or convert to decimal/percentage.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "Ratio as Probability" Bug: Expressing the answer as a ratio of part-to-part ($4/6$ or $4:6$) instead of part-to-whole.
2. "Inverse Probability" Bug: Placing the total in the numerator and favorable outcomes in the denominator ($10/4$).
3. "Attribute Confusion": Selecting the wrong attribute (6 instead of 4) due to reading interference or linguistic confusion between "black" and "white."
4. "Denominator Forgetfulness": Simply writing the count of black balls (4) as the probability.
5. "Operational Interference": Subtracting the values ($6-4=2$) or multiplying them.

Step 3: Population Considerations (Grade 8, EWS, Hindi-medium)
1. Language Barrier: In English-medium assessments, "at random" and "drawn" are technical vocabulary that may mask the underlying math for Hindi-medium students.
2. Contextual Nuance: Probability is often introduced in Grade 7/8 in India; however, systematic mastery of "part-whole" reasoning is often inconsistent in schools where rote memorization of operations is prioritized over conceptual modeling.
3. Open-ended Format: Without multiple-choice options to trigger recognition, students must recall the specific $n(E)/n(S)$ structure, increasing the likelihood of "part-to-part" (4/6) errors.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the arithmetic is simple (4+6), the systematic "bug" of part-to-part ratios ($4/6$) is highly prevalent in this demographic, alongside linguistic hurdles in identifying which number represents the "favorable" outcome in an English-language prompt.
