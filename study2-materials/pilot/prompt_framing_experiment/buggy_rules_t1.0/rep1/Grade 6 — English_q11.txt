Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Parse the English sentence to distinguish between the subject (The children) and the predicate (are playing football).
2. Recognize the linguistic category "verb" within the predicate.
3. Understand the specific technical term "phrase" in a grammatical context (requiring more than one word).
4. Identify the auxiliary verb (are) as part of the action, not a separate entity.
5. Identify the main verb (playing) and its participle form.
6. Isolate the verb phrase from the object (football) to avoid over-inclusion.
7. Transcribe the selection correctly into the answer space.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. **The "Action-Only" Bug:** Identifying only the lexical verb ("playing") and ignoring the auxiliary, based on a simplified definition of verbs as "doing words."
2. **The "Single Word" Bug:** Due to limited English proficiency, students often equate "a verb" with "one word," leading them to exclude "are."
3. **The "Predicate-as-Verb" Bug:** Identifying everything after the subject ("are playing football") as the verb phrase, failing to distinguish the verb from the direct object.
4. **The "First-Verb-Only" Bug:** Identifying "are" as the verb because it is the first functional word encountered after the subject.
5. **The "Keyword" Bug:** Translating "playing" to Hindi ("khel rahe") but failing to map the two-part English structure back to the specific term "verb phrase."

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Linguistic Interference:** In Hindi, the auxiliary functions differently (post-positional), making the "are playing" construction a common point of confusion.
2. **Technical Vocabulary:** "Verb phrase" is a metalinguistic term that is often less emphasized in ESL/EFL classrooms than simple identification of "the verb."
3. **Recall vs. Recognition:** Without multiple-choice options, students lack the "scaffolding" to see "are playing" as a cohesive unit, increasing the likelihood of "playing" or "are playing football" being the provided answer.
