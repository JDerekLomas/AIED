Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English text to identify the plant (Pitcher plant) and the specific sub-question (a) regarding "mode of nutrition."
2. Retrieve the specific scientific term "insectivorous" or "heterotrophic/insectivorous" from long-term memory.
3. Translate the internal conceptual understanding into the specific English technical term required by the rubric.
4. Correctly map the "trap-like structure" to the functional category of nutrition rather than a structural or habitat-based description.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. "Category Confusion": Providing the name of the plant (Pitcher plant) or its part (Leaf) instead of the *mode* of nutrition.
2. "Functional Over-generalization": Stating "Photosynthesis" as the mode because the prompt mentions it is green, ignoring the "special" qualifier.
3. "Phonetic/Orthographic Approximation": Producing "insectivorus," "insecti," or "insat-eating," which may be marked incorrect depending on the rigidity of the "Correctly identifies" rubric.
4. "Linguistic Interference": Conceptualizing the answer in Hindi (कीटभक्षी - Keetbhakshi) but failing to retrieve the English equivalent "Insectivorous."

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 7 students from economically weaker sections often face a "vocabulary gap." While they may understand the concept (the plant eats bugs), the requirement for a specific technical term ("insectivorous") in a second language (English) without a word bank (recall vs. recognition) is a high cognitive load. In many Indian government school contexts, science is transitioned to English in middle school, making technical recall a significant barrier.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The combination of requiring a specific polysyllabic English term and the common confusion between "process" (photosynthesis) and "special mode" (insectivorous) suggests a high error rate.
