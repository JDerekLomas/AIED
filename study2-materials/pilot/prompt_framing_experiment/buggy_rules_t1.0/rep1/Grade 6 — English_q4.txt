Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of the phrase "shining brightly."
2. Scan the provided text passage to locate potential synonyms or related descriptive terms.
3. Apply a matching rule to evaluate if a word in the text (e.g., "glowing") satisfies the semantic equivalence of the target phrase.
4. Verify the grammatical form (e.g., ensuring an adjective/participle is matched with the phrase).
5. Transcribe the word accurately from the text to the answer sheet.

Step 2: Buggy rules (Systematic procedural errors)
1. **Keyword Over-reliance:** Searching only for words that look like "shining" (e.g., words starting with 's') rather than focusing on meaning.
2. **First-Match Heuristic:** Selecting the first descriptive adjective found in the text regardless of its specific meaning.
3. **Contextual Association Bug:** Choosing a noun associated with light in the passage (e.g., "sun," "lamp") instead of the required adjective/verb.
4. **Literal Translation Gap:** For Hindi-medium students, mentally translating "shining brightly" into a single Hindi concept (like *chamak*) and then failing to find the precise English equivalent "glowing," instead selecting a more common but incorrect word like "bright" or "light."
5. **Copying Error:** Identifying the word correctly but misspelling it or changing the suffix (e.g., "glow" instead of "glowing").

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students in this demographic often struggle with vocabulary-heavy tasks that lack multiple-choice scaffolds (recognition vs. recall). While "shining" is a common word, "glowing" is a Tier 2 vocabulary word. In Hindi-medium contexts, the nuance between different types of light is often lost in English instruction.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the open-ended nature of the task, the linguistic shift from Hindi to English, and the precision required to match a specific word from a passage without prompts, the success rate is likely to be below the median.
