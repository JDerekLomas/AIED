Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English text to identify the target digit (5) and the number (7560).
2. Identify the position of the digit 5 within the number by mapping it to a place value column (Units/Ones, Tens, Hundreds, Thousands).
3. Distinguish between "face value" (5) and "place value" (500).
4. Translate the positional concept into the required output format (either the number 500 or the English word "Hundreds").

Step 2: Buggy Rules/Common Errors
- **Face Value Bug:** Providing the digit itself (5) instead of its positional value.
- **Column Misalignment Bug:** Counting from left-to-right (Thousands as Ones), leading to an answer of "Tens" or 50.
- **Zero-Padding Bug:** Adding an incorrect number of zeros (e.g., 50 or 5000) due to weak grasp of the base-10 positional multiplier.
- **Language Interference:** Misinterpreting the word "place" as "position" in a list (e.g., "second") or failing to recall the specific English term "Hundreds" despite understanding the concept in Hindi (Sainkada).

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 6 students in this demographic often struggle with the transition from intuitive arithmetic to formal mathematical vocabulary in English. Since this is an open-ended recall task, students cannot rely on cues from multiple-choice options. The distinction between "place value" and "face value" is a notorious point of confusion in primary mathematics across Indian curricula.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the concept is foundational, the combination of English-language terminology, the potential for face-value errors, and the lack of scaffolding in an open-ended format significantly reduces the success rate.
