Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English prompt into a mental representation (likely in Hindi) while navigating academic vocabulary ("colonial rule," "tribal communities," "distinct").
2.  **Historical Retrieval**: Access long-term memory to recall specific impacts of British policies on tribes (e.g., Forest Acts, shifting cultivation bans).
3.  **Concept Discrimination**: Differentiate between "tribal" experiences and general Indian peasantry experiences to ensure specificity.
4.  **Structural Synthesis**: Formulate a "general explanation" followed by "two distinct examples" as per the prompt.
5.  **Output Generation**: Transliterate or translate the internal Hindi thought into a written English response that satisfies the rubric's "clear explanation" criteria.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1.  **The "Keyword Matching" Bug**: Writing everything known about "British rule" or "History" without filtering for "Tribes," leading to irrelevant generalities.
2.  **The "Copy-Prompt" Bug**: Rephrasing the question as a statement ("British rule affected tribal lives in many ways") without providing the "how" or the examples.
3.  **The "Linguistic Substitution" Bug**: Using incorrect English words that change the meaning (e.g., using "forests" when they mean "farmers") due to limited vocabulary.
4.  **The "Non-Distinct Example" Bug**: Providing two examples that are conceptually identical (e.g., "They lost land" and "The British took their land"), failing the "distinct" requirement.
5.  **The "Recall-Recognition Gap" Bug**: In an open-ended format, students may recognize the answer in a multiple-choice setting but fail to generate the specific terms (e.g., "Jhum cultivation") from scratch.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 8 students from economically weaker sections in India often face a "double burden": low literacy levels in their native tongue and significant "English Language Learner" (ELL) barriers. The transition from Grade 5 (primary) to Grade 8 (upper primary) involves a jump in abstract reasoning that many students haven't mastered. Furthermore, Social Science is often taught via rote memorization; if this specific phrasing wasn't in the "back-of-chapter" questions, performance drops significantly.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The requirement for a "clear explanation" plus "two distinct examples" for only 1 mark is a high cognitive load for this demographic. The barrier of English proficiency combined with the need for specific historical recall (rather than recognition) suggests a low success rate.
