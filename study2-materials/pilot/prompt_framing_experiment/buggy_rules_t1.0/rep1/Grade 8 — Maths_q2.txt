Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Horizontal setup of the product: $(3a - 2b) \times (2a + 3b)$.
2. Application of the distributive property (FOIL or splitting the first binomial): $3a(2a + 3b) - 2b(2a + 3b)$.
3. Term-by-term multiplication involving coefficients: $(3 \times 2)$ and $(2 \times 3)$.
4. Term-by-term multiplication involving literal symbols/exponents: $(a \times a = a^2)$ and $(b \times b = b^2)$.
5. Correct sign management, particularly the distribution of the negative sign from the second term $(-2b \times 3b)$.
6. Identification of "like terms" ($ab$ and $ba$) for simplification.
7. Arithmetic addition/subtraction of signed coefficients ($+9ab - 4ab$).

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. **Partial Distribution:** Multiplying only the first terms $(3a \times 2a)$ and last terms $(-2b \times 3b)$, ignoring the inner/outer products.
2. **Exponential Blindness:** Writing $3a \times 2a$ as $6a$ instead of $6a^2$.
3. **Sign Detachment:** Treating $-2b$ as $2b$ during distribution, leading to $+6ab$ and $+6b^2$.
4. **Concatentation Error:** Adding coefficients and variables incorrectly, e.g., $3a + 2a = 5a^2$ or $9ab - 4ab = 5$.
5. **Literal Confusion:** Failing to recognize that $ab$ and $ba$ are like terms due to alphabetical order.

Step 3: Population Context
Grade 8 students in this demographic often struggle with "symbolic fluency." Because the medium of instruction is often a transition from Hindi to English, the "grammar" of algebra (the invisible multiplication signs and exponent rules) is frequently misinterpreted as rote memorization rather than logical rules. The open-ended format removes the possibility of "back-solving" from options, placing a high cognitive load on retrieval.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the procedure is standard, the requirement for a "fully correct" answer (all signs, exponents, and coefficients perfect) is a high bar. A single error in any of the seven steps results in a score of 0. In this specific socio-economic and linguistic context, the "bug" of sign management combined with the "bug" of forgetting exponents ($a^2$) typically accounts for a high failure rate.
