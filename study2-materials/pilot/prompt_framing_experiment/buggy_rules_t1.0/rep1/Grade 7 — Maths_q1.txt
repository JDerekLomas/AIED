Step 1: Specific procedural steps:
1. Recall the basic multiplication fact for $3 \times 4$.
2. Identify the signs of both integers (negative and negative).
3. Recall the specific sign rule for multiplication of integers (as distinct from addition/subtraction rules).
4. Apply the rule $(- \times - = +)$ to the product.

Step 2: Common "buggy rules":
1. **Rule Confusion (Sign of the Sum):** Applying the rule for addition to multiplication (e.g., "negative and negative stays negative"), leading to $-12$.
2. **Absolute Value Predominance:** Ignoring the signs entirely and providing the magnitude (which happens to result in the correct answer here by coincidence, though often penalized if steps are shown incorrectly).
3. **Visual Interference:** Misinterpreting the parentheses or the $\times$ symbol as a prompt for addition/subtraction (e.g., $-3 - 4 = -7$).
4. **Incorrect Fact Retrieval:** Basic multiplication error (e.g., $3 \times 4 = 7$ or $15$).

Step 3: Population considerations:
1. **Language Barrier:** In Hindi-medium contexts, the "minus-minus plus" mnemonic is often chanted ($-$ $-$ $+$), but without deep conceptual understanding, it is frequently misapplied to addition problems, leading to reciprocal confusion in multiplication.
2. **Open-ended Format:** Requires active retrieval of the rule rather than choosing from options, which increases the likelihood of "sign errors," the most common systematic error in Grade 7 algebra/arithmetic.
3. **Socio-economic context:** Limited access to remedial support means "buggy rules" often go uncorrected for years.

Step 4: Holistic Analysis:
While $3 \times 4$ is a simple fact, the transition to integer operations in Grade 7 is a notorious "bottleneck" topic. Systematic errors involving sign confusion are high in this demographic. However, the coincidence that a student who ignores signs entirely will still reach "12" slightly inflates the success rate compared to a problem like $(-3) \times (4)$.
