Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the sentence structure, specifically resolving the grammatical inconsistency of "the one major landforms" (singular vs. plural).
2. Retrieve geographical facts specific to the state of Rajasthan from long-term memory (Recall).
3. Select one specific feature (Thar Desert or Aravalli Hills) that fits the "major landform" category.
4. Synthesize a brief description in English (subject-verb-object structure, specific vocabulary like "sand," "dunes," "rainfall," or "oldest mountains").

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. "State-City Confusion": Identifying "Jaipur" or "Desert" as a city/state rather than a landform.
2. "Language-Switching Gap": Knowing the concept in Hindi (Marusthal) but being unable to retrieve or spell the English equivalent (Thar Desert).
3. "Description-Omission": Providing the name but failing to describe it, or providing a description that lacks a defining attribute (e.g., "It is in Rajasthan").
4. "Category Error": Listing a climate characteristic (hot/dry) instead of a physical landform.

Step 3: Population considerations:
Grade 6 students in this demographic often struggle with open-ended recall compared to multiple-choice. Limited English proficiency acts as a significant barrier to "briefly describing," even if the geographical concept is understood. The 0.5-point weight suggests a low-stakes item where students might not invest high cognitive effort in the descriptive component.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While "Thar Desert" is a high-frequency fact, the combination of the descriptive requirement and the English language barrier for Hindi-medium students significantly reduces the "fully correct" rate.
