Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Subtract the constant (+2) from both sides of the equation (inverse operations).
2. Perform the arithmetic subtraction (10 - 2 = 8).
3. Divide both sides by the coefficient of x (4).
4. Perform the arithmetic division (8 / 4 = 2).

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- "Operation Swap": Moving a term to the other side without changing the sign (e.g., 4x = 10 + 2).
- "Variable Detachment": Treating the 4 in 4x as an independent constant to be subtracted (e.g., x + 2 = 10 - 4).
- "Left-to-Right Processing": Adding 4x and 2 to get 6x (conflating coefficients and constants).
- "Partial Inverse": Dividing only the right side by 4 while leaving the 2 untouched, or dividing the 2 but not the 10.
- "Incomplete Processing": Stopping after the first step (finding 4x = 8) and not solving for x.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 7 is the introductory phase for formal two-step algebraic manipulation in the NCERT curriculum.
- Hindi-medium students often struggle with "Solve for x" phrasing if the English instruction is not reinforced with the term "मान ज्ञात कीजिए" (find the value).
- Students from EWS backgrounds often rely on rote memorization of "rules of thumb" (like "side change, sign change") which are highly susceptible to "buggy" execution when the conceptual foundation of equality is weak.
- The open-ended nature removes the "plug-and-test" strategy available in multiple-choice formats.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the transition from arithmetic to algebraic thinking at this grade level and the commonality of the "additive-multiplicative" conflation bug, the success rate is typically moderate.
