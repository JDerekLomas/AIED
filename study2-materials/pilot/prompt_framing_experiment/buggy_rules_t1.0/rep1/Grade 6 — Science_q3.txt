Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English command "Differentiate" and "characteristics" into functional concepts (finding differences/features).
2. **Retrieval**: Access stored biological schemas for "living" vs "non-living" from long-term memory.
3. **Selection**: Identify exactly two distinct features for each category that are scientifically valid.
4. **Structural Mapping**: Organize the answer in a comparative format (e.g., a table or "Living things... whereas non-living...") to satisfy the "differentiate" prompt.
5. **Production**: Encode the retrieved biological concepts into written English sentences.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **The "Movement" Bug**: Defining life solely by visible locomotion (e.g., "living things move"), leading to errors with plants (stationary) or clouds/vehicles (moving).
2. **The "Binary" Bug**: Providing a characteristic for living things but failing to provide the converse for non-living (e.g., "Living things grow," but omitting "Non-living things do not grow").
3. **The "Example-as-Definition" Bug**: Providing a list of objects (dog, stone) instead of abstract characteristics (reproduction, growth).
4. **The "Semantic Overlap" Bug**: Listing two characteristics that are functionally the same to the student (e.g., "they eat food" and "they get energy"), which may be marked as only one point.
5. **The "Translation" Bug**: Using Hindi phonetic approximations or incorrect English syntax that obscures the scientific meaning.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 is the transition year where science becomes more formal. For students in economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency, the "Double Burden" (content + language) is high. While "living vs. non-living" is a foundational topic, the requirement for *two* characteristics for *each* (total of four data points) in an open-ended recall format is significantly harder than a multiple-choice recognition task. The low rubric weight (0.5 marks) often leads to low effort or "shorthand" answers that fail to meet the formal "differentiation" criteria.
