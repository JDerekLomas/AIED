Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Visual Recognition: Correct identifies the specific iconography in the image (likely idols of Isar and Gangaur) and distinguishes them from other Rajasthani deity idols.
2. Retrieval: Recalls the specific proper noun "Gangaur" or "Dhinga Gavar" from long-term memory (Recall vs. Recognition).
3. Linguistic Encoding (L1 to L2): Translates the conceptual understanding into written English (as per the medium of instruction for the test, despite Hindi background).
4. Procedural Description: Formulates a sentence or phrase describing the ritual (e.g., worship by women, processions, or making clay idols).

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. Generalization Bug: Labeling any Rajasthani festival as "Teej" because both involve similar female-centric rituals and traditional attire.
2. Labeling Bug: Providing a description of the activity (e.g., "puja") instead of the specific proper noun required by the rubric.
3. Spelling/Phonetic Bug: Inability to map the Hindi sounds of "Gangaur" to English graphemes, leading to unrecognizable strings that might fail a strict rubric.
4. Descriptive Omission: Identifying the festival but failing to provide the "how" due to the high cognitive load of writing in a second language.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often have high "oral" cultural knowledge but low "academic" literacy in English. An open-ended recall question is significantly harder than a multiple-choice question. The 0.5-point weight suggests students might perceive the question as low-stakes and put in less effort for the descriptive part.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement for both a specific proper noun recall and a written description in a second language, many students will either provide a vague answer or misidentify the festival as the more colloquially common "Teej."
