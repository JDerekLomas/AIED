Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the syntax of the question (noting the grammatical error "Why the king felt..." vs "Why did the king feel...").
2. Retrieve the specific narrative schema from Leo Tolstoy's "Three Questions" (NCERT Grade 7 curriculum).
3. Map the concept of "failure" to the acquisition of the three specific pieces of knowledge (time, people, action).
4. Synthesize the causal link: Knowing these three things leads to perfect decision-making, which precludes failure.
5. Formulate a response in English that meets the rubric's requirement for 2-3 sentences.
6. Translate internal conceptual understanding (likely in Hindi/Hinglish) into English syntax and vocabulary.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. **Keyword Matching Bug**: Searching the text for "never fail" and copying the nearest sentence without explaining the underlying logic.
2. **Grammar Interference Bug**: Applying Hindi sentence structure to English (e.g., "King thought that if he know...").
3. **The "Three-List" Bug**: Listing the three questions but failing to address the "Why" (the causal link to avoiding failure).
4. **Verb Tense Confusion**: Mixing "know/knew" and "feel/felt" due to the incorrect phrasing in the prompt's question stem.
5. **Briefness Bias**: Providing a one-word or one-phrase answer (e.g., "Because he is king") despite the 2-3 sentence requirement.

Step 3: Population Considerations
The open-ended nature of the question is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice for ESL students. In the context of Indian government schools, students often struggle with "Explain" prompts because they require productive language skills rather than receptive ones. The lack of "did" in the question's auxiliary position may also confuse students regarding the required tense of the answer.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the story is a core part of the syllabus, the combination of required recall, causal explanation, and English sentence construction for a 1-mark item creates a high cognitive load that often results in partial or incoherent responses.
