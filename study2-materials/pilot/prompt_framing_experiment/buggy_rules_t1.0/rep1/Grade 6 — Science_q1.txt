Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English text to understand the physical setup (two bar magnets, North pole facing North pole).
2. Retrieve the conceptual rule of magnetism ("Like poles repel; unlike poles attract").
3. Map the specific scenario (North-North) to the "Like poles" category.
4. Recall the specific term for the interaction ("repel" or "push away").
5. Construct a coherent sentence or phrase in English to express the outcome.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. "Attraction Default": Applying a universal rule that magnets "stick together" regardless of orientation (overgeneralizing the property of magnetism).
2. "Opposites Rule Inversion": Systematically confusing the words "repel" and "attract" while understanding they are opposites.
3. "North-South Hierarchy": Assuming North is "stronger" or "positive" and South is "weaker" or "negative," leading to an incorrect deduction that two "positive" poles would join.
4. "Linguistic Substitution": Understanding the concept but being unable to recall the specific English word "repel," leading to a blank response or an irrelevant description in Hindi.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 6 is often the first year where formal physics terms (like "repel") are introduced in English.
- Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may grasp the concept (प्रतिकर्षण / dur hatna) but struggle with the English production required by an open-ended format.
- "North pole" and "North pole" are repetitive, which can lead to "skimming errors" where the student misses that the poles are the same.

Step 4: Holistic Estimation
While the concept is fundamental, the combination of English language production, the transition from intuitive "magnets stick" logic to formal physics, and the open-ended nature of the question (no options to choose from) creates significant hurdles for this specific demographic.
