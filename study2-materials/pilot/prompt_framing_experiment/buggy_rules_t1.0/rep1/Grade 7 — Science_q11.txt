Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Read and interpret the table: Map the column headers ("Liquid") to the row data.
2.  Understand the inverse relationship: Recognize that in the context of "evaporation speed," a *smaller* numerical value (time) represents a *faster* process.
3.  Compare decimal/whole numbers: Compare 5 minutes, 20 minutes, and 45 minutes to identify the minimum value.
4.  Execute the selection: Identify "Liquid A" (or "Petrol") as the correspondent to the minimum value (5).
5.  Language processing: Decode the English question "Which liquid evaporates the fastest?" and link the superlative "fastest" to the concept of "least time."

Step 2: Buggy rules
1.  "Larger is Faster" Bug: Students often associate the "highest" number with the "best" or "most" of a quality (e.g., 45 is the biggest number, so it must be the fastest). This is a common reversal error in rate/time problems.
2.  Literal Translation Bug: Students from Hindi backgrounds may struggle with the superlative "-est" in English, potentially confusing "fastest" with "last" or "most."
3.  Table-Reading Bug: Selecting the first item in the list or the item they are most familiar with (Water) regardless of data.
4.  Terminology Confusion: Confusing "evaporation" with "boiling" or "volume," leading to incorrect logic.

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 7 students in this demographic often have high "procedural fluency" in rote calculation but struggle with "functional thinking" (relationships between variables). The open-ended format prevents guessing. The inverse relationship (lower time = higher speed) is a major cognitive hurdle for students who are still developing proportional reasoning.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the calculation (comparing 5, 20, 45) is trivial, the conceptual mapping of "Fastest = Lowest Number" is a high-frequency failure point. In the context of limited English proficiency and the tendency to associate "more" with "higher," a significant portion of the cohort will select Liquid C (45) as the "fastest."
