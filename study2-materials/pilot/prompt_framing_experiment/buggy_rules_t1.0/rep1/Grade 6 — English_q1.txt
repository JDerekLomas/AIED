Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English question (identifying "Where," "find," and "old book" as keywords).
2. Retrieve the specific location from memory (textual recall of the story).
3. Translate the mental concept of "attic" (often an unfamiliar concept/word in Indian urban/rural contexts) into the English term.
4. Formulate an answer (ranging from a single word to a complete sentence).
5. Apply English syntax rules (e.g., converting "find" to "found" if writing a full sentence).

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. Keyword Matching Error: Searching for "where" and "book" but grabbing the wrong location (e.g., "in the school" or "on the table") based on real-world schemas rather than text.
2. Conceptual Substitution: Replacing "attic" with a more familiar but incorrect local term like "store room" or "roof," which may not match the rubric.
3. Syntax-Tense Mismatch: Answering "She find it in attic" or "She is find in attic."
4. Phonetic/Orthographic Bug: Spelling "attic" as "atic," "attick," or "atick" due to L1 interference.
5. Wh-Interpretation Bug: Confusing "Where" with "When" or "Who" due to limited English proficiency.

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often face a "vocabulary gap." The word "attic" is culturally specific to Western architecture; many Indian students live in dwellings without attics, making the word an abstract label rather than a concrete concept. In Hindi-medium backgrounds, the transition to English-medium assessment in Grade 6 often reveals significant gaps in "search-and-find" literacy vs. actual comprehension.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric is generous (accepting one-word answers), the combination of the specific vocabulary hurdle ("attic"), the recall-heavy nature of the question, and the linguistic transition of the demographic suggests a significant failure rate.
