Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Identify the need to isolate $y$ by moving $+9$ to the other side of the equation.
2. Apply the inverse operation (transposition), changing $+9$ to $-9$.
3. Execute the integer subtraction: $4 - 9$.
4. Apply the rule for subtracting a larger positive integer from a smaller one to arrive at $-5$.

Step 2: Buggy rules:
1. **Commutative Property Error (Subtraction):** Student performs $9 - 4$ instead of $4 - 9$ because they instinctively subtract the smaller number from the larger (Common in transition from arithmetic to algebra). Result: $y = 5$.
2. **Operator Preservation (Sign change bug):** Student moves the number but fails to change the sign. Result: $y = 13$.
3. **Inappropriate Operation:** Student sees addition and assumes the solution must involve addition regardless of transposition. Result: $y = 13$.
4. **Absolute Value Bias:** Student calculates the difference correctly (5) but neglects the negative sign, assuming values in basic equations should be positive.

Step 3: Population factors:
- Grade 8 students in this demographic often face "learning gaps" where foundational integer operations (introduced in Grade 6/7) remain insecure.
- Language barrier: While the equation is symbolic, the instruction "Find the value" may be less familiar than "Solve," though the symbolic nature minimizes this.
- Open-ended format: No multiple-choice options to trigger "recognition" of a negative result, forcing reliance on pure retrieval of rules.

Step 4: Holistic estimate:
Given the high prevalence of the "smaller-from-larger" bug and the common difficulty with negative integers in government school settings (NAS data often shows a sharp drop in performance on integer operations), a significant portion of students will likely provide "5" or "13" as the answer.
