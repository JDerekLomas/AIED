Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English text to understand the geographical constraint (Rajasthan) and the specific query (main occupations).
2. Retrieve specific factual knowledge about the economy of Rajasthan from memory (Recall).
3. Filter general rural occupations to match the specific climatic and regional context of Rajasthan (e.g., distinguishing from coastal or mountain occupations).
4. Select two occupations that meet the rubric's threshold.
5. Select one of the two for further elaboration.
6. Retrieve and synthesize a descriptive sentence in English/Hindi-English (Hinglish) that explains the "how" or "what" of that occupation.
7. Encode the final answer into written text.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. **The "Generalization Bug":** Students provide universal rural occupations (e.g., "Fishing" or "IT") without filtering for the specific geography of Rajasthan.
2. **The "Single-Item Termination Bug":** Students provide only one occupation because they are accustomed to "What is..." questions, missing the plural requirement for full marks.
3. **The "List-Only Bug":** Students list two items but fail to perform the second procedural half of the question ("Describe any one").
4. **The "Language Barrier Block":** Students know the answer in Hindi (Krishi/Pashupalan) but cannot retrieve the English terminology, leading to an empty response or a code-switching error that may be marked wrong depending on the strictness of the evaluator.
5. **The "Definition vs. Description" Bug:** Students provide a synonym instead of a description (e.g., "Agriculture means farming").

Step 3: Population Considerations
7th-grade students from economically weaker sections often have high exposure to "Animal Husbandry" and "Agriculture" in their daily lives, which aids conceptual recall. However, the requirement to produce an open-ended English description is a high-threshold task for students from Hindi-medium backgrounds. The "Maximum score: 1" indicates a binary marking scheme where failing any sub-part (naming two OR describing one) results in a zero.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the content is culturally relevant, the combination of a multi-part instruction (Name 2 + Describe 1) and the English language barrier significantly increases the "bug" surface area for this population.
