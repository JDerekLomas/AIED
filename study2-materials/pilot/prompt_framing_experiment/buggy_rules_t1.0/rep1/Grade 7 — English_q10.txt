Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Identify and remove quotation marks/commas.
2. Insert the linker "that" (optional but standard in Indian pedagogy).
3. Apply the Pronoun Change rule (First person 'I' → Third person 'she' based on the subject).
4. Apply the Tense Change rule (Backshift from Present Continuous 'am reading' → Past Continuous 'was reading').
5. Maintain the reporting verb 'said' and correct word order.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- **The "Copy-Paste" Bug:** Students keep the quotation marks or fail to remove the comma.
- **The "Static Pronoun" Bug:** Students keep "I" because they do not understand the shift in perspective or the grammatical rule of "S-O-N" (Subject-Object-No change).
- **The "Tense Blindness" Bug:** Students keep "am reading" or "is reading" (incorrectly matching the new subject but failing the backshift).
- **The "Ing-Form" Confusion:** Students might change the tense but lose the progressive aspect (e.g., "she read" or "she had read").
- **The "Reporting Verb" Bug:** Changing "said" to "told" without an object (e.g., "She told that..."), which is common in Indian English learners.

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 7 students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds often treat English grammar as a set of disconnected memorized formulas. In an open-ended format, the cognitive load of simultaneous pronoun and tense shifting is high. For Hindi speakers, the concept of "backshifting" tense in indirect speech is not intuitive because Hindi often retains the original tense in indirect reporting (e.g., *Usne kaha ki woh novel padh rahi hai*).

Step 4: Holistic Analysis
While the sentence is "simple," the success requires a "perfect string" of four distinct transformations. Errors in any one (especially the pronoun shift or the tense backshift) result in a score of 0. Given the linguistic interference from Hindi and the reliance on recall over recognition, the "buggy" rate for the tense shift alone is historically high in this demographic.
