Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the English prompt ("key features," "Constitution").
2. Retrieve the specific semantic category of "Indian Constitution" from long-term memory.
3. Isolate at least one technical term associated with the category (e.g., Secularism, Federalism).
4. Translate the retrieved concept back into English or a recognizable transliterated form.
5. Transcribe the term onto the answer sheet.

Step 2: Buggy rules:
1. Semantic Overgeneralization: Confusing "Features" with "Preamble contents" or "Fundamental Duties" (treating all civics vocabulary as one interchangeable set).
2. Concept Narrowing: Providing a specific Right (e.g., "Right to Education") instead of the feature "Fundamental Rights," which may fail depending on the examiner's strictness.
3. Keyword Mismatch: Recalling a related but incorrect noun (e.g., "Democracy" instead of "Parliamentary Democracy" or "Republic" instead of "Federalism").
4. Orthographic/Phonetic Interference: Spelling the term so incorrectly (due to English being a second/third language) that it becomes unrecognizable (e.g., "Secular" becoming "Secularism" vs. "Sular").

Step 3: Population considerations: 
Grade 8 students in this demographic often rely on rote memorization of "one-word" answers. While the open-ended format is harder than MCQ, the rubric is extremely "low-floor," requiring only a single correct term. The English barrier is the primary bottleneck, but the high frequency of these terms in textbook headers acts as a compensatory factor.

Step 4: Holistic analysis:
The simplicity of the rubric (requiring only one feature) significantly offsets the linguistic and cognitive hurdles. Most students will have memorized at least one "buzzword" like "Fundamental Rights" or "Secularism" even if they do not fully comprehend the underlying political theory.
