Step 1: Procedural steps required:
1. Recall and apply the area formula for a rectangle ($L \times W = 5 \times 4$).
2. Execute the multiplication to find $20$.
3. Recall and apply the area formula for a square ($S \times S = 5 \times 5$).
4. Execute the multiplication to find $25$.
5. Compare the two values to identify which is "greater."
6. Subtract the smaller value from the larger value ($25 - 20$) to determine "by how much."
7. Maintain consistent units (sq.cm) throughout (though often ignored in a 1-point rubric).

Step 2: Potential "Buggy Rules":
- **Area-Perimeter Confusion:** Calculating $2(L+W)$ or $4S$ instead of area (extremely common in Grade 6).
- **Additive Reasoning:** Adding dimensions instead of multiplying ($5+4=9$ and $5+5=10$).
- **Single-Operation Error:** Providing only the area values but failing to perform the comparison/subtraction required by "by how much."
- **Language Interference:** Misinterpreting "greater" or "by how much" due to limited English proficiency (LEP), leading to an incomplete answer.
- **Formula Misapplication:** Squaring the rectangle's dimensions or multiplying $5 \times 4 \times 5$.

Step 3: Population Considerations:
- **Language Gap:** "By how much" is a specific linguistic construction that may be difficult for Hindi-medium students to translate into the required subtraction operation.
- **Cognitive Load:** The 1-point rubric is punishing; any single error in the multi-step process results in a score of 0.
- **Recall vs. Recognition:** The open-ended format prevents students from using "back-solving" or elimination strategies.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment:
While the multiplication is simple, the combination of potential area-perimeter confusion, the linguistic barrier of a multi-part question in English, and the "all-or-nothing" rubric significantly lowers the success rate for this specific demographic.
