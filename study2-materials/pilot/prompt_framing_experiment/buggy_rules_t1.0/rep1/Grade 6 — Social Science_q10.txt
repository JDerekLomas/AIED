Step 1: Specific Procedural Steps
1. Language Decoding: Translate the English prompt into Hindi/native conceptual framework to identify the geographic and thematic constraints (Rajasthan + Fairs/Festivals).
2. Retrieval: Access long-term memory to retrieve at least two distinct names (e.g., Pushkar Mela, Gangaur, Teej).
3. Selection/Constraint Satisfaction: Verify that the retrieved items are "important" and specific to Rajasthan (not pan-Indian like Diwali/Eid, though the rubric might be lenient here).
4. Transcription (Naming): Write the names of the two items.
5. Functional Description: Select one of the two named items and retrieve a specific fact regarding its "attraction" or "significance."
6. Sentence Construction: Synthesize the fact into a coherent sentence in English (the medium of the test).

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. The "List-Only" Bug: Students provide the names but ignore the second half of the prompt (the description), a common error in multi-part open-ended questions.
2. The "Generic Festival" Bug: Students list pan-Indian festivals (Holi, Diwali) because they are "celebrated in Rajasthan," failing to recognize the implicit requirement for state-specific cultural markers.
3. The "Translation/Syntax" Bug: Students know the significance in Hindi but produce an unintelligible English sentence, leading to a loss of the single available point if the rubric is strictly applied.
4. The "Semantic Overgeneralization" Bug: Providing a description that applies to any festival (e.g., "It is celebrated with joy") rather than a specific "main attraction."
5. The "Partial Execution" Bug: Naming only one festival instead of two due to cognitive load during the writing process.

Step 3: Population Considerations
The requirement for recall (no options provided) significantly increases difficulty compared to multiple-choice. For English Language Learners (ELLs) from economically weaker sections, the barrier is rarely the knowledge of the festivals (which are culturally salient) but the "Description" step in English. Since the rubric requires a correct description for the full 1 mark, many students who know the festivals will fail the linguistic/structural demand of the second half.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While many students will know "Pushkar" or "Teej," the combination of naming two, the requirement for a specific attraction, and the English-medium output constraint creates a high probability of "buggy" partial responses.
