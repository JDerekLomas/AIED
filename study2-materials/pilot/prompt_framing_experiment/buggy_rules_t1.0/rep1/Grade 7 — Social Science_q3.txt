Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  Decoding the prompt: Translate English vocabulary ("guaranteed," "concept," "Constitution") into functional meaning.
2.  Retrieval: Access stored knowledge of Article 14 or the general principle of equal treatment/opportunities from memory.
3.  Application/Synthesis: Identify a real-world scenario that illustrates the abstract legal principle (e.g., voting queues, mid-day meals, or public tap access).
4.  Linguistic Encoding: Formulate a coherent sentence in English that conveys either the definition or the example as per the rubric.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1.  "The Literal Definition Bug": Providing a circular definition (e.g., "Equality means everyone is equal") which may not meet the threshold for a "correct explanation."
2.  "The Category Confusion Bug": Confusing "equality" with "freedom" or "justice," leading to an irrelevant example (e.g., "I can go anywhere").
3.  "The Linguistic Translation Bug": Knowing the concept in Hindi but being unable to retrieve the English terminology, leading to an empty or unintelligible response.
4.  "The Fairness vs. Equality Bug": Describing "fairness" in a personal grievance context rather than a Constitutional rights context.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students in this demographic are transitioning from rote memorization to conceptual application. The open-ended nature of the question is significantly harder than a multiple-choice format. Limited English proficiency acts as a high barrier; even if a student understands the concept (competence), they may fail to produce a written response that a rater recognizes (performance). However, the rubric is generous, allowing for *either* the definition or the example to earn the full 1 point.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric is lenient (OR logic), the combination of English-medium testing for Hindi-medium learners and the cognitive jump from abstract "Constitution" to "daily life example" creates a significant bottleneck.
