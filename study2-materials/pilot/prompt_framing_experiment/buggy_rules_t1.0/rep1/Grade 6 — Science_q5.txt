Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the specific chemical reagent required (Iodine solution).
2. Describe the application of the reagent (putting drops on the potato slice).
3. Recall and state the specific color change indicative of a positive result (Blue-black).
4. Synthesize these into a coherent English sentence (or semi-coherent phrase that satisfies the rubric).

Step 2: Identified "Buggy Rules" / Systematic errors
1. Reagent Confusion: Substituting "Iodine" with other substances learned in the same unit (e.g., "Copper Sulphate," "Caustic Soda," or simply "acid").
2. Color Misclassification: Recalling a change occurred but naming the wrong color (e.g., "turns red," "turns pink" — often confusing starch test results with protein tests or litmus tests).
3. Procedural Omission: Stating the result ("it turns blue") but forgetting to name the reagent used to get there.
4. Language Encoding Error: Knowing the process in Hindi (आयोडीन का घोल) but being unable to retrieve the English terminology under the pressure of a constructed-response format.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 is the foundational year for formal laboratory chemistry in the Indian curriculum. For students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, the transition to English-medium Science is a significant hurdle. Open-ended "Describe" questions have a much higher cognitive load than multiple-choice questions; they require retrieval and reconstruction rather than simple recognition.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the rubric is relatively lenient (focusing on the mention of iodine), the requirement to provide both the procedure and the observation in a second language creates a "bottleneck" effect. In large-scale assessments of this specific demographic (e.g., NAS or ASER-style data for Science), high-order retrieval of specific chemical tests usually shows significant decay.
