Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Read the sentence "We ran around" and the question, translating the English instruction into a conceptual task.
2. **Syntactic Mapping**: Analyze the relationship between "ran" (verb) and "around" (modifier) within the specific context of the sentence.
3. **Categorical Retrieval**: Access the definitions of "parts of speech" from memory.
4. **Differentiation**: Distinguish between "Adverb" and "Preposition" (the primary distractor for the word "around").
5. **Orthographic Production**: Recall the correct spelling of the term "Adverb" and write it down.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. **The "Preposition Bias" Bug**: Students often memorize "around" as a member of the preposition category. Since there is no object following it in this sentence (making it an adverb), the student applies the category label regardless of functional context.
2. **The "Spatial = Preposition" Bug**: A systematic error where any word describing spatial orientation or location is automatically classified as a preposition.
3. **The "Definition Mismatch" Bug**: Students may define an adverb only as a word ending in "-ly," leading to the exclusion of words like "around," "fast," or "well."
4. **The "Translation-Artifact" Bug**: In Hindi, "around" (charon aur/aas-paas) may not map cleanly to the English grammatical distinction between adverbial and prepositional usage, causing confusion during mental translation.

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 7 students in this demographic often face "The Vocabulary Gap." Since this is a recall task (not multiple choice), they cannot rely on recognition. In many Indian government school contexts, grammar is taught through rote memorization of definitions rather than functional analysis. English Language Learners (ELL) frequently struggle with "function words" that shift categories based on syntax.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given that "around" is a high-frequency "swing word" that looks like a preposition but acts as an adverb here, and considering the lack of an "-ly" suffix and the requirement of unassisted recall, this item is significantly difficult for the target demographic.
