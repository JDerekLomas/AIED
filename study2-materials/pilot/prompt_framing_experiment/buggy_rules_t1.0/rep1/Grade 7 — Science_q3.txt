Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English sentence to identify the core semantic requirements: "green pigment," "leaves," and "photosynthesis."
2. Access long-term memory to retrieve the specific scientific term associated with these descriptors.
3. Transcribe the phonological representation of the word into the correct orthographic English spelling ("Chlorophyll").

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules" or systematic errors
1. Semantic Association Overload: Providing the name of the process ("Photosynthesis") or the organelle ("Chloroplast") instead of the pigment due to shared context.
2. Phonetic Spelling Bug: Since the word is non-phonetic in English (the 'Ch' sounds like 'K', the 'ph' sounds like 'f', and the 'y' sounds like 'i'), students often produce systematic misspellings like "Clorofil," "Chlorofyl," or "Kalorophil."
3. Language Interference: Translating the concept to the Hindi term "Harit lavak" (chloroplast) or "Parn-harit" (chlorophyll) but failing to produce the English equivalent required by the rubric.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students in this demographic often have high conceptual familiarity with the "green color" of plants but low orthographic mastery of complex English scientific vocabulary. Because it is an open-ended recall question (rather than multiple choice), the lack of a visual scaffold increases the likelihood of spelling-related failure or retrieval failure.
