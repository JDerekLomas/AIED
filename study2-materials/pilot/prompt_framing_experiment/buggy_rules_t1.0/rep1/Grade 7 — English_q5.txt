Step 1: Specific procedural steps:
1. Decode the English syntax of the question ("How is... described").
2. Retrieve the specific poem "The Squirrel" from long-term memory (Mildred Bowers Armstrong).
3. Isolate the specific visual metaphor associated with the tail (as opposed to the coat or the diet).
4. Map the mental image or Hindi translation (*prashnachinh*) back to the specific English phrase "question mark."
5. Encode the phrase into written English with legible orthography.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. **Attribute Mapping Error:** Associating the description of the "overcoat of gray" with the tail because "gray" is a more common English adjective than "question mark."
2. **Keyword Match Error:** Searching memory for any word associated with "squirrel" (e.g., "nuts," "tree") rather than the specific descriptive imagery requested.
3. **Literalism Bug:** Describing a tail based on real-world observation (e.g., "long," "furry," "black") rather than the literary text's specific metaphor.
4. **Syntactic Scaffolding Error:** Being unable to transition from the mental concept (the shape ?) to the English noun phrase, leading to an empty response or a single-word Hindi response (*sawal*).

Step 3: Population considerations:
In Grade 7 Indian government schools, English is often taught via rote memorization of "Question-Answers." While the poem is short, the transition from recognition (seeing the text) to recall (open-ended response) is a high cognitive load for ESL learners. Limited English proficiency often results in students leaving "Wh-" questions blank if they cannot recall the exact textbook sentence.
