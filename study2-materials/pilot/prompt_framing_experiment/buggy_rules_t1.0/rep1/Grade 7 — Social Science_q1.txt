Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of the English prompt (specifically the abstract noun "importance").
2. Retrieve the relevant schema from memory regarding historiography/chronology (the "why" of dates).
3. Translate the internalized concept (likely stored in a mix of Hindi and English) into a coherent English sentence.
4. Align the response with the rubric’s functional requirements (sequence, timing, or periodization).

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. The "Definition-for-Function" Bug: Providing a definition of a date (e.g., "Dates are days and months") instead of explaining its utility/importance.
2. The "Keyword Association" Bug: Writing everything known about "history" or "dates" (e.g., "History is about kings") without addressing the "importance" relationship.
3. The "Linguistic Substitution" Bug: Using a familiar but incorrect English word that changes the meaning (e.g., "Dates tell us the story of history" — which may fail the rubric's requirement for specificity on timing/order).
4. The "Circular Logic" Bug: Stating "Dates are important because they are important for history."

Step 3: Population Considerations
Grade 7 students in this demographic often face a "threshold effect" where their conceptual understanding (knowing that dates help put things in order) outpaces their ability to express that logic in a second language. While the rubric is relatively lenient, the open-ended nature of the question demands active recall and syntax construction rather than simple recognition, which is a high cognitive load for ESL/ELL learners from low-resource environments.
