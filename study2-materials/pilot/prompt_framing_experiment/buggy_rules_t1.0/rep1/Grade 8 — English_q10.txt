Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Identify the adjective/adverb that follows the intensifier ("weak").
2. Replace the intensifier "very" with the adverb "too".
3. Identify the subject and modal/negative phrase ("He cannot") in the second sentence.
4. Delete the repeated subject and the negative modal ("He cannot").
5. Transform the finite verb ("walk") into an infinitive ("to walk").
6. Concatenate the structures while maintaining correct word order.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" (Procedural errors)
1. **Intensifier Retention:** Keeping "very" and adding "too" (e.g., "He is too very weak to walk").
2. **Negative Preservation:** Retaining the "not" because the original sentence was negative (e.g., "He is too weak to not walk").
3. **Double Subject Bug:** Failing to delete the second subject (e.g., "He is too weak he to walk").
4. **Tense/Modal Carryover:** Keeping the modal "can" or the verb's tense instead of the infinitive (e.g., "He is too weak to can walk" or "He is too weak to walks").
5. **Preposition Confusion:** Using "too" in both positions (e.g., "He is too weak too walk").

Step 3: Target population considerations
- Grade 8 students in this context often learn English via grammar-translation. While they are familiar with rules, "too...to" is a complex transformation involving a shift from a compound/complex thought to a simple sentence with a non-finite clause.
- Limited English proficiency means students often rely on "surface features" rather than semantic meaning.
- Hindi-medium backgrounds may lead to literal translations of "itna... ki" (so... that), causing interference with the "too...to" structure.
- Recall (writing the sentence) is significantly harder than recognition (multiple choice) for this demographic.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Taking into account the high number of procedural steps where a "bug" can occur—particularly the counter-intuitive step of removing the "not" to preserve the negative meaning—and the linguistic distance between Hindi and English syntax:
