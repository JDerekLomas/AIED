Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English prompt and identify the specific requirement (two reasons: one for color, one for fabric type).
2. Retrieve the conceptual link between light colors and low absorption/high reflection of radiant heat.
3. Retrieve the conceptual link between cotton and moisture absorption/evaporative cooling (sweat).
4. Isolate the "light color" reason specifically, as the rubric only awards the point for this component.
5. Translate the internal conceptual model from Hindi/Native language into an English written sentence.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. **The "Attribute Conflation" Bug:** Students attribute the cooling effect of the *material* (cotton) to the *color*, or vice versa (e.g., "cotton is light so it reflects sun").
2. **The "Non-Scientific Description" Bug:** Using colloquial terms instead of properties (e.g., "it feels nice" or "it is simple") which fails the "scientific reasons" constraint.
3. **The "Incomplete Retrieval" Bug:** Stating only the properties of cotton (breathability/sweat) because it is a more salient daily experience, while neglecting the optical property of the color required by the rubric.
4. **The "Reverse Logic" Bug:** Confusing absorption and reflection (e.g., "light colors absorb the cold").

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Language Barrier:** In Hindi-medium backgrounds, terms like "absorb," "reflect," and "radiant heat" are often lost in translation or replaced with vague descriptors like "soak" or "stop."
2. **Open-Ended vs. MCQ:** Without cues, students struggle to transition from functional knowledge (we wear cotton because it's cool) to structural/scientific reasoning (reflection/absorption).
3. **Rubric Specificity:** The rubric curiously only mentions the "light colors" reason for the point, but the prompt asks for two reasons. This mismatch often leads students to provide one detailed reason (usually about cotton/sweat) and miss the specific point-earning reason.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the linguistic threshold, the requirement to produce a "scientific" explanation rather than a functional one, and the common tendency for Grade 7 students in this demographic to focus on the "cotton/sweat" aspect over the "light color
