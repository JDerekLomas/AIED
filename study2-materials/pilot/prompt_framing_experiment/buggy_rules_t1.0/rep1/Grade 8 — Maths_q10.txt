Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Identify the geometric relationship between the given angle ($80^\circ$) and $x$ (Vertical Opposite Angles).
2. State the value of $x = 80^\circ$ and provide the reasoning.
3. Identify the relationship between $x$ and $y$ or the given $80^\circ$ and $y$ (Linear Pair).
4. Recall the sum of a linear pair is $180^\circ$.
5. Set up the equation $y + 80 = 180$ or $y + x = 180$.
6. Execute the subtraction $180 - 80$ correctly to find $y = 100^\circ$.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- "Equality Bias": Assuming all unknown angles in a diagram are equal ($x = 80, y = 80$).
- "Complementary Confusion": Subtracting from $90$ instead of $180$ ($y = 10$).
- "Naming Error": Confusing "Vertical Opposite" with "Adjacent" or "Interior," leading to hesitation or incorrect formula application.
- "Transposition Error": Adding the constant to the total instead of subtracting ($180 + 80 = 260$).
- "Labeling Bug": Finding the correct numbers but swapping the values of $x$ and $y$.

Step 3: Student Population Context
- Language Barrier: The term "Vertical Opposite" or "Linear Pair" may be known in Hindi (शीर्षाभिमुख कोण / रैखिक युग्म) but difficult to recall or explain in English as required by the rubric.
- Open-ended Format: Without multiple-choice cues, students often fail to initiate the first step if they cannot recall the specific theorem name.
- Economic Context: Limited access to geometry tools or visual aids often results in a procedural "memorize-the-shape" approach rather than conceptual understanding.

Step 4: Final Estimate
Taking into account that this is a multi-step problem where a failure in Step 1 or 2 usually cascades, and the linguistic requirement to "state the reason" adds a significant barrier for ESL learners:
