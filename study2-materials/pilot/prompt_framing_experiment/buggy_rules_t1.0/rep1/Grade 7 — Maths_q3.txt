Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall the specific formula for the area of a triangle ($A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$).
2. Substitute the given values ($8$ and $6$) into the correct variables.
3. Perform the multiplication of the base and height ($8 \times 6 = 48$).
4. Apply the fractional operator (divide by $2$ or multiply by $0.5$).
5. Finalize the calculation ($48 / 2 = 24$).

Step 2: Buggy Rules & Systematic Errors
- **Formula Confusion (Rectangle Bug):** Applying $A = L \times B$, leading to $48$. This is the most common systematic error in triangle geometry.
- **Operator Misinterpretation:** Treating the $\frac{1}{2}$ as an addition or a separate term rather than a multiplier.
- **Formula Decay:** Recalling the perimeter formula or the area of a square ($s^2$) due to cognitive load.
- **Calculation Error:** Simple arithmetic slips in multiplication ($8 \times 6$) or division ($48 \div 2$).

Step 3: Population Considerations
- **Linguistic Barrier:** While "base" and "height" are standard, students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle if they have not mapped these to *adhar* and *unchai* effectively in a bilingual context.
- **Recall vs. Recognition:** Unlike multiple-choice questions where $24$ might trigger a memory of the $\frac{1}{2}$ factor, an open-ended format requires active retrieval of the $\frac{1}{2}$, which is frequently omitted by students at this level.
- **Socio-economic context:** Limited access to remedial practice often results in "fragile knowledge" where the $\frac{1}{2}$ is forgotten under test pressure.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the arithmetic is simple, the "Rectangle Bug" (omitting the $\frac{1}{2}$) is a powerful attractor for Grade 7 students. In the context of economically weaker sections where conceptual mastery of geometry often lags behind rote arithmetic, a significant portion of students will provide "48" as the answer.
