Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Recall the perimeter formula: $P = 2(l + w)$.
2. Substitute the given values: $32 = 2(10 + w)$.
3. Distribute the 2 or divide both sides by 2 ($10 + w = 16$).
4. Solve for $w$ by subtracting 10 ($w = 6$).
5. Recall the area formula: $A = l \times w$.
6. Substitute and calculate: $10 \times 6 = 60$.
7. Provide the final answer with appropriate units.

Step 2: Buggy rules:
- **Formula confusion:** Using $l \times w = 32$ (Area for Perimeter) or $2l + w = 32$ (failing to distribute).
- **Additive error:** $10 + w = 32 \rightarrow w = 22$ (ignoring the "double" in perimeter).
- **Order of operations:** $2 \times 10 + w = 32 \rightarrow 20 + w = 32$ (correct) vs. adding 2 and 10 first.
- **Arithmetic slips:** Simple subtraction/multiplication errors under time pressure.
- **Unit neglect:** Calculating values but failing to state "cm" or "sq cm" (though the rubric focuses on the value).

Step 3: Population considerations:
- **Language Barrier:** "Perimeter" and "Width" are technical terms. Hindi-medium students often confuse "Perimeter" (Parimap) and "Area" (Kshetraphal) when tested in English.
- **Multi-step requirement:** This is a "linked" problem. If the student fails to find the width, they cannot find the area. The rubric requires a max score of 1, implying an "all or nothing" success for both components.
- **Socio-economic context:** Limited access to remedial tutoring and high reliance on rote memorization of formulas rather than conceptual understanding of space.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
While the math is conceptually Grade 6/7, the requirement to execute a two-stage process (Reverse Perimeter $\rightarrow$ Area) without scaffolding, combined with English-language terminology, creates a high "attrition rate" at each procedural step.
