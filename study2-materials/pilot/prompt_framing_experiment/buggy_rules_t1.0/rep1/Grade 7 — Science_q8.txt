Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the role of turmeric and hibiscus as pH indicators.
2. Formulate a plan to test the unknown liquid (e.g., make a paste/solution or dip paper).
3. Identify the specific color change for turmeric (Red in base, remains yellow in acid).
4. Identify the specific color change for hibiscus (Green in base, magenta/dark pink in acid).
5. Synthesize these observations into a coherent "if-then" conclusion.
6. Translate these scientific observations into English sentences.

Step 2: Common "buggy rules" or systematic errors
1. **Indicator Confusion:** Swapping color outcomes (e.g., believing turmeric turns red in acid).
2. **Neutrality Oversight:** Failing to distinguish between an acid and a neutral substance when using turmeric (both remain yellow).
3. **One-Way Mapping:** Assuming that if "Base = Red," then "Acid = Green" (transferring rules from litmus or universal indicators).
4. **Action-Observation Gap:** Describing the mixing process but failing to state the expected result/conclusion.
5. **Extract Misinterpretation:** Treating the materials as "ingredients" to be mixed together simultaneously rather than as separate diagnostic tests.

Step 3: Population-specific constraints
- **Language Barrier:** In a Hindi-medium/EWS context, writing an open-ended explanation in English is a significant hurdle. Students may know the science but fail to articulate the procedural "how."
- **Lack of Practical Exposure:** In resource-constrained schools, these experiments are often taught as rote facts rather than hands-on experiences, leading to fragile recall.
- **Cognitive Load:** The question asks for a multi-step procedure using *two* indicators for *two* types of substances, requiring high retrieval effort compared to multiple-choice questions.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While many students may remember that turmeric is involved in acid-base testing, the requirement to describe the *process* and *color results* for two different indicators in a non-native language makes the success rate quite low.
