Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Recall appropriate vocabulary for family members ("Grandmother/Dadi") and emotional states ("miss").
2. Syntactic Encoding: Construct a grammatically coherent sentence expressing a past/present feeling ("I miss you").
3. Functional Request: Formulate a polite imperative or request ("Please come," "Visit us").
4. Orthographic Execution: Correctly spell high-frequency but irregularly spelled words (e.g., "visit," "grandmother," "soon").
5. Contextual Application: Recognize the "Message" format, differentiating it from a simple list or translation.

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules"
1. Subject-Verb Agreement Bug: Omitting the subject or using incorrect verb forms (e.g., "I missing you," "She visit").
2. L1 Interference (Syntax): Applying Hindi word order to English (e.g., "Grandmother soon come").
3. Phonetic Spelling Bug: Spelling based on Indian English pronunciation (e.g., "vijeet" for visit, "mish" for miss).
4. Prompt Over-reliance: Copying the prompt's instructions verbatim (e.g., "I tell her how much I miss her") instead of generating a direct address.
5. Vocabulary Generalization: Using "coming" for "visit" or "saying" for "telling."

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students from these backgrounds often face a "threshold effect" where they understand the prompt's intent but lack the productive vocabulary to construct an original sentence without a template. Open-ended recall is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice recognition for ESL learners. The 1-mark "all-or-nothing" rubric is punishing, as minor grammatical slips may be marked incorrect by strict evaluators despite clear communication.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the communicative intent is simple, the transition from Hindi-medium thought to English written production, combined with the lack of scaffolding in the prompt, creates a high probability of at least one systematic "bug" in grammar or syntax.
