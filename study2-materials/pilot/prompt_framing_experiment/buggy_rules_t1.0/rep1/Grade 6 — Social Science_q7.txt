Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Recall the specific definition of "natural resources" (distinguishing from man-made or general geographic features).
2. Retrieve at least two specific examples tied to the geography of Rajasthan from long-term memory.
3. Select one of those resources.
4. Establish a causal link between that resource and a socio-economic outcome (influence on "lives of people").
5. Translate these internal concepts into English sentences.
6. Synthesize all components to meet the multi-part requirements within the constraint of the question.

Step 2: Common "buggy rules" / Systematic errors
1. Over-generalization: Listing general items (trees, air, water) that are not specific to Rajasthan's unique economic profile.
2. Concept-Attribute Confusion: Listing a city (Jaipur) or a landmark (Thar Desert) as the resource itself.
3. Partial Execution: Providing two resources but failing to provide the explanation (satisficing).
4. Circular Reasoning: "Water influences lives because people need water to live" (failing to provide a specific geographic/economic influence).
5. Linguistic Interference: Using Hindi terms for resources (e.g., "khunij" for minerals) which may be marked incorrect in an English-medium assessment despite conceptual clarity.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 6 students at this developmental stage often struggle with multi-step "And" prompts (Mention AND Explain). The open-ended recall format is significantly harder than recognition (multiple choice). For ESL/Hindi-medium students, the cognitive load of retrieving facts while simultaneously navigating English syntax often leads to "task shedding," where they skip the complex explanation to finish the simple listing.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement for two specific recall items plus a causal explanation in a second language, many students will provide a partially correct answer (e.g., just listing resources) which, under a strict "1 or 0" rubric, results in a failure to achieve the maximum score.
