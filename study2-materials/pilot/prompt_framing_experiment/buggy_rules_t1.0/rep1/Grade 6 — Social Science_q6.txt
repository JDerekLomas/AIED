Step 1: List the specific procedural steps a student must execute correctly.
1. Recall the definition of "archaeological sources" (material remains).
2. Recall the definition of "literary sources" (written records).
3. Identify the functional difference between the two (physical vs. textual).
4. Retrieve a specific, valid example for archaeological sources (e.g., coins, ruins).
5. Retrieve a specific, valid example for literary sources (e.g., manuscripts, books).
6. Translate these abstract concepts from Hindi/Internal thought into English sentences.
7. Synthesize all four components (two definitions, two examples) into a single response that satisfies the "differentiate" prompt.

Step 2: For each step, identify any known "buggy rules."
*   **Definition Substitution:** Defining "archaeological" as "old things" without specifying physical remains, or defining "literary" as "literacy/education."
*   **Category Overlap:** Placing "inscriptions" in literary sources because they contain writing, even though they are archaeological (a common classification error in Grade 6).
*   **The "Example-only" Bug:** Providing only examples and skipping the definitions of the categories.
*   **The "Label Swap":** Correctly defining both but swapping the labels (calling books archaeological).
*   **Language Interference:** Using Hindi terms (e.g., *pandulipi* for manuscript) or failing to construct the English "between/and" syntax required for a differentiation.

Step 3: Consider the target student population.
Grade 6 is the transition year from environmental studies to specialized history. For students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, "archaeological" and "literary" are high-tier academic vocabulary words (Tier 3) that are rarely used in daily speech. The open-ended nature of the question requires high-stakes recall.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate.
The rubric is "all or nothing" for 1 mark, requiring four correct elements (two definitions, two examples). Even if a student understands the concept, the language barrier and the complexity of managing four distinct sub-tasks for a single point significantly lower the success rate.
