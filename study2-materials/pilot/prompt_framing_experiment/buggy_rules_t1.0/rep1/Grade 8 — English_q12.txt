Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Visual-Semantic Mapping: Interpret the sequence of images to identify the characters (fox, goat/well) and the plot (falling, entrapment).
2. Vocabulary Retrieval: Recall specific L2 (English) nouns and verbs (fox, well, fall, climb/jump, escape).
3. Syntactic Construction: Formulate sentences using correct Subject-Verb-Object order.
4. Tense Consistency: Apply past tense markers correctly to narrate a completed event (fell, could not).
5. Narrative Cohesion: Link the "cause" (falling) with the "effect" (inability to escape) as per the rubric requirement.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. L1 Interference (Syntax): Applying Hindi word order (Subject-Object-Verb), e.g., "Fox well in fell."
2. Overgeneralization of Tense: Applying "-ed" to irregular verbs (felled/fallled) or using base forms for past events (fox fall).
3. Semantic Substitution: Using high-frequency but imprecise words to bypass missing vocabulary (e.g., "dog" for "fox" or "hole" for "well").
4. "Thematic Completion" Bug: Describing the image generally ("There is a fox") but failing to articulate the specific causal constraint ("could not escape") required by the rubric.
5. Copula Omission: Omitting "be" or "do" verbs in negation ("Fox not escape").

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Grade 8 Expectations: Students are expected to produce short paragraphs, but English is often taught as a tertiary priority compared to core subjects in low-resource environments.
2. Recall vs. Recognition: This is a productive task. Unlike multiple-choice questions (MCQs), there are no scaffolding cues, making the "cold start" hurdle significant for ELL (English Language Learner) students.
3. Medium Gap: Students may know the story perfectly in Hindi but lack the specific English functional grammar to satisfy a 1-point binary rubric (often scored as all-or-nothing in centralized testing).

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While many students will recognize the "Thirsty Crow" or "Fox and Goat" fables, the requirement to write a coherent narrative that captures both the accident and the failed escape in English—without hitting the "buggy" syntactic or tense traps—is a high bar for this specific demographic.
