Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Read and decode the English text to identify the functional requirement (action: "beaten into thin sheets") and the context (example: "aluminium foils").
2. Retrieve the specific scientific nomenclature associated with this physical property from long-term memory (distinguishing it from ductility, conductivity, or sonority).
3. Translate the retrieved concept into the correct English technical term ("Malleability").
4. Encode and spell the term correctly or near-enough to satisfy the examiner’s rubric in a written format.

Step 2: Systematic "buggy rules" or errors
1. **Property-Attribute Swap:** Students often confuse "Malleability" with "Ductility" (drawing into wires) because both are introduced simultaneously as mechanical deformations.
2. **Context-Driven Error:** Using a descriptive word instead of the scientific term (e.g., writing "Softness" or "Flexible" because of the foil example).
3. **Phonetic/Orthographic Bug:** For Hindi-medium students, the multi-syllabic English word "Malleability" is difficult to phonetically map. Students may produce non-standard spellings that don't resemble the target word enough for credit (e.g., "Mellibeleti").
4. **Linguistic Interference:** Students may understand the concept but lack the English vocabulary, leading them to leave the answer blank or provide the Hindi equivalent ("Aaghaatvardhaniyata"), which may not be accepted in an English-medium assessment.

Step 3: Target population considerations
The Grade 8 level requires transition to formal scientific terminology. For students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, the "vocabulary gap" is significant. Unlike multiple-choice questions where "Malleability" can be recognized, this open-ended recall task requires high-stakes retrieval of a specific, difficult-to-spell English word.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the high probability of Ductility/Malleability confusion and the linguistic barrier to spelling a 6-syllable technical English word, the success rate is likely lower than average for a fundamental science fact.
