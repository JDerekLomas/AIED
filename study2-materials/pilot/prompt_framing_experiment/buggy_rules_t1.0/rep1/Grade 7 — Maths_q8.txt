Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the word problem and identify the relationship between distance and fuel (Direct Proportion).
2. Calculate the unit rate (mileage): Divide $55$ km by $5$ liters to find km per liter ($55 \div 5 = 11$).
3. Apply the unit rate to the new quantity: Multiply the unit rate by the target liters ($11 \times 12$).
4. Execute the multi-digit multiplication ($11 \times 12 = 132$).
5. Address the secondary question: Explicitly state the mileage ($11$ km/l).

Step 2: Systematic Buggy Rules
- Division Direction Bug: Dividing the smaller number by the larger ($5 \div 55$) because of a "larger goes inside" heuristic.
- Operation Confusion: Multiplying the initial values ($55 \times 5$) instead of dividing, or cross-multiplying incorrectly ($55 \times 12$ then forgetting to divide by $5$).
- Additive Thinking: Assuming a constant difference rather than a ratio (e.g., $12$ is $7$ more than $5$, so distance is $55 + 7 = 62$).
- Partial Execution: Solving for the distance ($132$) but failing to provide the mileage, or vice-versa.
- Multiplication Slip: Standard algorithmic errors in $11 \times 12$ (e.g., forgetting the placeholder zero).

Step 3: Student Population Context
- Grade 7 students often struggle with the transition from additive to multiplicative reasoning.
- Language Barrier: The term "mileage (average)" may be unfamiliar in English for Hindi-medium students, even if they understand the concept of 'average' (*ausat*).
- Rubric Rigidity: The rubric awards 1 mark for the final distance, but the question asks for two distinct pieces of information. This increases the cognitive load and the chance of a "stopped-at-the-middle" error.

Step 4: Holistic Assessment
The multi-step nature of "Unitary Method" problems combined with potential language interference and the requirement for two distinct answers (distance and mileage) makes this a high-error-rate item for this demographic.
