Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Identify the geometric context: Recognize the triangle and the relationship between the exterior angle (or linear pair) and the interior angles.
2. Apply the Linear Pair Postulate: Subtract the given exterior angle (100°) from 180° to find the interior angle C ($180 - 100 = 80$).
3. Arithmetic execution: Perform the subtraction correctly.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. "Exterior = Interior" Bug: Setting the interior angle equal to the exterior angle ($x = 100$).
2. "Complementary vs. Supplementary" Bug: Subtracting from 90 instead of 180 ($90 - 100$, leading to confusion or negative results).
3. "Base Angle" Bug: Assuming the triangle is isosceles and assigning values based on symmetry rather than calculation.
4. "Subtraction Direction" Bug: If the student tries to subtract 180 from 100 or makes a borrowing error in the $180 - 100$ calculation.

Step 3: Student Population Factors
- Language Barrier: If the prompt is in English, "Find the angle x" may be understood, but the conceptual link between the visual representation and the geometric rule relies on prior instruction often delivered in a second language.
- Format: Open-ended questions have a higher cognitive load than multiple-choice as they require retrieval of the "180" constant rather than recognition.
- Grade 6: Students are at the early stage of formal geometry; the transition from "measuring" to "calculating" angles is a common point of failure.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the simplicity of the single-step subtraction but the high frequency of "100" being written as the answer due to a lack of conceptual understanding of linear pairs, the success rate is often lower than educators expect.
