Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decipher the English prompt and identify the core nouns ("main occupation," "Vedic period").
2. Access long-term memory to retrieve the historical context of the Vedic period (specifically the Early/Rig Vedic vs. Later Vedic distinction).
3. Select the dominant economic activity (Pastoralism/Agriculture) from the retrieved mental schema.
4. Recall a specific descriptive detail ("key aspect") of that occupation (e.g., cattle as wealth, use of iron plows).
5. Construct an English sentence to articulate the two-part answer within the constraints of the rubric.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. **Keyword Overshadowing:** Associating "Vedic" only with "religious texts" or "caste system," leading to an irrelevant answer.
2. **Temporal Collapse:** Applying modern or Harappan occupations (trade/commerce) to the Vedic period.
3. **The "Single-Step" Bug:** Answering only the first part of the question (identifying the occupation) and omitting the "key aspect" due to cognitive load or misreading the two-part structure.
4. **Translation Interference:** Correctly identifying the concept in Hindi (e.g., *pashupalan*) but failing to retrieve the specific English Tier 2 vocabulary required for the rubric.
5. **Over-generalization:** Labeling all early civilizations as "hunters and gatherers."

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 6 is a transitional year where students move from concrete to more abstract historical concepts. For students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium backgrounds, the English-medium "open-ended" format acts as a significant barrier. Unlike multiple-choice questions (recognition), this requires production (recall + synthesis), which significantly increases the likelihood of "bugs" related to linguistic encoding and memory retrieval.
