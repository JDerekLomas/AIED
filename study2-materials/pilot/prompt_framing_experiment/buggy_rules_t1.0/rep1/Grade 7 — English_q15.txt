Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Semantic Retrieval: Identify a personal interest and translate the concept into the English lexical label (Hobby).
2. Syntactic Encoding: Construct a declarative sentence defining the hobby (e.g., "My hobby is...").
3. Temporal Expression: Formulate a sentence using frequency adverbs or time prepositions (e.g., "I play in the evening").
4. Causal Reasoning/Justification: Articulate an abstract reason for enjoyment (e.g., "It makes me happy") using the connective "because."
5. Structural Cohesion: Sequence 4-5 sentences into a cohesive paragraph format.
6. Orthographic/Grammatical Execution: Apply correct subject-verb agreement and tense consistency (Present Simple).

Step 2: Identified "Buggy Rules" (Systematic procedural errors)
1. "The Labeling Bug": Writing only a single word (e.g., "Cricket") instead of a full sentence, treating the prompt as a fill-in-the-blank.
2. "The L1 Syntax Transfer": Mirroring Hindi word order (S-O-V) in English (e.g., "I cricket play").
3. "The Inventory Bug": Listing items related to the hobby rather than answering the "when" and "why" prompts.
4. "The Tense Inconsistency": Switching between "I like" and "I am liked" or "I playing."
5. "The Threshold Failure": Writing only 1 or 2 sentences and stopping, failing the length requirement due to limited vocabulary.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 7 students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds often face a "threshold effect" in English. While they may recognize the words, the transition from recognition to production (recall) is a high-cognitive-load task. In a 0 or 1 scoring system (no partial credit), any single procedural bug—such as failing the "4-5 sentence" constraint or omitting the "why"—results in a zero.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The binary nature of the rubric (Maximum score 1, requiring all three components plus a length constraint) makes this highly difficult for this specific demographic, as common errors in syntax or brevity will disqualify the response despite showing some understanding.
