Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the English question to identify the specific literary referent (Leo Tolstoy’s "Three Questions").
2. Retrieve the three distinct concepts from long-term memory (Time, People, Action).
3. Translate the retrieved concepts back into English syntax.
4. Synthesize the three elements into a grammatically coherent sentence structure that satisfies the rubric's requirement for all three components.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. **Partial Retrieval Bug:** Recalling only one or two of the three questions (usually "right time") and stopping, assuming the answer is sufficient.
2. **L1 Interference Bug (Code-switching):** Conceptualizing the answer in Hindi but failing to find the English equivalents for "important" or "necessary," leading to an incomplete or blank response.
3. **Keyword Matching Bug:** Searching the memory or text for the word "King" and "Questions" and providing a generic response (e.g., "The king was wise") rather than the specific list.
4. **Syntactic Overload Bug:** Attempting to write a full sentence but losing the semantic meaning of the three items due to grammatical struggle.

Step 3: Population considerations:
The open-ended recall format is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice for students with limited English proficiency. In many Indian government school contexts, while the story is a staple of the Grade 7 NCERT curriculum, the transition from rote memorization to functional English production is a major hurdle. Students often remember the *gist* of the story but fail to reproduce the specific three-part list required by the rubric in English.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
Given that this requires a 3-part conjunctive recall and precise English production, the "Partial Retrieval Bug" and "L1 Interference" will likely eliminate a large portion of the cohort.
