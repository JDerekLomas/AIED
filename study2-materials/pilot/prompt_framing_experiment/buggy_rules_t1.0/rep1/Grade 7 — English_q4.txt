Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the English sentence structure and vocabulary (understanding "important" and "real life").
2. Retrieve relevant content from the memory of the specific text (Leo Tolstoy's "Three Questions").
3. Abstract the king's philosophical questions (What is the right time? Who are the right people? What is the most important thing to do?) into a "real-world" context.
4. Formulate a logical "Yes/No" judgment.
5. Generate an original sentence in English to provide a "reason," requiring correct syntax, tense, and subject-verb agreement.
6. Translate internal thoughts (likely in Hindi) into written English output.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. **The "Keyword Matching" Bug:** Searching the text for the word "important" and copying the sentence containing it, regardless of whether it answers the "why."
2. **The "Literalism" Bug:** Thinking the questions only apply to kings or historical figures, thus answering "No" because they don't have subjects or kingdoms.
3. **The "Translation-Transliteration" Bug:** Constructing a reason using Hindi syntax (e.g., "This question important because life success happen").
4. **The "Restatement" Bug:** Simply repeating the prompt ("I think questions are important") without providing the "reason" required by the rubric.
5. **The "Content Confusion" Bug:** Confusing the king's questions with the hermit's answers or other story details.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 7 students from economically weaker sections in Indian government schools often face a "language barrier" where their conceptual understanding (knowing the story) exceeds their expressive literacy in English. An open-ended question is significantly harder than a multiple-choice question because it lacks "scaffolding" or "recognition cues." Students may understand the moral of the story but fail to articulate a "valid reason" in a way that satisfies an evaluator, or they may leave it blank due to fear of grammatical error.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the story is a staple of the curriculum, the transition from "what happened in the story" to "why is this relevant in real life" requires a level of meta-cognition and English production that is challenging for this demographic.
