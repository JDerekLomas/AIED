Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the sentence structure and identify the sentence type (assertive/affirmative vs. negative/interrogative).
2. Recognize the noun "apples" as a countable plural noun.
3. Recall the grammatical rule: 'some' is typically used in affirmative sentences, while 'any' is used in negative or interrogative sentences.
4. Evaluate the target sentence "There are ____ apples in the basket" against this rule.
5. Select and map the chosen word to the blank.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. "The Sound Rule": Students select the word that "sounds" better based on limited exposure, often leading to a 50/50 guess if both sound plausible.
2. "The Negative Bias": Students may fail to recognize the absence of "not," assuming "any" is a general-purpose quantifier for plural objects regardless of polarity.
3. "Overgeneralization of 'Any'": Believing 'any' means "one of many" or "whichever," applying it to affirmative contexts where they want to imply variety.
4. "Translation Interference": In Hindi, the quantifier 'kuch' (some/any) can be used for both affirmative and negative contexts; students may not perceive a functional difference between the two English choices.

Step 3: Student Population Analysis
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often have "low-input" English environments. In Indian government schools, English is frequently taught via the Grammar-Translation method. While the distinction between 'some' and 'any' is a standard curriculum item, the lack of conversational practice means students often rely on rote memorization of rules. The Hindi-to-English translation "Wahan basket mein kuch seb hain" maps 'kuch' to both options, creating high interference.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the simplicity of the affirmative structure but the high likelihood of L1 (Hindi) interference and the "buggy" application of 'any' as a generic plural marker, a significant portion will guess or apply a faulty rule. However, since it is a binary choice (recognition), the success rate is higher than a recall task.
