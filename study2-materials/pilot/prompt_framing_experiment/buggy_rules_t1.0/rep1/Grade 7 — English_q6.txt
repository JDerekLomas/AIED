Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the question phrase "writing style" (Requires distinguishing between *content* what the poem is about and *form* how it is written).
2. Retrieve the specific poem from memory (if not provided in a snippet).
3. Analyze the text for linguistic features (e.g., vocabulary level, sentence structure, tone).
4. Map these features to abstract literary descriptors (e.g., "descriptive," "simple").
5. Translate the identified concept into an English word.
6. Verify the word satisfies the grammatical requirement of the prompt.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
1. **Content-Style Merge:** Students provide a summary of the theme (e.g., "The poet writes about nature") instead of a stylistic descriptor.
2. **Adjective-Noun Confusion:** Students provide a noun related to the poet's identity or the poem's subject (e.g., "The style is beauty").
3. **The "Good/Bad" Binary:** Reverting to simple evaluative judgments (e.g., "The writing is nice" or "very good") rather than technical descriptors.
4. **L1-L2 Mapping Error:** Attempting to translate a complex stylistic concept from Hindi/Mother tongue into English but lacking the specific English vocabulary, leading to "Hinglish" or incorrect word choice.
5. **Pattern Matching:** Picking a random word from the poem itself and labeling it as the "style."

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Open-ended vs. MCQ:** The lack of a word bank significantly increases the "retrieval effort." Students cannot rely on recognition.
2. **Language Barrier:** For ESL/ELL students in Grade 7, "style" is an abstract meta-linguistic concept that is rarely explicitly taught compared to plot or character.
3. **Vocabulary Depth:** The rubric requires specific adjectives (simple, informal). While "simple" might be known, the application of it as a literary category is a high-order cognitive task for this demographic.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The combination of abstract conceptual requirements, the transition from Hindi-medium thinking to English production, and the open-ended nature of the question makes this a very high-difficulty item for the described population.
