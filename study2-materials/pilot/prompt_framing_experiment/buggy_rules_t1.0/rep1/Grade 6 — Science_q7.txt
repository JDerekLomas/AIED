Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Read and decode the English text, overcoming the grammatical error ("has ate") and identifying the context.
2. Filter the information to identify the constraint (eaten fruits/veg, but no milk).
3. Access long-term memory to retrieve the classification of milk as a source of specific nutrients (Calcium, Protein, Vitamin D).
4. Map the deficiency (no milk) to the specific requirement for "growing children" mentioned in the prompt.
5. Filter the two-part prompt to provide the specific answer required by the 1-point rubric (identifying the missing component).
6. Encode the answer in English or a functional hybrid.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. **The "Irrelevant Information" Bug:** Students focus on the second instruction ("Prepare diet chart") and ignore the first question, leading to a long-form response that fails to explicitly name the missing component.
2. **The "Nutrient vs. Food" Bug:** Students may identify a nutrient (e.g., "Protein") but fail to link it back to the specific food item "milk" requested by the context, or vice versa.
3. **The "Surface Pattern Match" Bug:** Seeing "fruits and vegetables," a student may assume the answer is "junk food" or "grains" because they are used to contrasting healthy vs. unhealthy, rather than analyzing specific omissions within a healthy diet.
4. **Linguistic Interference (ESL Bug):** Misinterpreting "missing" as "unwanted" or "bad," leading to an answer like "junk food."

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students from Hindi-medium/EWS backgrounds often face a "threshold effect" with English-medium Science questions. The rubric is narrow (1 mark for a specific identification), but the prompt is complex and wordy. The demand for recall (rather than multiple-choice recognition) significantly lowers the success rate for students struggling with English literacy.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the biological fact is basic, the linguistic packaging and the dual-task nature of the prompt (Identify + Prepare Chart) create high cognitive load. Many students will likely draw a chart but fail to concisely "identify" the missing component in the way the rubric requires.
