Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the English sentence structure (subject-verb-object) and identify the core entities (Battle of Plassey, 1757, British power).
2. Retrieve the historical fact associated with 1757/Plassey from long-term memory.
3. Establish a causal link between a military event and a political outcome (expansion of power).
4. Formulate an explanation in English that connects "victory" to "control/dominance" or "puppet ruler."
5. Write the sentence using correct syntax to convey the specific relationship required by the rubric.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors:
1. **The "Definition for Cause" Bug:** Providing a definition of the event (e.g., "It was a war between Siraj-ud-Daulah and Clive") rather than explaining its *contribution* to power.
2. **The "Narrative Sequence" Bug:** Listing chronological events (what happened during the battle) instead of analyzing the structural result (what happened after).
3. **The "Linguistic Substitution" Bug:** Using "expansion" literally (geographic) rather than politically, or using vague terms like "they became strong" which may not meet the rubric's "dominance/control" threshold.
4. **The "Keyword Association" Bug:** Writing everything known about "British" or "Plassey" (fragmented recall) without a logical connector.

Step 3: Population considerations:
Grade 8 students in this context often face a "threshold of expression" gap. While they may conceptually understand that the British won, the transition from Hindi-medium conceptualization to English-medium academic writing for an open-ended question is a significant barrier. The "puppet nawab" concept is sophisticated and often lost in translation.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate:
Given the shift from recognition to recall, the linguistic barrier for EWS/Hindi-medium students, and the specific causal requirement of the rubric:
