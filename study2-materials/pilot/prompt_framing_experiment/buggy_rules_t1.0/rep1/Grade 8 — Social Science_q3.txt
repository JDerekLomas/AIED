Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. **Linguistic Decoding**: Translate the English prompt into Hindi/native language (e.g., "Mitti kaise banti hai?").
2. **Concept Retrieval**: Access the specific schema for "Soil Formation" (Pedogenesis) rather than general "Pollution" or "Agriculture."
3. **Variable Selection**: Isolate one of the five formal geographical factors (Parent Rock, Climate, Relief, Time, Organisms) from memory.
4. **Linguistic Encoding**: Translate the conceptual factor back into an English term that matches the rubric.
5. **Orthographic Execution**: Write the term legibly.

Step 2: Buggy Rules / Systematic Errors
1. **Category Displacement**: Providing a component of soil (sand, air, water) instead of a formation factor.
2. **Functional Confusion**: Naming a factor that *depletes* soil (deforestation, overgrazing) instead of one that *forms* it.
3. **Semantic Approximation**: Using "Weather" (day-to-day) instead of "Climate," or "Stone" instead of "Parent Rock."
4. **Keyword Overgeneralization**: Seeing "Soil" and writing "Alluvial" or "Black Soil" (classification instead of formation).
5. **Phonetic Encoding Error**: Misspelling terms like "Topography" or "Relief" so severely that they are unrecognizable to a grader.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. **Language Barrier**: The shift from Hindi-medium thinking to English-medium testing often leads to "blank page" syndrome in open-ended recall tasks.
2. **Rote Learning vs. Conceptual**: Students often memorize the list as a "chunk." If they cannot recall the start of the list, they may struggle to isolate a single factor.
3. **Abstract Nature**: "Time" and "Relief" are abstract concepts in this context, making them harder to recall than concrete objects.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the question is a "low-stakes" recall item, the combination of English-language production and the specific technical vocabulary required for a social science rubric significantly lowers the success rate compared to a recognition (Multiple Choice) task.
