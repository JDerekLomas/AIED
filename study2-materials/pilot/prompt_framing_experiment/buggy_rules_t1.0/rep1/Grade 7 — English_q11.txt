Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English sentence "A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony" and understand its semantic meaning.
2. Recall the formal definition of an "adjective" (a word that describes a noun).
3. Scan the sentence to identify nouns ("bird," "nest," "balcony").
4. Evaluate which word modifies a noun.
5. Isolate the specific word "tiny."
6. Write the answer in English.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1. "The First-Word Bug": Selecting the first word of the sentence (in this case "A") regardless of its function.
2. "The Content-Word Bug": Selecting the most "important" or "difficult" word in the sentence (often "balcony" or "built") because it feels like a "vocabulary" word.
3. "The Subject-Verb-Object Bug": Confusing parts of speech with parts of a sentence (identifying "bird" as the answer because it is the subject).
4. "The Phrase-Word Mismatch": The question asks for an "adjective phrase," but the rubric accepts a single adjective. A sophisticated student might look for "in our balcony" (prepositional phrase acting as an adjective) and get confused, while a struggling student may not know the difference between a word and a phrase.
5. "The Semantic Association Bug": Choosing "nest" because "bird" and "nest" are strongly associated in Hindi (घोंसला), ignoring the grammatical category.

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 7 students in this demographic often face "The Hindi-Medium Transition Gap." While they may intuitively understand descriptions, the meta-linguistic terminology ("adjective") is often taught via rote memorization of definitions rather than functional use. The disconnect between the question (asking for a "phrase") and the rubric (accepting a "word") creates a significant validity gap for higher-achievers, while lower-achievers struggle with the English-only prompt.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the linguistic barrier and the cognitive load of identifying a grammatical category in a second language, many students will default to guessing or identifying the most recognizable noun.
