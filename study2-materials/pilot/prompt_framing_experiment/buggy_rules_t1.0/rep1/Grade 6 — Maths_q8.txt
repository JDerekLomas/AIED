Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Recall the formula for the Area of a rectangle ($A = L \times B$).
2. Recall the formula for the Perimeter of a rectangle ($P = 2(L + B)$ or $L+L+B+B$).
3. Substitute the values: $15 \times 8$ for area and $2(15 + 8)$ for perimeter.
4. Execute multiplication ($15 \times 8 = 120$).
5. Execute addition/multiplication for perimeter ($15 + 8 = 23$; $23 \times 2 = 46$).
6. Assign correct units: $cm^2$ or sq. cm for area and $cm$ for perimeter.
7. Synthesize both answers to satisfy the multi-part requirement for a single mark.

Step 2: Systematic "Buggy Rules"
- Formula Confusion: Interchanging formulas (calculating $15+8$ for area or $15 \times 8$ for perimeter).
- Area-Perimeter Syncretism: Adding all numbers provided ($15+8$) and stopping, or multiplying all numbers provided ($15 \times 8 \times 2$).
- Unit Neglect/Error: Using $cm$ for area or $cm^2$ for perimeter; omitting units entirely.
- Computational Slips: Errors in the $15 \times 8$ multiplication (e.g., $5 \times 8 = 40$, carry 4, $1 \times 8 + 4 = 12$).
- Semantic Noise: Students from Hindi-medium backgrounds may struggle with "Length" vs "Breadth" terminology if the concepts aren't translated/visualized.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- The "All-or-Nothing" Rubric: The rubric requires the area calculation for the mark, but the question asks for both. In many Indian govt. school contexts, students may find one and forget the other, or fail the multi-step demand.
- Open-ended recall: Without options (MCQs), students cannot use "guess and check."
- Language Barrier: The English terms "Length," "Breadth," "Area," and "Perimeter" are high-frequency but often decoded purely by rote memorization rather than conceptual understanding.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the multiplication $15 \times 8$ is standard for Grade 6, the combination of two distinct formulas, the unit requirements, and the specific socio-economic/linguistic constraints leads to a high probability of at least one procedural "bug" or omission.
