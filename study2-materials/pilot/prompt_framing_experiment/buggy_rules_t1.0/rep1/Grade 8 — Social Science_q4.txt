Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the semantic meaning of "primary role" and "Panchayati Raj system" in English.
2. Retrieve the specific conceptual framework of the three-tier governance system from memory (recall).
3. Distinguish the "primary" (essential) function from secondary functions (e.g., individual schemes vs. the concept of self-governance).
4. Translate the internal conceptual understanding from Hindi/native thought into a formal English sentence.
5. Synthesize the dual components required by the rubric: level (grassroots/village) and function (administration/development).

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **The "Specific Example" Bug:** Instead of defining the "role," the student lists a single task (e.g., "building roads" or "hand pumps").
2. **The "Translation/Vocabulary" Bug:** Misinterpreting "primary" as "elementary school" (Prathmik), leading to answers about education.
3. **The "Hierarchy Confusion" Bug:** Attributing powers of the Central/State government to the local level.
4. **The "Keyword Association" Bug:** Writing "Mahatma Gandhi" or "Village" without explaining the administrative mechanism.
5. **The "Grammar-Constraint" Bug:** The student understands the concept but produces an unintelligible English sentence that fails to meet the rubric's "Correctly identifies" standard.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often have "functional" knowledge of the Panchayat because it is visible in their lives, but the shift from Hindi-medium instruction to English-medium assessment (or limited English proficiency) creates a significant barrier for open-ended recall. Unlike multiple-choice questions (recognition), recall requires high linguistic confidence. The requirement to identify "local self-governance" (a complex abstract term) rather than just "helping people" is a high cognitive load.
