Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Identify and capitalize the first letter of the sentence (Riya).
2. Recognize "Meena" as a proper noun and capitalize the first letter.
3. Recognize "Sunday" as a proper noun/day of the week and capitalize the first letter.
4. Identify the sentence as a declarative statement and add a terminal period/full stop.
5. Maintain the correct spelling and word order of the original prompt while rewriting.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. "First-word-only" rule: The student capitalizes the start of the sentence but ignores proper nouns in the middle (Meena, Sunday).
2. "Phonetic transfer": In Hindi-medium contexts, proper nouns are not distinctively marked by case (as Hindi script lacks capitals). Students may treat "riya," "meena," and "sunday" as common nouns.
3. "Terminal neglect": Omitting the full stop because the student focuses entirely on the "letters" rather than the "punctuation mark."
4. "Selective capitalization": Capitalizing the person (Meena) but not the time/day (Sunday), or vice versa, based on perceived importance.
5. "Over-generalization": Capitalizing common nouns like "Market" or "Friend" (Germanic style or for emphasis).

Step 3: Population considerations
Grade 6 students from economically weaker sections often have inconsistent exposure to English syntax. In an open-ended "Rewrite" format, the cognitive load is higher than a multiple-choice "Identify the correct sentence" task. The "all-or-nothing" nature of the rubric (Maximum score: 1) means a single missed capital letter or a missing full stop results in a score of 0, even if the student corrected 3 out of 4 errors.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
The requirement for four distinct, perfect corrections (three capitals and one period) creates a high probability that at least one "bug" will occur, especially the capitalization of "Sunday" or the terminal full stop.
