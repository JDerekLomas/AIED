Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Decode the complex academic English vocabulary ("transparency," "governance," "suggest").
2. Retrieve the conceptual meaning of "transparency" from memory (differentiating it from physical transparency or general "honesty").
3. Contextualize the concept within the framework of government operations (RTI, public records, open meetings).
4. Formulate a functional solution in English or a hybrid language (Hinglish).
5. Transcribe the thought into a written sentence that meets the "plausible and relevant" rubric criteria.

Step 2: Buggy rules:
1. **Semantic Overgeneralization:** Interpreting "transparency" as "honesty" or "not lying," leading to vague answers like "Leaders should be good people."
2. **Keyword Association Bug:** Seeing "governance" and providing a generic civic answer like "People should vote" or "Stop corruption" without addressing the specific mechanism of *transparency*.
3. **Translation/Linguistic Mapping Error:** Misinterpreting the prompt due to low English proficiency (e.g., confusing "transparency" with "transport" or "transfers").
4. **Recall Gap:** Providing a descriptive definition of transparency instead of an active "suggestion" for improvement.

Step 3: Population considerations:
In Grade 7, "transparency" is an abstract, high-register Latinate word. For students in Hindi-medium or low-resource contexts, the term *pardarshita* (पारदर्शिता) might be understood, but the English prompt creates a significant barrier. The open-ended nature (recall) is significantly harder than a multiple-choice format (recognition), especially for students struggling with syntax.

Step 4: Holistic estimate:
While the rubric is generous (only one way needed), the combination of abstract vocabulary, the requirement for generative thought rather than rote repetition, and the linguistic barrier for this specific demographic suggests a high failure rate.
