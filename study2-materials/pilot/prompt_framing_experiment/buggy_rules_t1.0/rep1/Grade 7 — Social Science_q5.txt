Step 1: Procedural steps:
1. Recall the specific definition/characteristics of igneous rocks.
2. Recall the process of weathering (mechanical or chemical breakdown).
3. Recall the concept of "sediments" as the product of that breakdown.
4. Recall the process of erosion or transport (movement of sediments).
5. Synthesize these concepts into a coherent English sentence that demonstrates causality (X leads to Y).

Step 2: Buggy rules:
- **Phase Skipping:** Jumping directly from Igneous to Metamorphic (the most commonly remembered "transformation" in rock cycle diagrams).
- **The "Melting" Bug:** Assuming all rock transformations require heat and pressure (over-generalizing the volcanic aspect of the rock cycle).
- **Vocabulary Confusion:** Misinterpreting "Sedimentary" as "Sedimentation" (the settling process) but failing to mention the breakdown of the parent rock.
- **Linguistic Scaffolding Error:** Being able to visualize the process but failing to retrieve the specific English terms "weathering" or "erosion," resulting in vague descriptions like "it breaks and moves."

Step 3: Population considerations:
- Grade 7 is the introductory level for formal geological processes.
- For students with limited English proficiency, "Igneous" and "Sedimentary" are high-lexical-load words that are often memorized phonetically rather than conceptually.
- The open-ended format removes the "recognition" advantage of a multiple-choice question.

Step 4: Estimation:
The combination of specific vocabulary requirements, the multi-step causal chain (Breakdown → Transport), and the language barrier for the specific demographic suggests a high rate of partial or incorrect "buggy" responses.
