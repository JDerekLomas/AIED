Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the written English instruction ("Write the antonym") and the prompt word ("ancient").
2. Retrieve the semantic meaning of the metalinguistic term "antonym" (mapping it to "opposite" or the Hindi concept of *vilom shabd*).
3. Retrieve the semantic meaning of the stimulus word "ancient" (mapping it to "very old" or *pracheen* / *purana*).
4. Perform a lexical search for a word with the polar opposite meaning in the English mental lexicon.
5. Select a candidate ("modern" or "new") and verify its grammatical category (adjective).
6. Execute the orthographic production (spelling) of the retrieved word correctly.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
1. **Semantic Misalignment (Synonym Bug):** Student provides a synonym ("old") instead of an antonym, a common error when associations are strong but directional logic is weak.
2. **Translation-Output Gap:** Student correctly identifies the concept in Hindi (*naya*) but lacks the English productive vocabulary to translate it.
3. **Phonetic Spelling Bug:** Student attempts "modern" but produces an unrecognizable string (e.g., "morden," "modren") which may be marked wrong depending on teacher strictness.
4. **Instructional Neglect:** Student ignores the specific prompt and writes a sentence using "ancient" rather than its opposite.
5. **Associative Interference:** Student provides a word related to the context of "ancient" (e.g., "history," "king") rather than the linguistic opposite.

Step 3: Population Considerations
The open-ended nature (recall) is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice (recognition). For Grade 7 students in this demographic, "ancient" is a low-frequency Tier 2 vocabulary word. While "new" is a Tier 1 word, the link between "ancient" and "modern" is academic and often requires specific classroom exposure. Limited English proficiency increases the likelihood of the Translation-Output Gap.
