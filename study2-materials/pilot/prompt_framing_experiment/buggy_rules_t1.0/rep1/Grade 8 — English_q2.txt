Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English question (lexical retrieval for "sounds," "heard," and "scene").
2. Access the mental representation of the text (recall specific sensory details from the sunset passage).
3. Distinguish between different sensory inputs (filtering visual details like colors from auditory details like chirping).
4. Map the recalled memory to the target concept (birds returning to nests).
5. Formulate an English sentence or phrase that communicates the sound (e.g., "chirping," "singing," or "birds' sounds").

Step 2: Buggy rules / systematic errors
1. Over-generalization of visual cues: Students often provide the most prominent feature of a scene (the sun setting) rather than the specific sensory detail requested (sound).
2. Keyword matching error: Seeing "scene" and providing a general description of the location instead of the specific sound.
3. Language interference (Hindi to English): Translating "panchi ki awaz" but lacking the specific English vocabulary for "chirping" or "returning," leading to incomplete or unintelligible phrases.
4. Literalism bug: Looking for the word "sound" in the text rather than inferring sounds from context (e.g., "birds chirped" implies a sound even if the word "sound" isn't used).

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 8 students from EWS backgrounds often face a "literacy gap" where their reading comprehension in a second language lags behind their cognitive maturity. In open-ended recall tasks, the lack of "scaffolding" (like MCQ options) significantly increases the cognitive load. For these students, the transition from "learning to read" to "reading to learn" is often incomplete.

Step 4: Holistic analysis
While the concept (birds at sunset) is culturally familiar, the requirement to isolate an auditory detail and express it in a second language creates a high failure rate. Many students will describe the sun or use the wrong sensory modality.
