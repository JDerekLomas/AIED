Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the English phrasing of the prompt (specifically the distinction between "human environment" and "natural environment").
2. Retrieve the academic definition of "human environment" (social/cultural/built structures) from long-term memory.
3. Distinguish "human environment" (the creation) from "human-made environment" (the physical objects) as per NCERT Grade 7 geography distinctions.
4. Recall a causal relationship where human action alters a natural element (modification).
5. Synthesize these two components into a written English sentence.

Step 2: Buggy rules
1. **Definitional Conflation:** Defining "human environment" as "the environment where humans live" (tautology) or confusing it with the "natural environment."
2. **Category Error:** Providing a "human-made" object (e.g., a bridge) as the definition of the environment itself rather than the system of interaction.
3. **The "Example-as-Definition" Bug:** Providing only an example (e.g., "buildings") and assuming it satisfies the requirement for a formal definition.
4. **Linguistic Transliteration Error:** Directly translating a Hindi concept (e.g., *paryavaran*) which might lose the specific technical nuance required by the rubric.
5. **Partial Execution:** Providing the example but failing to provide the formal definition, or vice versa.

Step 3: Target population considerations
- **Language Barrier:** For Hindi-medium students, "human environment" (*manav paryavaran*) is technically dense. English production is a significant hurdle.
- **Cognitive Load:** The 0.5-mark allocation is disproportionately low for a two-part open-ended recall question, which may lead students to provide brief, insufficient answers.
- **Rote Learning vs. Conceptual Clarity:** Many students may have memorized "biotic/abiotic" but struggle with the more abstract "human environment" definition.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
The low mark value (0.5) suggests many students will treat this as a one-word or one-phrase answer, likely missing the formal "definition" requirement or the "modification" nuance. Given the language barrier and the specific technicality required by the NCERT rubric for "human environment," the failure rate for a *fully* correct response (both parts) is high.
