Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Linguistic Decoding: Understand that "maximum value... exact number of times" implies the Greatest Common Divisor/HCF.
2. Prime Factorization/Division: Decompose 75 (3 × 5 × 5) and 69 (3 × 23) into factors or use the long division method.
3. Factor Comparison: Identify the intersection of the factor sets (common factors).
4. Calculation of HCF: Select the product of common factors (in this case, just 3).
5. Unit Attachment: Express the final answer in kg.

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- Key-word Bug: Associating "Maximum" with LCM (Least Common Multiple) instead of HCF, leading to an answer of 1725.
- Prime Number Misidentification: Treating 69 as a prime number (due to its proximity to 67 or 71) or failing to recognize 23 as a prime factor.
- Division Error: "Small-from-large" subtraction errors during the Euclidean division algorithm or incorrect mental division of 69 by 3.
- Partial Factorization: Listing some factors but stopping before finding the highest common one.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 6 is the transitional year for HCF/LCM conceptualization.
- Hindi-medium background: The English phrase "exact number of times" is a high-register mathematical idiom that is often misunderstood by ESL learners as a cue for division or simple subtraction.
- Low-stakes/Economic context: Limited access to remedial tutoring means "buggy rules" often persist longer.
- Low weightage (0.5 marks): Students may rush the problem or show less rigor in checking work.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
While the arithmetic (75, 69) involves relatively small numbers, the linguistic barrier of the word problem combined with the common "Maximum = LCM" misconception and the difficulty of identifying factors of 69 (3 and 23) creates a high probability of error.
