Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Decoding and Translation:** Translate the English academic terms "biodiversity" and "sustainable development" into their conceptual equivalents (likely via Hindi "jaiv-vividhata" and "satat vikas").
2.  **Conceptual Mapping:** Link the two concepts by identifying the functional relationship (how variety in life supports long-term resource availability).
3.  **Retrieval of Ecosystem Services:** Recall specific examples of services (pollination, nutrient cycling, water purification) as defined in the rubric.
4.  **Syntactical Construction:** Formulate a coherent sentence in English that establishes a causal or supportive link between these concepts.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1.  **Term Substitution:** Confusing "biodiversity" with general "environment" or "pollution," leading to generic answers like "don't cut trees" rather than explaining systemic importance.
2.  **Definition-Only Loop:** Defining both terms correctly but failing to explain the *importance* of one for the other (lack of relational reasoning).
3.  **The "Keyword Soup" Bug:** Listing memorized terms (clean air, water) without connecting them to the mechanism of "sustainable development."
4.  **Language-Switching Syntax:** Thinking in Hindi and translating word-for-word, often resulting in broken English that may fail a strict rubric check for "explaining."

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 8 students from economically weaker sections often face a "double burden": conceptual complexity and English language barriers. In Indian government schools, "Sustainable Development" is a high-abstraction topic. While students might intuitively understand nature's value, the requirement to explain it as a "fundamental life support system" for "sustainable development" in a non-native language is a high-hurdle task. Open-ended recall is significantly more difficult than multiple-choice recognition for this demographic.

Step 4: Holistic estimate
The alignment of abstract concepts, the need for English production, and the specific requirement for "ecosystem services" (rather than just saying "animals are good") suggests a high error rate.
