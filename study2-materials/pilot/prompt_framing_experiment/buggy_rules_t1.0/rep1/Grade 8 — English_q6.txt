Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the command verb "Define" (distinguishing it from "List" or "Example").
2. Retrieve the semantic concept of "fable" from long-term memory.
3. Isolate the two essential attributes: animal characters and moral lesson.
4. Synthesize these attributes into a grammatically coherent sentence in English.
5. Apply correct English syntax and vocabulary (e.g., "imparts," "moral," "characters").

Step 2: Identified "buggy rules"
1. **The "Example-as-Definition" Bug**: Providing the title of a story (e.g., "The Thirsty Crow") instead of a categorical definition.
2. **The "Surface Feature" Bug**: Defining it only by characters (e.g., "A story about animals") while omitting the functional requirement (the moral).
3. **The "Translation-Transliteration" Bug**: Thinking of the Hindi concept "niti-katha" but failing to find the English equivalents for "moral" or "lesson," leading to "Story give good things."
4. **The "Synonym Swap" Bug**: Confusing "fable" with "fairy tale" or "folk tale," leading to definitions involving magic or kings.

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 8 students in this demographic often face a "threshold effect" where they understand the concept in their mother tongue but lack the English expressive vocabulary to meet a formal rubric. An open-ended "Define" question is significantly harder than a multiple-choice "Identify" question. The word "imparts" in the rubric is a high-register verb that most students in this demographic will not use, though they may use "gives" or "teaches."

Step 4: Holistic estimate
Considering the requirement for a dual-component definition (animals + moral) in a second language without the aid of recognition cues, the failure rate for a "fully correct" response according to a strict rubric is typically high in these contexts.
