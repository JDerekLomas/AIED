Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the English-language scenario (decoding "stunted growth," "yellowing," and "deficiency").
2. Link the symptom (yellowing/stunted growth) to the conceptual category of plant nutrition (specifically Nitrogen deficiency/Chlorosis).
3. Recall the specific remedy (application of fertilizers/manures).
4. Recall specific terminology for essential nutrients (NPK).
5. Construct a coherent sentence in English to communicate the recommendation.

Step 2: Buggy Rules/Systematic Errors
- "Surface Keyword Matching": Students may see "farmer" and "soil" and provide a generic agricultural response (e.g., "plowing" or "watering") rather than a chemical/nutrient one.
- "Language Interference/Code-Switching": The student knows the concept in Hindi (Khaad) but cannot recall or spell the English equivalent (Fertilizer/Manure).
- "Over-generalization": Assigning any "care" action to a "sick" plant (e.g., "give more water") without distinguishing between physical and chemical needs.
- "Partial Recall Bug": Mentioning "add nutrients" but failing to name a specific element (N, P, or K) as required by the rubric.

Step 3: Population Considerations
- Grade 7 students at this level often struggle with the transition from recognition (multiple choice) to production (open-ended).
- Limited English proficiency significantly increases the "frictional cost" of the first and last steps.
- While "Fertilizer" is a high-frequency word, the requirement to specify a nutrient (Nitrogen/Phosphorus/Potassium) is a high-level cognitive load for a 1-point question in a second language.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement to name a specific nutrient and the language barrier, many students will provide a correct general answer ("add fertilizer") but fail the specific rubric requirement.
