Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the written English question ("Who", "lived", "inside").
2. Retrieve the specific narrative detail from long-term memory (recall vs. recognition).
3. Map the conceptual entity ("pari") to the English target word ("fairy").
4. Formulate a syntactically coherent response in English (Subject-Verb-Object or a stand-alone noun phrase).
5. Transcribe the answer using correct orthography/spelling.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. "Literal Translation Bug": Translating a mental Hindi response directly into English, resulting in "Book in fairy" or "Fairy lived".
2. "Wh-Word Confusion Bug": Mistaking "Who" for "Where" or "How," leading to an answer describing the book rather than the character.
3. "Phonetic Spelling Bug": Spelling "fairy" as "fary," "pari," or "fery" due to L1 interference or weak English phonics.
4. "Last-Word Salience Bug": Focusing only on the word "book" and describing the book's physical properties instead of answering the "Who" question.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 students from EWS backgrounds in Indian government schools often face a "reading-to-learn" gap. While they may understand the story in a bilingual classroom setting, the transition from a Hindi-mediated understanding to a formal English written output is a significant barrier. The open-ended recall format is significantly harder than a multiple-choice format for this demographic.

Step 4: Holistic Estimate
Given the requirement for precise recall, English vocabulary retrieval, and the transition from L1 thought to L2 production, many students will provide partially correct or Hindi-influenced answers that may not meet the strict rubric if the examiner is not lenient.
