To analyze this item through the lens of systematic procedural errors (bugs), we must break down the "Passive Voice Algorithm" required for Sentence A.

**Step 1: Procedural Steps**
1. **Identify the Object:** Locate "a delicious meal" as the new subject.
2. **Tense Identification:** Identify "prepared" as Simple Past.
3. **Auxiliary Selection:** Choose the correct form of "to be" based on the new subject (singular/plural) and original tense (Past).
4. **Verb Transformation:** Convert the main verb to the Past Participle (V3) form.
5. **Agent Inclusion:** Add the preposition "by" followed by the original subject "the chef."
6. **Syntactic Reordering:** Assemble the string in the correct SOV/SVO shift.

**Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)**
*   **The "Tense-Cling" Bug:** Keeping the original tense's surface form (e.g., "A delicious meal *prepared* by...") without adding the auxiliary.
*   **The "Agreement Swap" Bug:** Choosing "were" instead of "was" due to proximity to "chef" or confusion with plural markers.
*   **The "V2/V3 Collapse" Bug:** For regular verbs ending in *-ed*, students often fail to realize a transformation has occurred, leading to errors when they encounter irregular verbs (though "prepared" is safe here).
*   **The "Present-Default" Bug:** Using "is" instead of "was" because "is" is the most frequently reinforced auxiliary in L2 learning.
*   **The "Subject-Object Confusion" Bug:** Starting the sentence with "The chef..." but trying to force a passive structure.

**Step 3: Population Considerations**
In the context of Indian government schools (EWS/Hindi-medium), students often treat grammar as a set of memorized "rules" rather than a functional system. The open-ended nature of the question (recall) is significantly harder than a multiple-choice item (recognition). Interference from Hindi (which uses a different passive construction using *jana/gaya*) often leads to the omission of the "to be" auxiliary in English.

**Step 4: Holistic Estimate**
While "prepared" is a relatively simple verb, the requirement to execute all five steps (Identification, Auxiliary Selection, Tense Matching, Participle use, and Prepositional Agent) without a single "bug" is a high cognitive load for Grade 8 students with limited English exposure. Even if they know the "by" rule, the "Auxiliary + V3" combination is where the majority of systematic failures occur.
