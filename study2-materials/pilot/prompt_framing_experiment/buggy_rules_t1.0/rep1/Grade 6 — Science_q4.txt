Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1.  **Semantic Decoding:** Decode the English sentence to identify the core question (Why cotton in summer?).
2.  **Concept Retrieval:** Recall the scientific properties of cotton fibers from the "Fiber to Fabric" or "Heat" chapters.
3.  **Causal Mapping:** Connect a specific physical property (absorption/porosity) to a physiological benefit (cooling/sweat removal).
4.  **Linguistic Encoding:** Formulate an English sentence that uses the correct scientific terminology (absorber, porous, sweat) or a functional equivalent.

Step 2: Buggy rules / Systematic errors
1.  **The "Function-over-Property" Bug:** Students describe the feeling ("It keeps us cool") instead of the scientific *property* (absorption), failing the rubric's specific requirement.
2.  **The "Visible Property" Bug:** Students cite irrelevant but true properties they can see, such as "it is soft" or "it is white," rather than the microscopic properties required for the explanation.
3.  **The "Keyword Substitution" Bug:** Confusing "cotton" properties with "jute" or "synthetic" properties (e.g., saying it is "strong" or "shiny").
4.  **Translation Bottleneck:** Knowing the concept in Hindi (*pasina sokhna*) but being unable to retrieve the English word "absorb" or "sweat," leading to an empty or fragmented response.

Step 3: Target population considerations
Grade 6 is the transitional year where students move from general observation to formal scientific definitions. For students from Hindi-medium backgrounds in economically weaker sections, "absorb," "porous," and "property" are high-tier vocabulary words. While the concept is culturally familiar, the requirement to produce an English explanation (recall/production) rather than selecting an answer (recognition) significantly increases the cognitive load.
