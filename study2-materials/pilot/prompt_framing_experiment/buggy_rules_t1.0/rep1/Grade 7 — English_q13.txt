Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Comprehend the sentence structure and vocabulary (I saw, elephant, tiger, zoo).
2. Apply the phonetic rule for "an" before a vowel sound (e-le-phant).
3. Apply the consonant rule for "a" before "tiger."
4. Apply the definite article "the" for the specific/situational noun "zoo."
5. Physical execution: Rewrite the entire sentence from memory/prompt without omitting words or changing the tense.
6. Verify spelling and syntax during the rewriting process.

Step 2: Buggy Rules (Systematic Errors)
1. "The First Letter Rule": Students use "a" for "elephant" because they focus on the letter "e" but default to "a" as the universal article.
2. "The Uniform Article Bug": Using the same article (usually "a" or "the") for every blank in the sentence to maintain consistency.
3. "The Phonetic/Spelling Mismatch": Confusion over "an" vs "a" based on the letter name rather than the sound (though less common for "elephant" than "hour").
4. "The Deletion Bug": In the process of rewriting the "whole sentence," the student provides only the three missing words, failing the rubric requirement.
5. "The Proper Noun Bug": Treating "Elephant" or "Tiger" as a proper name (like a person) and omitting the article entirely.
6. "The Translation Interference": In Hindi, articles are often omitted or substituted with the number "one" (ek); students may translate "I saw one elephant..." mentally and fail to produce the English article.

Step 3: Population Considerations
1. Grade 7 students in this demographic often struggle with the "rewrite the whole sentence" instruction, frequently losing marks on technicality rather than grammar.
2. English as a Second Language (ESL) interference is high; the distinction between definite (the) and indefinite (a/an) is one of the last features mastered in Indian English medium instruction for low-income schools.
3. The open-ended format removes the 33% chance of guessing correctly in a multiple-choice setting.
