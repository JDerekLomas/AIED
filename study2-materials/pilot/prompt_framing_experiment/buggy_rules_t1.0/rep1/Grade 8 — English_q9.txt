Step 1: Procedural Steps
1. Decode the terms "Synonym" and "Antonym" (linguistic terminology mapping).
2. Retrieve the semantic meaning of the target word "quiet."
3. Access the mental lexicon to find a word with a similar meaning (Synonym).
4. Access the mental lexicon to find a word with the opposite meaning (Antonym).
5. Execute the orthographic task of spelling both retrieved words correctly in English.
6. Map the correct retrieved word to the corresponding numbered slot (avoiding "swapping").

Step 2: Buggy Rules
- **Term Swap Bug:** The student understands both concepts but confuses the labels, providing an antonym for the synonym slot and vice versa.
- **Association Bug:** The student provides a word related to "quiet" (e.g., "library" or "shhh") rather than a word with the same grammatical/semantic function.
- **Phonetic Approximation Bug:** The student retrieves the correct word (e.g., "silent" or "noisy") but produces an unintelligible spelling due to phonetic interference (e.g., "sallent" or "noies").
- **L1 Interference:** The student knows the concept but cannot bridge the gap to English, potentially leaving it blank or writing the Hindi equivalent (e.g., "shant").
- **Definition Bug:** Providing a sentence describing the word rather than a single-word synonym/antonym.

Step 3: Population Considerations
For Grade 8 students in this context, "Synonym" and "Antonym" are high-level academic vocabulary. While "quiet" is a common word, the open-ended recall format is significantly more difficult than a multiple-choice format. Limited English proficiency often results in a "vocabulary gap" where students may know the meaning of the target word but lack the active recall of a second, distinct word to serve as a synonym.
