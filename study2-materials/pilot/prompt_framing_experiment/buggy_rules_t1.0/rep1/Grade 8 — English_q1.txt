Step 1: Specific procedural steps
1. Decode the syntax and vocabulary of the question (understanding "How did," "look," and "during").
2. Retrieve the specific visual imagery from the source text (memory recall of colors: orange/pink).
3. Translate the mental image back into English vocabulary words.
4. Construct a syntactically correct English sentence (Subject + Verb + Adjective/Prepositional phrase).
5. Apply correct spelling and orthography for color words.

Step 2: Buggy rules/Systematic errors
1. **The "Keyword Matching" Bug:** Searching the text for "sunset" and copying the entire sentence containing it, even if it doesn't describe the sky.
2. **The "L1-L2 Translation" Bug:** Thinking in Hindi (Aasman gulabi thaa) and producing "Sky pink was," failing English SVO order.
3. **The "Partial Recall" Bug:** Listing only one color (orange) instead of both, violating the rubric requirement for "both colors."
4. **The "Phonetic Spelling" Bug:** Writing "org" or "pinc" based on phonetic interpretation, which may be marked wrong depending on the strictness of the evaluator.
5. **The "Vague Descriptor" Bug:** Using generic adjectives like "beautiful" or "good" instead of the specific colors required by the rubric.

Step 3: Student population considerations
Grade 8 students in this context often possess functional literacy but struggle with open-ended recall in a second language. Without a word bank or multiple-choice options, the cognitive load of simultaneous retrieval and grammatical encoding is high. The requirement for *two* specific colors (orange AND pink) is a significant threshold that often penalizes students who understood the text but provided a concise or singular answer.
