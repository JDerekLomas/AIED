Let's break down the thought process for calibrating this estimate.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**
My first instinct, as someone with a good grasp of English and grammar, would be: "Adjective phrases are pretty basic. 'Tiny' is clearly an adjective. Most students should get this." This is the expert bias the prompt warns against.

**Challenging the Assumptions based on the Provided Data:**

1.  **"Average pass rate is about 29%."** This immediately sets a low baseline. The students are generally struggling.

2.  **"Mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English."** This is crucial.
    *   **Limited English:** While "tiny" might be a known word, the *grammatical concept* of an "adjective phrase" is a higher-level English skill. Many students might know what an adjective *is* (e.g., "describe a bird"), but not necessarily be able to *identify it as an adjective phrase* in a formal grammatical context, especially if they haven't explicitly practiced this specific terminology.
    *   **"Adjective phrase" vs. "Adjective":** The rubric says "The student correctly identifies 'tiny' as an adjective." This is key. If the question asked to identify *an adjective*, it would be easier. But it asks for an *adjective phrase*. The phrase is just "tiny" in this case. Would a struggling student know that a single word *can be* an adjective phrase? Or would they look for multiple words? This is a potential trap.

3.  **COMMON ERRORS & Low Pass Rates on Other Questions:**
    *   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass rate) - This requires interpreting a question and then formulating a response about literary style. Very hard for these students.
    *   "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate) - Requires comprehension and abstract thinking about a poem's message. Also very hard.
    *   "Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'." (10% pass rate) - Even this, a seemingly simple personal topic, yields a very low pass rate. The errors ("My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho") show a struggle with sentence structure, basic grammar, and perhaps even understanding the "paragraph" instruction. "My hobby is cricket play" is another example of very basic English.

4.  **"Teachers and experts consistently MISJUDGE item difficulty."** This reinforces the need to severely adjust downward from my initial instinct.

5.  **"Could a student who barely reads English?"**
    *   They might know "tiny" means small.
    *   But "identify," "adjective," and "phrase" might be completely opaque. They might know "bird" and "nest" and "balcony" but not the grammatical function of words.

6.  **"Could a student who was absent for this topic?"**
    *   Grammar topics are often taught explicitly. If they missed the lesson on adjectives or adjective phrases, they'd have no basis.

7.  **"Exam anxiety causes blank responses."** Many blank responses are seen in the examples. This will further depress scores.

**Re-evaluating the Specific Question:**
"Identify the adjective phrase in the sentence:\nA tiny bird built its nest in our balcony."

*   **Difficulty of "Adjective phrase":** For someone with limited English, "adjective phrase" is a technical term. Many might confuse it with an adverbial phrase, or just pick any noun they see.
*   **Difficulty of "tiny":** The word itself is relatively common.
*   **The Trap:** The fact that the "adjective phrase" is just a single adjective ("tiny") could confuse students who are looking for a *group* of words, as "phrase" often implies multiple words. They might pick "in our balcony" (adverbial phrase), or "a tiny bird" (noun phrase), or just randomly pick "nest."

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Considering:
*   The very low general pass rate (29%).
*   The even lower pass rates on other "writing" and "comprehension" questions (4-10%).
*   The struggle with basic paragraph writing and sentence structure.
*   The technical nature of "adjective phrase" for struggling learners.
*   The potential confusion of a single-word "phrase."
*   The prevalence of "Empty Response."

This question is asking for a specific grammatical identification, which is often harder than simple vocabulary or direct comprehension for these students. While "tiny" is a known word, the grammatical concept is likely beyond many.

I would expect a significant number of "Empty Responses," random guesses, or attempts to
