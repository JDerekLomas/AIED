Let's break down the question and the context.

**The Question:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"

**Rubric:** "Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why."

**Challenges for Class 6 Indian Government School Students (EWS, limited English):**

1.  **Understanding "Which line... do you like the most?"**:
    *   "Which line": Requires them to identify a specific sentence/phrase from a longer text. This assumes they can differentiate lines and recall them or refer to them.
    *   "do you like the most": This requires an *opinion* and a personal connection. While seemingly simple, for students used to factual recall, this can be a hurdle. They might not be comfortable expressing personal preference in English.

2.  **Understanding "and why?"**:
    *   This is the biggest hurdle. "Why" requires justification, reasoning, and the ability to articulate that reasoning in English.
    *   Looking at the common errors:
        *   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%) - Requires analytical thought and expression. Students struggle.
        *   "Write a theme or central idea..." (pass rate: 5%) - Requires abstract thinking and summarization, also difficult.
        *   "Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'." (pass rate: 10%) - Even for a simple personal topic, paragraph structure and sentence formation are weak. Students provide fragmented lists or single sentences.

3.  **Language Proficiency for the Response:**
    *   To get 1.5 marks, they need to:
        *   Quote or accurately paraphrase a line.
        *   Provide a reason.
    *   Example "correct" answers would look something like: "I like the line 'The King sat on his chariot' because it makes me imagine a powerful king."
    *   This requires:
        *   Correct sentence structure.
        *   Vocabulary to express "imagine," "powerful," "because," etc.
        *   Ability to connect the line to a personal feeling or thought.

4.  **Recalling the Poem:** The question doesn't state if the poem is provided with the question or if it's from memory. Assuming it's a recent poem covered in class, they still need to recall specific lines. If the poem is present, it reduces one cognitive load, but the "why" remains.

5.  **Exam Anxiety/"Empty Response"**: Given the high rate of "Empty Response" in other questions, many will simply freeze or not know how to start.

**Revisiting My Instincts:**

My first instinct might be "Oh, students like to talk about what they like! This should be easy."

**Challenging that instinct:**

*   **"What they like" vs. "articulating *why* they like it in English."** This is the key. They might *feel* they like a line, but expressing that feeling with a coherent reason in a foreign language is a very high bar for a 29% average pass rate cohort.
*   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic:** "Expressing an opinion and justifying it" is basic for fluent English speakers, but not for these students, especially in a formal exam setting.
*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** They might have done "Which is your favourite colour?" but not "Which line from a poem do you like and *why*, articulating it in complete sentences."

**Likely Errors for this specific question:**

*   Quoting a line but no "why." (Partial credit, maybe not 1.5)
*   Saying "I like this line" but no line quoted/mentioned.
*   Mentioning a line and giving a very generic, non-specific "why" (e.g., "it is good," "I like it").
*   Misunderstanding "line" and writing something else about the poem.
*   Writing an "Empty Response."
*   Writing a reason in their native language (if allowed, but usually not for English exam).
*   Giving a "why" that is not a reason but another observation (e.g., "I like the line 'The king came' because the king is a king.")

Considering the common errors (analytical questions at 4-5%, even a simple paragraph on 'My Hobby' at 10%), asking for a justified opinion about a literary text is extremely challenging. The "why" component elevates it significantly. Students might be able to pick a line, but articulating a *reason* in coherent English is where most will fail.

I expect a very low score, similar to the analytical questions, because the "why" demands a level of expression and reasoning
