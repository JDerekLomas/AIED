Let's break down the thought process to arrive at a calibrated estimate.

**1. Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**
My first instinct, based on having a decent grasp of English and understanding what "writing style" means, might be: "This is a pretty straightforward question. They just need to pick an adjective. Maybe 20-30%."

**2. Applying the "Challenging Assumptions" Filter:**

*   **"How limited many students' English actually is":** The provided examples are stark.
    *   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%) -> Wrong answer: "I am reading."
    *   This is the *exact same question stem*. The fact that only 4% got it right before, with "I am reading" as a common wrong answer, tells me students are struggling with the very concept of "describes," "poet's," and "writing style." They might interpret "describes" as "what am I doing now?" or just latch onto familiar words.
    *   "Write a theme or central idea..." (pass rate: 5%)
    *   "Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'" (pass rate: 10%)
    *   These low pass rates for seemingly simple tasks involving writing or identifying concepts reinforce the extreme limitation in English comprehension and expression.

*   **"That 'basic' concepts aren't basic for struggling learners":** "Writing style" is not a basic concept for someone with limited English. It's an abstract literary term. Even if they know "write" and "style" individually, combining them into "writing style" and then understanding "describes" in this context is a huge leap.

*   **"That exam anxiety causes blank responses":** "Empty Response" is a very common wrong answer in the examples. This suggests that even if a student has a faint idea, the pressure or lack of confidence leads to them not writing anything.

*   **"That many students have never practiced this exact question type":** This question is about literary analysis. Given the struggle with basic comprehension and sentence formation, it's highly unlikely they've practiced identifying "writing style" with any regularity or success.

**3. Focusing on the Specific Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question:** "Describes the poet’s writing style."
*   **Rubric:** "Identifies a suitable and relevant word describing the writing style (e.g., simple, descriptive, informal, direct) or other appropriate word."

To get this right, a student needs to:
1.  Understand "describes."
2.  Understand "poet's."
3.  Understand "writing style" as a combined concept.
4.  Be able to recall or infer an appropriate adjective *in English*.
5.  Spell that adjective correctly enough to be understood.

Given the prior 4% pass rate on this *exact question*, and the profound challenges observed in other questions:
*   "I am reading" shows a complete misunderstanding of the prompt.
*   "Empty Response" shows a complete inability to engage.
*   Even if they understand "style" as "how something is done," they still need to *describe* it with an appropriate English adjective.

**4. Re-calibrating:**

The fact that the *same question* previously yielded a 4% pass rate is the strongest indicator. While individual cohorts can vary, there's nothing in the provided information to suggest this cohort is significantly stronger than the one that yielded the 4%. If anything, the "average pass rate is about 29%" for the overall exam suggests a similar level of struggle.

Could it be slightly higher than 4%? Maybe, if there was some specific recent instruction, but we aren't given that. Could it be lower? Potentially, if the poem itself was particularly hard to analyze for style.

The examples provided are not for the target question, except for the first one, which *is* the target question.

The prompt specifically says:
*   "Q: 'Describes the poet’s writing style.' (pass rate: 4%)"

This is *the most direct and powerful piece of evidence*. I must give this precedence over my general assumptions or even other related questions. If this exact question previously yielded 4%, it's highly improbable it will suddenly jump to, say, 15% or 20% without significant intervention or change in curriculum/teaching.

My initial instinct of 20-30% is clearly too high.
Considering the 4% data point, and the general context of struggle, I need to stick very close to that.

Therefore, after challenging my assumptions, my calibrated estimate should be very close to
