Here's a breakdown of the thought process for estimating the proportion correct:

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**

My first instinct might be "Oh, mountains, that's basic geography. Most Class 6 students should know at least the Himalayas." This is precisely the expert bias that needs to be challenged.

**Challenging Assumptions based on provided information:**

*   **"Economically weaker sections with limited English."** This is *critical*. Even if they *know* the names in their native language, writing them correctly in English is a hurdle. Spelling mistakes or slightly off names might count as incorrect. "Himalayas" might be spelled "Himmalayas" or "Himalay."
*   **"Average pass rate is about 29%."** This sets a general baseline. If the average pass rate for the *entire exam* is 29%, a question needs to be significantly easier than average to exceed that by much.
*   **Common Errors:**
    *   **"Empty Response":** This is a huge factor for difficult questions. It shows students are either completely clueless, overwhelmed, or unable to formulate an answer.
    *   **Garbled/Irrelevant answers:** "Asher' stand," "ashok a second" – these are concerning for a simple factual recall question. It suggests a lack of comprehension of the question itself, or panic.
    *   **Specific Social Science Pass Rates (9-12%):** These are extremely low. While "mountains" might seem more straightforward than "colonial rule" or "Ashoka's reign," the *magnitude* of these low rates suggests a very fragile knowledge base and poor test-taking skills in general for these students.
*   **"Teachers and experts consistently MISJUDGE item difficulty."** This is the direct instruction to challenge my first instinct.
*   **"Forget how limited many students' English actually is."** This is a key point for "Himalayas" vs. "Himalay" vs. "Himalays."
*   **"That 'basic' concepts aren't basic for struggling learners."** While mountains seem basic, the *exact names* in English, and recalling *two*, might not be.
*   **"Exam anxiety causes blank responses."** Again, a major contributor to "Empty Response."
*   **"Many students have never practiced this exact question type."** While factual recall, the specific format and the need for *two* might trip some up.

**Re-evaluating the Question's Difficulty:**

*   **"Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."**
*   **Rubric: "Names one correct mountain range."** This is more lenient than needing two, which is good. If they name one, they get 0.5. The question asks for two, but the rubric rewards one. This increases the potential for partial credit.
*   **Common knowledge:** The Himalayas are undeniably the most famous. Aravalli is also quite well-known. Vindhya and Satpura are also significant. Western/Eastern Ghats are also prominent.

**Factors pushing the estimate *up* (compared to the extremely low SS rates):**

*   It's a direct factual recall question, not requiring explanation or analysis.
*   It's geography, which might sometimes be taught visually and be more concrete than abstract historical concepts.
*   The rubric allows for naming just *one* correct range for partial credit.
*   The Himalayas are universally recognized.

**Factors pushing the estimate *down* (towards the average/lower SS rates):**

*   **English limitation:** Spelling is a huge barrier. "Himalayas" might be known conceptually but difficult to write.
*   **Recall of *two* (even if one is sufficient for credit):** The prompt asks for two, which might lead students who only know one to panic or leave it blank if they feel they can't meet the "two" requirement.
*   **Prevalence of "Empty Response":** Given the other questions, even a seemingly "easier" question could still see a significant percentage of blank answers due to anxiety, poor preparation, or just not knowing.
*   **Low overall pass rate (29% average):** This implies that even relatively straightforward questions won't be aced by a majority.
*   **The other SS question pass rates (9-12%):** While this question is easier, it's operating in the same environment.

**Calibration:**

Given the extreme difficulty observed in other SS questions (9-12%) and the very high rate of "Empty Response," a purely factual question like this *should* perform better. However, the English limitation and the general academic struggle indicated by the 29% average pass rate mean
