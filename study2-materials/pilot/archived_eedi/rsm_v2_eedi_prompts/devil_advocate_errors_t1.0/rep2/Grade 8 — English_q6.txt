Let's break down the question "Define fable" considering the given context:

**Analysis of the Question and Rubric:**
*   **"Define fable."** This requires recall of a specific literary term and its key characteristics.
*   **Rubric:** "Defines fable as a short story that typically uses animals as characters and imparts a moral lesson." This is a three-part definition:
    1.  Short story
    2.  Uses animals as characters (typically)
    3.  Imparts a moral lesson

**Applying the Contextual Factors:**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "Define" itself might be challenging for some. They might understand "what is" but not "define."
    *   Keywords in the definition (short story, typically, characters, imparts, moral lesson) are not simple vocabulary. Students might know "story" and "animals" but struggle with "moral lesson" or "imparts."
    *   Given the "Empty Response" commonality for even simple writing tasks, formulating a complete, coherent definition in English will be very difficult.

2.  **Economically Weaker Sections / Limited Exposure:**
    *   While fables (Panchatantra, etc.) are culturally relevant in India, explicitly *defining* the literary term "fable" as an academic concept might not have been a focus in their instruction. They might know *examples* of fables but not the formal definition.
    *   Many students might struggle to translate their understanding of "moral story with animals" into precise English.

3.  **Common Errors Observed:**
    *   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass):** This is a *descriptive* task requiring analysis. "Define fable" is a *recall* task. The extremely low pass rate for the former indicates a severe lack of descriptive language skills and understanding of abstract concepts.
    *   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass):** Again, abstract understanding and expressing it in English is rare. "Moral lesson" is an abstract concept similar to "theme."
    *   **"Write a short paragraph..." (10% pass):** Even for a personal topic like "My Favourite Hobby," students revert to lists or very fragmented sentences. Defining a literary term is much harder than talking about a hobby. The "My hobby is cricket play" example shows basic sentence structure issues.

4.  **Teachers/Experts Overestimation:**
    *   A teacher might think, "Oh, they've heard Aesop's fables, they know what a fable is." But knowing an example is vastly different from providing a formal definition in a non-native language, especially for students who struggle with basic sentence construction.
    *   The "moral lesson" part is crucial. Students might omit this or struggle to express it.

5.  **Exam Anxiety / Blank Responses:**
    *   The high incidence of "Empty Response" across other questions suggests that if students are unsure, they will simply leave it blank rather than attempting a wrong answer.

**Challenging the Instinct:**

My first instinct might be "fable is pretty basic, maybe 20-30%." However, when I look at the 4-10% pass rates for *other* questions that require English production and conceptual understanding, "define fable" becomes much harder.

*   To get full credit, they need "short story," "animals," AND "moral lesson."
*   Getting *one* part might be doable ("story with animals").
*   Getting *two* parts is harder ("short story with animals").
*   Getting *all three* with coherent English: "A fable is a short story with animal characters that teaches a moral." This is a relatively complex sentence for someone struggling with "My hobby is cricket play."

Given the evidence, specifically the very low pass rates on questions requiring conceptual understanding and English expression, and the prevalence of "Empty Response," I expect a very low proportion to meet the full rubric. Some might get partial credit (not reflected in the "correct" proportion), but full correct response will be rare.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 7%**

*   This is higher than the lowest pass rates (4-5%) because "fable" might be more directly taught or familiar as a concept than "poet's writing style" or "theme."
*   However, it's still extremely low due to the demand for a precise, multi-part definition in good English, which contradicts the general English proficiency shown.
*   I'm banking on a very small fraction of students who have good recall *and* the English skills to articulate it. Most will likely give incomplete answers, incorrect answers, or blank responses.
