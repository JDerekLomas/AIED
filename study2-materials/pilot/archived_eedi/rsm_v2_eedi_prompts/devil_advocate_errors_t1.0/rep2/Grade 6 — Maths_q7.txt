Let's break down the thought process for estimating the proportion correct, keeping the constraints in mind.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong for this demographic):**
My first instinct, if I were an expert who forgets student struggles, might be: "This is a simple arithmetic problem. Find the time difference, multiply by the rate, add to the starting temperature. Most Class 6 students should get this." I might think 60-70%.

**Challenging the Instinct & Applying Constraints:**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "At 10 am in the morning..." - "morning" is redundant but could confuse a weak reader.
    *   "...temperature of Jodhpur was 30^0 C." - Understanding "temperature" and "C" might be an issue. Some might not know what 30^0 C *means* in practical terms, even if they can read the numbers.
    *   "If the temperature increases by 2^0 C per hour..." - "increases," "per hour" are key vocabulary. "Per hour" is a common source of confusion for rate problems.
    *   "...what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?" - "evening" vs. "morning" needs to be understood for the time calculation. "What will be" implies future, addition.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   **Time Calculation:** From 10 am to 4 pm. This isn't just "4 - 10" or "10 + 4". It requires understanding that 12 pm is noon, and then 1 pm is 13:00 if using 24-hour, or just counting 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 (6 hours). Many students, especially those struggling with number sense, find elapsed time calculations tricky. They might do 4-10 = -6, or 10-4=6 but misinterpret AM/PM. Or they might count 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 as 7 hours.
    *   **Rate of Change:** "Increases by 2^0 C *per hour*." This requires multiplication. Some might add 2 once, or just write 2.
    *   **Multi-step Problem:**
        1.  Calculate time elapsed.
        2.  Calculate total increase (time elapsed * rate).
        3.  Add total increase to initial temperature.
        Many struggling learners fail at multi-step problems. They might get one part right and then stop, or do the wrong operation for the next step.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:**
    *   If a student sees a longish word problem with numbers and symbols (C, ^0), and immediately doesn't understand "increases per hour" or how to count time, they might just stare at it or guess.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   Even if they've done "time problems" and "addition problems," combining them with a rate and a temperature context might be new. The specific "10 am to 4 pm" time jump could be a hurdle.

**Re-evaluating based on "Rubric: Calculates the time elapsed from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm as 6 hours."**

The rubric *only* cares about the time calculation. This significantly changes things. If a student can just write "6 hours" and nothing else, they get the point.

Let's re-assess just *that specific step*:
*   "At 10 am... at 4:00 in the evening."
*   Is "10 am to 4 pm" an easy mental calculation?
    *   10 -> 11 (1 hour)
    *   11 -> 12 (1 hour)
    *   12 -> 1 (1 hour)
    *   1 -> 2 (1 hour)
    *   2 -> 3 (1 hour)
    *   3 -> 4 (1 hour)
    *   Total: 6 hours.
*   *Potential pitfalls for this step alone:*
    *   Counting 10 as the first hour (making it 7 hours).
    *   Not understanding "am" vs "pm" boundary (12 o'clock).
    *   Subtracting 4 from 10 directly (6, but might not understand the AM/PM).
    *   Subtracting 10
