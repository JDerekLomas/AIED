Here's my thought process for estimating the proportion of correct answers:

1.  **Analyze the Target Audience:**
    *   Class 6 students, Indian government schools.
    *   Mostly economically weaker sections.
    *   **Limited English.** This is the single most critical factor.
    *   Average pass rate for the *entire exam* is 29%, not for individual questions. This tells me the overall English proficiency is very low.

2.  **Analyze the Common Errors from Other Questions:**
    *   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass) - Suggests extreme difficulty with abstract concepts, even basic descriptive language. "I am reading" shows a complete misunderstanding of the question's intent.
    *   "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass) - Again, abstract concepts are very hard. The partial answer "The last bargin they about a child and labour..." shows some keyword recognition but inability to form a coherent, grammatically correct thought.
    *   "Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'." (10% pass) - This is *much simpler* and still very low. "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy" indicates an inability to stay on topic, follow instructions (4-5 sentences, mention specific things), and very basic sentence structure. "My hobby is cricket play" is a common error with verb usage.

3.  **Analyze the Specific Question:**
    *   "Choose the correct word. There are (some/any) apples in the basket."
    *   Concept: Usage of 'some' vs. 'any' in affirmative sentences.
    *   This is a fundamental grammar rule taught early in English.
    *   It's not highly abstract, but it requires understanding of sentence structure and the specific contexts for 'some' and 'any'.

4.  **Initial Instinct (and why I challenge it):**
    *   My first instinct as a native English speaker would be: "This is basic! Most should get this." I'd probably think 50-60%.
    *   **Challenge:** *Remember the common errors and student profile.* The other "basic" questions yielded 4%, 5%, 10%. Why would this be drastically different?
        *   "My hobby is cricket play" vs. "There are some apples". The error with "play" shows a struggle with verb forms and basic sentence construction.
        *   "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy" shows an inability to form even simple sentences consistently, let alone apply specific grammar rules.
        *   The low pass rates on paragraph writing, even on a personal topic, indicate that forming a grammatically correct sentence is a significant hurdle for many.

5.  **Re-evaluating based on challenges:**
    *   **"Limited English":** Many students might not even grasp the difference between "some" and "any." They might pick randomly.
    *   **"Basic concepts aren't basic":** While we consider 'some/any' basic, for a struggling Class 6 student with limited exposure, this distinction might be completely lost.
    *   **"Exam anxiety/blank responses":** Some will leave it blank or make a random guess.
    *   **"Never practiced this exact question type":** While they might have seen 'some/any', the specific "choose the correct word" format might be new or intimidating.
    *   **Analogy to other questions:** The "My Favourite Hobby" question requires simpler English production and still only gets 10%. This question requires choosing between two words based on a specific grammar rule. It's *not* necessarily easier to *apply the rule* than to *write a simple sentence*.

6.  **Considering the "choice" aspect:**
    *   It's a 50/50 chance if they're guessing.
    *   However, if they guess, it's not "correct knowledge." The prompt asks for "proportion correct," implying understanding. But if they happen to choose 'some' by chance, it *counts* as correct.

7.  **Final Calibration:**
    *   Given the extremely low pass rates on other "basic" questions (4-10%), and the general low proficiency.
    *   The "My Favourite Hobby" question requires *production* of simple sentences, and the errors show fundamental struggles. This 'some/any' question requires *application* of a specific grammar rule.
    *   Many students will guess. A guess has a 50% chance of being right. If *everyone* guessed, 50
