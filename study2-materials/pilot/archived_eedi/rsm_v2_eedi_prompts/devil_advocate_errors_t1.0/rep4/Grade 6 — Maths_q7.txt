Let's break down the thought process for estimating the proportion correct, keeping in mind the constraints and biases.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**
My first thought might be: "This is a simple word problem involving time and basic addition/multiplication. Class 6 students should know this." This is the expert bias kicking in. I'm assuming a baseline of proficiency that doesn't exist for the target group.

**Challenging the Assumptions (Applying the provided filter):**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "At 10 am in the morning, the temperature of Jodhpur was 30^0 C." - Fairly straightforward. Numbers are clear. "temperature" and "Jodhpur" might be known from context.
    *   "If the temperature increases by 2^0 C per hour..." - "increases by" could be challenging. "per hour" might be understood, but the *implication* of multiplying by the number of hours might not be immediate for someone struggling with English.
    *   "...then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?" - "what will be" and "evening" are key.

    *Self-correction:* Many students will likely struggle to parse the full meaning, especially "increases by X per hour." They might get the initial temperature and the target time, but miss the multiplication aspect due to language.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   **Time Calculation (10 am to 4 pm):** This requires understanding AM/PM and how to calculate elapsed time across noon. For students with limited exposure to formal education or clock reading, this isn't trivial. They might count on their fingers, but getting exactly 6 hours without errors (e.g., counting 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 as 7 hours) is a common mistake even for slightly more proficient students.
    *   **Multiplication (2^0 C * hours):** While Class 6 students are taught multiplication, applying it in a word problem where "per hour" implies it is a step above rote calculation.
    *   **Addition (Initial temp + increase):** This is the easiest arithmetic step *if* the previous steps are correct.

    *Self-correction:* The time calculation is a significant hurdle. Many will get 5 or 7 hours instead of 6. Others might just add 2, or add 2 for *each* hour but miscount the hours.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:**
    *   If the English is difficult and the time calculation feels complex, a student might simply shut down and leave it blank. They won't attempt if they don't understand the core request.

    *Self-correction:* This will depress the score further. A student who "almost" gets it might just give up.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   While they might have practiced time calculations and simple word problems, a multi-step problem combining elapsed time, a rate of change, and final calculation might be novel. Especially if their curriculum emphasizes rote learning over problem-solving.

    *Self-correction:* This means they can't rely on memorized procedures. They have to *understand* and synthesize.

**Revised Step-by-Step Breakdown of Potential Errors:**

*   **Understanding the question (English):**
    *   Some students won't grasp "increases by 2^0 C per hour." They might just see "2^0 C" and "4:00 pm" and get lost.
    *   Difficulty identifying what needs to be found.
    *   *Estimate for understanding the *full* question:* Maybe 40-50% might grasp enough to attempt.

*   **Calculating elapsed time (10 am to 4 pm):**
    *   Common errors: Counting 7 hours (10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4), or 5 hours (missing 12 or 4).
    *   Difficulty with AM/PM transition.
    *   *Estimate for correctly getting 6 hours:* Out of those who understand, perhaps 50-60% will get this right. So, roughly 20-30% of the *total* students.

*   **Calculating total temperature increase (6 hours * 2^0 C/hour = 12^0 C):**
    *   Errors: Adding 2 instead of multiplying. Multiplying by the wrong number of hours.
    *   *Estimate for correctly calculating the increase:* Out of
