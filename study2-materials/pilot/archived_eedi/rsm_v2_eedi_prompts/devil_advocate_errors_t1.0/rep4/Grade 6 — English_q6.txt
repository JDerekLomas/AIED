Let's break down the question and rubric in the context of the students described.

**The Question:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"

**Rubric:** "Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why."

**Analysis of Difficulties:**

1.  **"Which line from the poem...?"**
    *   **Requires understanding of "line":** While seemingly basic, some students might struggle with distinguishing lines from sentences or entire stanzas, especially if their reading comprehension is weak.
    *   **Requires recall/identification:** Students need to have read and understood the poem enough to pick out a specific "line." If they struggle with general comprehension, this first step is a barrier.
    *   **Requires selection based on preference ("like the most"):** This is subjective, which can be an advantage as there's no "wrong" line. However, it still assumes they have *a* preference, which implies some level of engagement with the text.

2.  **"...do you like the most and why?"**
    *   **"Why?":** This is the biggest hurdle.
        *   **Formulating a reason:** Even if they can identify a line, articulating *why* they like it requires higher-order thinking, vocabulary, and grammatical structure to express a cause-and-effect or descriptive relationship. This is where the English proficiency gap will be most evident.
        *   **Vocabulary for reasons:** Do they know words like "because," "it shows," "it means," "I feel," etc., well enough to construct a coherent sentence?
        *   **Relating reason to the line:** The reason needs to clearly connect to the chosen line, not just be a generic statement or off-topic thought.

**Connecting to Common Errors and Expert Misjudgment:**

*   **"Describes the poet's writing style" (4% pass rate):** This question requires abstract thought and specific vocabulary. Our current question's "why" component is less abstract, but still demands explanation, which is where students failed on the 4% question.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea" (5% pass rate):** This also requires extracting and articulating meaning, similar to the "why" component. The "Empty Response" error is highly relevant here, indicating students simply don't know how to answer this type of explanatory question. "The last bargin they about a child and labour..." shows an attempt but a complete lack of grammatical control and structure.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'" (10% pass rate):** This is a *personal* and *familiar* topic, yet still only 10% succeed. The errors show basic sentence fragments and lists ("My hobby is cricket play"), not developed reasons or paragraphs. Our current question asks for a *personal* opinion, but it's tied to a *text*, making it potentially harder than "My Favourite Hobby."
*   **Expert Misjudgment:** Teachers would likely think, "Oh, it's just asking what they like and why, that's easy!" But they forget:
    *   **Limited English:** "Why" is a simple word, but constructing a grammatically correct *answer* to "why" is not simple for someone with limited English.
    *   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic:** Explaining *reasons* is not basic when you lack the linguistic tools.
    *   **Exam anxiety:** The "empty response" is a common outcome.
    *   **Lack of practice:** Many students won't have practiced articulating their personal aesthetic preferences for a line of poetry in English.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Given the extremely low pass rates on questions requiring *any* form of explanation, justification, or abstract thought, and the strong evidence of students struggling even with basic sentence construction on personal topics, the "why" component of this question will be a major stumbling block.

Even if they can identify a line, the ability to articulate a coherent and grammatically acceptable reason, linked to that line, is highly improbable for the majority of these students. The rubric allows for "mentions why," which is somewhat lenient, but it still needs to be an actual "why" and not just a repetition of the line or an off-topic sentence.

My first instinct might be 15-20% because it's "personal." But challenging that:
*   The "personal" hobby question only gets 10%.
*   The explanatory questions get 4-5%.
*   This question combines both: personal *preference* but requiring *explanation* about a *text*.

I expect a significant number of "Empty Responses" or attempts that are so grammatically flawed they wouldn't meet even a generous interpretation of "mentions why." Students
