Let's break down the thought process for this.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):**
My first thought is, "This is a very basic algebra problem. Most Class 8 students should be able to do this." I might initially think 60-70%.

**Challenging the Instinct (Applying the given constraints):**

1.  **"Mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English."**
    *   **Limited English:** While the equation uses numbers, the *instruction* "Find the value of y in the equation" requires understanding. "Find the value" might be a phrase some struggle with. "Equation" itself might be a slightly advanced vocabulary word for someone with very limited English proficiency.
    *   **Economically weaker sections:** This often correlates with less exposure to English outside of school, potentially less well-resourced schools, and a higher likelihood of foundational learning gaps.

2.  **"Average pass rate is about 29%."**
    *   This is a crucial data point. If the overall pass rate is so low, it suggests that a significant number of students are struggling across the board. This specific question, while "basic" to an expert, contributes to that overall performance.

3.  **"Teachers and experts consistently MISJUDGE item difficulty... they forget:"**
    *   **Limited English:** Re-emphasized.
    *   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic:** For a student who struggles with number sense, or who hasn't fully grasped the concept of variables, or the idea of "doing the same thing to both sides" (even if implicitly), this isn't basic.
    *   **Exam anxiety:** Can make even simple problems seem impossible.
    *   **Never practiced this exact question type:** While they might have practiced "y + 4 = 9", they might not have practiced "y + 9 = 4" which leads to a negative number. This is a *critical* point.

**Focusing on the Specifics of the Question: `y + 9 = 4`**

*   The biggest hurdle here is the **negative result (`y = -5`)**. Many students in early algebra, especially those with foundational gaps, struggle with operations involving negative numbers. They might correctly move the 9, but then calculate `4 - 9` as `5` or even `13`.
*   The concept of moving terms across the equals sign and changing their sign is fundamental, but again, if not solidly grasped, it's a stumbling block.
*   Some might try to guess and check, but guessing a negative number is less intuitive.

**Revisiting the Average Pass Rate (29%):**

If the average pass rate is 29%, it implies that many questions, even seemingly easy ones, are failed. This question, while basic for *some*, has elements (negative result, "find the value" English, variable concept) that push it beyond what *all* students who eventually pass might get correct.

**Calibrating the Estimate:**

*   It's not 0-10% because it is an algebra problem they should be learning. Some will have grasped it.
*   It's definitely not 60-70% given all the constraints, especially the limited English and the negative number result.
*   If the average pass rate is 29%, this question is likely *easier* than some of the more complex problems on a typical exam, but *harder* than simple recall or definition questions.
*   Let's consider the negative number aspect. That's a common point of error. A significant portion of students who might otherwise understand how to isolate 'y' will make a sign error.

Given the 29% average pass rate, this question is likely one that many *attempt* but a significant portion get wrong due to the negative number or fundamental misunderstandings. It's probably on the "easier" side of questions that contribute to the 29% pass rate, but not *so* easy that it's universally solved.

I'd place it slightly above the average pass rate for all questions, as it's a direct, single-step problem, but not by a huge margin. The negative number is the real killer here for many.

Let's estimate that a good portion will get the setup right (`y = 4 - 9`), but then stumble on `4 - 9 = -5`.
Perhaps half of the students will attempt correctly to isolate 'y'. Of those, maybe half will correctly handle the negative number.

If 60% try to isolate 'y':
*   Maybe 30% get `y = -5` correctly.
*   Maybe 20% get
