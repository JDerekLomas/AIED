Let's break down the question and the context.

**The Question:** "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."

**Key Challenges for Students:**

1.  **"Do you think... important in real life?"**:
    *   This requires *inference* and *personal opinion/application*, not just recall from the text.
    *   "Real life" might be a somewhat abstract concept for students who struggle with generalization.
    *   It's a "yes/no" or "agree/disagree" type question, followed by justification. This two-part structure can be tricky.

2.  **"Give one reason."**:
    *   This demands *justification*. Students need to articulate *why* they think it's important.
    *   The "reason" needs to be *valid* and connect logically to the "importance."

3.  **Connecting to the Passage (Implicitly):** While the question asks about "real life," the *source* of the "king's questions" is the passage. Students will likely need to recall or understand *what those questions were* to form a coherent answer about their importance. The rubric explicitly mentions the king's questions: "the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with." Students might struggle to summarize these concepts or recall them precisely.

**Applying Common Errors & Context:**

*   **Limited English:**
    *   "Important in real life" might be simplified to "good" or "useful."
    *   Articulating a *reason* in grammatically correct and coherent English will be a major hurdle. Many will struggle beyond a few fragmented words.
    *   Think of the "My Favourite Hobby" errors: "My hobby is cricket play" – very basic sentence structure and vocabulary. A reason like "yes good for life" might be the best many can manage, which may or may not satisfy "one reason."
*   **"Basic" Concepts Not Basic:** The idea of planning, timing, and choosing collaborators (the king's questions) might seem basic to us, but connecting it to "importance in real life" and then articulating it, is an advanced skill for these students.
*   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** The pass rates of 4%, 5%, and 10% for other questions highlight a very high proportion of blank or completely off-topic responses. This question isn't a direct recall, so it might lead to more "Empty Responses" if students can't formulate an opinion and a reason.
*   **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** While they might practice comprehension, a question demanding both opinion *and* justification, drawing on an abstract concept like "real life," is less common in rote learning environments.

**Challenging My First Instinct:**

My first instinct might be "Oh, everyone knows planning is important. They'll just say 'yes, because it helps you succeed.'" But then I remember the evidence:

*   "Q: "Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%) Wrong answer: "I am reading."
    *   This shows a complete misunderstanding of what "describes... style" means.
*   "Q: "Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."" (pass rate: 5%) Wrong answer: "The last bargin they about a child and labour. many people tried to force the la"
    *   This shows an inability to abstract a "theme" or "central idea," even when some content recall is present. The language is also very broken.
*   The "My Favourite Hobby" errors show immense difficulty with even simple paragraph construction and coherent thought.

For this question, a correct answer requires:
1.  Understanding "important in real life."
2.  Agreeing it's important (or disagreeing and giving a reason, though agreement is far more likely given the positive framing).
3.  Connecting the *king's questions* (implicitly) to this importance.
4.  Formulating *one reason* in understandable English.

Many will struggle at step 3 or 4, even if they grasp step 1 and 2. A "reason" like "yes it is important because it is important" would likely not count. A reason needs to explain *why*.

Considering the extreme difficulty observed in other questions that seem "simpler" to an educated adult, this question, which requires higher-order thinking (inference, application, justification) and coherent English, will be very challenging.

If 4-5% of students can identify a theme or describe a writing style, I expect this question, which requires similar abstract thinking and expression, to fall within a similar range,
