Let's break down the difficulty of "Define fable."

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**
My first thought might be: "Fable is a fairly common literary term. They've probably encountered it in stories like 'The Tortoise and the Hare.' Many students should know this." This instinct immediately falls into the trap of overestimating student ability and forgetting their limited English.

**Challenging the Assumptions (based on provided context):**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   The examples show students struggle *massively* with even basic descriptive tasks ("Describes the poet's writing style" leading to "I am reading").
    *   "Define" itself might be a difficult command for some. They might understand the concept but struggle to articulate a formal definition in English.
    *   Words like "typically," "imparts," and "moral lesson" could be challenging vocabulary. "Moral lesson" itself might be understood as "good thing" but not as a specific literary concept.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   While they might have *read* fables, the explicit *definition* of a fable as a literary genre might not have been formally taught or reinforced. Many curricula focus on reading comprehension rather than genre definition.
    *   Even if taught, retaining a precise definition for an exam, especially in a foreign language, is much harder than simply understanding the story.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:**
    *   The high number of "Empty Response" answers for other questions (especially "Describe the poet's writing style" and "Write a theme...") indicates that students are very quick to leave things blank if they are unsure or can't formulate an answer. This question is not a multiple choice where they can guess.

4.  **No Practice of Exact Question Type:**
    *   Have they explicitly practiced "Define X" questions for literary terms? Probably not extensively, given the other examples. They might be used to answering comprehension questions about *the content* of a fable, but not defining the *genre* itself.

5.  **Common Errors Analogy:**
    *   "Describes the poet's writing style" (4% pass rate) is a conceptual question requiring articulation. "Define fable" is very similar.
    *   "Write a theme or central idea" (5% pass rate) also requires abstract thinking and articulation in English.
    *   Even "My Favourite Hobby" (10% pass rate) leads to very basic, fragmented answers or lists, not coherent paragraphs. This suggests that constructing a multi-part definition will be very hard.

**Revisiting the Rubric:**
"Defines fable as a short story that typically uses animals as characters and imparts a moral lesson." This is a three-part definition. Students would need to capture:
1.  Short story
2.  Animals as characters
3.  Imparts a moral lesson

If they miss one part, it might not count as correct, or it might be partial. The rubric states "Max score: 1," implying a binary correct/incorrect.

**Calibrated Estimate:**
Given the extremely low pass rates on conceptually similar questions requiring articulation in English, and the evidence of extensive blank responses and very basic answers, "Define fable" seems highly challenging. It requires precise vocabulary and conceptual understanding in a language many students struggle with.

I anticipate a significant number of "Empty Responses," "I don't know," or very vague answers that don't meet the full rubric (e.g., "It's a story with animals").

Comparing it to the 4-5% pass rates for "describe writing style" and "write a theme," "Define fable" is arguably slightly easier than those as it's a more factual recall (though still requiring articulation). However, it's definitely harder than the "My Favourite Hobby" question that received 10%.

My estimate needs to be low.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 7%**
