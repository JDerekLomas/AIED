Let's break down the question and rubric against the student profile and common errors.

**Question:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"
**Rubric:** "Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why."

**Analysis considering student profile and common errors:**

1.  **"Which line from the poem...?"**
    *   This requires students to understand "line" and "poem." Given the "Describes the poet's writing style" example, many students struggle with even basic metalanguage about literature. They might not conceptually separate a "line" from a sentence or a general idea.
    *   They need to be able to *identify* a specific line, which means comprehending the poem well enough to remember/recognize a specific part. This is a higher bar than just understanding the gist.
    *   They need to be able to *extract* and *write down* that line accurately. Copying accurately can be a challenge for students with limited writing fluency.

2.  **"...do you like the most...?"**
    *   "Like" is a common word, but the concept of personal preference *about text* might be abstract. Many government school curricula focus on rote learning and factual recall, not subjective interpretation.
    *   Students might struggle with the concept of having a *personal* opinion on a line of poetry, especially if they are used to being told "the correct answer."

3.  **"...and why?"**
    *   This is the biggest hurdle. Explaining "why" requires:
        *   **Comprehension:** Understanding the chosen line.
        *   **Reasoning:** Formulating a reason for liking it.
        *   **Articulation in English:** Expressing that reason in a coherent sentence or two.
    *   Looking at the common errors:
        *   "Describes the poet's writing style" (pass rate 4%): Students completely failed to articulate anything related to the question.
        *   "Write a theme or central idea..." (pass rate 5%): While some attempted, their answers were often fragmented, grammatically incorrect, and lacked full coherence ("The last bargin they about a child and labour. many people tried to force the la").
        *   "Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby" (pass rate 10%): Even for a familiar topic like hobbies, students produced very short, grammatically flawed sentences or lists, not coherent paragraphs ("My hobby is cricket play"). The prompt explicitly asked for 4-5 sentences, but students couldn't manage it.

**Specific Challenges for this question:**

*   **Lack of vocabulary/sentence structure for expressing reasons:** Students will struggle to use words like "because," "it shows," "I feel," "the imagery," "it makes me think." They might just repeat the line or provide a very simplistic, incomplete reason.
*   **Difficulty articulating abstract ideas:** Explaining *why* one likes a line often involves abstract concepts like emotion, imagery, theme, or personal connection. These are difficult even for proficient English speakers.
*   **No "correct" answer to memorize:** Unlike some questions, there isn't a single right answer they could have memorized from a textbook. This demands original thought and expression, which is very difficult for this cohort.
*   **Exam anxiety leading to blank responses:** The high percentage of "Empty Response" in the examples is a strong indicator. If students don't immediately know how to answer or are intimidated by the "why" part, they will likely leave it blank.

**Revisiting my initial instinct:** My first thought might be "it's a simple personal preference question," but then I remember:
*   "Simple" for whom? Not for a Class 6 student with limited English from an EWS background.
*   "Personal preference" still requires *articulation* of that preference and *reasoning*.
*   The "My Favourite Hobby" example shows that even for very personal and concrete topics, students struggle with forming a few coherent sentences. This question is much more abstract.
*   The extremely low pass rates for similar "interpretive" or "descriptive" questions (4%, 5%) are very telling. This question combines identification with subjective explanation, making it arguably harder than simply identifying a theme.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Given the evidence, especially the struggle with expressing simple reasons and the prevalence of "Empty Response" for seemingly basic interpretive tasks, I anticipate a very low success rate. Students might pick a line, but providing a *reason* that meets the rubric's "mentions why" (even minimally) will be the critical failure point. Many will likely leave it blank or write something completely unintelligible for the "why."
