Here's my thought process for estimating the proportion correct, keeping the provided caveats in mind:

1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**
    *   **Starting Time:** 10:00 am
    *   **Ending Time:** 4:00 pm (evening)
    *   **Starting Temperature:** 30°C
    *   **Rate of Increase:** 2°C per hour
    *   **Goal:** Temperature at 4:00 pm

2.  **Steps to Solve (Ideal Student):**
    *   Calculate time difference: 4:00 pm - 10:00 am = 6 hours.
    *   Calculate total temperature increase: 6 hours * 2°C/hour = 12°C.
    *   Calculate final temperature: 30°C + 12°C = 42°C.

3.  **Focus on the Rubric:** The rubric *only* asks for calculating the time elapsed as 6 hours. This significantly simplifies the task from a scoring perspective, even if the student might struggle with the subsequent steps.

4.  **Analyze Challenges for Class 6 Indian Government School Students (EWS, Limited English, 29% pass rate):**

    *   **English Comprehension:**
        *   "At 10 am in the morning..." - Fairly straightforward.
        *   "...temperature of Jodhpur was 30°C." - Understandable.
        *   "If the temperature increases by 2°C per hour..." - "Increases by" is a common phrase. "Per hour" is key.
        *   "...what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?" - "Evening" vs. "pm" is a potential point of confusion, but less so for the time calculation itself. The "what will be the temperature" part is the ultimate goal, but not required for *this* rubric.
        *   **Overall:** The language is relatively simple, but "increases by X per hour" might be a stumbling block for a very weak reader.

    *   **Mathematical Concepts:**
        *   **Time Calculation (10 am to 4 pm):** This is the core of the rubric.
            *   **Counting on fingers/mentally:** 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4. That's 6 hours. Many students can do this even if they can't write out the subtraction.
            *   **Converting 4 pm to 24-hour format:** 16:00. Then 16 - 10 = 6. This is more advanced and less likely to be used by all.
            *   **AM/PM transition (12 noon):** This is the biggest hurdle. Students might get confused crossing 12.
                *   10 -> 11 (1 hour)
                *   11 -> 12 (2 hours)
                *   12 -> 1 (3 hours)
                *   1 -> 2 (4 hours)
                *   2 -> 3 (5 hours)
                *   3 -> 4 (6 hours)
            *   Some might just count 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 as 7 hours.
            *   Some might misinterpret "4:00 in the evening" as 4 hours *after* 10 am, leading to 2 pm.

    *   **Context/Anxiety:**
        *   "Jodhpur" is just a place name, not relevant to the math.
        *   The overall problem involves temperature and rates, which can distract from the simple time calculation for anxious students. They might jump to multiplying 2°C by *something* without first getting the time.
        *   The "30°C" and "2°C per hour" are distractors if the student is *only* focusing on getting the 6 hours for the rubric. If they are trying to solve the whole problem, these numbers complicate it.

5.  **Challenging Initial Instincts:**
    *   **My first instinct:** "Calculating 10 am to 4 pm is pretty basic. Maybe 60-70% could do it."
    *   **Challenging:**
        *   *English:* "Increases by X per hour" is fine, but combined with other words, it adds cognitive load.
        *   *AM/PM transition:* This is a *major* point of error for elementary students globally. Counting across 12 noon/midnight
