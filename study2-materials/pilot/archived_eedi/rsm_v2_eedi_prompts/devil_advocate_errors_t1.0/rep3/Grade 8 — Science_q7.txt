ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 10%

**Reasoning for the low estimate:**

1.  **Language Barrier:** The question uses terms like "collected waste," "pit," "notice any change," "reasons," "evaluate," and "beneficial for soil health." While "plants, vegetables and fruits" are common, the more abstract concepts and the request for "reasons" and "evaluation" will be challenging for students with limited English. The example errors clearly show a struggle with basic vocabulary and forming coherent sentences in English.

2.  **Conceptual Understanding (Decomposition/Composting):**
    *   **"Notice any change":** Many students might not immediately connect "waste of plants, vegetables and fruits" in a "pit" with decomposition/composting. They might not have formal exposure to the concept or the vocabulary to describe it (e.g., "decompose," "rot," "turn into manure/compost").
    *   **"Give reasons":** This requires understanding *why* the changes occur (microorganisms, breakdown of organic matter). This is a higher-order thinking skill than simple recall.
    *   **"Evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health":** This requires understanding the *purpose* and *benefits* of composting (e.g., adds nutrients, improves soil structure). This is a conceptual leap that many struggling students will miss, especially if they only have a superficial understanding of soil and plant growth.

3.  **Prior Knowledge and Exposure:** While some students from rural backgrounds might have seen waste decaying or used manure, they may not have the scientific vocabulary or formal understanding to articulate it in the context of an exam question. The question asks for a scientific explanation and evaluation, not just an observation.

4.  **Common Errors & Exam Context:**
    *   The provided examples show students struggling with basic scientific terminology (e.g., "gobaer" for gobar/manure, "insective stores" for insectivorous). This question, requiring a more complex explanation, is likely to lead to similar errors or simply blank responses.
    *   The question structure ("Give reasons and evaluate...") is more complex than simple recall. This type of multi-part question, requiring both explanation and evaluation, is often a stumbling block.
    *   Exam anxiety and lack of practice with this exact question type will also contribute to lower scores.

5.  **Teacher/Expert Overestimation:** My initial instinct might have been slightly higher, assuming basic knowledge of decomposition. However, remembering the "limited English," "basic concepts aren't basic," and "never practiced this exact question type" warnings, I've adjusted down significantly. Even if they know about manure, connecting it to "waste in a pit" and then explaining *why* it changes and *how* it benefits soil health, all in English, is a high bar.

Given the average pass rate of 29% for the exam, and the particularly low pass rates (6-11%) for the example Science questions which require less complex reasoning and evaluation than this one, a 10% estimate seems appropriate for students to correctly identify changes, give *reasons*, and *evaluate* the benefits for soil health. Many might get one part partially right (e.g., "it becomes manure") but fail on the explanation or evaluation. The rubric is quite specific about "significant changes" and implies a correct understanding of decomposition/composting benefits.
