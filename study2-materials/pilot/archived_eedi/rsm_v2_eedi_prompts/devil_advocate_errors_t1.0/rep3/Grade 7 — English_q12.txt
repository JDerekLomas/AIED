Let's break down the challenge of this question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, keeping in mind the common errors and the tendency of experts to overestimate.

**Initial Instinct vs. Reality Check:**

My first instinct, based on having taught this concept, might be that it's a fairly standard grammar transformation and a good number of students *should* be able to do it if they've been taught it. However, the provided context forces a serious reality check.

**Factors Working Against Correct Answers:**

1.  **Limited English Proficiency:** This is the *biggest* barrier.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Blew," "blown," "away" might be understood, but the grammatical structure required for passive voice is complex.
    *   **Syntax:** Rearranging the sentence, identifying the object, making it the subject, changing the verb form, and adding "by" are all syntax-heavy tasks that are very difficult for limited English speakers.
    *   **Irregular Verbs:** "Blew" (past simple) to "blown" (past participle) is an irregular verb change. Many students struggle significantly with irregular verb forms, especially in less common tenses/voices.

2.  **Conceptual Difficulty (Active/Passive Voice):** While "basic" to an English speaker or a well-resourced student, the concept of active vs. passive voice is abstract and involves understanding grammatical roles (subject, object) which are not intuitive for struggling learners. It requires identifying the agent and the receiver of the action, then re-framing the sentence from the receiver's perspective.

3.  **Lack of Practice/Exposure:** The note mentions that "many students have never practiced this exact question type." Even if active/passive voice was taught, dedicated practice on transformations might be missing, or it might have been taught once and forgotten.

4.  **Exam Anxiety:** This often leads to blank responses or rushed, incorrect attempts, similar to the "Empty Response" errors seen in the examples.

5.  **Common Error Patterns from Examples:**
    *   "Empty Response" is a significant concern. Students might look at this and simply not know where to start.
    *   The "Describes the poet’s writing style" example shows students answering with personal statements ("I am reading") or simple descriptions rather than analytical ones. This suggests they might struggle to understand the *kind* of answer expected. For "The wind blew the leaves away," they might correctly identify the wind and the leaves but fail to transform the sentence, perhaps just rewriting the active sentence or making a slight, incorrect alteration.
    *   The "My Favourite Hobby" examples show a breakdown in sentence structure, mixing topics, and very simple, grammatically incorrect sentences ("My hobby is cricket play"). This indicates a fundamental weakness in constructing grammatically correct English sentences, let alone complex transformations.

**Re-evaluating the Difficulty for This Specific Question:**

The question requires:
*   Identifying the subject ("the wind") and object ("the leaves").
*   Moving the object to the subject position.
*   Choosing the correct auxiliary verb ("were" because "leaves" is plural and the original sentence is past tense).
*   Using the correct past participle form of the verb ("blown").
*   Adding "by" and the original subject.

Each of these steps presents a potential point of failure for a student with limited English and inconsistent instruction. The irregular verb "blew" -> "blown" is a particularly difficult hurdle.

Given the extremely low pass rates on the example questions (4-10%) for tasks that are arguably simpler (identifying a theme, writing a short paragraph on a familiar topic), a complex grammatical transformation involving an irregular verb is going to be exceptionally challenging.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Considering all the above, especially the very low pass rates on other questions and the specific difficulties of passive voice transformation with irregular verbs for students with limited English:

*   Many will leave it blank.
*   Many will rewrite the active sentence.
*   Some might correctly identify "The leaves" but then use the wrong verb form (e.g., "The leaves blow away") or wrong auxiliary ("The leaves was blown away").
*   Very few will get the entire transformation correct.

I would expect this to perform similarly, if not worse, than the "theme" or "writing style" questions, which had pass rates of 4-5%.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **7%**
