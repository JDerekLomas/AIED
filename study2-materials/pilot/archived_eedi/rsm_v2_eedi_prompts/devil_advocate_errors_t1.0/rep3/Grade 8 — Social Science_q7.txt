Here's my calibrated estimate, with reasoning:

**Initial Instinct vs. Calibrated Approach:**

My initial instinct might be around 20-30%. Plassey is a foundational event in Indian history, often taught in Class 8. However, considering the common errors and specific student demographics, I need to adjust significantly downwards.

**Factors for Downward Adjustment:**

1.  **Limited English Proficiency:** The question asks "How did... contribute to the expansion of British power?" This requires understanding "contribute" and "expansion," which can be challenging vocabulary for students with limited English. Many might grasp "Battle of Plassey" and "British power" but struggle with the causal link.
2.  **Abstract Concept (Political Dominance/Puppet Nawab):** The rubric requires explaining "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)." This isn't just recalling a fact; it's understanding a *consequence* and a *mechanism* (puppet rule). This is a more abstract concept than simply stating "Britain won."
3.  **Prior Learning Gaps:** Even if "Battle of Plassey" is taught, the nuances of *how* it led to political dominance, rather than just military victory, might not be deeply ingrained, especially for students who struggle or were absent.
4.  **Common Error Patterns:** The provided examples ("Empty Response," irrelevant answers, phonetic attempts at names) strongly suggest that many students will either leave it blank, offer a very vague answer ("British won"), or miss the core point about political control. The "Asher' stand" and "ashok a second" responses highlight a struggle even with proper nouns and basic comprehension.
5.  **Exam Anxiety:** For struggling students, a question requiring an explanatory answer can trigger anxiety, leading to blank responses.
6.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While teachers might consider the political impact of Plassey "basic," for a student with limited background and language, linking a battle to a complex concept like "political dominance" and "puppet ruler" is far from basic.

**Recalibrating based on examples:**

*   **"Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi" (pass rate: 9%)**: This is a direct "how did X affect Y" question, similar in structure. The extremely low pass rate suggests that explaining *consequences* is a major hurdle.
*   **"Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes? Explain" (pass rate: 10%)**: Even for a seemingly simpler historical symbol, the pass rate is very low, again highlighting difficulty with explanatory questions and nuanced understanding.
*   **"Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign..." (pass rate: 12%)**: Another "explain significance" question, similar to "how did X contribute to Y." This again points to the difficulty of analytical and explanatory tasks.

The question about Plassey is asking for an explanation of its *contribution* to power expansion, which is essentially its *significance* or *effect*. Given the pass rates for similar explanatory/consequence-based questions (9-12%), this question is likely to fall into a similar range. The specific detail of "political dominance/puppet nawab" is quite specific and requires deeper understanding than just "British won the battle."

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 7%**

I'm leaning towards the lower end of the 9-12% range because the rubric's requirement for explaining *political dominance/control* via a *puppet nawab* is quite specific and requires a higher level of conceptual understanding than just a general "British power increased." Many might just state "British won" or "British got more land," which wouldn't fully meet the rubric. The "Empty Response" common error suggests a significant number will not even attempt it or provide something completely irrelevant.
