Let's break down the challenge with this seemingly simple question for the target demographic.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):** My first thought is, "This is basic SVO (Subject-Verb-Object). Most English speakers, even beginners, learn this early. Maybe 50-60%?"

**Challenging the Instinct (applying the given context):**

1.  **Limited English:** The average pass rate is 29%. This means that 71% are struggling severely. The common errors provided demonstrate a *very* fundamental lack of comprehension for terms like "writing style," "theme," or even constructing simple paragraphs. "I am reading" for "describes the poet's writing style" is a huge red flag.
2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While "he is reading a book" is SVO, the *act* of rearranging words requires analytical processing that many students with limited exposure might not have developed for English. They might know "he," "is," "reading," "a," "book" individually, but putting them in the correct *order* is another cognitive step.
3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** The high number of "Empty Response" errors on other questions suggests that when faced with something that isn't immediately obvious or requires effort beyond simple recall, students give up.
4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** While they might have learned simple sentences, explicitly *rearranging* jumbled words might not be a common practice exercise, especially if their teachers themselves have limited English or rely on rote memorization.
5.  **Common Errors Data:**
    *   "Describes the poet's writing style." (4% pass) - *Requires understanding abstract concepts and sentence construction.*
    *   "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass) - *Even if they know the story, articulating a theme is hard.*
    *   "Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'." (10% pass) - *This is essentially sentence construction practice. The errors like "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho" or "My hobby is cricket play" show a profound difficulty with even the most basic sentence structure.*

**Applying the Context to "Rearrange the words..."**

*   **Positive Factors:**
    *   All words are simple, high-frequency.
    *   The resulting sentence is extremely common.
    *   It's a relatively short sentence (5 words).
*   **Negative Factors (weighing heavily):**
    *   The average pass rate for *all* questions is 29%. This question is still an *English* question for students with *limited English*.
    *   The "My Favourite Hobby" question (10% pass rate) is a significant comparison. That question asks them to *produce* a short paragraph, which inherently involves arranging words into sentences. If they struggle *that much* with producing even basic sentences ("My hobby is cricket play"), then explicitly rearranging a jumbled sentence, even a simple one, isn't guaranteed.
    *   Rearranging requires understanding the grammatical function (subject, verb, object) implicitly, even if they don't know the terms. Students who write "My hobby is cricket play" are demonstrating a fundamental misunderstanding of verb phrases and compound nouns in English.
    *   "Empty Response" is a high probability for anything that isn't immediately obvious. They might read the jumbled words, not instantly see the answer, and move on.
    *   The teacher/expert overestimation factor is critical. This *looks* easy to a fluent speaker.

Given the extremely low pass rates on other questions that require similar (or even less complex, like "My hobby...") English sentence construction, I must significantly lower my initial estimate. The "My Favourite Hobby" question is the closest analog in terms of requiring basic sentence formation, and its 10% pass rate is alarming. While rearranging might be slightly easier than *generating* sentences from scratch, it's not by much for this demographic.

If 10% can manage a rudimentary paragraph (with errors), what proportion can correctly rearrange a simple sentence? It will be higher than the 4-5% for abstract concepts, but likely not dramatically higher than 10-15%.

Let's consider the breakdown:
*   A small percentage will get it perfectly (those who actually have some grasp).
*   A larger percentage will make attempts but get the order wrong (e.g., "Reading he is a book," "A book he is reading"). These would be marked incorrect.
*   A significant portion will leave it blank or write something completely irrelevant due to anxiety or lack of understanding.

Taking the 10% pass rate for the
