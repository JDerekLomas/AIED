Here's my calibrated estimate, after carefully considering the context and common errors:

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 7%**

Here's my reasoning, challenging initial instincts:

*   **Initial Instinct vs. Reality:** My *first* instinct, if I didn't apply the provided context, might be "this is a very simple comprehension question, maybe 40-50%." However, the context radically shifts this.
*   **Limited English is the Primary Barrier:** The average pass rate is 29%, and for questions requiring even slightly more complex output ("writing style," "theme"), it plummets to 4-5%. "Who lived inside the book?" requires direct recall, which seems simpler, but the student still needs to:
    *   Comprehend "Who lived inside the book?" (vocabulary, sentence structure).
    *   Locate "magical fairy" within the text (scanning, reading comprehension).
    *   Extract and write "magical fairy" or "fairy" correctly (spelling, basic writing).
*   **Common Errors are Telling:**
    *   "Describes the poet's writing style." (4% pass rate) - This question also requires finding information, just more abstract. The fact that students respond with "I am reading" or "Empty Response" shows a fundamental breakdown in understanding the question itself, let alone the answer.
    *   "Write a theme..." (5% pass rate) - Similar issues, inability to synthesize or even locate the core idea.
    *   "My Favourite Hobby..." (10% pass rate) - While the question is longer, the answers ("My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho") show they understand *some* words but struggle with the structure, coherence, and fulfilling all parts of the prompt.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While "who lived inside the book" seems basic to a native English speaker, for a struggling Class 6 student from economically weaker sections with limited English, *every* word can be a hurdle. "Lived," "inside," "book" are all basic, but strung together as a question, they might not register for many.
*   **Exam Anxiety / Blank Responses:** The high rate of "Empty Response" on other questions indicates that many students will simply not attempt a question if they don't immediately grasp it, even if they might theoretically know the answer with more time or less pressure.
*   **Lack of Practice:** If they haven't frequently practiced direct comprehension questions like this in English, even a simple one can be challenging.
*   **The "Magical Fairy" Aspect:** While "fairy" is a common word in children's stories, if the text itself was complex or the word wasn't highlighted, it might be overlooked. The "magical" part is an extra word to recall and write.

**Why 7% and not higher or lower?**

*   **Higher:** I can't justify a higher percentage given the extremely low pass rates on other "simple" questions and the pervasive English comprehension issues. Even a direct recall question is a challenge when the language itself is a barrier. It's likely that a very small subset of students have enough foundational English to successfully answer this.
*   **Lower:** While tempting to go lower given the 4-5% rates, "Who lived inside the book?" is a very direct, literal comprehension question compared to "describe writing style" or "write a theme." There might be a slightly larger group who can process this basic structure and locate the specific fact, especially if "fairy" is a known word for them. It's a single, short sentence answer. It's also possible that "fairy" is a well-known concept in their local language, which might aid recognition.

Therefore, 7% represents a realistic, calibrated estimate, acknowledging the directness of the question while heavily factoring in the profound English language limitations and common errors observed.
