Let's break down the thought process to arrive at a calibrated estimate.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**

My first thought is, "This is a pretty straightforward Social Science question. Mountains are a fundamental geography topic taught in elementary school. Most students should know at least one, if not two." This would lead to an initial estimate of perhaps 40-50%.

**Applying the "Challenge Your Assumptions" Filter:**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   The question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" uses relatively simple English. "Name," "two," "major," "mountain ranges," "India" are all common words. This is *less* of a barrier than questions with complex vocabulary or abstract concepts (like "colonial rule" or "significance").
    *   However, "ranges" might be slightly less common than "mountains" for the most struggling students, but it's still quite accessible.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   While mountains are fundamental geography, a "major mountain range" requires specific recall. It's not just "name a mountain."
    *   Have they been consistently taught the *names* of the major ranges? Or just the concept of mountains?
    *   For students from economically weaker sections, access to good textbooks, maps, and consistent classroom instruction might be sporadic. If a student was absent when this specific topic was covered, or if the teaching was weak, they might not know the names even if they understand what a mountain is.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:**
    *   The common errors show "Empty Response" as a significant issue for other questions. This is a very real factor. Even if a student *might* know, the pressure can lead to a blank.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   "Name any two..." is a fairly standard question type. This is less of a factor here compared to "Explain how..." or "Explain the significance...".

5.  **Comparison to Common Errors/Pass Rates:**
    *   The pass rates for other Social Science questions are extremely low (9%, 10%, 12%). These questions required more explanation, critical thinking, or understanding of abstract concepts.
    *   This question ("Name any two major mountain ranges") is purely recall-based. It's a lower cognitive demand than the examples provided. Therefore, it *should* have a higher pass rate than 9-12%.
    *   The average pass rate is 29%. This question is simpler than some of those likely included in the average.

**Recalibration:**

*   **Positive Factors:** Simple English, purely recall, lower cognitive demand than other examples, fundamental geography.
*   **Negative Factors:** "Basic" recall not guaranteed for all struggling learners, potential for "Empty Response" due to anxiety or lack of specific knowledge, inconsistent teaching/resource access.
*   **Rubric:** "Names one correct mountain range" is a low bar for 0.5 marks. This means they only need to get *one* right. This significantly increases the chance of scoring. The Himalayas are incredibly prominent, and Aravalli is also widely known, especially in Northern/Western India.

Considering the simplicity of the question *relative to the extremely low pass rates of other questions*, and the low bar for getting 0.5 marks (just one name), it should perform *better* than the 9-12% for the more complex questions. It should also likely perform better than the overall average of 29% because it's a very direct recall question.

However, it won't be exceptionally high because of the endemic issues (English, access, anxiety, "empty response"). It's still likely that a substantial portion of students will either write nothing, write something irrelevant, or simply not know even one name.

If the average is 29% for a mix of questions, and this is a relatively easy recall question, it should be above that. But not by a huge margin, given the severe challenges.

Let's think of it this way:
*   Perhaps 10-15% will write "Empty Response" or irrelevant answers, mirroring the "common error" trend.
*   Another 10-15% might know *of* mountains but not the specific names of ranges.
*   This leaves about 70-80% who have a chance. Out of those, what percentage would recall at least one? Given the prominence of Himalayas, I'd say a good chunk.

A range between 30% and 45% feels appropriate. It's better than the average, reflecting its lower difficulty, but not
