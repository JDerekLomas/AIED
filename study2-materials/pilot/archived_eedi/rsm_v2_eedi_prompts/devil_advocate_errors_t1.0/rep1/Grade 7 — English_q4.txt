Let's break down the question and the context.

**The Question:** "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."

**Key Challenges for Students:**

1.  **Understanding "important in real life":** This phrase, while seemingly simple to a native speaker, can be abstract for a student with limited English proficiency. They might interpret "important" very literally or struggle with the concept of applying a fictional scenario to "real life."
2.  **Connecting to the Passage (Implicit):** The question assumes students recall the king's questions from the passage ("the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with"). If they don't, they're lost from the start. Given the low pass rates on other questions requiring recall or synthesis, this is a major hurdle.
3.  **Generating a "Reason":** This requires analytical thinking and expressing that thought in English.
    *   **Low English proficiency:** Even if they understand the concept, expressing a coherent "reason" can be very difficult. We see "Empty Response" and fragmented answers in the examples provided.
    *   **Lack of practice:** "Give one reason" might be a new question type or one they haven't practiced extensively.
    *   **Anxiety:** The pressure of an exam often leads to blank responses when students feel they can't form a complete answer.
4.  **"King's Questions":** While the passage would have introduced these, linking "king's questions" to the underlying *concepts* of timing, action, and people requires a level of comprehension that might be beyond many.

**Comparing to Common Errors:**

*   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%)** This is analytical and abstract. Our current question is also somewhat analytical and abstract in its requirement for a "reason." The abysmal pass rate here suggests similar struggles.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem..." (pass rate: 5%)** Again, abstract thinking and synthesis, which our question requires to generate a reason. The example "The last bargin they about a child and labour..." shows an attempt at connection but a struggle with articulation.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'..." (pass rate: 10%)** This is a much more concrete, personal topic. Even here, students struggle with sentence structure and staying on topic. Our question is far less concrete.

**Teacher/Expert Overestimation:**

Teachers might think, "Oh, everyone wants to know the right time to do things! That's so relatable!" But this overlooks:
*   **Limited English:** Can they *express* that relation?
*   **Recall:** Do they remember *what* the king's questions were?
*   **Abstraction:** Can they bridge the gap from a story to "real life" and explain *why*?

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Given the consistently low pass rates for questions requiring:
*   Recall from a passage
*   Abstract thinking ("important in real life," "theme," "writing style")
*   Formulating an answer beyond simple recall (like giving a "reason")
*   Expressing thoughts coherently in limited English

And considering the prevalence of "Empty Response" and fragmented answers, even for simpler tasks:

I would expect a very low pass rate. It's more complex than "My Favourite Hobby" and similar in its demand for abstraction to "theme" or "writing style." Even if a few understand the concept, articulating a valid reason in English will be the main bottleneck.

My initial gut might be 15-20%, but after challenging it with the provided examples and the specific difficulties, that feels too high. The 4-5% pass rates for comparable analytical questions are very telling.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **7%**
