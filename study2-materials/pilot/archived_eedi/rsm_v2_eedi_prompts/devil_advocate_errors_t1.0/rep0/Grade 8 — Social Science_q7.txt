Let's break down the question and the student profile.

**Question:** "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"
**Rubric:** "For explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)."

**Student Profile:**
*   Class 8 students in Indian government schools.
*   Mostly from economically weaker sections.
*   Limited English proficiency.
*   Average pass rate for the exam is 29%.
*   Common errors include "Empty Response" and very basic, often nonsensical answers, even for seemingly simpler questions.
*   Teachers and experts overestimate difficulty due to forgetting English limitations, "basic" concept challenges, exam anxiety, and lack of practice.

**Analysis of the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Key Concepts:** Battle of Plassey, 1757, British power, expansion, India, political dominance, Bengal, Mir Jafar, puppet nawab.
*   **Vocabulary Difficulty:** "Contribute," "expansion," "political dominance," "puppet nawab" are not basic English words for someone with limited proficiency.
*   **Conceptual Difficulty:** Understanding the *causal link* between a battle and subsequent political control, and specifically the idea of a "puppet ruler," requires more than just memorizing facts. It requires synthesizing information.
*   **Specificity Required:** The rubric requires mentioning the *establishment of political dominance over Bengal* or the *puppet nawab*. A general answer like "British won and got powerful" might not score.
*   **Curriculum Coverage:** The Battle of Plassey is a core topic in Indian history for Class 8. Students would have been taught it. However, *understanding its implications* is different from rote memorization.

**Challenging Initial Instincts:**

My first instinct might be: "This is a fundamental event; most students should know it."
However, recalling the provided context:
1.  **Limited English:** Can a student with limited English articulate "establishment of political dominance over Bengal" or "placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab" accurately? They might struggle to form a coherent sentence even if they know the facts.
2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** The concept of a "puppet ruler" is fairly abstract.
3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** The high rate of "Empty Response" in the examples suggests that even if students have a partial understanding, they might freeze or not attempt if they can't formulate a complete answer.
4.  **Lack of Practice:** Have they practiced *explaining the contribution* rather than just *reciting facts*? The question requires an explanation of causality.

**Comparison to Example Questions:**

*   "Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi" (pass rate: 9%) - This is conceptually complex, requiring explanation of impact. Plassey is a more specific event, but still requires explaining impact.
*   "Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes? Explain" (pass rate: 10%) - Requires specific knowledge and explanation. Answers show very poor comprehension ("Asher' stand").
*   "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign..." (pass rate: 12%) - Requires explaining "significance," similar to explaining "contribution."

These examples, especially the ones requiring explanation and historical significance, have extremely low pass rates. The Plassey question falls squarely into this category. The rubric is specific, requiring more than just "British won."

**Re-evaluating:**

Given the severe limitations in English, the requirement to explain a causal link to political dominance, the abstract nature of "puppet nawab," and the extremely low pass rates for similar "explain" type questions in Social Science, even for seemingly simpler topics, a high estimate is unrealistic.

Students might know *that* the Battle of Plassey happened and *that* the British won, but translating that into a clear explanation of *how it contributed to political expansion* (specifically mentioning Bengal and perhaps the puppet ruler aspect) in decent English is a huge leap. Many will give incomplete answers, rote memorized fragments, or simply blank responses.

Considering the 9-12% range for similar "explain" questions, and Plassey being a central topic, it might be slightly higher than those, but not dramatically.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **15%**
