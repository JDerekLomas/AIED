Let's break down the challenge for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and common errors.

**Initial Instinct vs. Challenged Instinct:**

*   **Initial Instinct:** "This is a simple rearrangement. Most students in Class 6 *should* be able to do this. It's basic sentence structure." I might think 50-60%.
*   **Challenged Instinct:**
    *   **Limited English:** While the words are simple, forming a coherent sentence from scrambled words can be challenging even with simple vocabulary if the grammatical structure isn't ingrained. "He is reading a book" uses the present continuous, which might be a slightly more complex structure for some than a simple present.
    *   **Common Errors - "Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass rate):** This shows a *profound* difficulty with understanding instructions and producing even basic English. If they struggle to understand "describes" or "writing style," or simply respond with "I am reading" (which uses the structure from our target sentence!), it highlights a disconnect.
    *   **Common Errors - "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate):** Again, very low pass rates on tasks requiring even basic comprehension and expression. The "The last bargin they about a child and labour..." answer shows an attempt to string words together but with significant grammatical errors and an inability to fully grasp the prompt.
    *   **Common Errors - "Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'." (10% pass rate):** This is a free-response task, and the errors ("My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho") show a struggle with sentence formation, spelling, and coherence, even when given a very open prompt. The "My hobby is cricket play" is closer but still grammatically incorrect.
    *   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** Subject-verb-object might seem basic to us, but for a student with limited exposure, who perhaps misses lessons or struggles to internalize rules, it's not a given. The *rearrangement* aspect adds a layer of cognitive load beyond just knowing the words.
    *   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** The prevalence of "Empty Response" in the examples is a huge red flag. Even if a student *could* do it, anxiety or simply giving up can lead to a zero score.
    *   **Lack of Practice:** "Many students have never practiced this exact question type." This is crucial. If they haven't done "rearrange the words" exercises frequently, it's a novel task, not a recall task.
    *   **Distractors:** While the words are simple, some might try "Reading he is a book" or "A book he is reading." These are plausible but incorrect arrangements that might confuse struggling learners.

Given the average pass rate of 29% on *other* questions (which might include simpler MCQ or fill-in-the-blanks), and the extremely low pass rates on tasks requiring *production* of English sentences, even a seemingly simple rearrangement becomes a significant hurdle. The "I am reading" example from the "poet's writing style" question *uses* the verb structure, but applying it correctly in a novel rearrangement task, especially for students who produce "Empty Response" so often, is difficult.

The core challenge isn't just knowing the words, but understanding the underlying English sentence structure and applying it under exam conditions without prior specific practice.

Considering all these factors, my initial instinct of 50-60% is far too high. The performance on other production-based questions, even simpler ones, is abysmal.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **20%**
