Let's break down the thought process for this.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):**
* "Oh, y + 9 = 4. Subtract 9 from both sides. y = 4 - 9 = -5. That's a very basic algebra problem. Class 8 students should know this."
* If I were a teacher, I might think 60-70% because it's foundational.

**Challenging the Instinct (applying the provided constraints):**

1.  **Limited English:** "Find the value of 'y' in the equation."
    *   "Find the value" - might be okay.
    *   "Equation" - could be a stumbling block. Do they truly understand what an equation *is* in English, or do they just recognize the format?
    *   The equation itself uses numbers, `+`, and `=`. This is generally universal.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   The core concept here is solving for a variable. This involves understanding inverse operations (addition and subtraction are inverses).
    *   The *critical* hurdle: **Negative numbers.** Many students, especially those struggling, have a very shaky grasp of negative numbers.
        *   `4 - 9` is where a huge number of errors will occur.
        *   Common errors:
            *   `9 - 4 = 5` (ignoring the order or sign)
            *   Trying to "make it positive" or just being confused by subtraction where the subtrahend is larger.
            *   Getting `y = 5` instead of `y = -5`.
    *   They might have "learned" about negative numbers, but applying them correctly in a novel (even slightly) context is harder.

3.  **Exam Anxiety:** Simple errors become common under pressure. Students might rush, misread, or simply blank on the negative sign.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   While they've likely practiced `x + 3 = 7` (resulting in a positive integer), have they practiced `y + 9 = 4` *specifically* where the answer is a negative integer? It's often overlooked or rushed.
    *   They might have practiced `y - 9 = 4` (y=13) or `9 - y = 4` (y=5), but the specific structure leading to `4 - 9` is the key difficulty.

5.  **Average Pass Rate (29%):** This is a huge contextual clue. If the overall pass rate is so low, it implies widespread foundational weaknesses. A question that is "basic" for a high-achieving student is *not* basic for the average student in this group.

**Re-evaluating based on challenges:**

*   A significant portion will get `y = 5` due to issues with negative numbers. This is a very common mistake for struggling learners.
*   Some might be confused by the English or simply not understand the concept of solving an equation.
*   Some will get it right. These are likely the students who have a solid grasp of integers and basic algebra.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for the entire exam, this question, while fundamental, introduces the significant hurdle of negative numbers. It's not just "do they know algebra," it's "do they know algebra *and* consistently handle negative integers correctly?" The latter is often a weak point.

If I were forced to pick, I'd say the errors with negative numbers will dominate, bringing the score down significantly from what a teacher might expect. It's a single operation, but that operation leads to a negative, which is where the problem lies.

Let's think about a distribution:
*   Maybe 10-15% will correctly get -5.
*   Another 20-30% will incorrectly get +5.
*   The rest will either be blank, make other errors, or not understand.

This problem is a gateway to demonstrating a solid understanding of integers, not just variables.

My calibrated estimate, considering the strong emphasis on the difficulties and the low overall pass rate, would be closer to the lower end.
