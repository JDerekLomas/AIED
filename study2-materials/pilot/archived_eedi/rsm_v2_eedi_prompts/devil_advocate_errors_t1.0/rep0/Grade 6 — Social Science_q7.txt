Let's break down the question and the context:

**The Question:** "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."

**Key Demographics & Context:**
* **Class 6 students, Indian government schools.**
* **Mostly economically weaker sections.**
* **Limited English proficiency.**
* **Average pass rate ~29% for Social Science.**
* **Common errors:** Empty responses, highly confused or irrelevant answers, phonetic attempts.
* **Teacher/expert overestimation:** Crucial reminder to challenge my initial "easy" assessment.
* **Factors leading to low scores:** Limited English, "basic" concepts not basic, exam anxiety, lack of practice with specific question types.

**Analyzing the Question's Demands:**

1.  **"Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan"**:
    *   **Vocabulary:** "natural resources," "Rajasthan."
    *   **Knowledge:** Requires specific geographical knowledge of Rajasthan.
    *   **Difficulty for target group:**
        *   "Natural resources" is a core concept, but *applying* it to a specific region might be hard if they haven't explicitly studied Rajasthan's resources.
        *   Many students might know "water" and "sand" (desert state association), but formal identification as "natural resources" might be a hurdle for some. Other resources like marble, copper, gypsum are more specific.
        *   If they only know one, they fail this part.

2.  **"and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."**:
    *   **Vocabulary:** "influences," "lives."
    *   **Cognitive demand:** Requires causal reasoning – connecting a resource to human life/activities. This is a higher-order thinking skill than just naming.
    *   **Difficulty for target group:**
        *   This is the harder part. Even if they name water, explaining *how* it influences lives (e.g., agriculture, drinking, scarcity) requires coherent sentence formation and understanding of the relationship.
        *   Students with limited English will struggle to articulate this "explanation." They might give a single word or a very broken sentence.
        *   Consider the example of water: "Water is there for drink" – might be considered partial, but is it a full explanation of "influence"? Probably not fully. "Water is important for farming." This is better.

**Considering Common Errors and Overestimation:**

*   **"Empty Response":** A significant portion will simply leave it blank due to anxiety, not understanding the question, or not knowing the answer in English. This is a major factor in the low pass rates for similar questions.
*   **"ashok a second" / phonetic attempts:** Students might try to write something, but it could be completely off-topic or nonsensical due to language barriers or lack of knowledge.
*   **Limited English:** Even if they know "water" and "sand," explaining the influence of sand might be hard ("sand is everywhere"). Explaining water's influence is more direct but still demands sentence construction.
*   **"Basic" concepts not basic:** While "natural resources" is basic, identifying *two specific ones for Rajasthan* and then *explaining an influence* moves beyond basic recall.

**Recalibrating My Initial Instinct:**

My first instinct might be "Oh, natural resources of Rajasthan, surely they know water and sand." But then I re-read the context:
*   Limited English.
*   Economically weaker sections (might have less exposure to formal education beyond the classroom, potentially less reinforcement of such concepts).
*   *Explaining* the influence.
*   History of low pass rates for questions requiring explanation and specific knowledge.

Given the common errors and the specific challenges, many students will fail on either:
1.  Not knowing two resources.
2.  Not being able to explain the influence due to language or lack of conceptual understanding.
3.  Leaving it blank.

Let's think about a student who *might* get it right:
*   They know "water" and "marble."
*   They can write something like: "Water is important for farmers to grow crops" or "People need water to drink and live."

This requires a certain level of conceptual clarity and English sentence construction that many Class 6 government school students with limited English simply do not possess, as evidenced by the consistently low pass rates (9-12%) for similar explanatory questions, even if those topics are different. While natural resources might feel "easier" than colonial rule or Ashoka's reign, the *explanation* component is still demanding.

The rubric only asks for "Mentions two correct natural resources" for the first part and implicitly for an explanation for the second to get the
