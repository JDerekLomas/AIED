This question seems deceptively simple, especially for someone with a basic understanding of Indian geography. However, considering the context of Class 6 students in Indian government schools from economically weaker sections, with limited English, and a documented history of poor performance on Social Science questions, a significant downward adjustment is necessary.

Here's a breakdown of the factors influencing the estimate:

**Factors increasing difficulty:**

*   **Limited English:** While "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" uses relatively simple English, for students struggling with basic literacy, even this can be a hurdle. They might understand "name" and "India" but struggle with "major mountain ranges."
*   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic:** While mountain ranges are fundamental geography, a student who has been absent, has learning difficulties, or whose teacher rushed through the topic might not have retained this specific information.
*   **Exam anxiety:** The "Empty Response" common error suggests that many students freeze or give up when they don't immediately know the answer or find the question too difficult to parse.
*   **Previous question performance:** The pass rates for other Social Science questions (9%, 10%, 12%) are abysmal, even for questions that seem to require a bit more explanation. This question *only* requires naming. However, the sheer volume of "Empty Response" suggests a fundamental disconnect or lack of preparation.
*   **Lack of practice with this question type:** While "naming" is simple, if they haven't specifically drilled geographical features, it's not a given.
*   **Forgetting "basic" facts:** Many students, even if they learned it, might simply forget the names under pressure.

**Factors decreasing difficulty (making it *easier* than others):**

*   **Only *one* correct answer needed for full credit (0.5 points):** The rubric is very generous, requiring only *one* correct mountain range. This is a massive advantage. Many students might know "Himalayas" even if they struggle with others.
*   **No explanation required:** Unlike the other example questions, there's no "explain," "why," or "how" needed, which significantly reduces the cognitive load and English comprehension requirement.
*   **Common knowledge (for some):** The Himalayas are extremely prominent and often mentioned even outside of school. Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, and the Ghats are also important.

**Challenging the First Instinct:**

My first instinct might be "Oh, this is easy, everyone knows the Himalayas." But then I recall:
*   The 29% average pass rate.
*   The 9-12% pass rates for other Social Science questions.
*   The "Empty Response" prevalence.
*   The target demographic's limitations.
*   The fact that even knowing *one* name is not guaranteed for a student struggling with basic literacy and concept retention.

Even with the generous rubric (just *one* name), many will likely draw a blank due to anxiety, poor retention, or simply not having learned it effectively. If 80-90% of students are giving "Empty Response" or nonsensical answers on other questions requiring slightly more explanation, I can't expect a dramatically higher rate here, even if the question *appears* simpler.

While knowing *one* mountain range like the Himalayas might seem like a low bar, the data on other questions, particularly the prevalence of "Empty Response," is a strong indicator of fundamental difficulties in recall and test-taking. If a student can't even offer a single word on more complex questions, can they reliably pull one of several correct names for this one?

Given the 9-12% pass rates on other SS questions, and the generous rubric, I think it will be higher than those, but still significantly lower than what a teacher might expect. The low bar of needing only *one* name will push it up from the very low single digits.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

I'm going to lean towards the higher end of the single-digit/low-double-digit range, given the extremely low bar (one correct name).

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **20%**
