Let's break down the likely errors for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their background.

**Analysis of Errors:**

**1. Misconceptions about Mathematics:**

*   **Forgetting or not knowing the formula:** This is a very common issue. Students might remember "area" generally but not the specific formula for a triangle, or they might confuse it with the formula for a rectangle/square.
*   **Confusing area with perimeter:** Especially with a question involving two dimensions, some students might attempt to add the numbers (8+6) or even multiply and then add. They might not fully grasp the distinction between area (space inside) and perimeter (distance around).
*   **Incorrectly applying a remembered formula:**
    *   **Area = base × height:** This is a very common error, applying the rectangle/parallelogram formula directly. They might know "half" is involved but forget where it goes or why.
    *   **Area = 2 × base × height:** Less common but possible if they overthink "half" and multiply by 2 instead.
    *   **Adding the dimensions:** 8 + 6 = 14. This is a basic failure to understand area entirely, perhaps confusing it with a simple sum.
*   **Calculation errors:** Even if the formula is correct, basic multiplication errors (especially with 1/2) can occur.
    *   1/2 * 8 * 6 -> 4 * 6 = 24 (Correct)
    *   1/2 * 8 * 6 -> 8 * 3 = 24 (Correct)
    *   1/2 * 8 * 6 -> 16 * 6 = 96 (Incorrect multiplication by 2 instead of dividing by 2)
    *   1/2 * 8 * 6 -> 4 * 12 = 48 (Incorrect division of both numbers by 2)

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Find the area":** While "area" is a fundamental term, some students might struggle if their primary instruction is in a regional language and the English term isn't fully ingrained.
*   **"base" and "height":** These are specific geometric terms. While they would likely have learned them, recognizing them in a word problem and linking them to the correct formula is crucial. Lack of strong English comprehension could hinder this mapping.
*   **"Whose":** This possessive might slightly confuse some, but it's less likely to be a major barrier compared to the technical terms.
*   **Overall sentence structure:** For weaker English speakers, processing the entire sentence to extract the relevant numerical information and the task might be slow or lead to misinterpretation.

**3. Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**

*   **Most students would attempt:** This is a straightforward problem with numbers given directly. It's not abstract or multi-step. Even if they don't know the correct formula, they are likely to try *something* with the numbers (add, multiply, etc.).
*   **Not attempting:** This would be rare, perhaps only for students with severe learning difficulties or extreme lack of confidence, who might just leave it blank.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

Based on the above, the most common wrong answers would likely be:

*   **48 cm² (base × height):** This is *extremely* common. Students remember multiplication for area but forget the "half" for a triangle.
*   **14 cm (base + height):** Confusing with perimeter or just adding the numbers.
*   **Some other incorrect calculation:** E.g., 8/2 + 6/2 = 4 + 3 = 7. Or, if they try to use an incorrect formula like for a rectangle and make a calculation error.
*   **No answer / Blank:** Less common but possible.

**Estimation of Pass Rate:**

Given the average pass rate of 29% for *all* questions, and this specific question being quite fundamental for Class 7 geometry:

*   **Factors increasing pass rate:**
    *   Direct numbers, no complex word problem.
    *   Fundamental concept usually covered.
    *   Relatively simple calculation once the formula is known.
*   **Factors decreasing pass rate:**
    *   Forgetting the specific triangle formula (especially the "1/2").
    *   Confusing with other area formulas (rectangle, square).
    *   Language barrier affecting comprehension of "base" and "height."
    *   Calculation errors with 1/2.

I believe this question sits slightly *above* the average 29% pass rate for the paper as a whole, because it's a very direct application
