Let's break down the potential errors for the question: "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

1.  **"Empty Response" / Not Attempted at All (High Likelihood):**
    *   **Reasoning:** The provided examples of common errors show a very high rate of "Empty Response." This is a significant factor, especially given the low average pass rate and the economic background of the students.
    *   **Social Science Misconception/Language:** Students might not know *anything* about the Harappan Civilization, or they might not understand "urban planning." The question is specific to ancient history, which might not be a strong point for all students.
    *   **Impact:** This will be a major contributor to wrong answers.

2.  **Lack of Specific Knowledge about Harappan Urban Planning (Very High Likelihood):**
    *   **Reasoning:** Even if students attempt the question, "Harappan Civilization" and "urban planning" require specific historical knowledge. They might confuse it with other ancient civilizations or have only very vague ideas.
    *   **Social Science Misconception:** Students might know the Harappan Civilization existed but not recall specific details about its cities. They might confuse it with general features of ancient cities (e.g., "they had houses").
    *   **Most Common Wrong Answer:** "They built houses." "They lived in cities." "They were an old civilization." "They had a king." (These are too general and don't address "urban planning.")
    *   **Impact:** This will be a significant source of incorrect, vague, or irrelevant answers.

3.  **Language Misunderstanding - "Key Feature" or "Urban Planning" (Moderate Likelihood):**
    *   **Reasoning:** While "urban planning" might be taught, it's a slightly more academic term. Students might struggle to understand what "key feature" is asking for beyond a general description.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** They might understand "urban" as "city" and "planning" as "making plans," but linking it to specific architectural or civic design elements might be challenging.
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to general answers about the civilization rather than its cities, or answers that aren't specific to *planning*.

4.  **Recalling *Some* Detail, But Not a *Key Feature of Urban Planning* (Moderate Likelihood):**
    *   **Reasoning:** Students might remember *something* about Harappa – like "they found a dancing girl statue" or "they used seals." While correct facts, they don't answer the question about urban planning.
    *   **Social Science Misconception:** Difficulty distinguishing between general facts about a civilization and specific facts related to a particular aspect (urban planning).
    *   **Most Common Wrong Answer:** "They had seals." "They worshipped X god." "They had a great bath." (The Great Bath *is* a feature of urban infrastructure, but if not linked to "planning" or "drainage," it might be considered borderline or incomplete without further elaboration.) "They had good water." (Vague, but closer than the others).

5.  **Difficulty Articulating the Feature Clearly (Moderate Likelihood):**
    *   **Reasoning:** Even if a student has the knowledge, expressing it precisely in English can be a challenge. They might know about the grid layout but struggle to describe it clearly.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** Limited vocabulary to describe "grid layout," "drainage system," "baked bricks," or "citadel."
    *   **Most Common Wrong Answer:** "They made roads straight." "Water went out." "They used strong bricks." (These are partial truths, but might not be deemed "key" or fully articulated without more detail.)

**Comparison with Provided Errors:**

*   **"Empty Response":** Clearly a major factor, as seen in other examples.
*   **Vague/Irrelevant Answers:** The "Asher' stand" and "Ashok a second" examples for the lion question show students either guessing wildly or trying to write *something* when they don't know the answer. This translates to general, non-specific answers about Harappa.
*   **Misspelling/Confusing Names:** While less likely to be the *core* error for "urban planning," a student might mix up "Harappan" with other historical terms if they're guessing.

**Conclusion & Estimation:**

Given the low average pass rate (29%), the prevalence of "Empty Response," and the need for specific historical knowledge and the ability to articulate it in English, this question will be challenging.

*   Many students will leave it blank.
*   Many will provide vague, general
