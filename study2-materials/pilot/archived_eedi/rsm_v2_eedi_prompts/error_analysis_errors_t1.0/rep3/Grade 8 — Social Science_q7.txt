Here's an analysis of likely errors for the question "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?" for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, followed by an estimated pass rate.

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

1.  **Empty Response/No Attempt (Very High Probability):**
    *   **Reasoning:** As seen in the provided examples, "Empty Response" is a common error for even seemingly fundamental questions.
        *   **Lack of Knowledge:** Students may simply not know the Battle of Plassey or its significance. History beyond basic timelines can be challenging, especially for students from economically weaker sections who might have fewer supplementary learning resources.
        *   **Intimidation:** The question, while seemingly direct, asks for a *contribution* to *expansion of power*, which requires understanding cause and effect – a higher-order thinking skill. Students might feel overwhelmed and not attempt.
        *   **Limited English:** While the question is relatively straightforward, if a student struggles with English, they might not fully grasp what is being asked, leading to an empty response.

2.  **Misconceptions about Social Science/Historical Events (High Probability):**
    *   **Focus on Military Victory Only:** Students might only remember that the British *won* the battle, but not *why* that victory was significant beyond the immediate conflict. They might just state "British won the battle." (Insufficient for full credit).
    *   **Confusing with Other Battles/Events:** There are many battles and events related to British expansion. Students might conflate Plassey with Buxar, or the Carnatic Wars, or even later events like the Revolt of 1857.
    *   **Vague or General Statements:** "It helped the British," "The British became strong," "India lost." These are too general to earn a point.
    *   **Focus on Individual Figures without Context:** Students might remember Robert Clive or Siraj-ud-Daulah, but fail to connect their roles to the *political outcome* of the battle.
    *   **Lack of Understanding of "Expansion of Power":** They might not connect a military victory to the establishment of political dominance or control over a region. They might think "power" means just winning land, not setting up a puppet government.

3.  **Language Misunderstandings (Medium Probability):**
    *   **"Contribute to":** While a common phrase, some students might struggle to articulate the cause-and-effect relationship implied.
    *   **"Expansion of British power":** They might understand "British power" but not "expansion" in a historical context.
    *   **Difficulty articulating the nuanced answer:** Even if they have a basic understanding, forming a coherent English sentence or two that accurately explains "establishing political dominance/control over Bengal" could be a challenge. They might know *what happened* but not be able to *explain* it effectively.

4.  **Common Wrong Answer Look-Alikes:**
    *   "British won the Battle of Plassey." (Too simplistic)
    *   "Robert Clive defeated Siraj-ud-Daulah." (Correct fact, but doesn't explain contribution to *expansion of power*)
    *   "It was a very important battle." (Vague)
    *   "The British took Bengal." (Closer, but lacks the political nuance of "dominance" or "puppet nawab" that the rubric looks for)
    *   "It made the British rich." (Partially true in the long run, but not the direct *political* contribution in the immediate aftermath that the rubric seeks).

**Estimation based on likely errors:**

Given the common "Empty Response" for even seemingly simpler questions (9-12% pass rates), and the need for a specific, nuanced historical understanding (political dominance, puppet ruler) in English, this question poses several hurdles.

*   Many will likely leave it blank.
*   Many who attempt will provide superficial answers (e.g., "British won") or incorrect details.
*   The exact connection between the battle and the *political* control over Bengal via a puppet ruler is a key detail often missed in a general understanding of the battle.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for general questions, and the very low rates for questions requiring explanation and specific historical context:

*   **"Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi" (pass rate: 9%)** - This also requires historical understanding and explanation.
*   **"Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes? Explain" (pass rate: 10%)** - This requires general knowledge and an explanation of symbolism, which can be abstract.
*   **"Explain the significance of Ash
