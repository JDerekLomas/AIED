Here's an analysis of the likely errors and an estimated pass rate for the given question:

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the context of Class 7 students from economically weaker sections with limited English, and the provided common errors, here's what we can expect:

*   **Misconceptions about English/Grammar:**
    *   **Lack of understanding of "Active" and "Passive" voice:** This is the most fundamental barrier. Many students will not know what these terms mean, let alone how to transform a sentence between them. They might recognize "change the sentence" but not the specific grammatical transformation required.
    *   **Verb tenses and forms (especially past participle):** Even if they understand the concept, forming the past participle of irregular verbs like "blow" (blew -> blown) will be a significant challenge. Many will use "blowed" or just "blew."
    *   **Subject-Object identification:** They might struggle to identify the subject ("the wind") and object ("the leaves") correctly, which is crucial for flipping the sentence.
    *   **Prepositional phrases ("by the wind"):** They might omit this crucial part or place it incorrectly.

*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **Keywords "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice":** These terms themselves are complex. Students might interpret "change the sentence" in a much simpler way, leading to various attempts at rephrasing rather than grammatical transformation.
    *   **Vocabulary:** While "wind," "blew," "leaves," and "away" are relatively common, the overall instruction might be too abstract.

*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **High likelihood of attempt, but with poor execution:** Unlike "Describe the poet's writing style" which might lead to "I am reading" or "Empty Response" due to extreme difficulty/abstractness, "Change the following sentence" sounds like an actionable task. Students will likely try *something*. However, their attempts will often miss the mark significantly.
    *   **Some "Empty Responses" or "I don't know" are still possible**, especially if the grammatical terms completely baffle them, leading to a feeling of being stuck.

*   **Most Common Wrong Answers:**

    Based on the above, here's a breakdown of likely incorrect responses, roughly in order of probable frequency:

    1.  **Simple rephrasing without grammatical transformation (most common):** Students might just try to say the same thing in slightly different words, or add words without understanding voice.
        *   "The leaves blew away because of the wind." (Keeping active voice but adding "because of")
        *   "The wind make the leaves go away." (Simplified verb, incorrect grammar)
        *   "The leaves went away by wind." (Closer, but "went away" is not passive, missing "were blown")
        *   "Wind blow the leaves." (Simplification, wrong tense)

    2.  **Incorrect past participle or verb form:**
        *   "The leaves were **blowed** away by the wind." (Common irregular verb error)
        *   "The leaves was blew away by the wind." (Subject-verb agreement error, wrong participle)
        *   "The leaves are blow away by the wind." (Wrong tense)

    3.  **Missing "by the wind" or incorrect placement:**
        *   "The leaves were blown away." (Missing the agent)
        *   "By the wind the leaves were blown away." (Awkward, but better than nothing)

    4.  **Incorrect subject-verb agreement (singular/plural):**
        *   "The leaves **was** blown away by the wind." (Common error with "leaves" vs. "was")

    5.  **Partial understanding or just scrambling words:**
        *   "Away the leaves blew wind."
        *   "Wind the leaves blew away."

    6.  **"Empty Response" / "I don't know"**: Less common than other types of errors for this question, but still present.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 7%**

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

*   **Complexity of the concept:** Active/Passive voice transformation is a higher-level grammatical concept. It's not just about vocabulary or sentence structure but requires understanding how grammatical roles shift.
*   **Irregular verb form:** "Blew" to "blown" is an irregular verb, adding another layer of difficulty. Many will get the participle wrong.
*   **Multiple simultaneous errors:** Even if a student gets the general idea (object becomes subject), they are very likely to make errors in:
    *   Choosing the correct auxiliary verb ("were" vs
