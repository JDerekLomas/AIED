Let's break down the likely student responses to "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Subject Matter Misconceptions (Geography):**
    *   **Lack of Specific Knowledge:** Many students might not have memorized specific mountain ranges. While "Himalayas" is a very common name, others like Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, or the Ghats might be less known, especially if their geography curriculum hasn't emphasized them or if they lack access to good maps/textbooks.
    *   **Confusing Mountains with Other Features:** Students might confuse mountain ranges with rivers (Ganga, Yamuna), plateaus (Deccan Plateau), deserts (Thar Desert), or even cities.
    *   **General Knowledge Gap:** For many students, especially from economically weaker sections, exposure to detailed geographical information might be limited beyond the very basics.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Major":** While "major" is a common word, some might not fully grasp its implication of significance or extent, leading them to name smaller, local hills if they know any, or simply not understanding why "any two" are needed if they only know one.
    *   **"Mountain Ranges":** "Mountain" is generally understood, but "range" might be a more specific geographical term that some might not fully grasp, especially if their primary language is not English and the direct translation isn't immediately obvious. However, this is less likely to be a primary error than the lack of content knowledge.

3.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **High Attempt Rate:** Unlike abstract questions about colonial rule or Ashoka's reign, this is a direct, factual recall question. Students are more likely to attempt it even if they only know one name or are guessing. It feels "easier" to attempt than "explain how..."
    *   **Partial Knowledge:** Many might know "Himalayas" but struggle to recall a second. This is where the rubric (0.5 for one correct) is crucial.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   **Single Correct Answer:** "Himalayas" (leading to 0.5 marks). This will be a very common response.
    *   **Empty Response:** Similar to other exams, some students might simply leave it blank if they have no idea.
    *   **Random Geographic Features:** "Ganga," "Yamuna," "Thar Desert," "Deccan Plateau," "Mumbai," "Delhi." They know these are geographical features/places in India and might guess.
    *   **Misspellings:** Even if they know "Himalayas," spellings might be incorrect (e.g., "Himallaya," "Himalay"). The rubric doesn't specify penalizing minor misspellings, so we'll assume a recognizable misspelling is accepted.
    *   **Vague Answers:** "North mountains," "South mountains." (Likely not accepted by the rubric which asks for names).
    *   **Repeating one name twice:** "Himalayas, Himalayas" (only one will be counted as correct, so 0.5 marks).

**Impact of Previous Common Errors:**

The common errors from other questions (empty responses, very tangential answers, basic factual errors) suggest a general struggle with both comprehension and recall. However, this question is much more direct and less abstract.

*   "Empty Response" is a risk here too, but likely less so than for analytical questions.
*   The "Ashok a second" type answers for the lion question show a confusion of similar-sounding words or a very vague association. Here, the words are "mountain ranges."

**Rubric Consideration:**

The rubric awards 0.5 for *one* correct mountain range. This significantly increases the pass rate compared to needing *two*. "Himalayas" is widely known.

**Estimation Strategy:**

1.  **Baseline Awareness:** Almost certainly, a large majority of students (even those with limited exposure) will have heard of the Himalayas. Let's estimate **70-80%** would correctly name the Himalayas.
2.  **Second Mountain Range:** Recalling a second (Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats) is much harder.
    *   Perhaps **20-30%** might recall one of these in addition to the Himalayas.
    *   A very small percentage (less than 5%) might know two *other* than Himalayas.
3.  **Empty Responses / Completely Wrong:** Given the general struggles, about **15-25%** might provide an empty response or something completely off-topic (e.g., rivers, cities, general terms).
