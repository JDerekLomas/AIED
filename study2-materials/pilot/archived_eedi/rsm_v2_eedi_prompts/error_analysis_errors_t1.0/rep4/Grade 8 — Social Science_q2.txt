Let's break down the likely errors for the question: "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Lack of Knowledge/Recall (Most Significant Factor):**
    *   **Misconception about Social Science:** The most prominent error will simply be a lack of specific knowledge about the Harappan Civilization. While it's a foundational topic in Indian history, detailed features like urban planning might not be retained by many students, especially those struggling with the curriculum.
    *   **Empty Responses:** Given the examples provided for other difficult questions ("Empty Response" being common), this will be a very frequent occurrence. Students who simply don't know will leave it blank.
    *   **Vague/Generic Answers:** Some students might recall "something old" or "ancient civilization" but fail to provide a *specific key feature* of *urban planning*. They might say "they built houses" or "they had cities" which doesn't meet the rubric.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings/Vocabulary:**
    *   **"Urban Planning":** While "urban" and "planning" are relatively common words, some students from weaker sections might struggle with the specific nuance of "urban planning" as a discipline or concept. They might interpret it more broadly as "how they lived in cities" rather than focusing on the *design and organization* of the city.
    *   **Difficulty articulating features:** Even if they know a feature (e.g., drainage), they might struggle to describe it clearly or link it explicitly to "urban planning."

3.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   Given the prevalence of "Empty Response" in other challenging questions, a significant portion will not attempt it at all due to lack of knowledge.
    *   Some will attempt but provide very vague or incorrect information.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   **"Empty Response":** This will be the absolute most common.
    *   **Vague/General:** "They had cities," "They lived in groups," "They built things."
    *   **Irrelevant but Related:** "They worshipped many gods," "They had seals" (recalling other Harappan facts but not urban planning).
    *   **Misinformation/Conflation:** Possibly confusing Harappan features with other ancient civilizations or even more recent periods, or simply making something up. However, straight "empty response" is more likely than creative misinformation for this cohort.

**Comparison with Other Questions:**

*   **"Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi" (9% pass rate):** This requires analytical thinking and knowledge of a complex historical process. "Urban planning" is a more factual recall question, potentially making it slightly easier than this.
*   **"Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes? Explain" (10% pass rate):** This is a specific cultural/historical fact with a direct, relatively simple answer (Ashoka's pillar). The common errors here ("Asher' stand," "ashok a second") show attempts at recall but significant phonetic/spelling issues or incomplete knowledge. This suggests students *try* to recall, even if incorrectly.
*   **"Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign in Indian history, mentioning at leas" (12% pass rate):** Similar to the lion question, this tests specific historical knowledge. "Empty Response" is common.

**Estimation of Pass Rate:**

The question asks for *one key feature*, which simplifies the task compared to "explaining significance" or "how it affected lives." If a student recalls *any* of the major features (grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town), they get it right.

However, considering:
*   The overall low average pass rate (29%).
*   The prevalence of "Empty Response" for factual recall questions.
*   The specific nature of "urban planning" possibly being a bit too technical for some, even if they know about Harappan civilization generally.
*   The difficulty of articulating the feature clearly even if vaguely known.

While "Harappan Civilization" is fundamental, detailed "urban planning" might be one of the facts that are easily forgotten. The errors on the lion question suggest students might recall "Ashoka" but struggle with the precise connection or spelling. Similarly, they might recall "Harappan" but not "grid layout" or "drainage system."

I anticipate the pass rate for this specific factual detail to be closer to the lower end of the average, and potentially slightly higher than the *very* low rates for analytical or highly specific cultural questions, but not by much. It's a key topic, but the specificity of "urban planning" is the hurdle.

Given the examples, I'd
