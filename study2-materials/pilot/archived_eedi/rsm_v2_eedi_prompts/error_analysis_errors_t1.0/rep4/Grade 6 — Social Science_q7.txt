Let's break down the potential performance of Class 6 students in Indian government schools on this question.

**Analysis of the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question:** "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."
*   **Rubric:** Mentions two correct natural resources AND explains influence of one. Max score: 1 (implies all or nothing for full credit).
*   **Keywords:** "natural resources," "Rajasthan," "influences the lives."

**Likely Challenges for Students (based on provided context and common errors):**

1.  **General Social Science Knowledge (Especially Geography/Resources):**
    *   **Limited Exposure:** Many students from economically weaker sections might have limited exposure to geography outside their immediate surroundings or basic textbooks.
    *   **Recall Difficulty:** Remembering specific natural resources for a particular state like Rajasthan might be challenging without rote memorization or strong conceptual understanding.
    *   **Lack of Specificity:** They might know *some* natural resources but struggle to link them to *Rajasthan* specifically.

2.  **Language Barriers (English):**
    *   **"Natural Resources":** While a core concept, some might struggle to fully grasp or articulate it in English. They might know examples but not the term itself.
    *   **"Influences the lives":** This phrase requires not just listing a resource but demonstrating a cause-and-effect relationship, which can be harder to express in a second language.
    *   **"Rajasthan":** Simple recall of the state name and its associated features.

3.  **Task Comprehension and Execution:**
    *   **Two Parts:** The question has two distinct parts: (1) list two resources, and (2) explain influence of one. Students might miss one part or only partially answer.
    *   **"Explain how":** This requires more than just naming; it demands a descriptive sentence or two, which is where language and conceptual clarity become crucial.

4.  **Common Error Patterns from Previous Questions:**
    *   **"Empty Response" (High Risk):** Given the low pass rates on other questions and the likelihood of students not knowing specific resources for Rajasthan, a significant number might leave it blank.
    *   **Irrelevant/Incorrect Information:** Students might list general resources (trees, animals) that aren't specific to Rajasthan or not considered "natural resources" in the context of the curriculum (e.g., "food," "shelter").
    *   **Partial Answers:** Listing two resources but failing to explain the influence, or vice-versa (less likely, as listing is easier than explaining).
    *   **Phonetic/Misspelled Answers:** If they do attempt, the spelling of resources might be incorrect, though the rubric focuses on identification.
    *   **Memorization Failure:** If they only memorized lists, and this specific combination wasn't covered or recalled, they're stuck.

**Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **"Empty Response":** Highly probable due to lack of specific knowledge about Rajasthan's resources.
*   **Listing general resources, not specific to Rajasthan or not fitting the definition:** e.g., "trees," "animals," "soil" (without context like fertile soil for agriculture).
*   **Listing *one* correct resource, but not two, or failing to explain:** This would likely get 0 marks under a strict "Max score: 1" rubric.
*   **Confusing Rajasthan with other states/regions:** Listing resources for Punjab, Gujarat, etc., if they have some general knowledge but misattribute it.
*   **Attempting to explain influence but failing due to language/conceptual gap:** e.g., "Water is important for people." (Too vague, not an *explanation* of influence.)

**Factors Influencing Pass Rate:**

*   **The "Max score: 1" rubric:** This is critical. It implies a perfect answer is needed to get the single point. Listing two resources but not explaining, or explaining one but only listing one, will likely lead to 0. This drastically lowers the pass rate compared to a rubric that gives partial credit.
*   **Simplicity of common resources:** "Water" and "Sand" are very obvious natural resources in Rajasthan. If students grasp this and link water to daily life, agriculture, or scarcity, they have a chance. "Sunlight" for solar is also a strong contender.
*   **Difficulty of "explain how one of them influences":** This is the more demanding part. It requires connecting the resource to the daily lives, economy, or culture of the people.

**Estimation:**

Given the average pass rate of 29% for Social Science, and the nature of this question:

*   It requires specific knowledge
