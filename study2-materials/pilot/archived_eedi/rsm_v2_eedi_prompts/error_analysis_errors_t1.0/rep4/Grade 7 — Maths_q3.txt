Let's break down the likely errors for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their background.

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

**1. Misconceptions about Mathematics:**

*   **Forgetting the "1/2" (Most Common):** This is a very frequent error. Students often remember "base × height" from rectangles/squares and apply it directly to triangles without the division by two. They might not fully grasp *why* a triangle's area is half that of a corresponding rectangle.
*   **Confusing Area and Perimeter:** Though less likely for this specific question (as "area" is clearly stated), some students, especially weaker ones, might mix up the concepts. However, calculating perimeter here would be difficult without the third side, so it's less probable than forgetting 1/2.
*   **Incorrect Multiplication:** Even if they remember base * height, basic multiplication errors (8 x 6 = 42, 54, etc.) can occur, though less common than forgetting 1/2.
*   **Units:** They might forget to write units, or write incorrect units (cm instead of cm²). While not directly impacting the formula, it indicates a lack of complete understanding.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Area":** While "area" is a fundamental concept taught in Hindi/local languages, a student struggling with English might stumble if they haven't adequately connected the English term to their vernacular understanding. However, for Class 7, "area" is usually well-established.
*   **"Base" and "Height":** These terms are generally consistent across languages and well-illustrated in textbooks. Unlikely to be a major source of error.
*   **"Whose":** This possessive pronoun might be confusing for some, but in this context, it's fairly straightforward.

**3. Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**

*   **Most will attempt:** This is a direct, computational question based on a standard formula. Students are generally encouraged to attempt all questions, and this one *looks* approachable.
*   **Failure to attempt:** Would be rare unless the student has absolutely no idea about area or triangles, which would imply a severe gap in foundational knowledge.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer:**

*   **`48` (or `48 cm` or `48 cm²`):** This is overwhelmingly the most common wrong answer, resulting from `base × height` without dividing by 2.

**Error Scenario Breakdown (leading to wrong answers):**

*   **Scenario 1 (Very Common - Mathematical Misconception):**
    *   Student remembers "area of a rectangle/square is length × breadth."
    *   Applies this directly to the triangle: `8 × 6 = 48`.
    *   **Result:** `48`
*   **Scenario 2 (Less Common - Calculation Error after correct formula):**
    *   Student remembers `1/2 × base × height`.
    *   `1/2 × 8 × 6 = 1/2 × 48`.
    *   Makes a mistake dividing 48 by 2 (e.g., `20`, `22`, `24` but then misunderstands further).
    *   **Result:** Unpredictable, but less frequent.
*   **Scenario 3 (Rare - Total Confusion):**
    *   Attempts to add `8 + 6 = 14`.
    *   **Result:** `14` (unlikely for area)

**Estimating the Pass Rate:**

Considering the average pass rate of 29% and the specific nature of this question:

*   **The "1/2" omission is a massive trap.** Many students will fall into it.
*   Those who remember the formula correctly are likely to perform the multiplication and division correctly.
*   Language isn't a significant barrier here once "area," "base," and "height" are understood, which they usually are by Class 7.

If the *average* pass rate is 29% across *all* types of questions, this question tests a fundamental concept and formula. However, the specific common error (forgetting 1/2) is extremely prevalent.

Let's consider that the 29% average implies a significant portion struggle with *any* mathematical reasoning or recall.

*   A certain percentage will know the formula perfectly.
*   A significant percentage will forget the 1/2.
*   A smaller percentage will have calculation errors or complete confusion.

I'd expect the pass rate for this question to be *slightly higher* than the overall average, primarily because it's a direct application of a single formula, and
