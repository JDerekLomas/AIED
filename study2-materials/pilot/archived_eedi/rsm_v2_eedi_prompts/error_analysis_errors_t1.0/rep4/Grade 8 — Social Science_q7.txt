Here's an analysis of likely errors for the question "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?" for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, followed by an estimated pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the student profile and common error patterns, here's a breakdown of how students might struggle:

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science:**

*   **Lack of Causal Understanding:** Students might know *about* the Battle of Plassey but struggle to connect it causally to the *expansion* of British power. They might just list facts about the battle without explaining the *consequence*.
*   **Focus on Surface-Level Information:** They might remember dates or names (Plassey, 1757) but not the deeper historical significance or the strategic implications of the victory.
*   **Difficulty with "Contribution" / "Expansion":** The abstract nature of these terms might be challenging. They might not grasp that "contribution" implies a direct link to a larger process ("expansion").
*   **Memorization without Comprehension:** History is often taught through rote memorization in these contexts. Students might have memorized "Battle of Plassey 1757" but not the *why* or *how* it was significant.
*   **Limited Geographical Understanding:** Some students might not fully understand the significance of Bengal as a rich province or its strategic importance for British expansion.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Contribute":** This word might be difficult. Students might interpret it as simply "what happened at Plassey" rather than "how did Plassey *help* British power grow."
*   **"Expansion":** While a common word, its historical context (territorial and political expansion) might not be fully understood.
*   **"British Power":** While they might know "Britishers," the concept of "British power" (political, economic, military dominance) might be vague.
*   **Vocabulary Gaps:** Terms like "puppet nawab," "dominance," "control," "political influence" might not be part of their active vocabulary.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **Attempt but Fail (Common):** Most students will likely attempt something, even if it's just a few words or a vague sentence. This is unlike the "Empty Response" for the highly complex "tribal communities" question. They know "Plassey" and "British."
*   **Not Attempt at All (Less Common for this question):** While possible for very difficult or abstract questions, the Battle of Plassey is a central event in their curriculum, so a complete blank is less likely unless they are entirely unprepared.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **Vague Statements:** "It was important for the British." "The British won the battle." "It was a big battle."
*   **Facts without Linkage:** "The Battle of Plassey happened in 1757." "Robert Clive led the British." "Siraj-ud-Daulah was defeated." (These are facts, but don't explain the *contribution to expansion*).
*   **Incorrect Causal Linkage:** Attributing effects of other battles or policies to Plassey.
*   **Partial Answers (Missing the "political dominance" aspect):** "The British got money." or "The British became stronger." (While true, it misses the crucial political control over Bengal that the rubric emphasizes).
*   **Single-word answers:** "Victory." "Power."
*   **"Empty Response" / Off-topic scribbles:** Similar to the examples provided, for students who are completely lost or overwhelmed.

**Considering the Rubric:**

The rubric is quite specific: "explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)." This requires a clear cause-and-effect understanding and the specific detail of political control, ideally mentioning the puppet ruler. Students often struggle to articulate this level of detail and consequence.

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

Given the average pass rate of 29% for Social Science, and the common errors observed for similarly structured "explain" questions, this question is likely to be challenging. While students will know *of* Plassey, linking it specifically to "political dominance over Bengal" and explaining the *mechanism* (e.g., puppet nawab) is a higher-order thinking skill.

Comparing it to the example questions:
*   "Tribal communities" (9%): Very complex, abstract.
*   "Lions on currency" (10%): Requires specific cultural/historical knowledge beyond simple facts.
*   "Ashoka's reign" (1
