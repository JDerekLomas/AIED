Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the context (Class 6 students, economically weaker sections, limited English, common errors in Social Science exams), here's what we might expect:

**1. Content/Knowledge Gaps (Social Science Misconceptions):**

*   **Lack of Specific Geographical Knowledge:** While mountains are a basic concept, naming *specific major ranges in India* might be challenging for students who haven't had strong geography instruction or exposure. They might know "mountain" but not "Himalayas."
*   **Confusion with Other Geographical Features:** Some might name rivers (Ganga, Yamuna), cities, or states instead of mountain ranges, indicating a general lack of understanding of geographical categories.
*   **Difficulty Distinguishing "Major" Ranges:** Even if they know a few mountains, they might struggle to identify which ones are considered "major."

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Name any two major mountain ranges":**
    *   **"Name":** This is generally straightforward.
    *   **"any two":** This implies flexibility but requires two distinct correct answers for a full score (though the rubric only requires one for 0.5 points). Some might only name one, or repeat the same range twice.
    *   **"major":** This word might be a slight hurdle. While many major ranges are prominent, the term itself could be vaguely understood.
    *   **"mountain ranges":** This is the core term. Students who struggle with English might misinterpret "range" or conflate it with general "mountains" (which is acceptable here) or other landforms.
    *   **"located in India":** This is crucial. Students might name generic mountains from other countries or not understand the geographical boundary.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **Attempt but Fail:** This is highly probable. Geography is often seen as a less abstract subject than historical explanations. Students will likely try to write something, even if it's incorrect. Unlike the more abstract "Explain how colonial rule..." or "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign," simply "naming" is a lower cognitive load task.
*   **Not Attempting at all ("Empty Response"):** This is less likely than for the more complex explanation questions, but still a possibility for students with extremely low confidence or very poor recall. However, given the simplicity of the task ("name two things"), more students will likely put something down.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer(s):**

Based on the above, here are likely wrong answers:

*   **Single correct answer:** Many might only remember or know one, e.g., "Himalayas." (This would get 0.5 points, according to the rubric, so it's a *partially* correct answer leading to a pass, not a wrong answer per se).
*   **Generic terms:** "Mountains," "Pahad" (Hindi for mountain).
*   **Rivers/Cities/States:** "Ganga," "Delhi," "Rajasthan."
*   **Incorrect names/spelling:** "Himlaya," "Vindhyanchal" (slightly different but recognizable).
*   **Foreign mountains:** Less likely, but possible if they pick up information from other sources, e.g., "Everest" (which is *part* of the Himalayas, but not a range itself, and often associated with Nepal).
*   **Repetition:** "Himalayas, Himalayas." (This would still technically fulfill the "one correct range" for 0.5 marks).
*   **Empty Response:** For students completely stumped or lacking confidence.

**Rubric Consideration:**

The rubric is very generous: "Names *one* correct mountain range... Max score: 0.5". This significantly increases the pass rate. A student only needs to name *one* of the major ranges correctly to score 0.5 and "pass" this item.

**Estimate for Pass Rate:**

Let's consider the average pass rate of 29% for similar Social Science questions. This question is arguably *easier* than the examples provided ("Explain how colonial rule...", "Why are lions shown...", "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign...").

*   Those questions require explanation, critical thinking, or historical context.
*   This question requires recall of basic geography.

Many students, even with limited formal education, will have some awareness of the Himalayas. The Aravalli and Vindhya ranges are also prominent in central/western India.

*   **Low-end estimate (29% baseline + slight bump):** If this were as hard as the others, it would be 29%. But it's easier.
