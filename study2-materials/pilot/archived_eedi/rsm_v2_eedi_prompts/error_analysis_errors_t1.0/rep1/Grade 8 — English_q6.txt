Let's break down the potential pitfalls for Class 8 Indian government school students on the question "Define fable."

Given the context (economically weaker sections, limited English, low pass rates on similar questions, and common error patterns), here's an analysis of likely errors:

**1. Misconceptions about English/Definition Questions:**

*   **Understanding "Define":** Many students might not fully grasp what "define" means in an academic context. They might interpret it as:
    *   **Giving an example:** They might provide the name of a fable they know (e.g., "The Hare and the Tortoise") instead of its characteristics.
    *   **Translating a single word:** If they know the Hindi/local language equivalent for "fable" (e.g., "नीतिकथा" - neetikatha, or "कहानी" - kahani), they might just write that word, assuming it's a definition.
    *   **Describing a story generally:** They might just say "it's a story" without specifying its unique features.
*   **Vocabulary Gaps:**
    *   They might know the concept of a fable but lack the specific English vocabulary to articulate its definition (e.g., "moral," "lesson," "allegory," "personification," "animal characters").
    *   Words like "typically" or "imparts" would be well beyond their comprehension.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **Simple Sentence Structure:** Even if they have a vague idea, forming a grammatically correct and coherent sentence to define something abstract will be challenging.
*   **Spelling and Grammar:** Even if they attempt a definition, it's highly likely to be riddled with spelling and grammatical errors, making it unintelligible or not meeting the rubric's standard.
*   **"Fable" vs. "Story":** They might simply equate "fable" with "story" (kahani), failing to differentiate the specific characteristics of a fable.

**3. Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**

*   **High Non-Attempt Rate:** Similar to "Describes the poet's writing style" (4% pass rate with "Empty Response" common), many students will likely not attempt this question if they don't immediately recognize the word or know how to form a definition. "Empty Response" or "I don't know" in various forms will be common.
*   **Attempt but Fail:** Those who attempt will likely fall into the categories below.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **Empty Response/I don't know/Don't understand:** A very significant portion.
*   **Naming a Fable:** "The Hare and the Tortoise." "It is a story of animals."
*   **Generic "Story" Definition:** "Fable is a story." "It is a short story." "Fable is a story for children."
*   **Translating a single word:** "नीतिकथा" (Neetikatha) or "Kahani" (Story). (Though the exam is in English, some might attempt this if they don't know the English equivalent).
*   **Fragmented/Incorrect Attempts at Definition (due to limited vocabulary and grammar):**
    *   "Fable is animal story." (Lacks "moral lesson")
    *   "Fable is teach a lesson." (Lacks "short story," "animal characters")
    *   "Fable is a short story with animals." (Missing "moral lesson")
    *   "Fable have moral." (Missing other key elements, poor grammar)
    *   "Fable is good story for moral." (Vague, incomplete)
*   **Completely irrelevant answers:** Similar to "My favourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy" for a paragraph question, some might write something entirely off-topic if they simply recognize "story" and start writing about any story they know.

**Analysis against Rubric:**

The rubric requires: "Defines fable as a short story that typically uses animals as characters and imparts a moral lesson." This is a *three-part definition* that requires specific vocabulary and sentence structure.

*   "Short story": Many might miss this or just say "story."
*   "Animals as characters": Many might get "animals," but "as characters" might be too advanced.
*   "Imparts a moral lesson": This is the most complex part to articulate. "Moral" and "lesson" might be known words, but "imparts a moral lesson" is a much higher-level phrase.

Given the 29% average pass rate, and the even lower rates for questions requiring specific definitions or detailed descriptions of abstract concepts (4-
