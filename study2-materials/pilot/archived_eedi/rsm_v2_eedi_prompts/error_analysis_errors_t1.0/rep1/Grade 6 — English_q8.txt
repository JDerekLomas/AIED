Let's break down the potential errors for this specific question and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the context of Class 6 students from economically weaker sections with limited English, and the common errors observed in other questions, here's what I anticipate for "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence: book/reading/a/is/he":

*   **Misconceptions about English leading to incorrect answers:**

    *   **Lack of understanding of basic sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object):** This is the most fundamental issue. Many students might not grasp the "who does what" order. They might arrange words based on proximity in their native language (if that structure is different) or simply randomly.
    *   **Confusion with "is":** While "is" is a common verb, its position in a sentence can still be tricky for beginners, especially when trying to differentiate it from other parts of speech.
    *   **Ignoring punctuation/capitalization (even if not explicitly tested):** While the rubric doesn't mention it, a correct answer *implicitly* requires the subject to be capitalized. Students might just output "he is reading a book" without capitalizing "he". For the purpose of *meaningful sentence*, this would likely still pass, but it indicates a minor structural oversight.
    *   **Focus on individual word meaning rather than overall sentence meaning:** They know "book," "reading," "he," but struggle to combine them grammatically.

*   **Language misunderstandings that could occur:**

    *   **Direct translation pitfalls:** If they try to directly translate word-for-word from a local language that has a different sentence structure, they will likely get it wrong. For example, if their native language is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb), they might produce something like "He book reading is."
    *   **Identifying the "subject":** They might struggle to identify "he" as the subject that performs the action.

*   **Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**

    *   **Attempt but fail:** Given it's a rearrangement task and all words are provided, most students will likely *attempt* it. It doesn't require generating new vocabulary or complex ideas, just reordering what's given. This makes it less intimidating than "Write a theme..." or "Describe the poet's writing style."
    *   **Not attempt at all:** A small percentage might find it completely overwhelming if they don't even recognize "he," "is," "reading," or "book" as basic components, but this is less likely than for the more open-ended questions.

*   **What would the most common wrong answer look like?**

    *   **Random order:** "Reading a book he is," "Book he is reading a," "Is he reading a book?" (question form, not statement).
    *   **Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) influence:** "He book a reading is" or "He a book reading is." (If native language is SOV)
    *   **Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) influence:** "Is he reading a book." (Again, a question, not a statement, which is the expected output).
    *   **Missing words / Duplicated words:** Less likely for this specific question as it's rearranging, but possible if they misunderstand the instruction completely.
    *   **"Empty Response":** Less likely than for the other complex questions, but still a possibility for those completely lost. However, since all words are provided, there's a strong incentive to try *something*.
    *   **Partial correct (e.g., "He is reading"):** They might get the first part right but struggle with the object. "He is reading book a."

**Why this question is different from the examples provided:**

The example questions ("Describes the poet's writing style," "Write a theme," "Write a short paragraph") all require:
1.  **Understanding abstract concepts:** "writing style," "theme," "central idea."
2.  **Generating original content:** forming sentences, expressing complex thoughts.
3.  **Extended writing:** paragraphs, multiple sentences.

"Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence" is much more constrained and tests a very basic grammatical rule. It's less about *comprehension of abstract ideas* and more about *application of structural rules*.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**

Considering the above, while the average pass rate is low (29%), this particular question targets a very fundamental aspect of English that might be emphasized early in their learning. Students might have memorized basic sentence patterns. The difficulty is in *applying* that rule consistently.

I believe this question will have a significantly higher pass rate than the examples given
