Let's break down the likely errors for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their background.

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

1.  **Misconceptions about Mathematics:**

    *   **Forgetting the "1/2" (Most Common Mathematical Error):** Many students, especially under pressure or with rote learning, will remember "base × height" for area but forget the crucial factor of "1/2" for a triangle. This is a very common mistake across various educational levels, but particularly prevalent when understanding of derivations is weak. They might confuse it with the area of a rectangle/parallelogram.
    *   **Confusing Area with Perimeter:** While less common for such a direct question, some students might mistakenly try to add the numbers or make an attempt related to perimeter if they're not fully grasping the concept of "area."
    *   **Calculation Errors:** Even if they get the formula right, simple multiplication errors (e.g., 8 * 6 = 42 instead of 48) or division errors (48 / 2 = 20 instead of 24) can occur.
    *   **Lack of Formula Recall:** Some students simply might not have memorized the formula for the area of a triangle.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings:**

    *   **"Area":** While "area" is a fundamental concept, some students might struggle if their primary instruction is in a regional language and they haven't fully assimilated the English term. However, it's often introduced early.
    *   **"Base" and "Height":** These terms are generally standard and visually reinforced in diagrams, so direct misunderstanding of these words is less likely unless their conceptual understanding of what base and height *represent* in a triangle is weak.
    *   **"Whose":** This is unlikely to cause a significant issue as the structure is quite direct.
    *   **"Find the area of a triangle":** The entire phrase should be understandable in context, especially as "triangle" is a common geometric shape.

3.  **Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**

    *   **Attempt but Fail:** The vast majority of students will attempt this question. It's a direct application of a formula, and students are generally encouraged to show *some* work.
    *   **Not Attempt at All:** Only students who are completely lost (no formula recall, no understanding of the terms) or have very low confidence will leave it blank. This proportion will be relatively small, likely less than 10-15%. Most will at least write *something*.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:**

    *   **`48 cm²` (from base × height):** This will be the absolute most common wrong answer. It shows recognition of the numbers and the operation but misses the "1/2".
    *   **`24` (missing units):** Many students will get the numerical answer correct but forget to write the units (`cm²`). The rubric specifies "States or uses the correct formula," which implies getting the numerical value from the formula is key. If the rubric is strict on units for full marks, this would be an error, but for *using the correct formula*, the numerical part is paramount. Assuming the rubric focuses on the formula application, a student writing 24 without units might still get credit if the instruction is just "States or uses." However, for *full conceptual understanding*, units are important. Let's assume for *this specific rubric point* (formula use), `24` would likely pass.
    *   **`14 cm` (from 8 + 6):** This indicates confusion with perimeter or simply adding the numbers without understanding the context. Less common than 48 but possible.

**Estimation of Pass Rate:**

Given the average pass rate for Class 7 in Indian government schools is 29%, we need to consider how this particular question fits within that. This is a very fundamental geometry question, usually taught explicitly.

*   **Students who know the formula perfectly (Area = 1/2 * b * h) and calculate correctly:** This group is what we're trying to estimate.
*   **Students who forget "1/2" but do b*h (get 48):** This will be a large group. They *almost* know the formula.
*   **Students who don't know the formula at all / confuse with perimeter:** This will be another group.
*   **Students making calculation errors:** A smaller subset.

Considering the "average pass rate about 29%," this implies that many students struggle even with basic concepts. However, this question is a *very direct* recall and application. It's not a multi-step problem, nor does it involve complex reasoning.
