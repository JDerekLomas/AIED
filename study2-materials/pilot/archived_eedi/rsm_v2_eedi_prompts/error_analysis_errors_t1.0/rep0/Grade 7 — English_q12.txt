Let's break down the potential errors for Class 7 students in Indian government schools facing the Active to Passive voice transformation question.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Lack of Understanding of "Active" and "Passive" Voice:** This is the most fundamental hurdle. Many students might not grasp the concept at all, even if they've been taught the terms. They might view it as a random grammatical transformation rather than a shift in emphasis.

2.  **Difficulty Identifying Subject, Verb, and Object:**
    *   **Subject:** "The wind"
    *   **Verb:** "blew" (past tense of blow)
    *   **Object:** "the leaves"
    Students might struggle to correctly identify these components, which is crucial for the transformation.

3.  **Confusion with Verb Tense and Form:**
    *   The original verb is "blew" (simple past). The passive voice requires "was/were + past participle."
    *   Students might forget to change "blew" to "blown."
    *   They might use the wrong auxiliary verb (e.g., "is blown," "has blown").
    *   They might try to keep "blew" in some form or use another past tense form incorrectly.

4.  **Incorrect Placement of "by the wind":** If they get the core transformation somewhat right ("The leaves were blown"), they might forget or misplace "by the wind," or omit it entirely.

5.  **Direct Word Substitution/Literal Translation:**
    *   Given their struggles with "describes the poet's writing style" leading to "I am reading," they might try to simply substitute words without understanding the grammatical structure.
    *   They might try to change individual words rather than the sentence structure.

6.  **Focus on Surface-Level Changes:** They might think "change" means just altering one or two words without understanding the underlying rule.

7.  **Vocabulary/Spelling Issues:** "Blown" might be misspelled or confused with other words.

8.  **Over-complication/Adding Unnecessary Words:** Some students, trying to "change" it, might add extra words that don't belong.

**Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**

*   **Attempt and Fail (Most Common):** Unlike open-ended questions like "Describe the poet's writing style" or "Write a theme," this is a direct grammatical transformation. Most students will likely attempt it, even if their attempt is wildly off the mark. They'll try to apply *some* rule they might have vaguely heard of.
*   **Not Attempt (Less Common but Possible):** A small percentage might leave it blank if they have absolutely no idea or are completely overwhelmed by the instruction "Active Voice to Passive Voice." However, given it's a fill-in-the-blank type of answer expected, an attempt is more probable.

**What would the most common wrong answer look like?**

Given the common errors observed in other questions (empty response, fragmented ideas, literal interpretation, incorrect tense/grammar):

1.  **"The leaves blow by the wind."** (Incorrect verb form "blow" instead of "were blown") - *Very likely.*
2.  **"The leaves was blown away by the wind."** (Incorrect auxiliary verb "was" for plural "leaves") - *Likely.*
3.  **"The leaves blown away by the wind."** (Missing auxiliary verb "were") - *Likely.*
4.  **"The wind blown the leaves away."** (Attempting to change the verb but not the voice structure)
5.  **"The leaves were blew away by the wind."** (Incorrect past participle "blew" instead of "blown")
6.  **"The leaves away by the wind."** (Severely truncated, missing verb)
7.  **"Empty Response"** (For those completely lost, though less likely than an attempt)
8.  **"The leaves were blown."** (Omitting "by the wind") - This might be considered partially correct in some lenient marking schemes, but for a "correctly transforms" rubric, it would be incorrect.

**Analysis of Difficulty:**

*   **Identifiable subject/object:** Relatively straightforward in this sentence.
*   **Simple Past Tense:** This is a common tense, but the "blew" -> "blown" irregular verb can be a stumbling block.
*   **Concept of Active/Passive:** This is the biggest barrier. If they don't understand the *why* and *how*, they'll struggle.
*   **Requirement for "by the wind":** Easy to forget or misplace.
