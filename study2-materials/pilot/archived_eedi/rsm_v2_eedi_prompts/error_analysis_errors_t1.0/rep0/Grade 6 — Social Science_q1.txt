Let's break down the likely errors for the question: "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India." and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the student profile (economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate 29%) and the common errors observed in Social Science, here's a detailed breakdown:

1.  **"Empty Response" / Non-Attempt:**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a very prominent error in the examples provided for other questions (9% pass rate, 12% pass rate). Students might face a complete blank, feel overwhelmed by the question's direct recall nature, or lack the foundational knowledge of Indian geography. The English might not be the primary barrier here, but rather a lack of exposure to geographical terms in any language.
    *   **Likely Impact:** A significant portion of students will likely leave this blank.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Mountain ranges":** While "mountain" is a fairly common word, "ranges" might be less familiar for some, though the context should make it clear. The core issue isn't likely misunderstanding the question itself, but rather not knowing the *answer* in English.
    *   **"Located in India":** This is straightforward.
    *   **Impact:** Minor, but if a student only knows a *peak* (like Mount Everest, though not in India) or a single mountain, they might write that instead of a range.

3.  **Misconceptions / Incorrect Information:**
    *   **Naming a single mountain instead of a range:** A student might know "Mount Everest" (though not in India) or a local peak, but not the broader range.
    *   **Naming a non-mountainous feature:** Students might confuse mountains with rivers, plateaus, deserts, or even states/cities if their geographical knowledge is very weak. (e.g., "Ganga River," "Thar Desert," "Deccan Plateau").
    *   **Naming mountains outside India:** For example, "Mount Everest" (part of the Himalayas, but the peak itself is on the Nepal-China border) or other international ranges.
    *   **Confusion with famous Indian landmarks/historical sites:** Similar to the "lions on currency" question, where students might drift to related but irrelevant famous things. They might list historical monuments or famous places if they don't know geography.
    *   **General recall failure:** Simply not remembering the names of any major mountain ranges in India.

4.  **Common Wrong Answer Look-Alikes:**
    *   "Empty Response" / Blank.
    *   "Himalaya" (only one, but partially correct).
    *   "Everest" (incorrect, as it's a peak and mostly outside India).
    *   "Ganga" / "Yamuna" (rivers).
    *   "Deccan" (plateau).
    *   Local hills/mountains that are not considered "major mountain ranges" in a national context.
    *   Gibberish or random words (similar to "Asher' stand" or "ashok a second" in other questions, indicating a complete lack of understanding or attempt to write *something*).

**How it relates to the Rubric:**

*   **Rubric:** Names *one* correct mountain range (e.g., Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats). Max score: 0.5.
*   This means even if they only get one right, they still score. This is an important consideration.

**Estimate the Pass Rate:**

Let's consider the breakdown:

*   **Completely Blank/Non-Attempt:** Given the prevalence in other questions, I'd estimate this to be quite high, perhaps **30-40%**.
*   **Attempt but name something completely irrelevant (river, plateau, foreign peak, historical figure, gibberish):** This is also common for students who attempt but lack knowledge. Another **20-30%**.
*   **Attempt and name *one* correct range (e.g., "Himalayas"):** This would earn them 0.5 points. The Himalayas are quite prominent and often taught. Aravalli might also be known regionally. This is where the pass rate for *this specific question* will come from.
*   **Attempt and name *two* correct ranges:** This would earn them 0.5 points (as the max is 0.5 anyway).

Considering the low average pass rate (29%) and the specific errors shown for Social Science, simply recalling geographical names can be challenging. However, "Himalayas" is a very prominent feature taught across
