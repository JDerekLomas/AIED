Let's break down the likely errors for the question: "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence:\nbook/reading/a/is/he"

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Misconceptions about English Word Order (Syntax):**
    *   **Focus on Familiar Words, Ignoring Structure:** Students might identify "he," "book," "reading," and "is" as known words and try to string them together in any order that *feels* somewhat right, even if grammatically incorrect. They might not have a strong grasp of subject-verb-object (SVO) structure.
    *   **L1 Interference (Hindi/Regional Language):** Many Indian languages have a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) structure. For example, in Hindi, "He a book is reading" (वह एक किताब पढ़ रहा है - *vah ek kitab padh raha hai*) is a more literal translation. This could lead to answers like "He a book is reading" or "He book is reading a."
    *   **Lack of Articles:** The 'a' might be placed incorrectly or omitted due to not fully understanding its function.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **Understanding "Rearrange":** While "rearrange" is a common word, some students might interpret it more loosely, thinking they just need to list the words or write *any* sentence containing them, rather than strictly forming a *meaningful* sentence from *those exact words*.
    *   **"Meaningful Sentence":** The concept of "meaningful" might be subjective if their understanding of English grammar is weak. A sentence might seem "meaningful" to them even if it's grammatically incorrect, especially if it conveys a core idea.

3.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **Attempt but Fail:** This type of question (rearranging words) is often perceived as "easier" than comprehension or descriptive writing. Most students will likely attempt it. The words are common and understandable.
    *   **Low Non-Attempt Rate:** Unlike complex writing tasks where students might leave it blank due to lack of vocabulary or ideas, here, the words are provided.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answers:**
    Based on the above, here are the likely wrong answers:

    *   **L1 Interference (SOV structure):**
        *   "He a book is reading."
        *   "He book is reading a."
        *   "He a reading is book."
    *   **Incorrect Verb/Auxiliary Placement:**
        *   "He reading is a book." (Omitting the auxiliary verb, or placing 'is' incorrectly)
        *   "Is he reading a book." (Forming a question inadvertently)
        *   "Book is he reading a."
    *   **Partial Correctness/Missing Article:**
        *   "He is reading book." (Missing "a")
    *   **Simple Listing/Jumbled but not rearranged meaningfully:**
        *   "Book reading a is he." (Simply writing the words in a different random order)

**Comparison to Other Questions:**

*   **"Describes the poet's writing style." (4% pass rate):** This requires abstract thinking, understanding of literary terms, and complex sentence formation. The error "I am reading" shows a complete misunderstanding of the question's demands.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate):** Again, abstract thought, comprehension of a poem, and articulate expression. The common errors show either no understanding or a very rudimentary, fragmented grasp.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby." (10% pass rate):** This requires sustained writing, organization, and adherence to a prompt. Errors show poor sentence structure, listing, and inability to form a coherent paragraph.

**Why "Rearrange" is Different and Potentially Higher:**

*   **Concrete Task:** It's a very concrete, manipulative task. The words are given. It doesn't require generating new vocabulary or complex ideas.
*   **Common Vocabulary:** "He," "is," "reading," "a," "book" are all very high-frequency words that Class 6 students would likely know.
*   **Basic Sentence Structure:** While many may struggle with SVO, it's a fundamental structure introduced early. Students might have seen similar exercises.
*   **Familiarity of the Concept:** The sentence "He is reading a book" describes a very common, everyday action, making it easier to recognize the correct arrangement if they have even a basic grasp of English.

**Estimating the Pass Rate:**

Given the common errors observed in other questions (empty responses, complete misunderstanding of the prompt, fragmented answers),
