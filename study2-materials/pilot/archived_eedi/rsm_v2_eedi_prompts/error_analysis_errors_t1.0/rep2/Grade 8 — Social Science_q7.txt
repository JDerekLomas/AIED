Okay, let's break down the likely errors for the question: "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the context of Class 8 students in Indian government schools, mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English, and the common errors observed in other Social Science questions, here's an assessment:

1.  **Language Misunderstandings/Difficulty with English:**
    *   **"Contribute to the expansion":** This phrase might be slightly complex. Students might understand "Plassey" and "British power," but struggle to articulate the *causal link* or the *mechanism* of expansion. They might know it was important but not *how*.
    *   **Vocabulary:** Words like "dominance," "puppet," "nawab" (while a regional term, its specific meaning in this context might be vague), "establishment" might be challenging to use accurately in a sentence.

2.  **Social Science Misconceptions/Lack of Specific Knowledge:**
    *   **Chronological Recall:** While 1757 and Plassey might be known, the *consequences* beyond "British won" could be fuzzy. Many students might know *that* the British won, but not *what that victory specifically enabled*.
    *   **Focus on Military Aspect only:** Students might simply state "British won the battle" or "British defeated Siraj-ud-Daulah," without linking it to political control or economic gains. They might view it purely as a military event, not a political turning point.
    *   **Vague understanding of "British Power":** They might equate "British power" with general colonial rule, rather than understanding the *specific shift* that Plassey initiated (from trading company to political ruler in Bengal).
    *   **Limited understanding of "puppet nawab" concept:** Even if they remember Mir Jafar, the *significance* of him being a puppet – the actual transfer of control – might not be clear.
    *   **Lack of Depth:** The rubric requires explaining *how* it led to dominance/control. Many might just state *that* it did, without the "how" (e.g., placing a puppet ruler, gaining revenue rights, weakening local resistance).

3.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **Attempt:** This question is a core historical event, so many will likely attempt it. Unlike the "lions on currency" question, Plassey is directly from their syllabus.
    *   **Failure in Attempt:** The attempt will likely be superficial, lacking the specific detail required by the rubric.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   "British won the Battle of Plassey." (Too general, doesn't explain *how* it expanded power).
    *   "British defeated Siraj-ud-Daulah." (Same as above).
    *   "It helped the British to rule India." (Vague, lacks specific mechanism).
    *   "British got more land." (Partially true, but not the primary *mechanism* of power expansion related to Plassey's immediate aftermath).
    *   "They became powerful." (Circular reasoning, doesn't explain *why*).
    *   "Empty Response" (Given the 29% average pass rate and errors for other questions, a significant number will still not attempt or provide irrelevant answers).
    *   Confusion with other battles or events.
    *   Statements about trade or resources without linking to political control.

**Why the Pass Rate Might Be Low for This Specific Rubric:**

The rubric is quite specific: "explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)."

*   Just saying "British won" or "British became powerful" won't fetch marks.
*   They need to connect the *victory* to *political dominance/control* *over Bengal*, ideally mentioning the *mechanism* like Mir Jafar as a puppet.
*   The "e.g." indicates that mentioning Mir Jafar is a strong indicator of understanding the mechanism. Without it, the "political dominance/control" explanation needs to be very clear.

Many students will likely have a general idea that Plassey was important for the British, but struggle to articulate the precise *political consequence* and the *mechanism* of control as specified in the rubric. Their understanding might be more akin to "British won, so they became rulers," which is too simplistic for full marks.

**Considering Previous Error Trends:**
*   "Empty Response" is common.
*   Vague, incomplete, or tangentially related answers are also common (e.g., "Asher' stand
