Let's break down the likely student responses to "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."

**Analysis of Potential Errors:**

1.  **Empty Response/No Attempt (Significant):**
    *   **Reasoning:** As seen in the provided examples, "Empty Response" is a very common issue across various Social Science questions. This could be due to:
        *   Lack of knowledge: Simply not knowing the answer.
        *   Lack of confidence: Fear of answering incorrectly.
        *   Time constraints: Prioritizing other questions.
        *   Language barrier: Even a seemingly simple question might be confusing if they don't fully grasp "mountain ranges" or "located in India" in context, leading to a blank.
    *   **Impact:** This will be a major contributor to incorrect answers.

2.  **Incorrect Mountain Ranges (Moderate to High):**
    *   **Misconceptions:**
        *   **Local vs. Major:** Students might name a local hill or a small range they are familiar with from their immediate surroundings, rather than a "major" one.
        *   **Confusion with Rivers/States/Cities:** They might confuse mountain ranges with other geographical features or political divisions. For example, writing "Ganga" (a river) or "Uttar Pradesh" (a state) instead of a mountain. This is a common pattern in general knowledge questions for younger students.
        *   **General Geographical Terminology:** Not fully understanding what a "mountain range" is (e.g., just writing "mountains" or "hills" without a specific name).
    *   **Language Misunderstandings:**
        *   "Major": They might not fully grasp the distinction between a "major" range and any small hill.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer Look:**
        *   "Ganga"
        *   "Delhi"
        *   "Trees"
        *   "Jungle"
        *   "God" (random word)

3.  **One Correct, One Incorrect (Moderate):**
    *   **Reasoning:** A student might recall one major range (Himalayas is very prominent and often taught early) but struggle to name a second. They might then either leave the second blank or fill it with an incorrect answer as described above.
    *   **Impact on Score:** Since the rubric gives 0.5 for *one* correct, this scenario would still lead to a "pass" on that specific part of the question. However, the overall question asks for "any two," implying the student might aim for two.

4.  **Spelling Errors (Minor to Moderate - might still be counted correct if decipherable):**
    *   **Reasoning:** Students from these backgrounds often have limited exposure to English spelling, especially for geographical terms.
    *   **Example:** "Himalays," "Aravli," "Vindyas."
    *   **Impact:** If the marker can understand it, it's often counted. If it's too far off, it might be marked incorrect. This is less likely to be the *primary* reason for a full incorrect, but could lead to borderline cases.

5.  **Language Barrier - Misinterpretation of "Name any two..." (Minor):**
    *   **Reasoning:** While "Name any two" is fairly direct, some students might just write "Mountains" twice, without specific names, due to a very basic interpretation or inability to recall specific names.
    *   **Impact:** This would be incorrect.

**What the Most Common Wrong Answer Would Look Like:**

Given the prevalence of "Empty Response" in other Social Science questions, the *most common* wrong answer for this question would likely be **"Empty Response"**.

If they attempt it but fail, common wrong answers would be:
*   Random common nouns (e.g., "trees," "animals")
*   Names of rivers, states, or cities (e.g., "Ganga," "Delhi")
*   Generic terms like "Hills" or "Mountains" without specific names.

**Estimating the Pass Rate:**

Let's consider the average pass rate of 29% for Social Science questions, along with the observed error patterns. This question is relatively factual and requires specific recall.

*   **Knowledge of Himalayas:** The Himalayas are globally recognized and are almost certainly covered in basic geography lessons in India. Many students will know this one.
*   **Knowledge of a Second Range:** Naming a second major range (Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats) might be harder for many, especially if their regional curriculum didn't emphasize them equally.

Given that the rubric states: "Names one correct mountain range (e.g., Himalayas,
