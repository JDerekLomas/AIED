Let's break down the likely errors for the question: "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the student profile (Class 6, Indian government schools, economically weaker sections, limited English, low average pass rate for Social Science questions):

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science:**

*   **Difficulty with "Natural Resources":** While "natural resources" might be a familiar term, students might struggle to recall *specific* examples, especially those found in a particular state like Rajasthan. Their general knowledge might be limited or not geographically specific. They might list general things like "trees" or "animals" without connecting them to Rajasthan's primary natural resources.
*   **Lack of Specific Geographical Knowledge (Rajasthan):** Students might know *some* natural resources, but linking them specifically to Rajasthan could be a challenge. They might list resources common to other parts of India, or simply generic ones.
*   **Difficulty with "Influence on Lives":** This requires a level of analytical thinking that Class 6 students, especially those with limited exposure, might struggle with. They need to connect the resource to a direct impact on daily life, economy, or culture. For example, knowing "water" is a resource is one thing, but explaining how its scarcity or availability influences agriculture, lifestyle, or migration is more complex.
*   **Overgeneralization or Vague Answers:** Even if they identify a resource, their explanation of its influence might be very vague ("it helps people") rather than concrete.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Mention" vs. "Explain":** While "mention" is straightforward, "explain how one of them influences the lives" is a more demanding task. The English phrasing might be a hurdle for students with limited proficiency. They might "mention" resources but fail to "explain" the influence due to language barriers in articulating complex ideas.
*   **Vocabulary:** Words like "influences" might be understood loosely, but articulating a coherent explanation in English could be difficult.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **Partial Attempt:** Students are likely to attempt the "mention two natural resources" part, as it's a recall-based task. However, the "explain how one of them influences the lives" part is where many will falter or provide inadequate answers.
*   **Empty Response:** Similar to the examples provided, a significant portion might leave it blank if they cannot recall any resources specific to Rajasthan or cannot formulate an explanation.
*   **Keyword Spotting but Misunderstanding:** They might pick up on "natural resources" and "Rajasthan" but then write something irrelevant or very generic.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **Listing generic resources:** "Trees, animals," "crops" (which are products, not natural resources in the same sense as minerals or water).
*   **Listing resources not specific to Rajasthan:** E.g., "coal" (while present, not as prominent as other resources like marble or water scarcity).
*   **Listing only one resource:** Failing to mention two.
*   **Mentioning two resources but failing to explain influence:** This would be a very common error. They might write "Water, Marble. Water is important." without elaboration.
*   **Vague explanation of influence:** "Water is important for life." "Marble is used for buildings." (Lacks depth on *how* it influences *lives* beyond basic utility).
*   **Local specific resources from their own region:** If they are not from Rajasthan, they might mention resources from their home state.
*   **"Empty Response":** A significant percentage will likely leave it blank, mirroring the trends from other difficult questions.
*   **Broken English/Grammatically incorrect explanations:** Even if they attempt an explanation, it might be difficult to understand.

**Considering the Rubric (Max score: 1):**

The rubric is quite generous – "Mentions two correct natural resources." If they just do this, they get the point. The "explain how one of them influences" part is implicitly tested through the *overall* correctness, but the primary bar for *scoring* seems to be mentioning two resources. This *significantly* changes the pass rate potential. If they only need to *mention two correct resources*, the task becomes much simpler.

Let's re-evaluate with the *strict interpretation* of the rubric which suggests the primary component for the score is mentioning two resources. The explanation is likely considered part of getting the *full* correct answer, but given a max score of 1, it implies that getting the resources right is paramount.

However, the question *asks* for an explanation, and typical rubrics for a single mark would expect a complete answer, or at least the most difficult part. Let
