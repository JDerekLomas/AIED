Let's break down the likely errors for the question: "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Misconceptions about Social Science:**
    *   **Lack of Specific Knowledge/Recall:** This is a factual recall question. Many students, especially those with limited resources or less effective teaching, might simply not remember specific features of the Harappan civilization, or they might confuse it with other ancient civilizations. They might know *of* Harappa, but not its urban planning details.
    *   **Generalization vs. Specificity:** Some might give very vague answers like "they had good cities" or "they planned well," which wouldn't meet the rubric's requirement for a "key feature."
    *   **Focus on Non-Urban Planning Aspects:** Students might remember other aspects of Harappan civilization (e.g., seals, agriculture, decline) and mistakenly try to incorporate those, rather than focusing specifically on urban planning.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Key Feature":** While "key feature" is fairly common, some students might struggle with identifying what makes something "key" or important in the context of urban planning.
    *   **"Urban Planning":** This term itself might be a stumbling block for some. They might understand "city" but "urban planning" as a concept might be less familiar, leading them to describe *any* feature of the civilization rather than specifically those related to how the city was designed.
    *   **English Proficiency:** The general low pass rate and "Empty Response" commonality suggest that even simple English phrasing can be a barrier. They might understand the general gist but struggle to articulate a correct answer in English.

3.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   Given the general trend of "Empty Response" in other Social Science questions, a significant number will likely not attempt or provide a completely irrelevant answer.
    *   Those who attempt might write something very brief, perhaps just a single word or phrase if they recall *something* but can't elaborate.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   **"Empty Response" / "Don't Know":** This is consistently high for difficult Social Science questions.
    *   **Vague Generalizations:** "They had good cities," "They built houses well."
    *   **Incorrectly Recalled Features:** Mentioning something from another civilization (e.g., Egyptian pyramids) or a non-urban planning feature of Harappa (e.g., "they grew crops," "they used seals").
    *   **Partial/Incomplete Phrases:** E.g., just "drainage" or "grid." This *could* be close to correct but might lack enough detail to score.

**Comparison with Other Questions:**

*   The pass rates for "colonial rule tribal communities" (9%), "lions on currency" (10%), and "Ashoka's reign" (12%) are very low. These questions require more extensive explanation or nuanced understanding.
*   "Harappan Civilization's urban planning" is a more straightforward factual recall question. If a student has studied it, the answer is relatively simple and concise. It doesn't require "explanation" in the same way the other questions do.

**Factors for Estimation:**

*   **Factual Recall:** Less complex than "explain how" questions.
*   **Specific Vocabulary:** "Urban planning" might be an issue.
*   **Concise Answer:** A single key feature is enough, reducing the writing burden.
*   **High "Empty Response" Probability:** Given the overall context.
*   **Average Pass Rate (29%):** This question is likely *easier* than the 9-12% questions, but *harder* than the average across all subjects, especially considering it's Social Science.

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

I would expect this question to perform better than the very low 9-12% Social Science examples, primarily because it asks for a *single key feature* which is a direct recall. However, it's still a specific historical detail from a subject area where students struggle with detailed recall and articulation in English.

Given the rubric allows for multiple correct answers (grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town), students have a few chances if they recall *any* of these. The most likely successful students will remember the "drainage system" or "grid pattern."

Considering the average pass rate of 29% and the difficulty of Social Science, but the relative simplicity of the required answer, I'd place it slightly below the average but significantly above the listed very hard Social Science questions.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **20%**
