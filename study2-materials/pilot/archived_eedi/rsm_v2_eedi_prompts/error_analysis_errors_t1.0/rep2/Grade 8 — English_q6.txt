Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

## Analysis of Likely Errors for "Define fable."

Given the context (Class 8, Indian government schools, economically weaker sections, limited English, low pass rates on similar questions):

**1. Misconceptions about English/Academic Terms:**

*   **Literal Translation/Word Association:** Students might recognize "story" but struggle with "define." They might think of *any* story. "Fable" itself is likely a new or unfamiliar academic term. They might try to connect it to a similar-sounding Hindi word (though "कहानी" (kahani) is story, there isn't a directly similar sound for fable).
*   **Difficulty with Abstraction:** "Define" requires an abstract explanation, not just naming an example. This is a common struggle.
*   **Grammar/Sentence Structure:** Even if they know parts of the definition, constructing a grammatically correct sentence or two to express it will be a major hurdle. They might use fragments, incorrect verb tenses, or struggle with subject-verb agreement.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Define":** This word itself might be problematic. They might interpret it as "give an example of" or "tell about a fable you know," rather than asking for its characteristics. This is a common interpretation for students who struggle with academic vocabulary.
*   **"Fable":** Many might not know what a "fable" is at all, especially if their exposure to English literature is limited to textbooks and simplified stories. The concept of a *moral lesson* embedded in a story with *animal characters* might be entirely new or not explicitly taught/reinforced.

**3. Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**

*   **Non-Attempt (Empty Response):** Given the very low pass rates on "Describe the poet's writing style" (4%) and "Write a theme or central idea" (5%), where "Empty Response" is a prominent wrong answer, it's highly probable that many students will simply not attempt this question if they don't recognize the word "fable" or understand "define." This will be a significant chunk of responses.
*   **Attempt and Fail:** Some might attempt to answer, but their understanding of "fable" will be vague, or their English too limited to express it clearly.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

Based on the errors described:

*   **Empty Response:** This will likely be the most common single wrong answer.
*   **Literal/Vague Translation:**
    *   "Fable is story." (Too simplistic, missing key elements)
    *   "Fable is a good story." (Lacks specificity)
    *   "It is a story book."
*   **Giving an Example (Misinterpreting "Define"):**
    *   "The fox and the grapes." (Or another well-known fable)
    *   "It's like Panchatantra stories." (If they know the equivalent in their local language)
*   **Partial/Incorrect Definition:**
    *   "Fable is a story about animals." (Missing moral)
    *   "Fable is a story with a lesson." (Missing animal characters, or could be any moral story)
    *   "Fable is a short story." (Too general)
*   **Grammatically Incorrect/Incoherent Attempts:**
    *   "Fable a story animal give moral."
    *   "Fable means a animal talk story."
    *   "Fable story small animals."

## Estimation of Pass Rate

Let's break down the student population:

*   **Students who genuinely know "fable" and can define it in English:** This group will be very small. Even if they know the *concept*, translating it precisely into English is another hurdle.
*   **Students who vaguely know "fable" but struggle with English expression:** They might get one part of the definition (e.g., animals or moral) but miss the other, or fail to articulate it clearly. This leads to a partial/incorrect answer.
*   **Students who misunderstand "define" and give an example:** This is a common error pattern.
*   **Students who have no idea what "fable" means:** This will lead to an empty response or a completely unrelated answer.

Considering the very low pass rates on similar abstract/definition questions (4-10%) and the specific challenges of "define" and "fable":

*   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (4%) - Requires abstract thinking and specific vocabulary.
*   "Write a theme or central idea of the poem." (5%) - Requires abstract thinking and synthesis.
*   "Write a short paragraph... My Favourite
