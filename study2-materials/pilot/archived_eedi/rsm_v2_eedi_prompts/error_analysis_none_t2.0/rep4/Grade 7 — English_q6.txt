Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

Given the student demographic (economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate 29%):

*   **Understanding "Describes":** Many students might grasp this partially, knowing it means "tells about" or "gives information." However, the nuance of *describing a quality or characteristic* might be missed, leading to descriptive but irrelevant answers.

*   **Understanding "Poet's writing style":** This is the core challenge.
    *   **"Poet":** Relatively well-understood as the person who writes poems.
    *   **"Writing style":** This is likely the biggest stumbling block.
        *   **Lexical Gap:** Many might not have a direct equivalent for "writing style" in their mother tongue, or their English vocabulary for *analytical literary terms* would be extremely limited. They might understand "how they write" but struggle to articulate it using appropriate English adjectives.
        *   **Confusion with "Poem's Topic/Theme":** A very common error will be describing *what the poem is about* rather than *how it is written*. Students are more used to extracting themes or main ideas.
        *   **Confusion with "Poet's Feelings/Opinions":** They might describe what the poet feels or thinks, instead of how they *write*.
        *   **Confusion with "Difficulty of Poem":** Some might say the poem is "easy" or "hard" to understand, mistaking readability for style.
        *   **Confusion with "Length of Poem/Poet's Life":** Extreme long-shots, but possible from very confused students.

*   **"Suitable and Relevant Word":** Even if they get the concept of "writing style" partially, choosing a *single, precise adjective* for it is hard. They might write short phrases, sentences, or highly subjective opinions.

*   **Vocabulary Limitations:** Even if they want to describe style, the specific vocabulary needed (simple, descriptive, informal, direct, vivid, evocative, metaphorical, rhythmic, structured, complex) is likely beyond their grasp for *productive use*. They might only know very basic adjectives like "good," "bad," "nice," "beautiful."

**Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**

*   **Attempt Rate: High.** These students are generally taught to attempt all questions, even if they don't fully understand. There's usually a cultural emphasis on writing *something*.
*   **Success Rate on Attempt: Low.** The conceptual barrier ("writing style") and the linguistic barrier (suitable vocabulary) are significant.

**What would the most common wrong answer look like?**

1.  **Describes the content/theme of the poem:**
    *   "The poem is about nature."
    *   "The poet writes about sad things."
    *   "It tells about trees."
    *   "The style is telling a story." (Ambiguous, might sometimes get credit depending on how strictly "style" is interpreted, but more likely descriptive of content/genre).

2.  **Describes the *poem* itself, not the poet's style (or conflates the two):**
    *   "The poem is beautiful." (Evaluative, not descriptive of style)
    *   "The poem is long/short."
    *   "It is easy to understand." (Closer, but "easy style" is better than "easy poem")
    *   "It makes me happy."

3.  **Attempts to describe the poet's feeling/intentions:**
    *   "The poet wants us to love nature."
    *   "He feels happy."

4.  **Uses general, non-specific adjectives (even if applied to the "style"):**
    *   "Good style."
    *   "Nice style."

5.  **Rephrasing the question or just stating "style":**
    *   "The poet's writing style." (No description)
    *   "It describes his style of writing."

**Likely Pass Rate Estimation:**

Considering the average pass rate is 29% for general questions, and this question demands a more nuanced understanding of literary terms and specific vocabulary, it will be significantly harder.

*   **Understanding "Writing Style":** This is the major hurdle. Most will interpret it as "what the poet writes about" or "how they feel," or simply won't know what it means.
*   **Finding a "Suitable and Relevant Word":** Even if they grasp the concept, their vocabulary for stylistic descriptors is limited. They might choose "good" or "nice" which are too generic.
