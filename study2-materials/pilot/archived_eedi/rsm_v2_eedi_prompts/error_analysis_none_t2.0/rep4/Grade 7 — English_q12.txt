Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the student profile (Class 7, Indian government schools, economically weaker sections, limited English, 29% average pass rate), this question presents several hurdles.

**1. Language Misunderstandings (English Specifics for Voice):**

*   **Difficulty identifying subject, verb, and object:** Many students might not firmly grasp these grammatical concepts, especially when combined with a relatively simple sentence. "Wind" (subject), "blew" (verb), "the leaves" (object), "away" (adverbial particle) – breaking this down analytically would be tough.
*   **Lack of exposure to "voice" as a grammatical concept:** "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" are abstract grammatical terms. Even if taught, without consistent practice and deep understanding, students may not recall what they mean or how to apply the transformation rules. They might understand "present tense," "past tense," etc., but "voice" is more complex.
*   **Understanding "to be" + Past Participle:** This is the core of passive voice formation.
    *   **Knowing the Past Participle ("blown"):** Students might struggle with irregular verbs. They know "blow," "blew," but "blown" might be forgotten or misremembered as "blewed" or another incorrect form. This is a common error even at higher levels.
    *   **Choosing the correct form of "to be" ("were"):** This depends on identifying the new subject ("the leaves" - plural) and recognizing the original tense (past, so "were" not "are"). This requires simultaneous recognition of plurality and tense, which can be challenging. Many might default to "is" or "was."
*   **Understanding "by + agent":** While often optional in general passive voice, it's expected here. Students might omit it, or place it incorrectly.

**2. Misconceptions About English/Sentence Structure:**

*   **Confusion between tenses and voice:** Some might interpret "change voice" as "change tense." They might transform the sentence into present tense or future tense passive voice, or simply change the tense while staying in active voice.
*   **Simple word swapping:** Students might think it's just about reversing the word order without the grammatical changes required. E.g., "The leaves blew the wind away." This shows an attempt but a fundamental misunderstanding of grammatical transformation.
*   **Prepositional phrase errors:** They might use incorrect prepositions or omit them entirely.

**3. Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**

*   **Not Attempt at All (Low Probability for "no attempt," High for "blank"):** A small number might leave it completely blank due to overwhelming confusion. However, based on an average pass rate of 29%, it's more likely they *attempt* something, even if wrong, rather than just leave it blank unless the question seems entirely incomprehensible.
*   **Attempt but Fail (High Probability):** Most students would likely try to answer, often leading to common wrong answers.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **"The leaves blew the wind away."** (Simple word reversal, shows no understanding of passive voice mechanism).
*   **"The leaves was blew away by the wind."** (Incorrect "to be" verb for plural subject, incorrect past participle) - this is actually two common errors, but plausible for a single answer.
*   **"The leaves were blow away by the wind."** (Correct "to be" and subject, but incorrect past participle of 'blow').
*   **"The leaves are blown away by the wind."** (Correct structure, but incorrect tense – misidentifying the original tense or confusing it with habitual action).
*   **"The leaves was blown away by the wind."** (Incorrect singular "was" for plural "leaves," but correct "blown"). This might be a very common error due to difficulty with subject-verb agreement in complex structures.
*   **"The leaves blew away by the wind."** (Missing "to be" verb, fundamentally misunderstanding the auxiliary verb requirement).
*   **"The wind blows the leaves away."** (Changing tense, but not voice, or changing voice but staying active - indicating confusion about the instruction).
*   **Missing "by the wind":** "The leaves were blown away." (Grammatically correct passive, but might be marked down for not fully converting all elements if the rubric is strict on "by the agent").

**Likely Thought Process and Obstacles for Students:**

1.  **Read "Change from Active Voice to Passive Voice":** Many might not even fully register what "Active Voice" or "Passive Voice" means, or how to identify them. They might recognize
