Let's break down how Class 6 students in Indian government schools from economically weaker sections might approach and answer this question.

**Analysis of Potential Errors:**

1.  **Misconceptions about Social Science / Lack of Specific Knowledge (Most Significant):**
    *   **What are "Natural Resources"?** While a basic definition might be known ("things from nature"), many students might struggle to concretely identify *specific examples* relevant to Rajasthan. Their understanding might be very generic (e.g., "trees," "animals") rather than geologically or economically significant ones.
    *   **Specific Knowledge of Rajasthan:** This is the biggest hurdle. Even if they understand "natural resources," knowing what resources are *specifically* found in Rajasthan is a matter of geography and local knowledge that might not be consistently taught or retained at this level, especially for students outside Rajasthan or with limited exposure.
        *   They might name resources found *anywhere* in India, not specifically Rajasthan (e.g., "coal" even though Rajasthan has limited coal).
        *   They might name agricultural products (e.g., "wheat," "millets") but struggle to connect them back to "natural resources" in a broader sense, especially if they haven't explicitly learned this classification.
    *   **Understanding "Influence on Lives":** Even if they identify a resource, articulating *how* it influences lives requires a slightly higher-order thinking skill and vocabulary. They might say "people use it" without explaining the economic, social, or daily life impact (e.g., "marble is used for building" vs. "marble quarrying provides jobs, brings wealth to families, and marble buildings are common in homes and temples"). Their explanation might be too simplistic or repetitive.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings (Moderate to Significant):**
    *   **"Natural Resources":** The term itself, if not regularly used and reinforced in Hindi/local language, could be a barrier. They might know "प्राकृतिक संसाधन" but struggle with its direct application.
    *   **"Influences the Lives of the people":** "Influences" (प्रभावित करता है) is a somewhat abstract concept. They might understand "uses" better than "influences."
    *   **General English Comprehension:** For students with limited English, decoding the entire sentence can be challenging. They might grasp parts of it but miss nuances, especially in the "explain how one of them influences" part. They might just list resources and stop.

3.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **Attempt:** Most students will likely attempt this question because it seems "easy" on the surface (listing two things). However, the quality of the attempt will vary widely.
    *   **Partial Attempt:** Many might correctly identify 1-2 generic natural resources (like "water," "sand," "sunlight" – the most obvious ones) but fail the "Rajasthan" specificity. Many will struggle significantly with the "explain influence" part, offering very rudimentary or irrelevant explanations.
    *   **No Attempt:** Only a very small percentage would leave it entirely blank, likely due to complete incomprehension of the question or feeling utterly lost.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   **Generic natural resources, not specific to Rajasthan:**
        *   "Trees, animals"
        *   "Coal, iron" (common pan-India resources but not primary for Rajasthan)
        *   "Water, soil" (too generic without qualification for Rajasthan's scarcity)
    *   **Agricultural products confused with resources:**
        *   "Wheat, Bajra"
        *   "Cotton"
    *   **Listing resources but failing explanation:**
        *   "Water, sand. People use water." (No real explanation of influence).
    *   **Incorrect resources + no explanation.**
    *   **Single correct resource listed, but no second, and/or weak explanation.**

**Applying Rubric and Estimating Pass Rate:**

The rubric is strict: "Mentions *two* correct natural resources... explain how *one* of them influences." Even a slightly incorrect resource or a weak explanation could lead to 0 marks.

*   **Identifying Two Correct Resources (Specific to Rajasthan):** This is the biggest filter. Many might get one (water, sand/desert), but getting a second *correct* one like Marble, Copper, Gypsum, Solar/Wind energy requires specific knowledge.
*   **Explaining Influence:** This part will further thin the numbers. A basic explanation might pass, but if it's too vague, it might fail.

Considering the challenges:
*   **English Language:** This is a Class 6 question in an English exam context for students with limited English. Even knowing the answer in Hindi might not translate to a correct English response.
