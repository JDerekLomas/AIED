Let's break down the likely student experience with this question.

**Target Audience Considerations:**

*   **Class 6 Indian Government School Students:** This is a crucial context.
    *   **Economically Weaker Sections:** Often implies limited exposure to English outside school. Resources at home (books, internet, educated family members) are likely scarce.
    *   **Limited English Proficiency:** This is the core challenge. They've likely been introduced to basic sentence structure, but mastery is far from guaranteed. Grammatical nuances, tenses, and complex vocabulary are stumbling blocks.
    *   **"Average pass rate about 29%":** This general pass rate for other questions gives us a benchmark for the overall academic standard and English proficiency. A rearrange-the-words question might be slightly easier than answering content-based questions in English, but it still requires some grasp of grammar.

**Analysis of Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Fundamental Lack of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) Understanding:**
    *   **Misconception:** English grammar rules are not firmly entrenched. They might not understand the basic need for a subject, followed by a verb, followed by an object/complement. They might be more comfortable with word order patterns from their native languages, which might differ.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** The words themselves are simple ("he," "is," "reading," "a," "book"). The misunderstanding is at the *structural* level of the sentence, not individual word meaning.
    *   **Attempt vs. Not Attempt:** They will almost certainly *attempt* this. It's a "rearrange" task, implying they just need to move words, not generate new content or complex ideas. It looks approachable.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer Look:**
        *   **Random Listing:** `book reading a is he` (just writing the words in any order, maybe the order given)
        *   **Partial SVO:** They might get the `reading a book` part but not know what to do with "he" and "is." Or vice versa.
        *   **Verb Confusion:** Placing the main verb ("reading") at the beginning or end.
        *   **Native Language Influence:** Trying to force a word order similar to Hindi/regional languages, where verbs might appear later.

2.  **Confusion with "is":**
    *   **Misconception:** "is" is a tricky little word. While basic, some might struggle to place it correctly as an auxiliary verb, or might confuse it with other "be" forms if they are learning about verb tenses.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** Not understanding its function as part of the present continuous tense (`is + -ing verb`).
    *   **Attempt vs. Not Attempt:** Will attempt.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer Look:**
        *   `He reading a book is` (Common SVO error influenced by some native languages, or just not knowing where "is" goes after the subject).
        *   `Is he reading a book` (Forming a question inadvertently).

3.  **Missing "a":**
    *   **Misconception:** Articles (a, an, the) are notoriously difficult for ESL learners, especially those whose native languages don't have direct equivalents. They might view "a" as redundant.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** Not understanding the countability of "book" and the requirement for an indefinite article.
    *   **Attempt vs. Not Attempt:** They would attempt and likely just omit "a."
    *   **Common Wrong Answer Look:** `He is reading book.`

4.  **Minor Swaps/Close Attempts:**
    *   Some might get very close but mix up two words, for instance: `He is a reading book.` or `He is book reading a.` This shows a partial understanding of the SVO structure.

**Overall Impression:**

This question relies on a very fundamental understanding of English sentence structure (SVO). While the words are simple, mastering this structure can still be challenging. The high general failure rate (29% average pass) suggests a significant portion of students will lack this basic grammatical understanding.

*   Students who recognize "He" as the subject will have a strong start.
*   Those who then connect "is reading" will be further ahead.
*   Placing "a book" after that requires solid SVO recognition.

The good news is it's a fill-in-the-blanks type of task rather than generative writing, so fewer spelling/grammar errors (beyond word order) will be penalized. They have all the words they need.

**Let's think about the tiers of students:**

*   **Top tier (already understanding SVO):** They'll
