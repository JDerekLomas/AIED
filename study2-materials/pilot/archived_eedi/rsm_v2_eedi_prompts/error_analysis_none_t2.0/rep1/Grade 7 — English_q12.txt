Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

Given the student profile (Class 7, Indian government schools, economically weaker sections, limited English, 29% average pass rate), this question presents several hurdles beyond just understanding passive voice.

1.  **Fundamental Lack of Understanding of Active/Passive Voice:**
    *   Many students, even if introduced to the concept, might not have grasped the core transformation from "doer-action-receiver" to "receiver-action-doer."
    *   They might confuse it with other grammatical transformations like direct/indirect speech or tenses.

2.  **Verb Conjugation (Past Participle - V3):**
    *   This is a HUGE barrier. The past participle of "blow" is "blown." Students commonly struggle with irregular verbs.
    *   **Common Error:** Using "blew" (V2) or "blow" (V1) instead of "blown" (V3).
        *   "The leaves were **blew** away by the wind."
        *   "The leaves were **blow** away by the wind."

3.  **Tense Mismatch:**
    *   The original sentence is in Simple Past ("blew"). The passive voice must maintain this tense.
    *   **Common Error:** Using the wrong form of "to be."
        *   "The leaves **are** blown away by the wind." (Present instead of Past)
        *   "The leaves **is** blown away by the wind." (Grammatical error and tense mismatch)
        *   "The leaves **was** blown away by the wind." (Subject-verb agreement error with "leaves")

4.  **Identifying Subject and Object:**
    *   Students might incorrectly identify "the wind" as the subject to be made the passive subject, or fail to move "the leaves" to the subject position.
    *   **Common Error:** Attempting to manipulate the sentence without a clear understanding of subject/object shift.
        *   "The wind was blown by the leaves away." (Confusing agency)

5.  **Placement of "by the wind":**
    *   While technically optional, the "by phrase" is crucial for a complete understanding and expected in early passive voice exercises. Some students might forget or incorrectly place it.
    *   **Common Error:** "The leaves were blown away wind." (Missing "by")
    *   **Less Common, but possible:** Incorrect word order with "by the wind."

6.  **"Away" as a Particle Verb/Adverb:**
    *   The "away" is part of the verb phrase "blew away." Students might struggle to keep it with the verb.
    *   **Common Error:** Omitting "away" or misplacing it.
        *   "The leaves were blown by the wind." (Loss of nuance, though closer)
        *   "The leaves were blown by the wind away." (Awkward placement)

7.  **Vocabulary/Sentence Comprehension (Initial understanding):**
    *   "Wind," "blew," "leaves," "away" are relatively simple words for Class 7. So, initial comprehension of the *active* sentence itself is probably not the main barrier, but it could add a layer for some struggling students.

**Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**

*   **Most will attempt:** Given it's a grammar transformation, students are usually encouraged to try. They might write *something*.
*   **A significant portion will fail badly:** Many attempts will be completely incorrect or demonstrate severe misconceptions.
*   **Some might not attempt:** If they have absolutely no idea what "active voice to passive voice" means, they might leave it blank, but I'd expect attempts over blanks.

**What would the most common wrong answer look like?**

Based on the identified errors:

1.  **"The leaves were blew away by the wind."** (Incorrect V3 - most common)
2.  **"The leaves are blown away by the wind."** (Tense error - very common)
3.  **"The leaves was blown away by the wind."** (Subject-verb agreement error with tense error potential)
4.  **"The wind was blown by the leaves away."** (Completely misunderstood roles)
5.  **"The leaves blew away by the wind."** (Missing "were," demonstrating a lack of passive voice structure)
6.  **"The leaves blow away by the wind."** (Missing "were" and incorrect V3)

**Overall Impact on Pass Rate:**

Considering the multiple potential points of failure (V3
