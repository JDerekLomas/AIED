Let's break down the likely errors for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, primarily from an economically weaker section, attempting to answer "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Limited Geographical Knowledge/Exposure:**
    *   Many students might not have traveled widely or even seen a significant hill/mountain beyond their immediate vicinity, unless they live near one.
    *   Mapping skills and understanding of geographical features might be underdeveloped. They might have seen maps, but not fully connected them to the real world or understood the scale of a "mountain range."
    *   Focus on **state-level geography:** Their knowledge might be more confined to their own state's prominent features rather than national-level mountain ranges. They might know local hills but not categorize them as "ranges" or "major" on a national scale.
    *   **Overgeneralization:** They might simply name a nearby hill or a famous religious hill, not understanding "range."

2.  **Confusing with Rivers or Plateaus:**
    *   Rivers and mountains are often taught together. A student might get confused and name a major river (Ganga, Yamuna, Narmada) instead of a mountain range. Both are "natural features."
    *   They might name a famous plateau (Deccan Plateau) which also sounds like a significant geographical feature.

3.  **Specific vs. General Terms:**
    *   While "Himalayas" is well-known, they might struggle to recall other specific mountain ranges like Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, or the Ghats, especially if these aren't as prominent in their region's curriculum or public discourse.
    *   They might use generic terms like "Pahad" (mountain) or "Parvat" without specifying a range.

4.  **Misconceptions about "Major":**
    *   "Major" might be interpreted subjectively. For a child from the plains, even a prominent hill could be considered "major."

**Language Misunderstandings:**

1.  **"Mountain Ranges":**
    *   The term "range" might be confusing. They might understand "mountain" (पहाड़/पर्वत) but not the concept of a "range" as a series of connected mountains. This could lead to them naming just "Mount Everest" (which isn't *in* India and is a peak, not a range) or another singular peak they've heard of.
    *   The English term might be unfamiliar if geography is primarily taught in a regional language, and direct translation might lose nuance.

**Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**

*   **Most students would attempt:** This is a direct recall question, and they would likely have heard *something* related to mountains. Even if they don't know the "right" answer, they'll likely write down a geographical feature they've heard of. Blank answers are less probable for such a straightforward recall question.
*   **Failure often due to misidentification rather than inability to recall *any* geographical feature.**

**Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **Himalayas (only one listed):** The most common correct partial answer. If they stop at one, they get 0.5. But if they only know one, and try to think of a second, they might name an incorrect one.
*   **Rivers:** Ganga, Yamuna, Narmada, Brahmaputra.
*   **Plateaus:** Deccan Plateau, Chota Nagpur Plateau.
*   **Famous Religious Hills/Peaks:** Vaishno Devi Hill, Mount Abu (correct but usually thought of as a place), Kedarnath/Badrinath (sites, not ranges).
*   **Foreign Mountains/Peaks:** Mount Everest (misconception of being in India or of a peak being a range).
*   **Generic "Pahad" / "Parvat"** (mountains in general).
*   **Specific local hills/smaller hills (e.g., local state-specific hills that are not major national ranges).**
*   **Mixing up:** Himalayas and then Ganga (one correct, one incorrect).

**Rubric Consideration:** "Names one correct mountain range... Max score: 0.5"

This means even if they write one correct and one incorrect, they still get 0.5 if one of them is valid. The hurdle is identifying *any* correct range.

**Estimating the Pass Rate (getting 0.5 score):**

Considering the average pass rate for all subjects is 29%, let's adjust for this specific question.

1.  **Himalayas:** A large majority will know the Himalayas. It's universally taught and discussed. So, if they write just "Himalayas
