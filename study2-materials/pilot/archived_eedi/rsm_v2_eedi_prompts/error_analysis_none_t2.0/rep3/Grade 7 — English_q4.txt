Let's break down the potential student experience with this question.

**Target Students:** Class 7, Indian government schools, mostly economically weaker sections, limited English proficiency. Average pass rate ~29%.

**Question:** Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason.
**Rubric:** The king wanted to answer (based on the reading passage) the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with. Any valid reason. Max score: 1

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **"Do you think..." - Misinterpreting Subjectivity vs. Objective Comprehension:**
    *   Many students, especially those learning English and in a more rote-learning focused environment, might struggle with the "Do *you* think" aspect. They are used to extracting information directly from the text.
    *   They might interpret it as "Is the king important in real life?" (Confusing the questions with the king himself).
    *   Some might feel pressured to agree/disagree without genuinely understanding why, or provide a generic, context-less answer.

2.  **Vocabulary Gaps:**
    *   **"Important":** While a common word, "important *in real life*" might be slightly more abstract than just "important." They might grasp "important" but not fully the "real life" context, linking it to the story only.
    *   **"Reason":** Many might struggle to articulate *a reason* in English, even if they grasp the concept. They might state the king's questions again (e.g., "The king asked what is the right time") instead of giving a *why* they are important.
    *   Less common, but possible: misunderstanding "king's questions" – some might just think "questions" generally. However, context from a preceding passage about "The Three Questions" would likely clarify this.

3.  **Syntactic/Grammar Challenges:**
    *   Formulating a coherent, grammatically correct sentence for "one reason" will be a significant hurdle. They might use fragments, incorrect verb tenses, or mixed-up word order.
    *   Example: "Yes king question good for life." (Understands the gist but poor syntax).
    *   "King want know right time." (Restates a fact, doesn't give a reason *why* it's important).

4.  **Connecting "King's Questions" to "Real Life":**
    *   The leap from a historical/fictional king's pursuit of wisdom to its *relevance today* or *for an individual's life* requires a degree of abstract thinking and generalization that is challenging for students with limited exposure to such analytical questions in English.
    *   They might understand the king's goal but fail to connect it to its broader human relevance.
    *   They may simply regurgitate parts of the story (e.g., "Because the king wanted to know what time is best to do everything"), which partially answers the "what" but not necessarily the "why it's important."

5.  **Passage Dependence:**
    *   If the preceding passage about "The Three Questions" strongly emphasizes the answers found (the present moment, love everyone, do good), students might simply state one of those *answers* as the "reason" without explicitly linking it to the *importance* of the *questions*.
    *   E.g., "Yes, because we should live in the present." (This is a valid deduction but might not be phrased as directly addressing the *importance of the questions*).

**Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**

*   **Attempt and Fail (Most Common):** Given it's a "yes/no" part and then a "give one reason," most will likely attempt the "yes/no" part. They'll almost certainly try to write something for the "reason." They might get "yes" right but then provide an insufficient or grammatically poor reason.
*   **Not Attempt at all (Less Common for the "reason" part, but still possible):** If they entirely fail to understand "important" or "reason," or feel their English is too poor to articulate anything, they might leave the reason blank. They might still mark "Yes" or "No."

**What would the most common wrong answer look like?**

1.  **Partially correct answer lacking clarity or complete reasoning:**
    *   "Yes. King want know right time." (Restates a question, not a reason for its importance).
    *   "Yes. These are good questions." (Lacks specific reasoning).
    *   "Yes. To live happy." (
