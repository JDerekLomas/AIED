Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

**1. Misconceptions about Mathematics:**

*   **Difficulty with time calculation (Elapsed time):** This is the single biggest mathematical hurdle.
    *   **Common error: Subtracting the numbers directly (e.g., 4 - 10 = -6 or 10 - 4 = 6, but not understanding am/pm conversion).** They might think 10 am to 4 pm is just 4 hours (4 - 10) or struggle with the transition over noon.
    *   **Miscounting on fingers:** They might count 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 and get 7 hours, forgetting 10 AM is the *start*. (11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 = 6 hours).
    *   **Treating 12 like 0 or 100:** Confusing the 12-hour clock with base-10 arithmetic.
    *   **Missing the AM/PM distinction:** Just thinking of 10 and 4 as absolute numbers.
*   **Simple Multiplication Error:** Once they get the hours, they might miscalculate `X` * `2`. For a multiplication by 2, this is less common but still possible, especially if their elapsed time calculation is incorrect, leading to a larger multiplication they aren't confident with.
*   **Simple Addition Error:** Adding `30 + (increase)` might be challenging for some, particularly if they are under time pressure or stressed.
*   **Order of Operations/Steps:** Not realizing they need to find elapsed time first, then multiply, then add. Some might try to add `30 + 2` and then multiply by the hours (wrong).

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"per hour":** While relatively straightforward, "per" might be subtly misinterpreted as "for one hour only" or confused with other prepositions.
*   **"increases by":** Could be confused with "decreases by" (though less likely here as the numbers align with a common sense increase in heat during the day).
*   **"At 10 am... at 4:00 in the evening":** This is the core language difficulty related to the math problem. The *concept* of AM/PM and elapsed time between them is not just math; it's cultural understanding of how time is expressed. "In the evening" specifically implies PM.
*   **General Comprehension:** The length of the question might be intimidating, especially for students with limited English exposure. They might miss keywords and rely on numbers they recognize.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **Attempt:** Most students will attempt this. It involves simple numbers and an explicit question "what will be the temperature." There's no complex geometry or abstract reasoning. They'll try to do something with the numbers 10, 30, 2, and 4.
*   **Failure:** A high proportion will attempt but fail due to the mathematical and language issues outlined above, particularly with calculating elapsed time correctly.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

Let's assume the correct elapsed time is 6 hours:
*   `30 + 2 = 32^0 C` (Assuming only one hour passes or not multiplying by hours)
*   `30 + (4 - 10) * 2 = 30 + (-6) * 2 = 30 - 12 = 18^0 C` (Direct subtraction of numbers, misinterpreting am/pm as irrelevant)
*   `30 + (10 - 4) * 2 = 30 + 6 * 2 = 42^0 C` (Correct multiplication/addition, but derived from incorrect "10-4" elapsed time reasoning)
*   **Incorrect elapsed time leads to wrong answer:**
    *   If elapsed time is `4` hours (assuming 10 am to 2 pm, or similar): `30 + (4 * 2) = 38^0 C`
    *   If elapsed time is `7` hours (10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, a common counting error): `30 + (7 * 2) = 44^0 C`
    *   If elapsed time is `5` hours: `30 + (5 * 2) = 40^0 C`
    *   If they only count PM hours (4 hours):
