Let's break down the potential student experience with this question.

**Target Audience:** Class 7 students, Indian government schools, mostly economically weaker sections, limited English proficiency. Average pass rate ~29% on general exams.

**The Question:** "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."
**Rubric:** Mentions "right time to do everything, right thing to do, right people to work with" or "any valid reason."

---

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

**1. Misunderstanding Key English Words/Phrases:**

*   **"King's questions":** Students might not immediately link this to the core questions the king was seeking answers for (right time, right people, right thing). They might interpret it more broadly as "questions *from* the king" without understanding the *content* of those questions. Some might think of *any* question the king might ask.
*   **"Important in real life":**
    *   **"Important":** They generally understand "important," but the nuance of "important *in real life*" might be slightly missed. They might focus more on "important for the king" from the story, rather than transferring it to their own context.
    *   **"Real life":** Could be confused with "realistic" or "true" as opposed to "fictional/story context." They might not make the jump to general human relevance.
*   **"Give one reason":** This phrase is relatively common, but providing a *reason* that directly addresses the "importance in real life" and links to the king's actual questions will be the challenge.

**2. Language Misunderstandings (Syntactic & Semantic):**

*   **"Do you think...?"**: This requires an opinion. Students accustomed to fact-recall questions might struggle to formulate a personal opinion *and then justify it*. They might simply parrot something from the text related to the king.
*   **Difficulty with sentence construction for a nuanced answer:** Even if they grasp the concept, framing it in coherent English will be a major hurdle. Their typical answers might be very brief, grammatically clunky, or only partially convey the meaning.
*   **Confusion with the source text:** The *pre-requisite* is that they've understood the king's central dilemma in the story. If they struggled with the story itself due to vocabulary or plot complexity, this question will be impossible.

**3. Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**

*   **Attempt:** Most will likely attempt it, as "Yes" or "No" is a low barrier start. The instruction to "give one reason" usually prompts *some* kind of follow-up, even if it's very brief or incorrect. It's an "opinion" question, which can sometimes feel more approachable than complex factual recall for those with weaker understanding, as it *seems* to have no single "right" answer.
*   **Failure:** The majority of attempts will likely fail due to the issues listed above.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **Simple "Yes" or "No" without a reason (0 marks).**
*   **"Yes. King is powerful." / "Yes. King wanted to know."** (Shows understanding of the story's context, but not the *relevance* of the questions themselves, or connecting it to "real life.")
*   **"Yes. Right time important." / "Yes. We need right people."** (Partial credit possible, depending on stringency. This answer indicates they've recognized *one* of the king's core questions but haven't explicitly linked it to *why it's important for everyone* or for "real life.") This is likely the *closest* they'll get to a correct answer without quite hitting the rubric's expectation fully.
*   **"Yes. To live better." / "Yes. To make good decisions."** (This *could* be considered valid, especially if phrased clearly, but for the average student, the phrasing will likely be too simplistic or ungrammatical to receive full credit. It shows a connection to personal benefit but might miss the nuance of the *types* of decisions the king was considering).
*   **Grammatically incomprehensible answers:** Attempts at expressing an opinion that are too muddled by poor sentence structure and vocabulary to discern the intended meaning.

**Why a low pass rate is expected:**

*   **Abstract Thinking:** Linking the specific questions of a fictional king to universal human importance ("real life") requires an abstract leap.
*   **Opinion Formulation & Justification:** These students are often less practiced in expressing and supporting personal opinions in English.
*   **Synthesizing Information:** They need to recall the *nature* of the king's questions from
