Let's break down the potential performance of Class 6 students in Indian government schools on this question, keeping in mind their background and the general pass rate of 29%.

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science/General Knowledge:**

*   **Difficulty defining "Natural Resources":** This is a key conceptual hurdle. Students might conflate natural resources with anything "found in Rajasthan," even manufactured items if they don't grasp the natural vs. man-made distinction clearly. They might also think of things only as *products* rather than the raw material.
*   **Lack of Specific Geographical Knowledge:** While they know Rajasthan, pinpointing specific natural resources there might be challenging without direct teaching on Rajasthan's geography and resources. Their knowledge might be more localized to their immediate surroundings than state-level.
*   **Focus on the "known" over the "correct":** Students might mention crops they know grow there (e.g., bajra) without categorizing them as natural *resources* in the context of the question asking for *any* two (implying non-agricultural resources could be included, and even agricultural ones would be understood differently). They might list animals.
*   **Confusing *finished products* with *raw resources*:** They might list "buildings" instead of "limestone" or "marble," or "salt bags" instead of "salt."
*   **Difficulty with the "influence" part:** Even if they identify a resource, explaining its influence on lives requires a step beyond simple recall – it needs a cause-and-effect understanding that might be underdeveloped.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Natural Resources":** This is the biggest vocabulary hurdle. While "natural" (प्राकृतिक) might be somewhat understood, "resources" (संसाधन) might be a less common or abstract term for Class 6. They might interpret "natural things" rather than "natural resources for human use."
*   **"Found in Rajasthan":** This part is likely clear.
*   **"Influences the lives of the people":** "Influences" (प्रभावित करता है) might be a slightly advanced verb. They might struggle to articulate this relationship even if they conceptually grasp it. The instruction to "explain how" further compounds this, demanding more than a one-word answer.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **Attempt:** Most students would likely *attempt* the question because it seems like a straightforward "name two things" query. The difficulty would come in the *accuracy* and *explanation*.
*   **Failure:** The failure would mostly stem from:
    *   Incorrect identification of resources.
    *   Listing only one resource (failing the "two" requirement).
    *   Not attempting the "explain how it influences" part.
    *   Attempting the explanation but doing so poorly or irrelevantly.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **Listing only one correct resource, or two incorrect ones:**
    *   Example: "Water, Trees" (Trees are broad, and specific *forest* resources like timber might be harder for them to pinpoint).
*   **Listing common items/animals/crops that aren't strictly "resources" in this context:**
    *   "Camel, Bajra, Sand, Deserts, People"
*   **General geographical features, not resources:**
    *   "Thar Desert, Aravalli Mountains"
*   **Incorrectly classifying items:**
    *   "Roads, Houses" (thinking of things *in* Rajasthan).
*   **Poor or missing explanation for the influence:**
    *   Even if they identify "water," their explanation might be very rudimentary ("people drink water") rather than linking it to agriculture, daily life, industry etc. Or they might omit the explanation entirely.
*   **Listing things generic to India, not specific to Rajasthan:**
    *   "Rivers, Lakes" (without specifying the actual ones or how they are distinct to Rajasthan's resource profile).

**Rubric Application - Key to Pass:**

The rubric is fairly generous on the "resources" part (water, Marble, Copper, Sandstone, Gypsum, mica, limestone, zinc, salt, Sunlight for solar energy, Wind for wind energy). However, it requires *two* and the *explanation* for one. Many wrong answers will fail the "two correct" criterion or the explanation part.

**Analyzing likely Pass Rate:**

Given the context:
*   Average pass rate 29% implies that many questions are answered incorrectly.
*   Conceptual difficulty with "natural resources" for this age group, combined with lack of specific state-level knowledge.
*   Language barrier with "resources" and "influences."
*   Requirement for *
