Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Fundamental Lack of Understanding of Active/Passive Voice:** This is probably the biggest barrier. Many students in these circumstances, especially with limited exposure to formal grammar structures in English, may not have been taught or fully grasped the concept of active vs. passive voice at all.

2.  **Vocabulary/Word Meaning Issues:**
    *   "Blew": While a common verb, if they struggle with the past tense or past participle forms (blow-blew-blown), it's a critical point of failure.
    *   "Away": Could be misinterpreted or omitted if they don't see it as integral to the verb phrase.

3.  **Lack of Understanding of Tense Conversion:**
    *   The original sentence is in the Simple Past ("blew"). To form the passive voice, they need "was/were + past participle." This involves understanding subject-verb agreement ("leaves *were* blown," not "leaves *was* blown") and the correct past participle.

4.  **Identifying the Subject/Object:**
    *   Correctly identifying "the wind" as the *doer* (agent) and "the leaves" as the *receiver* (object) is crucial for the transformation. They might flip them incorrectly or struggle to identify them.

5.  **Placement of "by the agent":**
    *   Knowing *when* and *where* to include "by the wind" is part of the passive voice structure. Some might omit it entirely, place it incorrectly, or just add "by" without the agent.

6.  **"Be" verb confusion:** Many will forget or misuse the "be" verb (was/were) which is essential for passive voice construction.

7.  **Simple Word Swap Attempt:** Given limited understanding, many might attempt a simple word reordering without understanding the grammatical rules.

**Would students attempt or fail to attempt?**

*   **Most would attempt.** Even if they don't know the answer, the instruction "Change the following sentence..." prompts an action. They are unlikely to leave it completely blank unless they genuinely have no idea what "active voice" or "passive voice" even means.
*   They might try to reorder the words, change one or two words, or substitute similar-sounding words if they're guessing.

**What would the most common wrong answer look like?**

Given the anticipated errors, here are likely common wrong answers, roughly in order of likelihood:

1.  **Simple Reversal with no grammatical changes:**
    *   "The leaves blew the wind away." (This shows a basic attempt to flip words but ignores voice rules.)
    *   "Away blew the leaves the wind." (Even more jumbled, trying to make sense of "away")

2.  **Incorrect Past Participle or "Be" verb omission/error:**
    *   "The leaves was blown away by the wind." (Subject-verb agreement error with "was" for plural "leaves")
    *   "The leaves blow away by the wind." (Forgetting the "be" verb and incorrect tense)
    *   "The leaves blowing away by the wind." (Using present participle)
    *   "The leaves *is* blown away by the wind." (Present tense "be" verb with past context)

3.  **Missing "by the agent":**
    *   "The leaves were blown away." (This is grammatically correct passive voice but technically omits a part of the "full" transformation including the agent.) – This might still get *some* credit depending on rubric interpretation, but for "max score 1" and implying a complete transformation, it's often a deduction.

4.  **Just adding "by":**
    *   "The leaves blew away by the wind." (Forgetting the "be" verb and past participle change.)

5.  **Random word substitutions:**
    *   "The leaves fall by the wind away." (Attempting to substitute verbs if "blew" is unclear.)

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 10%**

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

*   **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is a key anchor. Grammar transformations of this specific type (active/passive voice) tend to be harder than basic fill-in-the-blanks or simple sentence constructions for students with limited exposure.
*   **Complexity:** This question requires multiple grammatical steps: identifying subject/object, correct "be" verb usage, knowing the past participle ("blown"), subject-verb agreement, and correctly positioning "by the wind." Each step is a potential point of failure.
*   **Past Experience:** From
