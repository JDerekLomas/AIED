Let's break down the potential errors and arrive at an estimated pass rate.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Limited Exposure to Geography/Map Work:**
    *   Many students, especially from economically weaker sections, might not have much exposure to maps, globes, or structured geography lessons that specifically name and locate major physical features of India. Their "world" might be very localized.
    *   **Misconception:** They might not conceptualize India as having distinct *named* mountain ranges beyond the general idea of "mountains." They might know *where* mountains are generally (e.g., "up north"), but not their proper names.

2.  **Lack of Understanding of "Mountain Range" vs. "Mountain":**
    *   They might think of individual mountains (e.g., Mount Everest, although Everest isn't entirely *in* India for Class 6 level distinction, it's the most famous mountain in the region) rather than a *range*. While Everest is part of the Himalayas, they might just say "Everest."
    *   **Misconception:** They might name a state known for mountains (e.g., "Jammu and Kashmir," "Himachal Pradesh") thinking the state itself is the range.

3.  **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Major":** While generally understood, for Class 6, they might struggle with the implied "well-known, significant" aspect, not differentiating between minor local hills and national ranges.
    *   **"Mountain Ranges":** They might simply translate it to "pahad" (mountains) and struggle to recall specific names, even if they've heard them.
    *   **"Located in India":** Some might name the Himalayas but then struggle to think of another *clearly within* India, especially if they have limited geographical knowledge.

4.  **Recall Failure:**
    *   Even if taught, the specific names (Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats) might not be sufficiently reinforced or considered "major" in their limited worldview, especially compared to the omnipresent "Himalayas."

5.  **Not Attempting vs. Failed Attempt:**
    *   Many will likely *attempt*. They know "pahad" means mountains. The problem isn't often *not trying*, but *not knowing what to write*.
    *   Failed attempts would likely look like:
        *   "Pahad" (just the word for mountains)
        *   "Up north"
        *   Names of states (Jammu, Himachal)
        *   Specific, but incorrect, local hills (if they name anything at all)
        *   Irrelevant names (from other subjects or general knowledge)
        *   Sometimes, "Mount Everest" (which would be half-correct as part of the Himalayas, but not ideal as a "range").
        *   Blank (less likely if they attempt anything, but still possible).

**Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **"Himalayas" (often spelled incorrectly, or as "Himachal"):** If they only name one. This is partially correct but doesn't meet the "two" requirement.
*   **Names of States:** Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir.
*   **General terms:** "Pahad" (mountains).
*   **Specific but incorrect mountains:** Maybe a local hill, or *attempting* a specific peak name from a textbook that wasn't reinforced.
*   **Just one correct range (e.g., "Himalayas"):** This gets them 0.5 points.

**Applying the Rubric:**

*   "Names one correct mountain range" for 0.5 points.
*   So, if a student names only "Himalayas," they score 0.5 and *pass* the question (as "pass" means achieving the max score, 0.5).

**Revised Interpretation of Pass:** The question asks "proportion of Class 6 students... would answer this question correctly." Given the max score of 0.5 for one correct answer, achieving this 0.5 would count as "answering correctly" to the extent allowed by the rubric for partial credit.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT (getting at least one name right, securing 0.5 points):**

Considering the points above:

*   **Himalayas:** This is by far the most well-known mountain range. Most students, even with limited geography knowledge, would have heard of the "Himalayas" or "Himachal mountains." This is their primary candidate.
*   **Other ranges (Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western/Eastern Ghats):** Knowledge of
