Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science/History:**

*   **Lack of Concrete Knowledge:** The most significant issue. Many students will simply not recall *specific* details about Harappan civilization. Their historical knowledge might be very broad and superficial ("it was an ancient civilization," "they built cities") but lack the detailed descriptors needed for this question.
*   **Difficulty with "Key Feature":** Even if they remember some aspects, identifying a "key feature" requires analytical thinking and an understanding of what makes something *important* or *distinctive*. They might recall general facts but struggle to select one that highlights a significant characteristic of *urban planning*.
*   **Focus on General Civilizational Aspects:** Students might confuse "urban planning" with other aspects of the civilization. They might write about their agricultural practices, trade, gods, or script, thinking any detail about Harappa is acceptable.
*   **Recollection Gaps/Confusion with other Civilizations:** Limited exposure and rote memorization often lead to incomplete recall or confusing Harappan features with those of other ancient civilizations (e.g., Mesopotamia, Egypt), if they even remember others.
*   **Anachronistic Thinking:** Might relate it to modern cities or simply say "they built houses," without understanding the distinct features of ancient urban planning.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Describe":** This verb might be interpreted too broadly as "write anything you know." It requires more than just naming; it needs some elaboration.
*   **"Key Feature":** As mentioned, understanding "key" implies significance, not just "any feature." This phrase might be difficult to parse precisely.
*   **"Urban Planning":** This is a relatively sophisticated term.
    *   **"Urban":** Students might understand "city" but not "urban" in an analytical sense.
    *   **"Planning":** They might struggle with the concept of intentional design and forethought, associating it more with a modern process than an ancient one.
    *   **Combined:** "City planning" might be an easier concept for them. *Urban Planning* as a formal academic term might be unfamiliar, leading them to miss the core focus of the question. They might understand "cities" and "planning" individually but not grasp the precise combination's implication.
*   **English Proficiency:** Limited English could lead to:
    *   Difficulty formulating a coherent answer even if they know the information in their mother tongue.
    *   Misunderstanding the question entirely due to unfamiliar vocabulary.
    *   Providing very brief, disjointed answers.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **Most will attempt:** Given it's a "describe" question, and they would likely have studied *something* about Harappan Civilization, most students will likely attempt it.
*   **Failed Attempts:** The majority of attempts will be incorrect, either by being too vague, irrelevant, or factually wrong.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer:**

The most common wrong answer would likely fall into these categories:

*   **Too Vague/General:** "They had good cities." "Their cities were clean." "They built houses." "They had a civilization." (Fails to describe a *key feature* of *urban planning*).
*   **Irrelevant Fact:** "They grew wheat." "They traded with Mesopotamia." "They had a script." "They worshipped mother goddess." (Confuses general Harappan knowledge with *urban planning*).
*   **Partial but Undescribed:** "Drainage." (Not enough to get credit - needs "advanced drainage system" or similar elaboration).
*   **Misconceived Urban Aspect:** "They lived near rivers." "They had walls for protection." (While true, "living near rivers" isn't an *urban planning feature* in itself; "walls" is borderline, but "grid layout" or "drainage" is far stronger evidence of *planning*).

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

Considering the factors:

*   **Curriculum:** Harappan Civilization is a foundational topic. So, it *is* taught.
*   **Recall Difficulty:** Specific features like *urban planning* and its sub-points require detailed recall beyond general understanding.
*   **Language Barrier:** The academic language "urban planning" and "key feature" are obstacles.
*   **Pass Rate Benchmark:** The average pass rate is 29%, which means questions generally have a low success rate. This particular question is more analytical than just factual recall.

A student needs to not only recall a specific detail but also link it correctly to "urban planning" and articulate it in English.

I believe this question would perform **below** the average pass rate due to the
