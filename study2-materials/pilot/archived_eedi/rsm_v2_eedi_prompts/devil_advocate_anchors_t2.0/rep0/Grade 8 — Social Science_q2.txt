I need to estimate the pass rate for the question: "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

Let's break down the difficulty based on the provided anchors and the context:

*   **Subject Matter:** Harappan Civilization is a core topic in Indian history taught in Class 8. Students *should* have encountered this.
*   **English Proficiency:** "Describe one key feature" is a relatively straightforward instruction. The answer itself requires specific vocabulary related to history (e.g., "grid layout," "drainage system," "baked bricks," "citadel").
*   **Cognitive Load:** It asks for *one* key feature. This is less demanding than differentiation or summarizing a poem.
*   **Anxiety/Blanks:** Many students, as indicated, struggle with English or anxiety, leading to blank or irrelevant responses. The 50% pass rate item shows that even with a simple factual recall, some students provide incomplete or no answers.

Let's look at the calibration anchors:

*   **5% Pass Rate (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking and good English comprehension. Clearly much harder.
*   **15% Pass Rate (Differentiate sources):** Requires understanding of two distinct concepts and providing examples. More complex than identifying *one* feature.
*   **30% Pass Rate (Short paragraph "My favorite season"):** This requires basic English sentence construction, personal expression, and organization. Students have to generate content from scratch. This question feels somewhat comparable in terms of cognitive demand, but *My Favorite Season* allows for simple English ("Winter. Sweater. Hot water. Tea") which can still get marks. The Harappan question demands specific historical terms.
*   **50% Pass Rate (Three questions the king wanted):** Factual recall from a specific story. Very direct. Many students managed this, but even here, some struggle. This is similar to the Harappan question in requiring specific recall.
*   **66% Pass Rate (Two Fundamental Rights):** Direct factual recall, commonly taught. High pass rate for good reason.

**Comparison to the Target Question:**

The Harappan Civilization question is factual recall, like the "king's questions" (50%) and "Fundamental Rights" (66%). However, "Harappan Civilization urban planning" might involve more specific and less universally known terms than "Fundamental Rights" or "king's questions" from a story often read.

The requirement to "describe" means more than just listing a word or two; it needs a short phrase or simple sentence. For instance, "Grid layout of streets" or "Advanced drainage system."

The prompt states that students often struggle with "basic" concepts and have limited English. Even if taught, recalling the *specific vocabulary* for urban planning features (like "grid system" or "drainage") might be a hurdle for some. They might know "cities were good" but struggle to articulate *how*.

Given that "My favorite season" got 30% with very minimal (even fragmented) English still earning marks, and "Three questions the king wanted" got 50% for direct factual recall (albeit with incomplete answers also being common), I need to place the Harappan question somewhere in that range.

The "Three questions" prompt is slightly easier because the answers are often part of a readily memorized narrative structure. Harappan features, while important, might require slightly more abstract conceptualization to "describe."

If students write: "They had good roads," that might get a mark. If they write: "Drainage system was there," that should get a mark.
The expectation of "one key feature" and the need for even rudimentary historical vocabulary makes it harder than the "Fundamental Rights" question.
It's likely *harder* than the 50% "king's questions" because Harappan urban planning might be slightly more nuanced for these students than recalling story facts. But it's easier than paragraph writing or differentiation.

I anticipate many students might recall *something* but struggle with the specific terminology.
"Good roads" or "Good drainage" could pass. This level of simple recall with slightly specific terminology falls below 66% but above 30%. It's close to the 50% mark, possibly slightly below, due to the need for a bit more precise historical vocabulary than just recalling narrative points.

Let's consider common student responses that *might* score 1:
*   "Roads were in grid pattern."
*   "They had a good drainage system."
*   "Used baked bricks."
*   "City divided into two parts." (even without citadel/lower town)

This is a specific fact from a social studies chapter. If the students attended class and paid attention to the chapter on Harappan civilization, this fact is usually highlighted.
