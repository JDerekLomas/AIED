The question asks for a definition of "fable," a relatively straightforward knowledge-based question. However, the context is crucial: Class 8 students in Indian government schools, mostly from economically weaker sections, with limited English, and an average pass rate of 29%.

Let's break down the difficulty:

1.  **Vocabulary:** "Fable" itself is a specific literary term. While it's covered in primary education, its precise definition might not be strongly retained by all students, especially those with limited exposure to diverse English texts.
2.  **Recall vs. Comprehension:** This is a recall question. Students need to have learned the definition and be able to articulate it.
3.  **English Proficiency:** The definition needs to be articulated in English. Even if they understand the concept, forming a coherent sentence like "A fable is a short story, typically with animals as characters, that teaches a moral lesson" might be challenging for students with limited English.
4.  **Learning Gaps:** Given the educational background, it's very plausible that many students missed this specific topic, or didn't fully grasp the nuanced definition, or have simply forgotten it.
5.  **Anxiety/Blank Responses:** The calibration anchors show a significant number of blank responses (e.g., 50% pass rate item, 0 points for empty response). This will naturally lower the pass rate for what seems like a simple question.
6.  **"Basic" Concepts Misjudgment:** As highlighted, what seems basic to an educated adult (like "define fable") is often not basic for these students.

Let's compare to the calibration anchors:

*   **5% Pass Rate (Theme of Poem):** Requires critical thinking and articulation of an abstract concept in English. Much harder than defining "fable."
*   **15% Pass Rate (Differentiate Archaeological/Literary Sources):** Requires understanding two concepts and articulating differences with examples. This is significantly more complex than defining a single term. Students providing fragmented answers got partial credit (score 1 for just mentioning archeological source). For "define fable," the rubric is Max 1, meaning full definition is likely required for a pass.
*   **30% Pass Rate (Paragraph on Favorite Season):** This is a creative writing task requiring 6-8 lines and addressing specific prompts. Even fragmented answers like "Winter Sweater Baju Hot water Tea Gever feali Hat" got a full score (3/3), suggesting very lenient grading for effort and content related to the prompt, not perfect English or structure. Defining fable requires specific factual recall, not creative expression with lenient grading.
*   **50% Pass Rate (Three Questions the King Wanted):** This is a factual recall from a specific story. Students who provided keywords (like "the right time to do everything, the right thing to do...") got full credit. This is similar to defining "fable" in that it's recall, but the *length* of the expected answer for the king's questions is slightly longer and might allow for more partial recall that still passes.
*   **66% Pass Rate (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is straightforward recall of two items from a list. It's similar in cognitive demand to defining fable, *if* the student has robustly memorized the definition. Examples showed very concise, almost keyword answers getting full credit.

**Conclusion:**

Defining "fable" requires specific vocabulary (animals, moral lesson), an understanding of its purpose, and the ability to combine these into a concise English sentence.
While easier than higher-order thinking or differentiation, it's harder than simply listing two rights or recalling a short phrase. The high number of expected blank/poorly articulated responses due to limited English and general learning gaps will bring the score down.

Compared to "Two Fundamental Rights" (66%), which is simple listing, "fable" is slightly more demanding because it requires synthesizing multiple parts of a definition. Compared to the "King's questions" (50%), "fable" is similar recall but maybe slightly harder to get *all* components for full credit in a concise sentence. The example answers for the 30% item (favorite season) show very broken English being accepted, but for "define fable," the bar is likely higher for correctness (all parts of definition).

Considering the average pass rate of 29% and the demonstrated challenges students face, "define fable" is unlikely to be in the 50-66% range. It's a precise definition, and simply knowing "it's a story" won't suffice for full credit. They need the animals and the moral.

My initial thought would be higher, but after considering the limited English, the need for *specific* components of the definition, and the documented struggles and blank responses, the difficulty escalates. Students might
