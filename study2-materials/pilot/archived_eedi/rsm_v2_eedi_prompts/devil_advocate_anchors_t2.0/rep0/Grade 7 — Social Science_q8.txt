I'll use the provided calibration anchors and context to estimate the pass rate.

The question asks for "main occupations of people in rural areas of Rajasthan" and to "describe any one in brief." This requires recall of specific geographical/social studies knowledge, plus a basic ability to form a brief descriptive sentence or two.

Let's break down the difficulty:

*   **Knowledge Recall:** Students need to remember key occupations for rural Rajasthan. Agriculture and animal husbandry are generally common knowledge for rural areas, but connecting them specifically to "Rajasthan" might be a slight added layer. However, these are foundational concepts for social studies in India.
*   **Language Barrier:** The English is straightforward: "main occupations," "rural areas," "Rajasthan," "describe in brief." No complex vocabulary or sentence structures.
*   **Describing one in brief:** This means forming a simple sentence or two about one chosen occupation. For example, "Agriculture means growing crops like wheat and millet." This is comparable to the paragraph writing question in terms of writing length/complexity (which was a 30% item but required *more* lines and elaboration). Here, "brief" suggests minimal output.
*   **Cognitive Load:** It's a two-part question (name two, describe one), but each part is relatively simple.

Let's compare to anchors:

*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%)**: This was a recall question from a text. It required remembering specific details. Many students got one or two parts right even if they didn't get all three, thus earning a 1. This question is similar in recall (two occupations).
*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India." (66%)**: This is a direct recall of two specific items. Students only needed to list them, no description required. Our target question adds the description part.
*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each." (15%)**: This is a definition *and* differentiation task, much harder than simple recall and description.

The current question is simpler than differentiating two complex concepts but slightly more complex than just listing two fundamental rights because of the "describe any one in brief" part. However, "in brief" means a very minimal description is likely accepted for scoring. Many students, even with limited English, can likely name "farming" or "agriculture" and "animal keeping" or "livestock." Describing one briefly would probably involve a very simple phrase that a struggling student could construct.

If students could get 50% on recalling three specific story points, and 66% on naming two fundamental rights, a question that asks for two common occupations and a very brief description of one seems somewhere in between, but closer to the 50-66% range. The knowledge itself (occupations in rural Rajasthan) is also likely part of their curriculum for social studies/EVS, similar to fundamental rights.

The challenge is the "in brief" part. A simple "Agriculture is farming" or "People grow crops" could suffice. Given the low expectations in scoring, a simple phrase could get credit.

Considering the commonality of agriculture and animal husbandry as rural occupations, most students would have been exposed to this information. The English required for the answer is minimal. The bar for "brief description" is also likely quite low.

I expect it to be slightly below the "Name two Fundamental Rights" (66%) but higher than "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%), because identifying rural occupations and providing a minimal description is very common knowledge in an Indian context. The description element, while adding complexity, likely has a low scoring threshold for "brief."

Challenging my assumption: If students struggle with basic sentence construction, even "Agriculture. Grow crops." might be too much. But the examples for other items (like "My favorite season") show that even very fragmented responses ("Winter\nSweater\nBaju") could get score if the keywords were present. For this question, naming two occupations (even with spelling errors) and providing *any* simple phrase related to one would likely pass.

Final estimate, leaning towards the higher end given the foundational nature of the knowledge and the likely low bar for the "brief description" to earn points.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 58%
