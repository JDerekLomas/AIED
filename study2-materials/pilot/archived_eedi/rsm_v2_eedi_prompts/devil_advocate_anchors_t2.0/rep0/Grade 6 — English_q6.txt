Here's my thinking process to arrive at the estimated proportion correct:

1.  **Analyze the Question:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"
    *   **Core Task 1:** Identify *a line* from the poem. This requires *recall* of the poem (or at least being able to pick a line if the poem is provided in the exam, which it likely is given the nature of other questions about "The Last Bargain").
    *   **Core Task 2:** Provide a *reason* ("why") for liking that line. This requires simple expression of a personal opinion.
    *   **Language Difficulty:** English is relatively straightforward, but requires expressing a reason, not just identifying.

2.  **Consider the Rubric:** "Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why." Max score: 1.5. This means *both* parts are required for a correct answer. No partial credit implied for just the line.

3.  **Student Demographics & Context:**
    *   Class 6, Indian government schools, economically weaker sections, limited English.
    *   Average pass rate 29%.
    *   Crucial warnings: teachers *overestimate*, limited English, "basic" not basic, anxiety/blanks, no practice for exact question type.

4.  **Calibrate Against Anchors:**

    *   **Anchor 1 (5%): Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."**
        *   This requires abstract thinking and synthesis. Very hard for this group. Even basic English is challenged by expressing an abstract "theme."
        *   My question is *easier* than this. "Liking" a line and giving a simple "why" is less abstract than defining a theme.

    *   **Anchor 2 (15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each.**
        *   Requires conceptual understanding and distinct examples for two categories. More demanding than expressing a personal preference.
        *   My question is *easier* than this.

    *   **Anchor 3 (30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season." Talk about what you like to do, what you eat or wear, and w.**
        *   Requires sustained writing (6-8 lines) on a *familiar* topic, incorporating specific details. The *structure* and *length* are challenging for 30%.
        *   My question requires much less writing (one line, one short reason). The topic (personal preference for a poem line) might be less "free" than favorite season, but the *expressive load* is lower. The *difficulty of expressing the "why"* might be comparable to articulating what one *does* in a season for many students.

    *   **Anchor 4 (50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?**
        *   Pure recall from a story. If they understood the story and remember the questions, it's straightforward. Many might remember *some* but not all three accurately, or struggle with the precise phrasing.
        *   My question requires *recall of a line* (similar to recalling facts from a story) *plus* *articulation of a reason*. The "articulation of a reason" is what pushes it beyond simple recall. The recall part itself, especially from a poem, can be harder than recalling key plot points from a story for some.

    *   **Anchor 5 (66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India.**
        *   Requires factual recall of specific concepts. If taught and remembered, it's quite simple. Short answers.
        *   My question is *harder* than this because it requires not just recall of a line, but *also* a simple explanatory reason. "Why" is always harder than "what."

5.  **Synthesize and Challenge Initial Instinct:**

    *   **Initial Gut Feeling:** Many students could probably pick *a* line if the poem is there. And give *some* reason, even a simple one. Maybe 40-50%?

    *   **Challenging the Gut Feeling (using warnings):**
        *   "Limited English": Even a simple "why" can be hard to articulate if your vocabulary is tiny. "I like it because it sounds nice" or "it is good" might be all they can manage. Will that count for "why"? The rubric says "mentions why." I'll assume even basic reasons would count.
        *   "Basic concepts aren't basic": Choosing a "favorite" and explaining *why* requires some level of engagement with the text and personal reflection, which isn
