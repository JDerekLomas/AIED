Let's analyze the given question and calibrate it against the provided anchor items.

The question asks students to write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby', mentioning what it is, when they do it, and why they enjoy it. This requires:
1.  **Paragraph structure:** Though "short," it demands some basic organizational skill in writing sentences together.
2.  **Content generation:** Identifying a hobby, expressing *when* it's done, and *why* it's enjoyed. This requires abstract thinking and expressing personal preferences.
3.  **English proficiency:** Students need sufficient vocabulary and grammatical control to express these ideas coherently in 4-5 sentences.

Let's compare this to the anchor items:

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain."** This is very abstract, requiring deep comprehension of a poem and ability to articulate a complex theme. Much harder than 'My Favorite Hobby'.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate archaeological and literary sources.** Requires specific domain knowledge, precise definitions, and examples. More factual recall and comparison than 'My Favorite Hobby'. The partial responses show difficulty in precise articulation.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season."** This is very similar in task type and content to "My Favourite Hobby."
    *   It's a paragraph on a personal preference.
    *   It asks for similar details (what you like to do, eat/wear, why).
    *   The required length (6-8 lines) is slightly longer than the target question's 4-5 sentences, making the current question *slightly* less demanding on length.
    *   The examples show students providing very simple, list-like responses or struggling to form coherent sentences. A pass might just be a string of words.

*   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer.** This is specific recall from a story. It doesn't require original thought or paragraph construction. It's essentially listing.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Two Fundamental Rights.** This is pure recall of learned facts, not requiring any comprehension or synthesis beyond naming. Very direct.

**Challenging Assumptions:**

My first instinct might be "everyone has a hobby, they can probably write something." However, recalling the common difficulties:
*   **Limited English:** The 30% pass rate for "My favorite season" is crucial here. Many students who "know" their favorite season still struggle to string together 6-8 *coherent* lines about it, even with prompts. "My Favourite Hobby" is slightly less demanding in length but still requires coherence.
*   **"Basic" concepts:** Expressing *why* one enjoys something in grammatically correct English can be a challenge. Simple enumerations like "I like playing" might pass, but forming descriptive sentences like "It helps me relax" might be harder for many.
*   **Exam anxiety/Blank responses:** As seen in the 50% pass rate item, empty responses are common even for simpler tasks.
*   **Never practiced:** While personal essays are common, a specific "paragraph with X, Y, Z details" might be new.

Given the close similarity to the "My favorite season" question (pass rate 30%), the current question is *slightly* easier due to the reduced length requirement (4-5 sentences vs. 6-8 lines). However, the bar for passing might still be very low, accepting fragmented or very simple sentences that convey the core information.

If "My favorite season" (6-8 lines) had a 30% pass rate, this question (4-5 sentences) might be marginally higher. Students who could *just barely* meet the criteria for the 30% item might find this slightly less intimidating. I don't think it's significantly easier to jump to 40% or 50%, as the core task of paragraph construction and articulating personal feelings in English remains. The biggest hurdle isn't the *idea* of a hobby, but expressing it coherently.

I will calibrate it just above the "My favorite season" question, considering the slightly reduced sentence count, which reduces the overall English proficiency and sustained writing effort required.
