I will analyze the question and the calibration anchors to make a calibrated estimate.

**Question Breakdown:**
*   **"Does gardener notice any change after some days?"**: This requires basic understanding of decomposition.
*   **"Give reasons"**: Explain *why* the change occurs (decomposition by microorganisms).
*   **"evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health"**: Relate decomposition to manure/compost and its benefits for soil.

**Challenges for Students:**
1.  **Vocabulary:** "waste of plants," "vegetables and fruits," "pit," "significant changes," "beneficial," "soil health," "decomposition," "microorganisms," "manure/compost" – these are fairly common, but putting them into a coherent English sentence can be hard.
2.  **Conceptual Understanding:**
    *   Knowing that plant waste decomposes is common knowledge even outside school for many, but explaining *why* (microorganisms) and its *benefit* for soil (manure/compost, nutrients) requires more specific science knowledge.
    *   Many students might know that dead things rot, but might struggle to articulate "decomposition by microorganisms" and its agricultural benefits in English.
3.  **Articulation in English:** Even if a student understands the concept, writing it out coherently and scientifically in English is a significant barrier for students with limited English proficiency.
4.  **Open-ended Nature:** This isn't a simple factual recall. It requires a multi-part explanation and evaluation, which is harder than just naming things.
5.  **Reaching the "0.5 score" threshold:** The rubric states: "The user suggests that the gardener will notice significant changes." This is a relatively low bar for *some* credit, focusing only on the first part of the question. However, getting full credit on a more comprehensive rubric for such a question would be harder. I am estimating based on *this specific* rubric.

**Comparing with Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Poem Theme):** Requires nuanced understanding and abstract expression. Hard.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Archaeological vs. Literary sources):** Requires definitional recall and example-giving for two distinct concepts. Moderate difficulty. The correct answers often had fragmented or incomplete English, but enough to get credit.
*   **Pass rate 30% (My favorite season, short paragraph):** Open-ended, creative writing about a personal topic. Students could score well even with simple sentences and bullet points. Many still scored 0.
*   **Pass rate 50% (King's three questions):** Direct recall of specific information from a story. Many blank or partial answers.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Direct factual recall, highly taught. Still, 1/3 failed.

**Calibration:**

The question about the gardener and decomposition is conceptually familiar to many (things rot). The first part ("Does gardener notice any change?") is very accessible. The "Give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial" part makes it harder, pushing beyond simple observation to scientific explanation and evaluation.

However, the specific rubric for the "0.5 score" is crucial: "The user suggests that the gardener will notice significant changes." This is an *extremely* low bar.
*   "Yes, it will change."
*   "Yes, it will rot."
*   "Yes, it will smell."

Many students, even with limited English, would likely be able to state *some* form of "yes, it will change" or "yes, it will rot." This is more like common sense than complex academic content, especially the initial observation part.

Even if they don't know "decomposition," they know things decay. The challenge is in the *next* parts (reasons, benefits), which would get a full score, but the 0.5 score is based only on "significant changes."

Let's look at the "My favorite season" item (30%). Many could produce something, but a significant portion (70%) scored 0. Why? Lack of English, complete disengagement, anxiety, or not understanding the prompt. This gardener question is less open-ended than "My favorite season" but requires factual knowledge about nature.

The "King's three questions" (50%) involved direct recall from a story. If 50% could do that, then understanding basic decay might be around that level or slightly higher, especially since the prompt specifically gives them "waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit."

Considering the low bar for 0.5 points (simply stating a change is noticed):
*   A large number of students would have *some* idea that things rot.
*   Expressing "change" or "rot" in simple English should be possible
