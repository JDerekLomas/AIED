I will analyze the question and the calibration anchors to estimate the proportion of Class 7 students who would answer correctly.

**Question Analysis:**
*   **Concept:** Area of a triangle. This is a fundamental concept in geometry, usually introduced in Class 6 or 7.
*   **Formula Recall:** The primary hurdle is recalling the formula `Area = 1/2 × base × height`.
*   **Arithmetic:** Simple multiplication and division (1/2 * 8 * 6 = 24).
*   **English Comprehension:** "Find the area," "base," "height" are standard mathematical terms but still require basic English comprehension.
*   **Difficulty:** This is a direct application of a formula. No complex reasoning or multi-step problem-solving.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Poem Theme):** Requires abstract thinking, deep comprehension, and nuanced English expression. Much harder than the current question.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Archaeological vs. Literary sources):** Requires recalling definitions of two related terms and providing examples, often in comparative form. This tests memorization and understanding of distinct concepts. The current question only asks for one formula.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Favorite Season paragraph):** Requires creative writing, sentence construction, and adherence to specific content prompts. Many students struggle with producing coherent written English.
*   **Pass rate 50% (King's Three Questions):** This is a factual recall question from a specific story, requiring students to remember details. Similar to recalling a formula, but text-based. Students often get partial credit here by remembering parts of the questions.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Another direct factual recall question from civics, often a well-drilled topic. Students typically memorize these points.

**Challenging Assumptions:**

*   **Limited English:** While mathematical terms are somewhat universal, "find the area," "base," and "height" might be misunderstood by the weakest students. However, for a math question, the core difficulty lies in the mathematical concept itself rather than the intricate English.
*   **"Basic" concepts:** Area of a triangle is taught in Class 7, so it *should* be basic. However, inconsistent teaching, attendance issues, and lack of revision mean many would not know it.
*   **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** Always a factor, pulling scores down.
*   **Question type:** This is a very standard "direct application of formula" type question. Students often practice these.

**Factors for the current question:**

*   **Ease of formula recall:** While fundamental, students can forget `1/2`. Many might remember `base × height` but miss the `1/2`.
*   **Computational ease:** The numbers are simple (8 * 6 = 48, then / 2 = 24).
*   **Partial Credit Potential (Rubric):** The rubric states "States *or uses* the correct formula." This is key. Even if a student gets the final calculation wrong, if they write "Area = 1/2 * b * h" or show "1/2 * 8 * 6", they score 1. This broadens the definition of 'correct'.
*   **Visualization:** Some students might visualize a rectangle and understand how a triangle is half of it.

Compared to the 50% anchor ("King's Three Questions") which requires recalling 3 specific facts, this question requires recalling one formula. The 66% anchor ("Two Fundamental Rights") also requires factual recall, but for two specific items, from a likely frequently discussed civics topic.

The area of a triangle formula is fundamental to geometry taught around this grade level. It's often emphasized. Given that merely *stating or using* the formula is enough, many who might make a small arithmetic error (or even forget the `1/2` but remember `b*h`) could still demonstrate knowledge of the formula itself, securing the point.

However, remembering the exact `1/2` part is crucial. Students frequently confuse it with the area of a rectangle or parallelogram. But the simplicity of the numbers makes the calculation less prone to error once the formula is correctly applied.

I suspect it's harder than the 66% item (Fundamental Rights, which is often rote learned) and the 50% item (King's questions, where students could often recall at least parts), because forgetting `1/2` is a common error and would not result in credit if only `b*h` were used. But the 'states *or* uses' is crucial. If a student writes down the correct formula, they get a point. If they show `1/2 * 8 * 6`,
