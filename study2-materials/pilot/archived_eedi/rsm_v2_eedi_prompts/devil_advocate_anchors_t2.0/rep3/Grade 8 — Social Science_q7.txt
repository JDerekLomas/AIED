I'll analyze the question against the calibration anchors, keeping in mind the limitations of the target student population.

The question asks for a specific historical impact of the Battle of Plassey. It requires:
1.  **Knowledge of the Battle of Plassey (1757):** Students need to recognize it as a historical event.
2.  **Understanding of "contribute to the expansion of British power":** They need to link the battle's outcome to the growth of British influence.
3.  **Specific detail (e.g., control over Bengal, puppet nawab):** The rubric requires a particular consequence.

Let's compare this to the anchors:

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** This requires abstract thinking and nuanced English comprehension. Students struggled significantly. The given responses show attempts at interpretation but often miss the mark or are incomplete.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** This requires knowing definitions and examples for two distinct concepts. One example shows decent understanding, while another is brief. "Empty response" indicates many couldn't even start. This is a conceptual knowledge question, similar in requiring specific recall, but "Plassey" is a single event, potentially simpler to recall a single impact than differentiate two source types.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Short paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This is a creative writing task requiring personal expression and basic sentence construction within parameters. It's relatively low-stress as there's no "wrong" answer as long as they meet the format. Responses vary wildly, but the pass rate is moderate.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is direct recall from a story. It requires memory of specific plot points and moderate English to extract and list them. Responses demonstrate recall of the core ideas even with limited phrasing.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Name two Fundamental Rights):** This is direct recall of specific names/terms from civics. It's a high pass rate because it's a foundational, likely heavily repeated concept, and only requires naming. Even with poor English, just writing "Right to equality" counts.

**Comparing to the "Plassey" question:**

*   **Difficulty of concept:** "Battle of Plassey" and its immediate impact is a foundational historical event, likely covered in Class 8 history. It's less abstract than a poem's theme, but more specific than general "favorite season."
*   **Required detail:** The rubric for Plassey requires specific knowledge (control over Bengal, puppet nawab). This is more demanding than just listing two rights or general themes. It's closer to differentiating sources in that a specific, accurate piece of information is needed, rather than a broad understanding.
*   **English proficiency:** Students need enough English to articulate the relationship between the battle and British power, ideally using terms like "dominance," "control," or explaining the "puppet nawab." The "King's questions" and "Fundamental Rights" allow for very fragmented answers and still score. The Plassey question demands a slightly more complete sentence structure to convey the cause-effect relationship clearly.
*   **Risk of blank responses:** Historical questions that demand specific names, dates, and impacts often lead to blank responses if students haven't internalized the information well.

The Plassey question is more challenging than listing fundamental rights or the king's questions because it requires connecting a cause to a *specific* effect that goes beyond simple recall of a name. It's more complex than defining terms (archaeological/literary sources) as it's about a specific event's *consequence*. However, it's less abstract and open-ended than finding a poem's theme.

The prompt warns that teachers overestimate student performance. "Plassey" is a crucial historical topic, so one might instinctively think more students know it. But connecting it precisely to "expansion of British power" and specifically mentioning Bengal or a puppet ruler, especially with limited English, will be difficult for many. The average pass rate is 29%, so I'm looking for something around that middle ground, but slightly above or below based on nuance.

The difficulty is probably between the 15% (differentiate sources, which requires two distinct pieces of info) and 30% (favorite season, which is more open-ended but still demands multiple sentences). The "King's questions" at 50% is about simple recall of short phrases. The "Plassey" question requires slightly more complex sentence formation to explain a consequence, not just list items. The specificity of the rubric (political dominance over Bengal/puppet nawab) is the critical hurdle. Many might know Plassey led to "British rule" but might struggle to articulate *how* or *where*
