Here's my thinking process to arrive at the estimate:

1.  **Analyze the Question:** "Define fable."
    *   **Core concepts:** "short story," "animals as characters," "moral lesson."
    *   **Complexity:** This requires recall of a specific literary definition. It's not inferential or creative.
    *   **Language requirement:** Moderate English proficiency to understand "define" and to articulate the three core concepts.

2.  **Analyze the Rubric:** "Defines fable as a short story that typically uses animals as characters and imparts a moral lesson."
    *   All three elements are crucial for a full score. Even a student mentioning only "moral lesson" might not get a point, as the rubric implies completeness.

3.  **Consider the Target Audience:** Class 8 Indian government school students, economically weaker sections, limited English, 29% average pass rate.
    *   **English proficiency:** This is the biggest hurdle. Even if they know the *concept* of a fable in their native language, translating it accurately and concisely into English is difficult.
    *   **"Basic" concepts:** "Fable" might be taught, but is it a consistently *recalled* definition, especially under exam pressure and with limited English practice? It's not like "fundamental rights" which has broader civic importance.
    *   **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** Many will simply leave it blank if they're unsure.

4.  **Calibrate Against Anchors:**

    *   **5% anchor: "Theme of a poem."** Very difficult. Requires interpretation and abstract thinking in English. "Happiness is found in innocence" got a point, but many struggled. Defining "fable" is less abstract than interpreting a poem's theme, but still requires accurate recall.

    *   **15% anchor: "Differentiate archaeological and literary sources."** This requires *two* definitions and a comparison, *plus* an example for each. More demanding than defining one term. The 15% rate suggests that even basic definitions are hard. The example that got a '2' shows pretty good understanding, but even '1' scores were sparse. Defining "fable" is arguably simpler than *differentiating* two complex concepts, but still involves recalling specific attributes.

    *   **30% anchor: "Short paragraph on 'My favorite season.'"** This is creative writing with prompts. Many students can talk about simple things (winter, sweater, tea). Even simple lists sometimes scored. While this allows for more open-ended answers and personal experience, it shows that extended, grammatically correct writing is challenging. Defining "fable" is a *much* shorter and more direct answer, but with specific content requirements.

    *   **50% anchor: "Three questions the king wanted to answer?"** This is direct recall from a story they *read*. If they read the story and remembered the plot points, this is relatively easy. This is the closest in *type* to "Define fable" (both recall-based). However, story plot points are often easier to remember than abstract literary definitions. The provided examples show many *start* the answer but don't finish the three points or have grammatical errors. This tells me even simple recall of text-based facts is only achievable by half the class.

    *   **66% anchor: "Name any two Fundamental Rights."** This is rote memorization of civics. It's highly likely to be covered repeatedly in their curriculum and potentially in their local language as well. The examples show direct recall works. Defining "fable" is less high-stakes memorization than "Fundamental Rights."

5.  **Synthesize and Estimate:**

    *   **Too low for 5%:** Defining a fable is more straightforward than finding a poem's theme.
    *   **Higher than 15%:** Differentiating two concepts and giving examples is significantly harder. "Define fable" is a single definition.
    *   **Lower than 30%:** Writing a simple paragraph about a favorite season allows for more flexibility and simpler language, even if basic. A precise definition requires accuracy.
    *   **Probably lower than 50%:** Recalling plot points from a story is generally easier for students than recalling a specific, somewhat abstract literary term, especially when struggling with English. The "king's questions" directly test if they *understood* the premise of a story, which is fundamental to reading comprehension. "Define fable" is a step *beyond* basic reading comprehension to specific literary terminology.
    *   **Much lower than 66%:** Not a high-priority, heavily repeated memorization item like fundamental rights.

    *   **Considering common pitfalls:**
        *   "Short story" only: Many might get this far but miss
