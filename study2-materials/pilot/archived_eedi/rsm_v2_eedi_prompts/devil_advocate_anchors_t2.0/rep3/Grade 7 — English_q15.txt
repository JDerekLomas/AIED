Here's my calibrated estimate for the "My Favourite Hobby" question, challenging my initial assumptions:

**Initial thoughts (and why I'm challenging them):**

*   **"Most students have a hobby, so they'll be able to write about it easily."** This assumes strong English vocabulary, sentence structure, and the ability to articulate "why they enjoy it" beyond simple words like "fun" or "good." Many students, especially those with limited English exposure, struggle to move beyond basic factual descriptions.
*   **"It's only 4-5 sentences, that's not much."** For students struggling with even basic sentence formation, crafting 4-5 coherent sentences, ensuring they cover the specific points (what, when, why), and staying on topic is a significant challenge. The paragraph structure itself might be a barrier for some who are more accustomed to short, point-form answers.
*   **"They've probably practiced descriptive writing."** While they might have practiced "my pet" or "my house," the structure and requirements here (specifically mentioning 'what, when, why') combined with the paragraph length can trip up those who rely on rote learning or don't fully grasp the instructions.
*   **"The prompt is simple."** While conceptually simple for a fluent speaker, translating personal experience into accurate English with correct grammar and spelling to meet the rubric (complete paragraph, clearly mentions hobby, when, why) is a hurdle. Look at the "My favorite season" examples – many struggled with length and coherence despite it being a similar "personal experience" prompt.

**Calibrating with the anchors:**

*   **"My favorite season" (30% pass rate):** This is the closest in format. Students often gave very short, fragmented responses, or just lists of words, rather than complete paragraphs. The average pass rate suggests that achieving a *good* paragraph structure and coherence, even on a personal topic, is tough. This question has a similar ask: a paragraph, with specific content requirements.
*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50% pass rate):** This required recalling factual information from a text. Students struggled even with direct recall, leading to partial answers or blank responses. While "hobby" is personal, the need to structure it into specific categories ('when,' 'why') adds complexity beyond simple recall.
*   **"Theme of 'The Last Bargain'" (5% pass rate):** This shows how low the rate can be for abstract thought or literary analysis, which isn't the case here, but it highlights the baseline of struggle.
*   **"Differentiate archaeological/literary sources" (15% pass rate):** Requires analytical thought and structured comparison, which is harder than the hobby question but still shows how many struggle to produce *structured* academic responses.
*   **"Fundamental Rights" (66% pass rate):** This is a direct recall of specific terms, which can be rote-learned and is simpler in structure. This isn't comparable in writing demands.

**Re-evaluating "My Favourite Hobby":**

The demand for a coherent, structured paragraph of 4-5 sentences, hitting all three specific points (what, when, why), in functional English, pushes this beyond a simple recall task. Many students will likely:

1.  Write too few sentences.
2.  Not clearly articulate "when" or "why," possibly just stating "it is fun."
3.  Have significant grammatical and spelling errors that might impact understanding.
4.  Produce fragmented sentences instead of a flowing paragraph.
5.  Struggle to elaborate enough to meet the sentence count without filler or repetition.
6.  Leave it blank due to anxiety or not knowing how to start.

Comparing to the "My favorite season" (30%) anchor, this prompt for "My Favourite Hobby" is very similar. If anything, articulating *why* you enjoy something can be slightly harder than just describing what happens in a season. Given the observed performance on a similar task, and acknowledging the difficulty in forming complete, coherent paragraphs, especially for "why," I expect the pass rate to be comparable, perhaps slightly lower than "My favourite season" if the "why" requirement is interpreted strictly by the scorer.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 28%**
