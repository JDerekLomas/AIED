I will consider the provided calibration anchors and the described student population to estimate the proportion of correct answers.

The question asks students to identify a line from a poem they like and explain why. This requires:
1.  **Reading Comprehension:** Students need to have read and understood the poem, or at least remember parts of it, to pick a line. The poem isn't provided here, but students would have access to it in the actual exam. Assuming "The Last Bargain" from the first anchor is the poem in question. This poem might be familiar to them, or it might be new.
2.  **Recall/Selection:** Being able to recall or pinpoint a specific line they "like."
3.  **Basic Expression (English):** Formulating a simple sentence to explain *why* they like that line. This "why" can be very basic.

Let's break down the difficulty compared to the anchors:

*   **Anchor (5% pass rate):** "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" This requires abstract thinking and synthesizing the poem's meaning, then articulating it clearly. This is a very high-level skill, explaining the low pass rate.
*   **Anchor (15% pass rate):** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each." This requires factual recall, understanding a specific historical concept, and applying it with examples. It's structured and relies on rote learning but also conceptual understanding.
*   **Anchor (30% pass rate):** "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'" This is a personal reflection, but it demands writing a *paragraph* with several sentences and incorporating specific details (what they like to do, eat, wear). The length requirement and specificity increase difficulty for those with limited English.
*   **Anchor (50% pass rate):** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" This is a direct recall question from a specific story (presumably a common one like "The Three Questions"). If the story is well-known or recently studied, this is relatively easy. The answers are quite specific.
*   **Anchor (66% pass rate):** "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India." This is pure factual recall of something generally taught in civics. It requires only naming two items.

**Analyzing the current question ("Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"):**

*   **Selecting a line:** This is relatively easy if the poem is provided. Even if they don't fully understand the poem, they can pick a line that *looks* interesting or that they can somewhat understand. This part is easier than summarizing a theme.
*   **Explaining "why":** This is the more challenging part for students with limited English.
    *   They don't need a sophisticated explanation. A simple reason like "because it is beautiful" or "because it tells about hard work" or "because I feel happy when I read it" would likely be sufficient for partial credit or even full credit on a rubric with "mentions why."
    *   The "why" is personal, so there's no single correct answer, which can be liberating but also daunting for some students who look for a definitive right answer.
    *   It tests creative expression and basic opinion articulation, not just factual recall.

**Comparison with Anchors:**

*   **Harder than:** Naming fundamental rights (66%) because it requires more than just two words; asking the king's questions (50%) because that's direct recall, whereas this is personal choice + explanation.
*   **Easier than:** Writing a theme (5%) or differentiating historical sources (15%) which demand much deeper conceptual understanding and analytical skills. Also easier than a 6-8 line paragraph (30%) due to lower length requirements and less structured demands.

**Considering student challenges:**
*   **Limited English:** Students may struggle to articulate *why* they like a line, even if they understand the line. Their "why" might be very simplistic or poorly worded.
*   **Anxiety/Unfamiliarity:** Some students might just pick a random line and offer a generic reason, or leave it blank if they don't know *what* to write for "why."
*   **Absence/Lack of Study:** If they haven't read/understood the poem at all, selecting a line and explaining it becomes a pure guess.

Given that even simplistic explanations are likely acceptable ("mentions why"), and they don't need a *good* reason, just *a* reason, it lowers the bar somewhat. Many students will be able to at least point to a line and attempt a very short, simple reason. However, "limited English
