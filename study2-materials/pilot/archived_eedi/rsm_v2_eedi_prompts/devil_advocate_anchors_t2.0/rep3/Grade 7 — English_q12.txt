This question requires an understanding of active and passive voice, subject-verb agreement in passive constructions, and irregular past participle forms ("blown").

Considering the calibration anchors:
*   The 5% item (identifying a theme) is conceptually difficult and requires interpretive English skills.
*   The 15% item (differentiating sources) is definitional but requires generating two distinct examples.
*   The 30% item (short paragraph on "My favorite season") allows for basic expression but often yields very minimal responses, suggesting even free expression is a hurdle.
*   The 50% item (recalling three specific questions) requires basic comprehension and memory of a text, but still sees many blank responses.
*   The 66% item (naming two Fundamental Rights) is quite straightforward recall of taught material, allowing for simple lists.

The current question ("The wind blew the leaves away") demands a specific grammatical transformation. While active/passive voice might be covered, applying it correctly requires:
1.  Identifying the object ("the leaves").
2.  Making it the new subject.
3.  Choosing the correct form of "to be" ("were" because "leaves" is plural and the original tense is past).
4.  Knowing the past participle of "blow" ("blown").
5.  Optionally (but ideal for full credit), adding "by the wind."

Students with limited English or who struggle with grammatical structures are very likely to get this wrong or provide an incomplete answer. Many might not know "blown," or might simply swap the subject and object without changing the verb structure. The "My favorite season" item shows how limited basic writing can be, and this is a much more specific grammatical task. The high rates of blank or very short answers in the other items also suggest a low threshold for attempting complex tasks.

Given that the average pass rate is 29% and this requires specific grammatical knowledge that is often a stumbling block even for native speakers learning grammar, I'd place it below the 50% comprehension-based item but possibly slightly above the theme identification or source differentiation which requires more sophisticated thinking or dual recall. It's similar in a way to recalling facts, but involves transformation, which adds complexity.

My initial thought might be around 35-40% because it's a "standard grammar topic." However, challenging that assumption:
*   Limited English makes understanding the instruction and performing the transformation much harder.
*   "Basic concepts aren't basic": passive voice is a hurdle for many.
*   Knowing the irregular past participle ("blown") is a common sticking point.
*   Many will likely provide answers like "The leaves blew away by the wind" or "The leaves was blowed by the wind."

The "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66%) is much simpler recall. "What were the three questions..." (50%) is recall from a story. This active-passive transformation requires active grammatical processing.

I'd estimate this question to be slightly harder than the 30% item, which allowed for simple paragraphs but often yielded poor results, and easier than the 15% differentiation item which needed examples. It requires precise linguistic knowledge.
