I will break down the thought process for estimating the proportion correct.

1.  **Analyze the Question:**
    *   "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."
    *   Keywords: "two," "major," "mountain ranges," "India."
    *   Task: Recall and list.

2.  **Analyze the Rubric:**
    *   "Names one correct mountain range..." (e.g., Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats).
    *   Max score: 0.5. This means even if they only name one, they get partial credit (0.5 points, which implies if the max possible score for *all* answers on the exam were 100, getting 0.5 would count as correct enough for the pass rate metric). The prompt asks for "proportion correct," so "correct" for this specific question implies getting the 0.5.

3.  **Initial Instinct & Challenge:**
    *   *First instinct:* This seems relatively easy. "Himalayas" is a very common answer, and many might know at least one other (Aravallis, Western Ghats, Vindhyas). Maybe 60-70%?
    *   *Challenge:* "Teachers and experts consistently MISJUDGE item difficulty." Remember the demographic: "economically weaker sections with limited English. Average pass rate is about 29%."
        *   "Limited English" – while the names of mountain ranges might be the same in local languages, recall/spelling in English could be an issue for some.
        *   "Absent for this topic" – basic geography might not be consistently covered or retained, especially if teaching quality varies.
        *   "Exam anxiety causes blank responses" – a significant factor for students who aren't confident.
        *   "Many students have never practiced this exact question type" – simple recall for two specific items might be harder than assumed if not explicitly taught this way.

4.  **Calibrate using Anchors:**

    *   **66% Anchor:** "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India."
        *   This is pure recall, similar to the mountain range question.
        *   Topics: Civics/Political Science, a core part of Indian curriculum.
        *   Common answers: Right to Equality, Right to Freedom. These are heavily emphasized.
        *   Result: 66%. This is quite high. Why? Because it's fundamental knowledge repeated often.

    *   **50% Anchor:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"
        *   This is recall from a specific story/prose passage (likely from their English reader).
        *   Requires: comprehension of a text and remembering specific details.
        *   Result: 50%. A reasonable drop from Fundamental Rights.

    *   **30% Anchor:** "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season.""
        *   Creative writing, personal expression. Seems easier, but the *paragraph structure, line count, and specific content points* make it harder for the target group.
        *   Result: 30%. Shows how much students struggle with even "easy" writing tasks when format/length are specified.

    *   **15% Anchor:** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each."
        *   Requires: higher-order thinking (differentiation), definition, and example.
        *   Result: 15%. This is complex for the group.

    *   **5% Anchor:** "Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain.""
        *   Requires: high-level comprehension, abstract thinking (theme identification), and articulation.
        *   Result: 5%. Extremely difficult.

5.  **Re-evaluate the Mountain Ranges Question in light of anchors:**

    *   The mountain ranges question is pure *recall* of factual geographic information. It's most similar in *task type* to the "Fundamental Rights" question (66%).
    *   *Difference from Fundamental Rights:* Fundamental Rights are often drilled repeatedly due to their importance in civics. Geographic names *might* not have the same level of repetition or salience for every student, especially for the *second* mountain range. However, "Himalayas" is exceptionally prominent.
    *   The rubric helps: "Names *one* correct mountain range" gets 0.5 points, counting as "correct." This significantly *lowers* the bar for success compared to needing *two*. Knowing "Himalayas" alone will suffice.
    *   Many students *will* know "Himalayas." What about a
