I will break down the thought process for estimating the proportion correct.

1.  **Analyze the Question:**
    *   "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan." - This part requires recall of specific facts.
    *   "and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there." - This part requires not just recall, but also a basic understanding of cause-and-effect or application, and the ability to articulate it.
    *   Target audience: Class 6, Indian government schools, economically weaker sections, limited English.

2.  **Evaluate Each Part of the Question Separately for Difficulty (Initial Gut Feeling before Calibration):**

    *   **Part 1: Mention two natural resources from Rajasthan.**
        *   Rajasthan is known for its desert environment. Many students, even with limited exposure, might associate it with "sand" (though not usually considered a *primary* natural resource in this context, it's abundant) or "water scarcity" (implying water as a resource).
        *   Marble, sandstone, copper, zinc, salt are major resources, but might be less commonly taught or remembered at a general Class 6 level across the board, especially for those not explicitly from mining regions.
        *   Solar energy/sunlight and wind energy are plausible as well, given the increasing focus on renewables.
        *   The prompt asks for *any two*. This lowers the bar somewhat.
        *   *Initial thought:* Moderately difficult. Maybe 40-50% could get at least one, and perhaps 25-35% could get two correct specific ones, or at least one plausible one like "water" and then struggle for the second.

    *   **Part 2: Explain how one of them influences lives.**
        *   This requires slightly more than rote memorization. It asks for a simple connection.
        *   If a student names "water," they could say "lack of water means people struggle for farming, have to travel far." This is a straightforward impact.
        *   If they name "salt" (Sambhar Salt Lake), they could say "people make a living from salt."
        *   If they name "marble/sandstone," they might say "used for buildings, creates jobs."
        *   The *English requirement* here is crucial. "Explain" demands more sentence construction than simply listing.
        *   *Initial thought:* More difficult than just listing. Probably only 20-30% could articulate a basic influence in a coherent way, even if simple sentences.

    *   **Combining them:** Both parts need to be mostly correct to get the full score. The rubric is "Mentions two correct natural resources AND explains how one of them influences..." (Implicit "AND" for full credit if the question is marked 1/0). The sample rubric implies 1 for a successful attempt, which would likely mean both parts are somewhat addressed.

3.  **Consult Calibration Anchors:**

    *   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of a poem.** Requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and expression. Very low pass rate confirms difficulty of abstract English expression. *Our question: Requires recall + simple explanation. Less abstract than a poem theme.*
    *   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources.** Requires definition of two terms and differentiation. "Archaeological sources are physical objects such as corn tools building..." - this got a 1. So, specific factual recall *and* basic definition is still tough. *Our question: Recall of two facts + a simpler, applied explanation. Comparable difficulty to definition, maybe slightly easier on the explanation part because it's practical.*
    *   **Item (pass rate 30%): Short paragraph on "My favorite season."** Personal writing, structured around prompts (what you like to do, eat/wear). "Rainy season... I am so enjoy... fastly Growing plants..." This is basic English and gets full marks (3). This is crucial. It shows that *if students can identify key facts and describe simple effects in simple, even broken, English, they can pass a question like this.* *Our question: Similar demand for simple descriptive English, but on a factual topic rather than personal preference.*
    *   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer?** Pure factual recall from a specific story. "the right time to do everything, the right thing to do and the right people to work with..." got a 1. High pass rate suggests rote recall from a familiar text is easier. *Our question: Factual recall (resources) + application (influence). The recall part is similar to this 50% anchor, but the application part adds difficulty.*
    *   **Item (pass rate 66
