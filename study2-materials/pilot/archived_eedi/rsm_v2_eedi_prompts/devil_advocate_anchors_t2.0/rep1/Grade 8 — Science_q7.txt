I'll break down the thought process to arrive at the estimate.

1.  **Analyze the Question:**
    *   "A gardener has collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit." - This sets the context of composting.
    *   "Does gardener notice any change after some days?" - Direct question requiring a "yes" or "no" and some elaboration. This is the first hurdle.
    *   "Give reasons" - Requires understanding *why* the changes occur (decomposition).
    *   "and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health" - Requires a judgment (beneficial) and explanation (adds nutrients, improves structure).

2.  **Deconstruct Difficulty Layers for the Target Audience (Class 8, economically weaker, limited English, low pass rate):**

    *   **Vocabulary/Concepts:**
        *   "Waste of plants, vegetables and fruits": Likely understood as "kudda" (garbage/refuse).
        *   "Pit": Understood.
        *   "Change": Understood.
        *   "Reasons": Understood.
        *   "Evaluate": Might be tricky if not explicitly taught to "explain the good/bad."
        *   "Beneficial": Potentially difficult word for some. They might understand "good."
        *   "Soil health": Basic science concept.

    *   **Core Knowledge (Science/Biology):**
        *   Do they know about decomposition? This is a fundamental concept in lower secondary science, often covered under topics like waste management, environment, or agriculture. However, rote learning often focuses on definitions, not practical application.
        *   Do they know that decomposed organic matter is good for soil (manure/compost)? This is also a common environmental science point.

    *   **English Language Demands:**
        *   The question structure is reasonably straightforward.
        *   Answering "Yes, there is a change" is easy.
        *   Stating "it decomposes" or "it rots" or "it turns into manure" are simple phrases.
        *   Explaining *why* (microbes/bacteria) might be hard to articulate for those with limited English. They might just say "it happens."
        *   Explaining *beneficial* requires a simple sentence like "It makes the soil healthy" or "It gives nutrients to plants."

    *   **Common Pitfalls/Student Behavior (from calibration anchors):**
        *   **Empty responses:** Significant proportion.
        *   **Partial understanding, incomplete answers:** Very common (e.g., just "yes" or "it changes").
        *   **Limited vocabulary:** Simple answers, possibly grammatically incorrect but conveying core idea.
        *   **Missing abstract concepts:** Understanding *decomposition* itself might be present, but articulating it as a *reason* could be the issue.
        *   **Lack of linking ideas:** Connecting "changes" to "beneficial for soil health" in a coherent sentence.

3.  **Evaluate Against Calibration Anchors:**

    *   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, nuanced vocabulary, and ability to summarize. Much harder. This question is less abstract.
    *   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** Requires recall of two distinct categories *and* examples. Often a definition-recall question. "Reasons" in our question is similar to an "explanation" but less about precise recall of academic terms.
    *   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph "My favorite season"):** Requires personal expression, creativity, sustained writing, and addressing multiple prompts (what to do, eat, wear). The students who passed here often gave very short, bullet-point answers but showed effort. *This is a crucial comparison.* Our question is more direct knowledge recall, but still requires simple sentences.
    *   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted):** Pure factual recall of specific details from a story. If they knew the story, it was relatively easy. If not, they got 0. This suggests that basic recall, when direct, can be 50% *if* the material was explicitly covered and remembered.
    *   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Another direct factual recall question, likely from civics/political science. If memorized, easy. The "average pass rate of 29%" suggests not everyone memorized these.

4.  **Synthesize and Estimate:**

    *   The question *does* touch on a basic science concept (decomposition/composting). It's plausible many students would have heard of it.
    *   The first part ("Does gardener notice any change after some days?") is very easy to answer "
