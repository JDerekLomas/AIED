I'll go through the reasoning process.

**1. Initial Gut Feeling:**
My first instinct, based on knowing active/passive voice is a fairly common grammar concept taught in English, is that a decent chunk of students would get this. Maybe 40-50%.

**2. Challenging the Gut Feeling (Applying Calibration Anchors and Warnings):**

*   **Limited English & "Basic" Concepts:** The prompt explicitly warns about students' limited English and that "basic" isn't basic. Active/passive voice involves understanding sentence structure, verb tenses (past simple to past continuous with a past participle), and prepositions ("by"). This is more complex than simply identifying a word or copying text.
*   **"The Last Bargain" (5% pass rate):** Writing a theme is very open-ended and requires strong comprehension and expressive skills. Our target question is much more structured.
*   **Archaeological vs. Literary Sources (15% pass rate):** Differentiating concepts and providing examples, even with some keywords present, shows that conceptual understanding and applying it correctly is hard. Active/passive requires similar conceptual understanding and application. The examples for 15% are often incomplete or fragmented, suggesting that students might *partially* get the idea but fail to produce a *complete, correct* answer.
*   **"My Favorite Season" (30% pass rate):** This is a creative writing task with prompts, yet only 30% manage to write a paragraph with basic details. The writing ability of the student receiving "Winter\nSweater\nBaju" is very low, indicating that sentence construction itself is a challenge. The passive voice requires specific sentence construction.
*   **King's Three Questions (50% pass rate):** This is recall, *if* they remember the story. It's often direct quotes or near-quotes. This is much easier than transforming a sentence grammatically.
*   **Fundamental Rights (66% pass rate):** This is recall of specific terms, which can be rote memorization. It doesn't require complex grammatical transformation or deep conceptual understanding, just remembering specific phrases. The blank/gibberish responses even at 66% indicate how many students struggle with basic recall, let alone complex transformations.

**3. Applying Specific Difficulties to the Target Question:**

*   **Identifying Subject/Object/Verb:** Students first need to correctly identify "wind" (subject), "blew" (verb), "leaves" (object).
*   **Switching Roles:** Understanding that the object ("leaves") becomes the new subject.
*   **Auxiliary Verb + Past Participle:** This is the biggest hurdle.
    *   The tense must remain the same (past simple -> past simple). So "blew" becomes "were blown."
    *   Students need to know "was/were" (singular/plural agreement with the new subject "leaves").
    *   They need to know the past participle of "blow," which is "blown" (irregular verb). This is often a major sticking point for learners. Many might use "blowed."
*   **"by the wind":** They need to remember to include the original agent, preceded by "by."
*   **"away":** Positioning adverbs correctly.

**4. Recalibration:**

The challenges with verb tenses (irregular past participles) and the full construction "were blown by the wind" are significant. Looking at the "My Favorite Season" (30%) examples, sentence construction is very rudimentary for many. The 15% item for differentiating sources shows conceptual understanding and application are hard.

While active/passive is taught, actual *mastery* to apply it consistently and correctly, especially with irregular verbs and specific structure rules, is much lower in this population than rote memorization or simple recall.

I expect a lot of "the leaves blown by the wind," or "the leaves blowed away by the wind," or simply leaving out parts, or trying to use the present tense. Many will leave it blank due to anxiety or not knowing the past participle.

The task is closer in complexity to "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources" (15%), which requires understanding concepts and applying them. The active/passive voice transformation also requires understanding grammatical concepts and applying a specific transformation rule, including recalling an irregular past participle. It's more structured than finding a theme (5%) but significantly harder than recalling names (50-66%). The sentence writing capabilities suggested by the 30% anchor also don't instill confidence.

Given the warnings about expert overestimation and students' limited English, irregular verbs are often a huge problem.

**Final Estimate:**

I'm leaning closer to the 15-20% range. It's not *pure recall*,
