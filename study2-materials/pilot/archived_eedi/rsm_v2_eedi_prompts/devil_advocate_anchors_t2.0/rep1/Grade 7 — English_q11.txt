The question asks students to identify an adjective phrase, but the rubric clarifies that a correct answer is simply identifying "tiny" as an adjective. This simplifies the task significantly.

Let's break down the difficulty:
*   **English proficiency:** "Tiny bird" is a common, relatively simple phrase. "Adjective" might be a new or not fully understood term for some, but the core task is about identifying a describing word.
*   **Concept understanding:** Identifying a descriptive word is a fundamental grammatical concept usually introduced early in English language learning. However, recognizing the *term* "adjective" and applying it precisely might be a hurdle for students who struggle with grammatical terminology or formal instruction. The concept of a "phrase" adds another layer of complexity that is mercifully removed by the rubric.
*   **Likely student responses:**
    *   Some will correctly identify "tiny."
    *   Many might get confused by "adjective phrase" and not respond or point to the whole sentence or "built its nest."
    *   Some might identify "our" as an adjective, which is also correct (possessive adjective) but the intended answer is likely "tiny" given the simple structure.
    *   There's a risk of students selecting "our balcony" or "in our balcony" if they confuse phrase types or miss the "adjective" part.

**Calibration:**
*   **5% "Theme of poem":** This requires interpretive skills and higher-order thinking, plus abstract language. Clearly much harder.
*   **15% "Differentiate archaeological/literary sources":** This requires specific historical knowledge and the ability to compare/contrast using formal language. More demanding than identifying a word.
*   **30% "My favorite season" paragraph:** This allows for creativity and simpler sentence structures but demands sustained writing (6-8 lines) and specific content. Many students struggle with basic sentence construction, so paragraph writing is difficult. The fact that the sample includes "Winter\nSweater\nBaju" as a passing response suggests a low bar for "paragraph" quality, but still requires more production than identifying a word.
*   **50% "Three questions the king wanted to answer":** This requires recalling specific plot details and transcribing them. It's direct recall, but students might misremember or struggle with the full phrasing. This is about information retrieval.
*   **66% "Two Fundamental Rights":** This is pure factual recall of memorized political science information. If students know the two rights, it's an easy pass. This requires memory, not analysis or composition.

Our question falls somewhere above factual recall and below paragraph composition. The "adjective phrase" instruction could mislead some, but the generous rubric (just identifying "tiny") makes it much simpler. If students understand "adjective" as a "describing word," they have a good chance with "tiny." The most common error will likely be not knowing what "adjective" means or misinterpreting "phrase."

The fact that students only need to identify one word, "tiny," and that it's clearly a descriptive word, places it on the easier end for single-concept identification. Many will likely get it wrong because of the term "adjective" itself, or confusing it with other parts of speech or other phrases.

Given that 66% could recall two Fundamental Rights, identifying a single, very obvious adjective should be within the reach of a good portion of the class. However, the grammatical terminology is a hurdle. It's not just "which word describes the bird?" but "identify the *adjective* (phrase)." Many might guess, or know what an adjective *is* even if they struggle with the full grammar of the English sentence.

Let's reconsider. Identifying "tiny" as *the* adjective is quite basic. If the question truly required an "adjective phrase," it would be much harder. But just "tiny" (which is an adjective, and also the simplest "adjective phrase" possible in this case, albeit technically not a phrase) brings the difficulty down significantly.

Compare to 50% "three questions the king wanted to answer." That required memory and longer recall. This question is a conceptual identification of a simple word type. If they know "tiny" is an adjective, they get it. If not, they don't. The limited English of students is a key factor here; grammatical terms might be poorly understood.

I'd place it higher than 30% ("My favorite season" paragraph) because it requires much less writing production. It's probably a bit harder than pure recall of "two fundamental rights" for the *average* student because abstract grammatical terms are often harder than memorized facts, especially if not well-taught or practiced. However, "tiny" is such an obvious adjective.

Perhaps around the
