I will calibrate my estimate based on the provided anchors, considering the limitations of English proficiency, prior knowledge, and exam anxiety among students from economically weaker sections.

**Analysis of the Question:**
The question asks students to write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about "My Favourite Hobby." They need to include:
1.  What the hobby is.
2.  When they do it.
3.  Why they enjoy it.

This question requires a degree of free-form expression in English, which can be challenging for students with limited English proficiency. It asks for personal reflection and structured writing (paragraph format with specific inclusions).

**Calibration against Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** This requires analytical skills and abstraction, combined with writing ability. Highly difficult. The current question is simpler conceptually.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** This requires specific subject knowledge and comparative explanation, often involving more formal language. The current question is about personal experience.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season," 6-8 lines, mention what to do, eat, wear):** This is the *most comparable* anchor. It asks for a descriptive paragraph on a personal topic with specific elements to include, similar to the "Favourite Hobby" question. The target length for the season question is 6-8 lines, whereas the hobby question is 4-5 sentences. Both require basic paragraph construction.
    *   The season responses show students can mention elements but often struggle with forming complete, coherent sentences and meeting length requirements in a structured way.
    *   One response for "My favorite season" just listed keywords: "Winter, Sweater, Baju, Hot water, Tea, Gever feali, Hat." This scored 3 (max score, suggesting the rubric might have been lenient for just listing ideas, or there was a scale involved). This makes me wonder if a list of facts for the hobby might pass. Assuming the rubric is *strictly* "writes a complete paragraph," then this style would not pass for the hobby question. However, if some level of list-like English can score, the rate might be higher. The rubric for "hobby" explicitly states "Student writes a complete paragraph that clearly mentions the hobby, when it is done, and why it is enjoyable." This suggests a higher bar than a mere list of keywords.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer?):** This requires recall of specific information from a text. If the student remembers the information, expressing it in English is relatively straightforward, as the answers are likely short phrases. The challenge is memory, not complex construction.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Name two Fundamental Rights):** This is a simple recall and listing question, requiring minimal English construction. Very straightforward if the student knows the facts.

**Challenging Assumptions:**

My first instinct might be "Many students have hobbies, so they should be able to write about it." However, recalling the common issues:
*   **Limited English:** Forming 4-5 *sentences* with clear subject-verb agreement and coherence will be a significant barrier. They might know their hobby but struggle to articulate "when I do it" or "why I enjoy it" in correct English sentences. They might resort to very fragmented or very short, simple sentences.
*   **"Basic" concepts:** "Paragraph structure" and "answering specific prompts within a narrative" are not basic for struggling learners, even in their native language, let alone English.
*   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** Many will leave it blank or write very little if they can't start or get stuck on a sentence.
*   **Never practiced:** They might not have practiced writing short descriptive paragraphs on personal topics *in English*.

The most relevant anchor is the "My favorite season" question at 30%. That question allowed for 6-8 lines, slightly more demanding on length. The hobby question asks for 4-5 *sentences*, which might feel like a stricter structural requirement than "lines."

Given the "My favorite season" question with a similar open-ended, personal paragraph requirement yielded 30%, and considering the strictness of the "complete paragraph" rubric for the hobby question (implying a list won't pass), I anticipate the hobby question might be slightly harder or at best equally difficult. Students might be able to *state* their hobby and *when* they do it with simple sentences, but "why they enjoy it" often requires more complex reasoning and vocabulary (e.g., "it relaxes me," "it makes me happy," "I learn new things").

Also, some students may genuinely not have a well-defined "hobby" they can easily articulate, or cultural backgrounds might make "le
