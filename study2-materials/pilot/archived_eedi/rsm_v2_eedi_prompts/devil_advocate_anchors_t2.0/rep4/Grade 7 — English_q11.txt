This is a trickier question than it first appears, mainly due to the specific terminology "adjective phrase" versus a simple "adjective."

Here's my breakdown using the calibration anchors and considering the student profile:

1.  **Student Profile:** Mostly economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate ~29%. Many will struggle with specific grammatical terminology.

2.  **The Question:** "Identify the adjective phrase in the sentence: A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony."
    *   The expected *correct* answer according to the rubric is "tiny," which is an adjective, not an adjective *phrase*.
    *   This discrepancy between the question and the rubric is crucial. If the rubric scores "tiny" as correct, despite the question asking for a *phrase*, then many students *might* get it right by just identifying the adjective.
    *   However, if a student actually *understands* "adjective phrase," they might get confused because "tiny" alone is an adjective. An adjective phrase modifying "bird" would be something like "tiny and grey," or "very tiny."

3.  **Analyzing "tiny" as the expected answer:**
    *   Identifying *adjectives* is a fundamental grammatical concept usually introduced early. "Tiny" is a very common word.
    *   Students from "economically weaker sections with limited English" might recognize "tiny" as describing the bird.
    *   The "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%) item suggests students can pull simple information from a text or recall basic facts. Identifying a descriptive word like "tiny" is similar in cognitive demand to simple recall or comprehension.
    *   However, even for a simple adjective, *explicitly identifying* it as "the adjective" can be hard for students who haven't extensively practiced grammar labeling.

4.  **Impact of "adjective phrase" terminology:**
    *   This is the major confounding factor. Even if a student knows "tiny" is an adjective, the word "phrase" might throw them off completely. They might skip the question, or try to guess a multi-word sequence.
    *   Compare to "Name any two Fundamental Rights..." (66%). That's specific factual recall, but less abstract than grammatical labeling.
    *   Compare to "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15%). This requires higher-order thinking and specialized vocabulary. While "adjective phrase" isn't as high-order, the "phrase" part makes it more specialized than simply "adjective."

5.  **Reconciling the Question/Rubric Conflict:**
    *   If the rubric genuinely scores *only* "tiny," then the question setters have either simplified the expectation greatly or poorly phrased the question.
    *   If students have been taught to identify adjectives and "adjective phrases" are either new or conflated with single adjectives in their curriculum, then it's plausible they might put "tiny."

6.  **Considering student struggles:**
    *   **Limited English:** Many might not even know "adjective" or "phrase." They just understand the meaning of "tiny."
    *   **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** Grammar questions often lead to blanks if the terminology is unfamiliar.
    *   **"Basic" concepts not basic:** Identifying an adjective might be basic in a well-resourced school, but in a struggling context, it might be taught abstractly or skipped.
    *   **"Never practiced this exact question type":** Many might have practiced identifying adjectives, but not specifically "adjective *phrase*" where the expected answer is a single word. This feels like a "trick" question because of the phrasing.

**Calibration:**

*   **Higher than 15% (differentiate sources):** It's not as conceptually demanding as differentiating and giving examples. Identifying a single word from a sentence is less complex.
*   **Lower than 50% (king's questions):** While identifying a word is simple, the *grammatical label* makes it harder than simple recall. Many will miss it because of the "phrase" part. The 50% anchor also involves some level of direct retrieval of information, not abstract identification.
*   **Likely closer to 30% (favorite season paragraph):** That item, despite being writing, allows for simple responses ("Winter / Sweater / Baju...") for partial credit. This adjective question, if "tiny" is the *only* full credit answer, has less room for partial correctness (e.g., if they pick "bird" or "our"). However, the 30% item requires producing original language, which can be harder than identifying from given text.

**The Crux:** The primary difficulty will come from the term "adjective phrase"
