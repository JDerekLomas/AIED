I will estimate the proportion of Class 6 students in Indian government schools who would correctly answer the question about natural resources in Rajasthan.

Here's my thinking process, applying the calibration anchors and warnings:

1.  **Analyze the question:** "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."
    *   **Part 1: Identify two natural resources.** This is a recall task. Students would need to have learned about Rajasthan's geography and resources specifically. Common knowledge items like "water" or "sunlight" might be easier, but others like "copper," "mica," "gypsum" require specific factual knowledge.
    *   **Part 2: Explain influence.** This requires a slightly higher level of understanding and expression. Students need to connect a resource to human activity or lifestyle.

2.  **Consider student profile:**
    *   **Limited English:** "Explain how...influences the lives" is a more complex sentence structure and requires more vocabulary than just listing. This will be a significant hurdle.
    *   **Economically weaker sections:** Exposure to diverse resources and geographical knowledge might be limited outside the curriculum.
    *   **Average pass rate 29%:** This is crucial context. Many questions are hard for this group.
    *   **Anxiety/Blank responses:** Some students will leave it empty.

3.  **Calibrate with anchors:**

    *   **Pass rate 5%:** Theme of a poem. Highly abstract, requires deep understanding and interpretation, then expression in English. "Influence" explanation could be somewhat abstract.
    *   **Pass rate 15%:** Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources with examples. Requires definition of two abstract terms and specific examples. More complex than just naming two things. Explaining the *influence* is closer to this level than just listing.
    *   **Pass rate 30%:** Short paragraph "My favorite season." Requires sustained writing, organizing thoughts, and specific details. While personal, it still demands more structured English than simple recall. The "explanation" part of our question moves it towards this level.
    *   **Pass rate 50%:** Three questions the king wanted to answer. A direct recall from a story. If the story was well-known or recently covered, it's easier. Naming two resources could be similar if the topic was just covered.
    *   **Pass rate 66%:** Name any two Fundamental Rights. Direct recall of specific legal terms. This is a clear, discrete factual recall. If students *know* two resources, this part is relatively easy.

4.  **Evaluate each part of the target question:**

    *   **Naming two resources:** If "water," "sunlight," "sand," "salt" are considered, these might be moderately common knowledge for students in India, especially related to a desert state like Rajasthan. Other specific minerals (copper, gypsum, mica) would require more direct instruction. If students are expected to pick *any* two, then the probability of getting simple ones increases. This part alone could be in the 40-50% range.
    *   **Explaining influence:** This is where the difficulty spikes due to English proficiency and the need for connected thought.
        *   Example for water: "Water helps in farming" or "Water is used for drinking and living." (Simple)
        *   Example for marble: "Marble is used to build houses/palaces" (Simple)
        *   Example for solar/wind energy: "Sunlight is used to make electricity" (Moderately simple)

5.  **Re-assess the whole task:**
    *   To get 1 mark, students need to correctly name two resources AND provide a *sensible* explanation for *one*. The bar for "explanation" in this context is likely low (as seen in the paragraph example, "Sweater Baju Hot water Tea" got 3/3 for a paragraph).
    *   Many students might name two resources but fail on the explanation due to language, or their explanation might be too basic to be scored.
    *   Some might name one resource, but not two, or get the explanation wrong.
    *   The "differentiate" question (15%) involved specific factual knowledge and distinguishing between abstract concepts. The "explain influence" is less abstract, but requires synthesis.
    *   The "favorite season" (30%) involved personal writing. Our question requires factual recall *and* application/explanation.

6.  **Synthesize and challenge initial instinct:** My first instinct might be around 40-45% because "water" and "sunlight" are so common. However, the requirement for *two* resources *and* an *explanation* brings it down. The English
