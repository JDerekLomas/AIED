I need to estimate the pass rate for the question: "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?" based on the provided calibration anchors and understanding the context of Class 8 Indian government school students.

Let's break down the cognitive demands of the target question:
1.  **Recall/Knowledge:** Students need to know about the Battle of Plassey and its direct aftermath.
2.  **Causal Linkage:** They need to connect the *victory* in this battle to the *expansion of British power*. This requires understanding the political consequences.
3.  **Specific Detail (implied by rubric):** The rubric specifically mentions "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal" and "placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab." This means a general answer like "it made the British powerful" might not be enough for a full score, but mentioning control over Bengal or Mir Jafar would be ideal.
4.  **English Language:** Students need to articulate this in basic English.

Now, let's compare this to the calibration anchors:

*   **Pass rate 5%:** "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'"
    *   **Cognitive demand:** Requires interpretation, abstract thinking (theme), and expressing it. English proficiency for expressing abstract ideas is higher. The example responses show students struggling to form coherent ideas even with limited English.
*   **Pass rate 15%:** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each."
    *   **Cognitive demand:** Requires recall of two distinct concepts, understanding their differences, and providing examples. This is definition/categorization. One example given is basic (physical objects vs. written).
*   **Pass rate 30%:** "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'"
    *   **Cognitive demand:** Personal narrative, requiring basic sentence construction and ideas about daily life. It's less about factual recall and more about expressing personal experience. Responses are often list-like or very short.
*   **Pass rate 50%:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"
    *   **Cognitive demand:** Direct factual recall from a specific story (presumably taught). The questions are very specific ("right time to do everything, the right thing to do and the right people to work with"). Many students can likely memorize and reproduce these. The responses confirm this direct recall.
*   **Pass rate 66%:** "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India."
    *   **Cognitive demand:** Direct factual recall of two specific items from a list (Fundamental Rights). This is highly memorized and frequently reinforced. Even basic names are accepted.

**Analysis of the Target Question ("How did the Battle of Plassey...")**

*   **Subject Matter:** History, specifically a key event taught in Indian history. The Battle of Plassey is a foundational moment in understanding British rule. Students would have studied this.
*   **Difficulty:**
    *   **Recall:** Students *should* know about the Battle of Plassey.
    *   **Causal Link:** Understanding *how* it contributed is the crucial part. Many might remember that the British won, but fewer might articulate the *political* dominance over Bengal or the puppet nawab. They might simply say "it made British strong" which might or might not score, depending on scorer leniency for "control over Bengal".
    *   **English:** Formulating a sentence or two to explain the causal link and the concept of dominance/puppet rule can be challenging with limited English. It's more complex than simply listing names or defining terms.

*   **Comparison to anchors:**
    *   **More difficult than 66% (Fundamental Rights):** Plassey requires more than just listing. It requires explaining a *consequence* and *causal link*.
    *   **More difficult than 50% (King's questions):** Those were specific questions often memorized as a list. Here, the explanation needs synthesis.
    *   **Similar to or slightly more difficult than 30% (Favorite season paragraph):** While "favorite season" requires paragraph construction, the *content* is personal and simpler. Plassey requires factual knowledge and a specific kind of explanation that students might struggle to formulate in English, even if they grasp the concept.
    *   **Easier than 15% (Differentiating sources):** That required differentiation of two concepts and examples. Plassey is a single event, asking for its consequence. However, expressing the *political dominance* specifically might be at that level.
    *   **Easier than 5% (Poem theme):** That's abstract
