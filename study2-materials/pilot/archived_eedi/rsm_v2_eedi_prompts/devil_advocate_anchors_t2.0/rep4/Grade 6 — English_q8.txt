ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 75%

**Reasoning:**

I've considered the calibration anchors and the "challenging assumptions" advice very carefully. Here's why I landed on 75%, which is higher than the average pass rate, but lower than what many experts might instinctively guess.

*   **Simplicity of English:** The words are extremely common, basic vocabulary (book, reading, a, is, he). This is a foundational sentence structure. Even students with very limited English proficiency would likely recognize these words individually.
*   **Direct Instruction:** Sentence rearrangement is a very common type of English language exercise taught at the primary level in Indian schools, especially when learning basic sentence structure. Students would have seen this exact type of question countless times.
*   **Predictable Structure:** "He is reading a book" is the most fundamental SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. The other calibration anchors suggest that even if students can't fully elaborate or explain concepts, they can often recall basic facts or patterns. This question is primarily about pattern recognition.
*   **Comparison to Anchors:**
    *   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66%):** This involves recall of specific factual knowledge, which can be patchy. Our question is simpler in that it's applying a common linguistic rule, not recalling specific curriculum content. Many students who got the Rights wrong might still get this.
    *   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%):** This requires recall of a specific plot detail from a story, which can easily be forgotten. Rearranging a basic sentence is a more direct application of learned rules rather than memory of specific content.
    *   **"Write a short paragraph" (30%):** This requires generative writing, organization, and a larger vocabulary. Our question is much more constrained and focused on a single correct arrangement.
    *   **"Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" (15%):** This requires conceptual understanding, comparative analysis, and specific examples – a much higher cognitive load.
    *   **"Write a theme or central idea" (5%):** This is the most complex, requiring abstract thought, inference, and articulation, far beyond sentence rearrangement.
*   **Potential Hurdles (and why they aren't critical here):**
    *   **"Limited English":** While true, the words are basic. The sentence itself is what they would be learning *first*.
    *   **"Basic concepts aren't basic":** For a *sentence*, SVO is arguably one of the most basic, consistently reinforced structures.
    *   **"Exam anxiety/blank responses":** While some blanks will occur, the low cognitive demand for *this specific question* reduces the likelihood for students who might blank on more complex questions. Many might try even if unsure, as they'll likely recognize the words and common sentence order.
    *   **"Never practiced this exact question type":** This is highly unlikely for sentence rearrangement in Class 6. It's a fundamental English exercise.

While a significant portion of students will struggle with complex English, forming a very basic SVO sentence from common words is a skill that is likely taught and reinforced extensively. It represents one of the earliest stages of English grammar acquisition. The expected cognitive load is significantly lower than even the 50% anchor, making a higher percentage plausible. However, recognizing that "most" isn't 100% due to factors like absence, extreme struggles, or genuine confusion/anxiety, I've placed it below what a native speaker might achieve, but well above the average.
