The question asks to describe the poet's writing style. The rubric allows for a single, suitable word. This requires:

1.  **Understanding the term "writing style."** This is a meta-concept about literature, which can be challenging for students with limited exposure to literary analysis.
2.  **Being able to extract an understanding of the poet's style from whatever poem(s) they've studied.** Even if they know "The Last Bargain," inferring style from a single poem, and then distilling it into a single descriptive word, is a higher-order thinking skill.
3.  **Having the English vocabulary to articulate a suitable descriptive word.** Many common descriptive words (e.g., "evocative," "lyrical," "metaphorical") might be beyond their everyday vocabulary. They'd likely gravitate towards simpler words if they understood the concept at all.
4.  **Recalling or having been taught explicitly about the poet's (likely Rabindranath Tagore, given the 5% anchor item) writing style.** Without explicit instruction or extensive reading, this is a difficult inference for an EWS student.

Let's compare to anchors:

*   **5% pass rate (Theme/Central idea of poem):** This requires understanding abstract concepts and articulating them. Inferring "style" is somewhat similar in its abstract nature.
*   **15% pass rate (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** Requires conceptual understanding and examples. The "style" question is more about analysis and descriptive vocabulary.
*   **30% pass rate (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This is a personal response, largely formulaic for many students, and tests basic writing construction and simple descriptive ability. This is significantly easier.
*   **50% pass rate (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is direct recall from a story. This is much easier than inferring style.
*   **66% pass rate (Name two Fundamental Rights):** Direct factual recall from civics. Easier.

The question of "writing style" is quite abstract for students who struggle with English and complex literary concepts. While "simple" or "direct" might be suitable, generating even those requires a certain level of comprehension and analytical ability. Many might simply list the poet's name, or a general positive comment, rather than an actual descriptor of style. The "empty response" rate for this kind of question is likely high.

My first instinct might be around 20-25% as it asks for one word. But challenging that:
*   Limited English makes nuanced understanding difficult.
*   The concept of "writing style" itself might be poorly grasped.
*   Lack of explicit teaching about style.
*   Fear of making a mistake could lead to blank answers.

It's closer to the 5% "theme" question in terms of requiring abstract literary interpretation, but slightly easier as it asks for *a* word rather than a full statement/paragraph, but potentially harder because "style" can be harder to pin down than "theme" if not explicitly taught. The low vocabulary combined with abstract concept makes it tough. I think it will perform closer to the "theme" question than the definitional differentiation, as that item had some scaffolding through examples.

My revised estimate would be below 15%. I think it's more challenging than the archaeological sources (15%) because that involved categories which could be brute-forced somewhat.

Let's lean slightly below the "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources" question (15%), as this feels more open-ended and requires a nuanced understanding of an abstract concept.
