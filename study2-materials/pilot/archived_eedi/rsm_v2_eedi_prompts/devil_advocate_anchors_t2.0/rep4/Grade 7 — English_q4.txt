I need to estimate the pass rate for the question: "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason." (Max score: 1)

Let's break down the question and compare it to the calibration anchors.

**Question Analysis:**
*   **Part 1: "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life?"** This requires recalling the king's questions from the previous context (which were probably asked in the prior question with a 50% pass rate). It then asks for a personal opinion/judgment, "important in real life," which is relatively straightforward for most.
*   **Part 2: "Give one reason."** This requires a simple explanation.

**Cognitive Load/Difficulty:**
*   **Recall:** Students likely just answered the previous question "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (pass rate 50%). So the information should be fresh.
*   **Understanding "Important in real life":** This is a very common phrase and concept.
*   **Providing a "reason":** This is the crucial part. It doesn't require complex reasoning or extensive vocabulary. Even a simple, broken English sentence expressing "yes, because it helps you succeed" or "yes, because you know what to do" would likely score 1.
*   **English Proficiency:** While English is limited, "yes, important because..." and a simple subject-verb-object reason might be manageable for many, even if grammatically flawed.
*   **Topic Familiarity:** "The Three Questions" is a well-known story by Leo Tolstoy, often covered in school. This helps with comprehension.
*   **Anxiety/Blanks:** Some will still leave it blank or give irrelevant answers.

**Calibration Anchors Comparison:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'"** This requires abstract thinking, identifying themes, and articulating them clearly, which is very difficult for students with limited English and critical thinking skills. Our target question is much more concrete.

*   **Item (pass rate 15%): "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each."** This requires defining two distinct concepts, recalling specific examples for *each*, and presenting them in a comparative manner. It's conceptually more demanding and requires more factual recall than our target question.

*   **Item (pass rate 30%): "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.' Talk about what you like to do, what you eat or wear, and w"** This is a longer free-response, descriptive writing task with multiple criteria. While the topic is personal and accessible, the length and structure requirements are challenging. Our target question is a single sentence opinion + reason. The scoring seems quite lenient for this 30% item (just listing words can get 3 marks, equivalent to scoring for *writing* something), suggesting that for single, short responses, the threshold might be quite low for our question too.

*   **Item (pass rate 50%): "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"** This is direct recall of specific information from the text. Our question *presupposes* this information, then asks for an opinion and a reason. The fact that 50% *could* recall the three questions suggests a good base.

*   **Item (pass rate 66%): "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India."** This is direct factual recall, and *only* listing two. It doesn't require any explanation or opinion. The answers are very short. This is quite high, showing students can recall short, factual points when asked. Our question needs a *slightly* more elaborated response.

**Synthesizing and Adjusting:**

*   The question involves opinion and reason, which is generally easier than abstract theme identification (5%) or complex differentiation (15%).
*   It's less demanding than a multi-line paragraph (30%).
*   It builds on a concept from a 50% pass rate item, meaning many students will already have the initial understanding.
*   It's not as simple as listing two facts (66%), as it requires a "reason."

The crucial part is the "one reason." Many students struggle to articulate reasons, even simple ones, especially in a foreign language under exam pressure. However, the rubric for similar items suggests that very basic and incomplete reasons often score. For instance, in the "My favourite season" item (30%), even a list of words scored. Here, a simple, possibly fragmented "yes, it's good for life" or "yes, we will successful" could score.

Given that
