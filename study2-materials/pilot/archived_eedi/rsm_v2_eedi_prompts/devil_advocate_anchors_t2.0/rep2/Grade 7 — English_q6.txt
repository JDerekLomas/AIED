I will analyze the target question in light of the provided calibration anchors and student characteristics.

**Target Question Analysis:**
"Describes the poet’s writing style." (Rubric: Identifies a suitable and relevant word describing the writing style (e.g., simple, descriptive, informal, direct) or other appropriate word. Max score: 1)

This question requires students to:
1.  Understand the concept of "writing style."
2.  Have read the poem in question (not provided, but assume it's one they would have studied).
3.  Be able to identify an adjective that accurately describes that style.
4.  Spell that adjective correctly, or at least intelligibly.

**Considering student characteristics and expert bias:**
*   **Limited English:** While "simple" or "descriptive" are common English words, understanding "writing style" as a concept and then articulating it with an appropriate adjective might be difficult for students with limited English. They might know the *content* of the poem but struggle to metacognitively describe *how* it's written.
*   **"Basic" concepts:** For us, describing a writing style might seem basic, but for struggling learners who are primarily focused on literal comprehension, abstracting "style" can be a leap.
*   **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** This is always a factor.
*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** Students might be good at summarizing or identifying themes but might not have practiced analyzing writing style in such a concise, abstract way. They might describe *what* the poet writes about, rather than *how* they write.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme/Central Idea):** This is a conceptual question that requires a higher level of abstract thought. Students struggled with articulation and even basic understanding. "Writing style" is similarly abstract.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate sources):** This requires understanding two concepts and giving examples. It's more definitional and less subjective than describing style, yet still low. Many gave fragmented or incomplete answers.
*   **Pass Rate 30% ("My favorite season" paragraph):** This is a narrative writing task based on personal experience. Students often struggle with sentence structure and coherence even on simple topics, leading to low scores. Articulating a complex concept like "writing style" concisely might be harder than this.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is a factual recall question from a specific text. It's much more concrete. Students who read the story would likely be able to extract this information, despite poor English. Our target question is NOT factual recall.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Again, factual recall of specific memorized items. If students have learned these, they can reproduce them, even with imperfect English.

**Synthesis:**
The target question falls into the more conceptual and abstract category, similar to identifying a theme (5%) but perhaps slightly less abstract, and similar to differentiating concepts (15%). It's certainly much less straightforward than factual recall (50%, 66%) or a simple personal paragraph (30%).

The primary difficulty lies in:
1.  Grasping the abstract concept of "writing style."
2.  Recalling appropriate adjectives to describe it.
3.  Articulating that in English.

Given that students often provide descriptions of content instead of style, or struggle to find a suitable word, this question will be quite challenging. While "simple" or "direct" might come to mind for some, the general difficulty in abstract analysis, coupled with English limitations, suggests a low pass rate. It requires critical analysis beyond basic comprehension.

I lean towards the lower end of the conceptual questions, probably slightly higher than "theme" because the expected answer is a single word rather than a complete sentence or phrase expressing a complex idea. However, the requirement to specifically pinpoint *style* and not just general feelings or content is the key differentiator from slightly easier tasks.

If 15% can differentiate two historical sources, requiring precise terminology, perhaps a similar number could identify a word for style. But style can be more subjective and less "taught" as a single correct answer. Many students might offer general adjectives that don't quite fit the specific meaning of *writing style*.

My first instinct might have been 20-25% as it seems like a simple descriptive task, but applying the filters:
*   English limitations for nuanced words.
*   Abstract concept of "style."
*   Likelihood of mistaking content description for style.
*   Anxiety and blank responses.

This pulls the estimate down. It feels more akin to the 15% mark (differentiating sources) in terms of abstract vocabulary/concept application
