I will analyze the question, compare it to the calibration anchors, and then estimate the proportion of correct answers.

**Analysis of the Question:**
*   **Topic:** Active to Passive Voice transformation. This is a common grammatical concept taught in English classes.
*   **Sentence:** "The wind blew the leaves away." It's a simple past tense active voice sentence.
*   **Expected Answer:** "The leaves were blown away by the wind."
*   **Difficulty Factors:**
    *   **Grammar knowledge:** Requires understanding of subject, object, verb tense, and the rules for converting active to passive (object becomes subject, use "to be" verb in correct tense + past participle, "by" + original subject).
    *   **Vocabulary:** "wind," "blew," "leaves," "away" are relatively common words.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple SVO structure in active.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of "The Last Bargain"):** This requires comprehension of a poem, abstract thinking to identify a theme, and articulate it. The student examples show very limited understanding and writing ability, even for simple ideas. Our question is less abstract and more rule-based.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** This requires recalling definitions, differentiating concepts, and providing examples. Students struggle with articulating distinct differences. Some just list features. It requires recall of specific academic knowledge. Our question is more application-based grammar.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This is a creative writing task requiring 6-8 lines, incorporating specific elements. Even short, fractured responses get points. Students struggle with sentence structure and generating coherent thoughts, let alone a paragraph. Our question requires a single correct grammatical transformation, not an extended piece of writing.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer?):** This requires recall of specific details from a story. Many students provide fragments, showing partial recall. The question directly asks for specific memorized facts. Our question is an application of a grammatical rule, not memorization of story details.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is direct recall of civics knowledge. If they have memorized them, it's easy. It's similar to the 50% anchor but likely deemed easier because "Fundamental Rights" is a core concept taught frequently. Responses are either mostly right or completely wrong due to rote memorization.

**Challenging Assumptions & Estimation:**

My first instinct might be "this is basic grammar, maybe 40-50%." However, I need to apply the challenges:

1.  **Limited English:** Students with limited English might not fully grasp the concept of "voice" or the nuances of verb tenses and participles. "Blown" (past participle) can be tricky. "By the wind" might be forgotten.
2.  **"Basic" Concepts aren't Basic:** Active/Passive voice, while fundamental, is still an abstract grammatical concept. Many struggling learners rote-memorize but don't deeply understand the transformation process. They might miss a crucial component like "were" or the past participle "blown."
3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** Students who are unsure will either write something completely wrong or leave it blank. Given the complexity of English grammar for non-fluent speakers, this is a significant factor.
4.  **No Practice:** Even if taught, students from economically weaker sections often have less access to practice materials or opportunities to apply these rules.
5.  **Partial Credit:** The rubric specifies "correctly transforms the sentence." No partial credit for "The leaves was blown away" or "The leaves blew away." This is crucial.

**Re-evaluation:**
The transformation from active to passive voice in past simple requires several steps:
1.  Identify object (the leaves).
2.  Make it the new subject.
3.  Use "to be" verb in the original tense (past simple -> were/was).
4.  Use past participle of main verb (blew -> blown).
5.  Add "by" + original subject (by the wind).

Missing *any* of these steps will likely lead to an incorrect answer per the rubric.
*   Using "was" instead of "were" (agreement error).
*   Forgetting "were."
*   Using "blew" instead of "blown."
*   Forgetting "by the wind."

Comparing to anchors:
*   It's more complex than recalling facts (50%, 66%). It requires *application*.
*   It's less abstract than finding a theme (5%) but
