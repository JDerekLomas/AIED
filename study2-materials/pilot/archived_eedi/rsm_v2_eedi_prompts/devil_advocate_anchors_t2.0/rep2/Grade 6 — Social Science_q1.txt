ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%

Here's my reasoning, leveraging the calibration anchors and challenging assumptions:

1.  **Analyze the question:** "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India." This requires factual recall of geographical information. The "any two" makes it slightly easier as there are multiple correct answers. The "major" helps narrow it down but doesn't require an exhaustive list.

2.  **English Language Barrier:**
    *   The question uses common English words. "Name," "two," "major," "mountain ranges," "located," "India." These are relatively straightforward and less abstract than terms like "theme," "differentiate," or "archaeological."
    *   Compared to "Write a theme..." (5%), "Differentiate..." (15%), or even "Write a short paragraph..." (30%), the English comprehension demand here is quite low.
    *   This leans towards a higher pass rate than the very low anchors.

3.  **Knowledge Required:**
    *   Geographical knowledge of India's major mountain ranges. The Himalayas are almost universally known, even by students with limited formal education, due to their prominence in media, general knowledge, and potentially local curricula. Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, and the Ghats are also commonly taught.
    *   Even if they only remember one, they'll still get partial credit based on the rubric (which allows 0.5 for one correct answer, and this question likely scores 1 for two correct, so a 0.5 for one is highly likely).

4.  **Comparison to Anchors:**
    *   **5% "Theme of poem":** This requires analytical thinking, understanding literary devices, and expressing abstract concepts in English. Much harder.
    *   **15% "Differentiate sources":** Requires conceptual understanding, comparison, and examples. More abstract and cognitively demanding.
    *   **30% "My favorite season" (paragraph):** This involves sentence construction, organization, and descriptive language. While personal, the act of writing a coherent paragraph in limited English is challenging for many. However, many students scored something here even with very simple answers ("Winter, Sweater").
    *   **50% "Three questions the king wanted to answer":** This requires recall of a specific detail from a story. Many students might have understood the story and remembered the key plot points. The simplicity of recalling a factual list ("the right time, right people, right thing") contributes to its relatively high score. This is a closer comparison in terms of factual recall.
    *   **66% "Two Fundamental Rights":** This is also factual recall of specific concepts. Fundamental Rights are a key part of civic education in India and are emphasized. This question also allows for *any* two, making it accessible if a student remembers just a couple from a longer list. Many students likely knew "Right to equality" or "Right to freedom."

5.  **Challenging Assumptions:**
    *   **"Most students could do this":** No, not *most* in the general sense. But a significant portion *could* recall the Himalayas. Many might struggle to name a *second* without strong recall.
    *   **"Barely reads English":** They should understand "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" due to basic vocabulary.
    *   **"Absent for this topic":** Possible, but general geographical knowledge of India is quite basic and often reiterated. The Himalayas, especially, are very hard to miss.
    *   **"Exam anxiety/blank responses":** This will definitely affect it. Students who know one range but can't think of a second might leave it blank, or only write one. However, the rubric awards 0.5 for *one* correct answer, which mitigates this.

6.  **Refined Estimate:**
    *   The question is simpler in English and cognitive demand than the 5%, 15%, and 30% anchors.
    *   It's comparable to the 50% anchor ("king's questions") and 66% anchor ("Fundamental Rights") in requiring factual recall, but *geography* might be slightly less emphasized in exams than core civic rights or story comprehension, or it might be easier.
    *   Knowing *one* correct range (like Himalayas) is highly probable for a substantial group. Many will get at least 0.5 for this.
    *   To get *full* credit (assuming full credit is 1 and partial is 0.5), they need two. This will bring the score down from a theoretical peak.

Given that a significant portion will likely recall at least one, and many might recall two from a set of common options (Himalayas,
