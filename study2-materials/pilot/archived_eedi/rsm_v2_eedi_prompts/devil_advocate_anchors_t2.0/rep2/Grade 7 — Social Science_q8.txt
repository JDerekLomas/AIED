The question asks about "main occupations" and then "describe any one in brief." This requires a combination of recall and a basic descriptive skill, similar to some of the provided calibration anchors.

Let's break down the difficulty:
1.  **Recall of occupations:** "Rural areas of Rajasthan" is a specific geographical and socio-economic context. While some general occupations (like farming) are universally understood, knowing other *main* occupations in *rural Rajasthan* might be less intuitive if not explicitly taught or culturally familiar to students outside that specific region, or even within it if their knowledge is primarily urban. However, agriculture and animal husbandry are very common across most Indian rural areas, making them somewhat predictable.
2.  **English comprehension:** "Main occupations" is relatively straightforward English. "Describe any one in brief" is also clear.
3.  **Descriptive writing:** Providing a "brief" description requires a few coherent sentences. Students struggled with this in the "My favorite season" (30%) item, even with clear prompts, sometimes writing just a list of words. The expectation here is perhaps simpler than a full paragraph, but still more than a single word.
4.  **Content specificity:** While agriculture is universal, listing other *main* occupations might be where some students struggle. Animal husbandry is also very common in Rajasthan. Handicrafts are another, though perhaps less 'main' than the first two from a direct livelihood perspective for *most* people.

Comparing to anchors:

*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15%):** This requires conceptual understanding, examples, and differentiation. Our question requires recall of facts and brief description.
*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%):** This is pure recall of a specific detail from a story. If the story was well-known and recently taught, this would be easier.
*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights..." (66%):** This is pure recall of fairly direct, taught facts. Students likely memorise these for Civics.

Our question requires more than just recall. It needs both specific recall *and* a basic descriptive sentence or two.
Many students will be able to recall "farming" or "agriculture" and perhaps "animal husbandry." Describing one briefly (e.g., "Farmers grow crops like wheat and millet" or "People keep cows and goats for milk") requires only a very basic sentence structure.

The low pass rates in the calibration anchors suggest students struggle with tasks requiring even slightly more complex cognitive steps or non-direct recall, especially with writing in English.
The 50% anchor was direct recall from a story. The 66% anchor was direct recall of factual bullet points (Fundamental Rights). This question falls in between these, as it's recalling facts, but then synthesizing a brief description.

Given that students mostly come from "economically weaker sections," it's reasonable to assume a good number would have direct or indirect exposure to these occupations, making the *recall* part potentially easier than, say, academic definitions. However, expressing it clearly and correctly in English remains a barrier.

Many might name agriculture, but struggle to "describe it in brief" or name a second distinct occupation.
Some might write "agriculture" and nothing else, or give a very vague description.
Some might just list items like in the 30% anchor "My favorite season".

I'm leaning towards it being harder than the 50% "King's questions" (pure recall) but easier than the 15% "Differentiate" (conceptual + specific examples). The "My favorite season" at 30% required a short paragraph, which proved quite challenging. Describing *one* occupation "in brief" might be a bit simpler, potentially a single sentence or two, making it slightly more achievable.

However, the "main occupations *of people in rural areas of Rajasthan*" adds a layer of specificity. If they just say "farming" they have one, but do they know a *second* main one and can they describe it briefly? Animal husbandry is highly probable, but perhaps not all students will easily articulate both and one description.

Let's assume a significant portion of students will recall 'farming' or 'agriculture'. Some might remember animal husbandry. Then the "describe in brief" part: for "farming," "people grow crops like wheat and barley" is a basic and achievable description.

I expect more students to get at least some points here than for the "My favorite season" prompt, as the description is about a factual activity rather than personal preferences, which can be harder to express concisely in a foreign language. But naming *two* specific to Rajasthan, *and* describing one briefly could trip up many.

Considering the average pass rate is 29% and accounting for blank responses and limited English proficiency,
