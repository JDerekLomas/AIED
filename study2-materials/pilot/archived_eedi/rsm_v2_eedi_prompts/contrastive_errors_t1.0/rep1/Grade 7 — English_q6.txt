Let's break down the question "Describes the poet’s writing style" for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and common English errors.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Implicit:** Students are assumed to have read a poem written by "the poet" referred to. Without context of a specific poem, it's impossible to answer. *This is a huge hurdle if this question is presented in isolation.* If it's part of a larger assessment *after* a poem has been read, then the prior knowledge is about understanding the poem itself.
    *   **Vocabulary:** Understanding "describes," "poet's," and "writing style." "Style" is abstract and can be difficult.
    *   **Literary Concepts:** The concept of "writing style" itself is a higher-order literary concept. At Class 7, while students might be introduced to poets and poems, explicitly analyzing "writing style" with appropriate vocabulary (simple, descriptive, informal, direct, etc.) might be beyond the typical curriculum focus, which often emphasizes comprehension of content, rhyming, and perhaps basic poetic devices.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Describes" is common enough. "Poet's" implies possession. "Writing style" is the most challenging. "Style" in this context is abstract. They might understand "style" as in "fashion style" but not "literary style."
    *   **Abstract Thinking:** This question requires abstract thought – moving beyond concrete details of the poem (what happened, who said what) to analyze *how* the poem was written. This is a significant leap for students with limited English and often limited exposure to higher-order thinking skills in English.
    *   **Generating Appropriate Vocabulary:** Even if they grasp the concept of "style," finding the *right* English word (simple, descriptive, informal, direct, vivid, formal, complex) is very hard. Their productive vocabulary in English is likely far smaller than their receptive vocabulary. The provided rubric requires a "suitable and relevant word." This is a high bar.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **reasoning** and **application** of literary analysis. It's not recall (unless they've memorized a critic's description of a poet's style, which is highly unlikely for Class 7). It requires them to:
        *   Read and comprehend a poem.
        *   Analyze the poem's linguistic and structural characteristics.
        *   Synthesize those characteristics into an overarching "style."
        *   Express that style using appropriate English vocabulary.
    *   This is a significantly higher cognitive demand than simple comprehension or recall.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   Typical Class 7 English textbook exercises in India often focus on:
        *   **Comprehension:** Answering factual questions about a text ("Who was the main character?", "What happened next?").
        *   **Vocabulary:** Matching words, fill-in-the-blanks, antonyms/synonyms.
        *   **Grammar:** Sentence structure, tenses, parts of speech.
        *   **Basic Creative Writing:** Writing a few sentences about a picture or a simple topic (e.g., "My pet").
    *   Analyzing "writing style" is typically found in higher classes (Class 9-10 or even 11-12) or in more advanced literary studies. It's much harder than typical Class 7 exercises.

**Why the observed low pass rate (4%) is understandable:**

*   **"I am reading."** Shows a complete misunderstanding of the question. They might have picked up on "poet" and "describes" but defaulted to a basic, unrelated English sentence they know. It's a deflection.
*   **"Empty Response."** Students either don't understand the question at all, don't know how to answer it, or lack the vocabulary. Given the abstract nature and high demand, this is a very common outcome.
*   **Lack of Context:** As mentioned, if this question appears without the preceding poem, it's unanswerable. Even with a poem, the analytical leap is immense.

**Comparison to other difficult questions:**

*   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate):** This is also abstract, requiring synthesis, but "theme" is perhaps slightly more commonly discussed than "writing style" at this level, though still very difficult. The specific poem ("The Last Bargain") might be familiar, but extracting a formal "theme" is hard.
