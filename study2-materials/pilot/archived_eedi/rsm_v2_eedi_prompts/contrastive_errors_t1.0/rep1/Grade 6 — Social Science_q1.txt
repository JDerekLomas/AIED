Let's break down the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geographic Literacy:** Basic understanding of what a "mountain range" is.
    *   **Indian Geography:** Awareness of the prominent physical features of India. This is typically covered in Class 6 Social Science (Geography section). Students would likely have seen maps of India with these features labeled.
    *   **Recall of Names:** Ability to recall the names of at least two specific mountain ranges within India.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."
    *   **Vocabulary:** "major," "mountain ranges," "located in." These are fairly common geographical terms.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple, direct question.
    *   **English Proficiency:** This question is relatively low in linguistic complexity compared to the "Explain how colonial rule..." or "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign..." questions. It doesn't require complex sentence construction or abstract reasoning in English. Even with limited English, students might recognize "mountain ranges" and "India" and be able to recall names.

*   **Type of Cognitive Task:**
    *   **Recall:** Purely a recall question. Students either know the names or they don't. There's no application or complex reasoning involved.
    *   The rubric only asks for *one* correct name for 0.5 points, making the threshold for partial credit even lower.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very common type of question found in Class 6 geography chapters. Chapters on the physical features of India almost always include questions like "Name the major mountain ranges," "List two important rivers," etc.
    *   It's a foundational knowledge check, not an analytical or interpretative task.

**Comparison with Common Errors:**

*   The common errors cited for other questions ("Empty Response," "Asher' stand," "ashok a second") highlight issues with:
    *   **Comprehension of complex prompts:** Students may not understand what "explain how colonial rule affected" or "explain the significance" means.
    *   **Ability to formulate a coherent answer in English:** Even if they have some knowledge, expressing it precisely can be a barrier.
    *   **Lack of specific knowledge:** For "lions on currency notes," it seems many don't know the connection to Ashoka.

*   **Why "Name two major mountain ranges" is different:**
    *   **Simplicity of Prompt:** Very straightforward. No complex verbs like "explain," "analyze," "interpret."
    *   **Concrete Nature:** Mountain ranges are physical entities, easier to visualize and recall from maps.
    *   **Direct Recall:** If they've studied the chapter, they've likely memorized these names.
    *   **Lower English Demand for Output:** Providing a single word or short phrase (e.g., "Himalayas," "Aravalli") is much easier than constructing a sentence or paragraph explaining a historical concept.

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

Considering the factors above:

1.  **Direct Recall:** This is often better than analytical tasks for this demographic.
2.  **Low Language Barrier:** Minimal English required for comprehension and response.
3.  **Fundamental Geography:** This is a core topic usually covered well.
4.  **Rubric Generosity:** Only one correct name is needed for points.

While the average pass rate is 29%, this question is significantly simpler and more direct than the "explain" questions that see very low pass rates. Students would have encountered maps and lists of physical features repeatedly.

I anticipate a much higher success rate for this question compared to the analytical or complex historical recall questions.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **60-70%**

*   Students would likely recall "Himalayas" as the most prominent.
*   Other common ones like "Aravalli" or "Vindhya" are also frequently taught.
*   The linguistic barrier for naming two ranges is minimal.
