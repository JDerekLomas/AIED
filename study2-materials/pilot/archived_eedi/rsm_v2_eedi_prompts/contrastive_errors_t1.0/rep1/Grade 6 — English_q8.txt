Let's break down the question "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence:\nbook/reading/a/is/he" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their typical profile and common errors.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **What prior knowledge is assumed?**
    *   **Basic English vocabulary:** Students are expected to know the meaning of "he," "is," "reading," "a," and "book." These are very common, high-frequency words typically introduced in early primary grades.
    *   **Basic sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object):** This is fundamental grammar taught from early on. They should have encountered and practiced forming simple affirmative sentences.
    *   **Understanding of word order in English:** Unlike some Indian languages where word order is more flexible (due to case markers), English relies heavily on word order for meaning. This concept is crucial for sentence formation.
    *   **Concept of "meaningful sentence":** They need to understand what constitutes a grammatically correct and understandable sentence.

2.  **What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
    *   **Minimal vocabulary challenge:** As noted, the words are basic. This is a significant advantage compared to questions about "poet's writing style" or "theme."
    *   **Focus on syntax over semantics:** The primary challenge is arranging words correctly, not understanding complex ideas or expressing nuanced thoughts.
    *   **No open-ended response:** This is a constraint-based task. They are given all the words, reducing the burden of recalling vocabulary or generating sentences from scratch. This is a huge simplification compared to "Write a short paragraph about 'My Favourite Hobby'".
    *   **No complex grammatical structures:** The target sentence "He is reading a book" is a simple present continuous sentence, one of the first tenses learned.
    *   **Limited reading comprehension demand:** The prompt itself ("Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence") is straightforward.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of learned grammatical rules (subject-verb-object order, basic present continuous structure) and **recall** of basic vocabulary.
    *   It involves a minor degree of **reasoning** to determine the correct sequence that forms a coherent thought, but it's largely rule-based application. It's not abstract reasoning like interpreting a poem's theme.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Easier than the "Common Errors" examples:**
        *   "Describes the poet’s writing style": Requires understanding abstract concepts, higher-level vocabulary, and ability to formulate descriptive sentences. This question is vastly simpler.
        *   "Write a theme or central idea of the poem": Requires deep comprehension, abstract thinking, and ability to synthesize and express complex ideas. Again, much harder.
        *   "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'": Requires generating ideas, recalling vocabulary, forming multiple grammatically correct sentences, and maintaining coherence over several sentences. This rearrangement task is a single, contained sentence.
    *   **Typical textbook exercise:** Rearrangement tasks are very common in Class 5-7 English textbooks for practicing sentence structure. This specific sentence is a very standard example. Students would have encountered many similar exercises. The difficulty is on par with, or even slightly easier than, many such exercises, as all the words are single-syllable or very common and distinct.

**Considering the "Common Errors" and Student Profile:**

*   **"Empty Response":** While common for harder questions, the simplicity and constrained nature of this task might reduce "empty responses." Even if they get it wrong, they are likely to attempt *some* arrangement.
*   **Vocabulary/Grammar Errors (e.g., "My hobby is cricket play"):** The given words limit vocabulary errors. Grammar errors might occur in the arrangement, but the correct structure (S-V-O) is very basic.
*   **Understanding the prompt:** "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence" is a standard instruction that most students would understand.
*   **Average pass rate (29%):** This question is significantly *easier* than the average item on this exam, especially compared to the examples given with 4-10% pass rates. The average includes questions that are much harder than this one.

**Conclusion for this specific question:**

This question taps into fundamental, frequently practiced grammar concepts with very basic vocabulary. It requires minimal interpretation and is a constrained response. The difficulties seen in the "common errors" (complex expression, abstract ideas, open-ended writing) are largely absent here.

Students who struggle with English will still find
