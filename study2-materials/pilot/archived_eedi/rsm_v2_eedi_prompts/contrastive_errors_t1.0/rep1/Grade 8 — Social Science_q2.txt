Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimate:

## Contrastive Analysis of "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

**Compared to the common errors observed, this question has several advantages, but also some inherent difficulties for the target demographic.**

**What prior knowledge is assumed?**
*   **Core assumption:** Students have been taught about the Harappan Civilization, specifically its urban planning aspects. This is a standard topic in Class 8 Indian history textbooks.
*   **Specific concepts:** Grid layout, drainage system, use of baked bricks, citadel/lower town division. These are the *key* features emphasized in most textbooks when discussing Harappan cities.

**What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
*   **Vocabulary:** "Describe," "key feature," "urban planning," "Harappan Civilization."
    *   "Describe" is a relatively common and straightforward command word.
    *   "Key feature" is also quite common.
    *   "Urban planning" might be slightly more technical, but the context of "Harappan Civilization" should help.
*   **Sentence structure:** Requires a simple declarative sentence or two. The rubric accepts a concise answer.
*   **Abstractness:** While "urban planning" is somewhat abstract, the features themselves (grid, drainage) are concrete and can be described simply.

**Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
*   **Primarily Recall:** This question is a direct recall of factual information taught in history lessons. Students need to remember what they learned about Harappan cities.
*   **Limited Application/Reasoning:** There's no complex application or deep reasoning required, unlike questions asking to "explain *how* colonial rule affected" or "explain the *significance* of Ashoka's reign," which demand more synthesis and analytical thought.

**How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
*   **Easier than complex explanations:** It's simpler than the "explain how/why" questions with low pass rates, as it only asks for *one* feature and doesn't demand an elaborate explanation of causality or significance.
*   **Similar to "list/state" questions:** This is essentially a "state one feature" question, which is a common and relatively basic exercise in history textbooks.
*   **Less prone to "empty response" due to specificity:** While "empty response" is always a risk, the question is highly specific ("Harappan Civilization's urban planning"). If a student has *any* knowledge of this topic, they are likely to recall one of the prominent features. The previous examples like "colonial rule" and "Ashoka's reign" are broader and could lead to more confusion or difficulty in formulating a specific answer.
*   **Less ambiguous than "Why are lions shown...":** That question is tricky because the answer (Ashoka's pillar) requires a specific historical connection, which many students might not immediately link or recall correctly (as seen in "Asher' stand," "ashok a second"). The Harappan question is more direct.

**Considering the common errors:**
*   **"Empty Response":** While still possible, the focused nature of the question (one specific topic, one key feature) might reduce the likelihood compared to broader, more demanding questions. If a student has studied Harappan civ, they likely know *something* about its cities.
*   **Misinterpretations/Irrelevant answers:** Less likely here. The features are distinct. There's less room for the kind of misunderstanding seen with the "lions" question.
*   **Language barrier:** While present, the core concepts (grid, drainage, bricks) can be expressed with relatively simple English words (e.g., "good drainage," "straight roads," "baked bricks").

**Key factors pushing the score up:**
1.  **Direct Recall:** No complex analysis or extended writing needed.
2.  **Specific Focus:** "Harappan Civilization's urban planning" is a very defined topic.
3.  **Multiple Correct Answers:** Students can choose any *one* from several prominent features, increasing their chance of hitting one they recall.
4.  **Standard Curriculum Topic:** This is a fundamental part of the Class 8 history syllabus in India.
5.  **Simpler Language Demand:** Compared to "explain the significance" or "explain how," "describe one key feature" is less demanding linguistically.

**Key factors pushing the score down:**
1.  **Limited English Proficiency:** While simpler, articulating even one feature accurately in English can be a hurdle for some.
2.  **Overall Low Pass Rates:** The average of 29% and the even lower rates for similar Social Science questions indicate a general struggle with the subject and exam format.
3.  **
