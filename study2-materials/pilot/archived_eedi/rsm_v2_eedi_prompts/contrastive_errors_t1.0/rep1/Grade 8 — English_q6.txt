Let's break down the question "Define fable" for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, considering their specific context.

**Contrastive Analysis of "Define fable"**

**1. What prior knowledge is assumed?**

*   **Implicit understanding of "fable":** Many students will have encountered fables (like those of Aesop) in their regional languages or even simplified English. They might know the *concept* of a fable without knowing the *definition* in English.
*   **Vocabulary:** They need to understand "define." This is a common instruction word, but for very limited English speakers, it might still be a hurdle.
*   **Story structure and literary terms:** They need to implicitly understand what a "story" is, and what a "moral lesson" entails. "Character" and "animal" are likely known words.

**2. What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**

*   **Command word "Define":** This is a direct, relatively straightforward command. It doesn't require complex sentence construction or interpretation like "Describe" or "Write a theme."
*   **Specific vocabulary for definition:** The core words needed for the definition (story, animal, moral lesson) are generally more accessible than abstract literary analysis terms. "Imparts" might be too advanced, but "gives" or "teaches" would suffice.
*   **Sentence construction:** They need to construct one or two grammatically correct sentences to convey the definition. This is a common challenge, as seen in the "My Favourite Hobby" examples where students struggle with basic sentence structure.
*   **Abstract concept vs. concrete description:** Defining an abstract literary term is harder than describing a concrete object or personal experience.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

*   **Recall:** Primarily recall. Students need to remember the specific definition of a fable. It's not an application of knowledge (like analyzing a specific fable) or complex reasoning.
*   **Understanding vs. rote memorization:** While it's recall, a student who truly understands fables (even in their native language) has a better chance of formulating a coherent definition than one who only rote-memorized an English definition without understanding.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Textbook definitions:** English textbooks at this level often include glossaries or sections where literary terms like "fable," "poem," "story," "novel" are defined. Students might have been asked to "learn definitions" as homework.
*   **Less demanding than analysis:** It's significantly less demanding than tasks requiring analysis, interpretation, or extended writing (e.g., "Describe the poet's writing style" or "Write a theme").
*   **More demanding than simple factual recall:** It's more demanding than recalling a specific character's name or a detail from a story. It requires synthesizing several pieces of information into a coherent definition.

**Comparison with Common Errors:**

*   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass rate):** This question requires complex language, abstract reasoning, and advanced vocabulary. "Define fable" is far simpler.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate):** This also requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and an understanding of literary concepts, plus the ability to articulate it. "Define fable" is more direct.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby." (10% pass rate):** While this is about a personal topic, the requirement for a *paragraph* and *multiple sentences* exposes grammatical weaknesses. "Define fable" might be shorter, but still requires accurate sentence construction.

**Key factors making "Define fable" *easier* than the examples provided:**

*   **Direct command:** "Define" is straightforward.
*   **Common concept:** Even if not known as "fable" in English, the concept of a story with animal characters teaching a lesson is universal.
*   **Limited scope:** The answer is relatively short and focused.
*   **Teachable definition:** It's a standard definition that can be memorized or logically deduced.

**Key factors making "Define fable" *harder* than ideal:**

*   **English vocabulary for the definition:** "Imparts," "moral lesson" might be challenging. Simpler alternatives like "teaches a lesson" would be acceptable per the rubric.
*   **Grammar for sentence construction:** Constructing a coherent sentence (e.g., "A fable is a short story that has animals as characters and teaches a moral.") remains a hurdle for students with limited English.
*   **"Empty Response" possibility:** As seen in other questions, a significant number of students might simply leave it blank if they don't know the English term or
