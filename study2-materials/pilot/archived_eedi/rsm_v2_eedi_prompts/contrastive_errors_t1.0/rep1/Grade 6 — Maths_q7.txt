Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Time:** Understanding of AM/PM, calculating elapsed time across AM/PM boundary (e.g., 10 am to 4 pm). This is a foundational skill usually covered by Class 3-4, but proficiency can vary.
    *   **Temperature:** Understanding of Celsius degrees ($^0 C$) as a unit of temperature. Basic concept of temperature increasing.
    *   **Arithmetic:** Addition, multiplication (repeated addition). Simple multiplication ($6 \times 2$) or repeated addition ($2+2+2+2+2+2$) is expected.
    *   **Word Problems:** Ability to extract numerical information and operations from a descriptive text.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   "10 am in the morning": Relatively straightforward.
    *   "temperature": A common science/math word, likely understood through context or prior teaching.
    *   "Jodhpur": A place name, irrelevant to the math but doesn't hinder.
    *   "$30^0 C$": Numerical value with unit.
    *   "increases by $2^0 C$ per hour": This is the most crucial part. "Increases" is key for addition. "Per hour" indicates multiplication or repeated addition based on the number of hours. This phrase needs to be correctly interpreted.
    *   "then what will be the temperature": Standard question format, asking for a future value.
    *   "4:00 in the evening": Understanding "evening" maps to PM.

    The overall sentence structure is relatively simple. The core challenge is understanding "increases by X per hour" and applying it over a duration. This is a common structure in math word problems and they might have encountered it in Hindi.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Application:** It's an application problem. Students need to apply their knowledge of time calculation, rate of change, and basic arithmetic to a real-world scenario.
    *   It's not pure recall of a formula.
    *   It requires some basic reasoning:
        1.  Identify the start time and end time.
        2.  Calculate the duration.
        3.  Identify the initial temperature.
        4.  Identify the rate of change.
        5.  Apply the rate of change over the duration.
        6.  Add this change to the initial temperature.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   This problem is a very *standard* type of word problem for Class 6 involving rate of change and time. It's often found in chapters on "Time and Temperature" or "Simple Equations/Word Problems."
    *   It's not a multi-step problem with hidden information or complex conversions.
    *   The numbers are simple ($2^0 C$, 6 hours).
    *   The time calculation (10 am to 4 pm) is straightforward for most who have grasped time, not involving tricky minutes or crossing midnight.
    *   Compared to average textbook exercises, this would be considered **medium difficulty** for Class 6, leaning towards easier once the structure is understood. It's not the easiest (e.g., direct computation) but far from the hardest (e.g., complex fractions, geometry proofs).

**Specific Challenges for the Target Group:**

*   **Reading Comprehension:** Even with simpler English, some students might struggle to parse the sentence correctly, especially "increases by $2^0 C$ per hour."
*   **Time Calculation:** Calculating elapsed time across AM/PM can still be a stumbling block for a subset of students, especially if they haven't solidified their understanding of the 12-hour clock. Many might count linearly: 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, getting 7 hours if they count the 10 o'clock hour or just by finger counting which can lead to errors. Correctly counting 10am, 11am, 12pm, 1pm, 2pm, 3pm, 4pm as 6 distinct hours (or 10 to 12 is 2 hours, 12 to 4 is 4 hours, total 6 hours).
*   **Lack of Practice:** If their curriculum or teaching methodology heavily emphasizes rote learning or direct computation, application problems like this might be less practiced.
*   **Anxiety:** Word problems can be intimidating for students who lack confidence in reading and math.
