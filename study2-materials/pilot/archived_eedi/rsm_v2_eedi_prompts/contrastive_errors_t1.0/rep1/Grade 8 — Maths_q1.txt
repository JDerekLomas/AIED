Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty for Class 8 Indian government school students, followed by an estimate:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition and subtraction with positive and negative integers. (This is fundamental and taught well before Class 8).
    *   **Concept of an Equation:** Understanding that an equation represents a balance and that the goal is to isolate the variable.
    *   **Algebraic Operations:** The concept of transposing terms across the equals sign, or performing the same operation on both sides of the equation to maintain balance.
    *   **Integers:** Understanding negative numbers and how to perform operations with them (e.g., 4 - 9 = -5). This is typically introduced in Class 6 or 7.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **"Find the value of `y`":** This is a very standard and frequently encountered phrase in mathematics. Even with limited English, students would likely recognize this as "solve for y" or "what is y?".
    *   **"in the equation":** Again, a standard term.
    *   **`y + 9 = 4`:** The mathematical symbols are universal and do not rely on English proficiency.
    *   **Overall:** The language demand is extremely low. It uses basic, almost universal mathematical terminology. Students are likely to have seen similar questions translated into Hindi numerous times.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application** of a fundamental algebraic rule (solving linear equations with one variable).
    *   It requires applying the rule of inverse operations (subtraction to undo addition) or transposition.
    *   It also involves **Recall** of integer operations.
    *   It requires very little higher-order **Reasoning** beyond the direct application of a learned procedure.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question is **extremely easy** compared to typical Class 8 textbook exercises.
    *   Class 8 algebra often involves:
        *   Equations with variables on both sides (e.g., `2y + 9 = y - 4`).
        *   Equations involving multiplication/division (e.g., `3y = 12`).
        *   Equations with fractions or decimals.
        *   Word problems that require setting up the equation first.
        *   More complex expressions within the equation.
    *   This particular equation (`y + 9 = 4`) is a foundational step, often encountered in Class 6 or 7 when linear equations are first introduced, or as a warm-up in Class 8. The only "difficulty" is the resulting negative integer, which is a standard part of integer operations by Class 8.

**Conclusion on Difficulty:**

This question is at the absolute lowest end of the difficulty spectrum for Class 8 mathematics. The language is simple, the equation is basic, and the concepts are foundational and would have been covered extensively in prior years and early Class 8. The main hurdle would be a conceptual misunderstanding of negative numbers or a very basic procedural error. Given the average pass rate is 29%, this specific question should perform *significantly* better than that average.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:** 75%

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

*   **Extremely Basic Algebra:** This is a fundamental skill that would have been drilled repeatedly since Class 6 or 7.
*   **Minimal Language Barrier:** The mathematical symbols and standard phrasing ("Find the value of y") are universally understood.
*   **Procedure-Based:** It's a direct application of a learned procedure (transpose +9 as -9, or subtract 9 from both sides).
*   **Integer Operations:** While the result is a negative number, operations with negative integers are a standard part of the curriculum by Class 8.
*   **Why not higher (e.g., 90%+)?**
    *   **Procedural Errors:** Some students might make a sign error (e.g., `4 + 9 = 13`) or a basic arithmetic mistake (`4 - 9` becoming `5` instead of `-5`).
    *   **Lack of Practice/Engagement:** While taught, not all students fully grasp or retain every concept, especially those who struggle generally.
    *   **Test Anxiety/Carelessness:** Simple mistakes can happen under exam conditions.
    *   **Foundation Gaps:** A small percentage might have foundational gaps even in basic integer arithmetic or the concept of an equation.

Given its simplicity and directness, 75% represents a high but not perfect mastery, accounting for typical minor errors or learning gaps within a large, diverse student
