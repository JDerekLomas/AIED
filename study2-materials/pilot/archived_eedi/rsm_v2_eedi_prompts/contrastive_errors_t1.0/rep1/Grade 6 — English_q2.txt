Let's break down the question "Who lived inside the book?" to estimate the proportion of correct answers.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Text Comprehension:** The student must have read and understood a preceding text (likely a story or poem) that explicitly states who lived inside the book. This is the primary and most crucial piece of prior knowledge. Without having read the text, the question is unanswerable.
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Who": Fairly basic interrogative, likely understood.
        *   "lived": Basic verb, past tense. Very common.
        *   "inside": Basic preposition, common.
        *   "the book": Basic noun phrase, common.
        *   *Implied from rubric:* "magical fairy" or "fairy". "Fairy" is a common fantasy character, often introduced in early English readers. "Magical" adds an adjective.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The question uses a very simple subject-verb-prepositional phrase structure ("Who lived inside the book?"). This is highly accessible.
    *   **Vocabulary:** All words in the question itself are very common and foundational.
    *   **Answering:** The expected answer is a short noun phrase ("a magical fairy" or "fairy"). This is a low-demand output, requiring recall of a specific entity.
    *   **Comparison to common errors:**
        *   The errors seen (e.g., "I am reading," "My hobby is cricket play") suggest difficulty with constructing grammatically complex sentences or understanding abstract concepts like "writing style" or "theme."
        *   "Who lived inside the book?" is a concrete, factual recall question. It doesn't require abstraction, interpretation of style, or extended paragraph writing.
        *   The common error "Empty Response" for "Write a theme..." might occur if the student didn't understand the story, didn't understand the question, or simply couldn't formulate an answer. Here, the question is very direct.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is almost purely **recall**. Assuming the text explicitly stated "A magical fairy lived inside the book," the student simply needs to identify and recall that specific piece of information.
    *   There is no application of a concept or complex reasoning required.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   This is a very **low-difficulty** comprehension question, common in early reading comprehension checks. Questions like "Who are the characters?", "Where did they live?", "What happened next?" are staples.
    *   It's significantly easier than "Describes the poet’s writing style" (abstract, requires analysis), "Write a theme or central idea" (abstract, requires synthesis), or "Write a short paragraph...about 'My Favourite Hobby'" (requires productive writing, idea generation, sustained grammar, and vocabulary).

**Factors that might still cause errors:**

*   **Failure to comprehend the *source text*:** If the student didn't understand the story at all, or missed the specific sentence about who lived in the book, they couldn't answer correctly. This is a significant hurdle.
*   **Vocabulary in the *source text*:** If the word "fairy" or "magical" was itself too challenging in the original story, even if they read the sentence, they might not recall it accurately.
*   **Simple recall lapse:** Even easy questions can be missed due to poor memory or distraction.
*   **Translating "fairy":** Some might struggle to produce the English word "fairy" if they only know its equivalent in Hindi or other regional languages, even if they understood the character. However, "fairy" is often introduced early in English primers.
*   **Writing the answer:** Though short, minor spelling errors might occur, but the rubric suggests 'fairy' is acceptable, implying some leeway.

**Considering the average pass rate of 29% and common errors:**

The 29% average pass rate is for *all* items, including very difficult ones. The common errors show deep struggles with productive writing, abstract concepts, and complex instructions. This question is diametrically opposed to those difficulties. It's concrete, uses simple language, and requires minimal production.

The biggest variable here is whether the source text was adequately understood. Assuming the source text itself was at an appropriate Class 6 level and the information about the fairy was clear, this question should be among the easiest on the exam.

If a student has even minimal comprehension of the story, this is a prime candidate for a correct answer. The difficulty lies much more in the source text's
