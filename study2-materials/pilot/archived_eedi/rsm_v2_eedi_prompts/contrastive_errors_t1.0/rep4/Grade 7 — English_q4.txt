Let's break down the question and its demands on Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering the provided context.

**Contrastive Analysis of "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."**

1.  **What prior knowledge is assumed?**
    *   **Passage Comprehension:** The most crucial assumption is that students have read and understood the preceding passage (likely "The Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy, a very common story in Indian school curricula). They need to understand the king's original questions (what is the right time, who are the right people, what is the most important thing to do).
    *   **Vocabulary:** "King," "questions," "important," "real life," "reason" are all relatively common words. "Important" and "real life" might be slightly more abstract but are still within the expected range for Class 7.
    *   **Basic Argumentation:** The phrase "Give one reason" assumes an ability to formulate a simple justification for their opinion.

2.  **What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The question uses a straightforward interrogative structure ("Do you think...").
    *   **Abstract vs. Concrete:** While "king's questions" refers to specific content, connecting them to "real life" requires a degree of abstract thinking and generalization. This is where many students might struggle.
    *   **Expression of Opinion/Reason:** Students need to be able to express an opinion ("Yes, I think so" or "No, I don't think so") and then provide a simple supporting statement. This is a common stumbling block, as seen in the "Empty Response" errors for other questions. They might understand the concept but lack the English vocabulary or grammatical structures to articulate it.
    *   **Rubric Demands:** The rubric's implicit demand for students to connect it to the *king's* questions (right time, right thing, right people) is subtle. A student might give a general reason for *any* questions being important without linking it back to the specific context. However, "Any valid reason" makes it more forgiving.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Recall (Implicit):** Students need to recall the king's questions from the passage.
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** The core of the question is application and reasoning. Students must apply the *theme* of the king's questions to a "real-life" context and reason why they are important. It's not just retrieving a fact; it's forming an opinion and justifying it.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Typical Textbook Questions:** Many textbook questions at this level are recall-based ("Who was the king?", "What were the three questions?"). Some might ask for "moral of the story," which is similar in requiring synthesis and an opinion.
    *   **Difficulty Comparison:**
        *   **Easier than "Describes the poet’s writing style" (4% pass rate):** That question is highly abstract, uses complex vocabulary ("describes," "style"), and requires specialized literary analysis knowledge, which is beyond most Class 7 students, especially with limited English. "I am reading" shows a complete misunderstanding of the prompt.
        *   **Similar to or slightly easier than "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate):** This question also requires synthesis and abstract thinking. However, "theme" is often explicitly taught, and students might have sentence starters for it. The "The last bargin..." error suggests they grasp a part but struggle with articulation and formality.
        *   **Significantly harder than simple recall questions:** This isn't just picking out information from the text.
        *   **Comparable to "Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby" (10% pass rate) in terms of structure, but higher cognitive demand:** While the "Hobby" question asks for a paragraph, the *content* is personal and relatively simple. The errors show basic vocabulary/grammar issues and difficulty sustaining a paragraph. The king's question requires understanding a story's deeper meaning and connecting it to a real-world concept, then expressing it. The "Give one reason" part is simpler than a 4-5 sentence paragraph, which works in its favor.

**Specific Points of Difficulty/Ease for This Question:**

*   **Ease:**
    *   Relatively simple vocabulary in the question itself.
    *   Yes/No answer is an easy starting point, even if the reason is challenging.
    *   "Give one reason" is a less demanding output than a full paragraph or complex explanation.
    *   The
