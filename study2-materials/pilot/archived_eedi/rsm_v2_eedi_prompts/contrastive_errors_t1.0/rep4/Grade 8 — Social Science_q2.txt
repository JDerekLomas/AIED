Let's break down the question "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning" using the provided context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Core Knowledge:** Students are expected to have learned about the Harappan Civilization (also known as Indus Valley Civilization) as part of their Class 8 Social Science (History) curriculum. This is a foundational topic for ancient Indian history.
    *   **Specific Knowledge:** They need to recall specific details about its urban planning. Textbooks typically emphasize features like grid patterns, drainage systems, use of baked bricks, and the citadel/lower town division.
    *   **Contrast with common errors:** Unlike the "lions on currency" question which might require connecting symbols to historical figures (Ashoka's pillars), or "tribal communities" which might require understanding socio-economic impact, Harappan urban planning is usually presented as a direct descriptive topic. The "Ashoka's reign" question, while about a historical figure, still often involves a more nuanced explanation of "significance." Harappan planning is often taught with clear, distinct features.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   **Keywords:** "Describe," "key feature," "Harappan Civilization's urban planning."
    *   **Difficulty:** "Describe" is a straightforward command. "Key feature" is also quite clear. The vocabulary "Harappan Civilization" and "urban planning" are standard terms within the curriculum.
    *   **Contrast with common errors:** The "Ashoka's reign" question uses "significance," which can be slightly more abstract than "describe a feature." The "colonial rule" question uses "affected the lives of," requiring more complex causal reasoning and articulation. This question is relatively direct in its language.
    *   **English Proficiency:** While limited English is a factor, "describe one key feature" is a common task. Students might struggle with complex sentence structures, but a simple statement like "They had good drainage" or "Streets were in a grid" would likely be understood as correct.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Primary:** Primarily **recall**. Students need to retrieve specific facts about Harappan urban planning from memory.
    *   **Secondary:** Very minimal **application** or **reasoning**. They don't need to analyze cause-and-effect or compare different civilizations' planning. They just need to state one characteristic.
    *   **Contrast with common errors:** The "colonial rule" question demands reasoning and explanation of impact. "Why are lions shown" requires connecting a symbol to its origin and significance, which is a form of reasoning. This question is much more direct recall.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical:** This is a very common type of question found at the end of a chapter on the Harappan Civilization. Textbooks often have "List features of Harappan cities" or "Describe the town planning of the Harappans."
    *   **Focus:** It's a foundational, fact-based question that directly assesses if a student has absorbed one of the most emphasized aspects of the civilization.
    *   **Contrast with common errors:** The "Empty Response" errors on other questions suggest either complete lack of knowledge, inability to articulate in English, or finding the question too open-ended/complex. This question is more structured and prompts for a specific, identifiable piece of information. The specific errors on "Ashoka" and "Lions" ("Asher' stand," "ashok a second") suggest phonetic misinterpretations or very fragmented, incorrect recall, which might be less likely for a concrete feature like "drainage system."

**Conclusion on Difficulty:**

This question is significantly *easier* than the examples provided for "common errors."
*   It's a direct recall question on a foundational topic.
*   The language demands are relatively low.
*   The required answer is a concrete fact, not a complex explanation or abstract concept.
*   It's a standard type of textbook exercise.

While limited English proficiency and overall low average pass rates are crucial factors, the specificity and directness of this question make it more accessible than those requiring deeper analysis or more nuanced understanding. Students might provide short, even grammatically imperfect, but factually correct answers. The rubric is quite accommodating ("Correctly describes one key feature...").

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:** 20-25%

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

*   **Baseline:** The average pass rate is 29%. This question is objectively *easier* than the 9-12% pass rate questions provided.
*   **Challenges:** Even though it's easier, the context of "economically weaker sections," "limited English proficiency," and
