Let's break down the question "Define fable" for Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Concept of "fable":** This is the core knowledge required. While students may have encountered fables (like Panchatantra stories, which are often taught in their regional languages or Hindi), they might not have explicitly learned the English term "fable" or its formal definition. They might recognize the *story type* without knowing the *word*.
    *   **Basic vocabulary:** "Define," "short story," "animals," "characters," "moral lesson." These are fairly common words, but "imparts" (implied by "imparts a moral lesson") might be challenging if they're not explicitly given the full rubric wording. If they simply say "gives a moral," that's fine.

*   **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **"Define":** This is a relatively straightforward command verb. They're not asked to *analyze* or *describe in detail*, but to provide a definition.
    *   **Formulating a coherent definition:** This requires stringing together a few key concepts in English. They need to recall the elements of a fable and express them. This is harder than a single-word answer but easier than a paragraph or an analysis.
    *   **Keywords:** The key terms are "short story," "animals," "moral lesson." If they miss one, the answer is incomplete.
    *   **Common Errors Context:**
        *   "Empty Response" is a significant concern on previous questions. This indicates either a complete lack of understanding of the question or the inability to formulate any answer.
        *   The errors on "describes the poet's writing style" (pass rate 4%) show a profound misunderstanding of abstract English literary analysis. "Define fable" is much more concrete.
        *   The "write a theme" question (pass rate 5%) is also abstract and requires interpretive skills.
        *   "My Favourite Hobby" (pass rate 10%) shows students struggling with sentence structure and staying on topic for even a simple paragraph. They often list things rather than elaborate.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   Primarily **recall**. They need to recall the definition of "fable."
    *   There's a very minor element of **application** in putting those recalled concepts into a coherent sentence or two.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Mid-range difficulty for a definition.** Textbook exercises might ask them to *identify* a fable from a list, or *read* a fable and state its moral. Asking for a formal definition is a step up from identification but less demanding than a creative writing task or complex analysis.
    *   They might have encountered "fable" as a vocabulary word with a definition, or as a genre. If it's a genre they've studied, then this is a direct knowledge recall question.
    *   The "English-medium" equivalent might be easier, as those students would have learned the term and its definition explicitly. For Hindi-medium students, the connection between their known concept (e.g., *kahani jismein janwar bolte hain aur sabak milta hai*) and the English word "fable" needs to be strong.

**Factors making it harder:**
*   The "Empty Response" trend suggests a high proportion of students might not attempt it if they don't immediately recognize "fable" or can't articulate a definition.
*   Formulating a multi-part definition in English (short story + animals + moral) is challenging for students with limited proficiency. They might get one or two parts but miss another.
*   Lack of explicit instruction on the English term "fable" *and* its formal definition could lead to low scores. If they know the *concept* but not the *word*, they're stuck.

**Factors making it easier:**
*   It's a concrete noun/concept, not an abstract analytical task like "poet's writing style."
*   The constituent parts of the definition (short story, animals, moral) are relatively simple concepts.
*   Fables are a common story type across cultures, so the underlying concept is familiar.
*   The command "Define" is straightforward.

**Comparison to other items:**
The 4-10% pass rates on the example questions are for tasks requiring much higher-order thinking (describing style, finding theme, elaborate paragraph writing) or profound misunderstanding (the "I am reading" example). "Define fable" is simpler in its cognitive demand. However, the language barrier for *
