Here's a detailed analysis of the question and its potential impact on Class 8 Indian government school students, followed by the estimated proportion correct.

**Question:** A gardener has collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit. Does gardener notice any change after some days? Give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Decomposition:** The core concept is decomposition of organic matter. Students should ideally have encountered this in their environmental science or biology lessons, understanding that microorganisms break down dead organic material.
    *   **Compost/Manure:** The idea of creating compost or manure from organic waste is often covered in topics related to agriculture, waste management, or environmental studies.
    *   **Soil Health:** Basic understanding that organic matter enriches soil, improves its structure, and provides nutrients for plants.
    *   **Living Organisms:** A rudimentary understanding of bacteria and fungi as decomposers, even if not explicitly named, is helpful.

*   **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Gardener," "collected," "waste," "plants," "vegetables," "fruits," "pit," "notice," "change," "reasons," "evaluate," "beneficial," "soil health." Most of these are fairly common words, likely encountered in everyday English or basic science contexts. "Evaluate" might be slightly more demanding than "explain" or "describe," requiring a judgment. "Beneficial" is also a common word in this context.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The sentences are relatively straightforward, using direct questions. The question requires a multi-part answer, which can be challenging for students who struggle with understanding the full scope of a prompt.
    *   **Comparison to other difficult questions:** The language is significantly simpler than the "turmeric powder and hibiscus flower extract" question or the "pitcher plant" question, which involved more specific scientific terms and complex scenarios. The "Pot 'A'" question also contained significant grammatical errors in the student responses, suggesting a lower baseline understanding of English or the inability to form coherent sentences. This question is less prone to misinterpretation due to obscure phrasing.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Students need to recall the concept of decomposition and the formation of manure/compost.
    *   **Application:** They need to apply this knowledge to the specific scenario of a "pit" of organic waste.
    *   **Reasoning:** They need to provide "reasons" for the changes and "evaluate" the benefit for soil health. This requires a small degree of causal reasoning and critical thinking, linking decomposition to nutrient cycling and soil enrichment. It's not just rote memorization.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical:** This type of question (observing decomposition, its benefits) is *very common* in Class 6-8 science textbooks, especially in chapters on waste management, agriculture, or environmental science. It often appears as an activity or a discussion point.
    *   **More Accessible:** Compared to questions requiring specific scientific names (like "insectivorous plants" for the pitcher plant) or precise experimental procedures (like the turmeric/hibiscus question), this question deals with a more observable and relatable phenomenon. Many students, even from rural backgrounds, might have seen or been involved in composting or observing organic matter decay.
    *   **Less Ambiguous:** The scenario is clear. There isn't an obscure setup or an implied complex chemical reaction.

**Why this question is potentially easier than the examples provided:**

1.  **Relatability & Observability:** The process of organic waste decomposing is something many students, especially those from rural areas, might have observed firsthand in their homes or fields. This lived experience can bridge gaps in formal English instruction.
2.  **Core Concept:** Decomposition and its use in creating manure/compost are fundamental and repeatedly taught concepts in environmental science. The other examples (pitcher plant details, specific chemical reactions with indicators) are often more specialized or require more precise recall.
3.  **Simpler Language:** While still in English, the vocabulary and sentence structure are less challenging and ambiguous than the examples given. "Waste," "plants," "fruits," "soil," "beneficial" are words they are more likely to know.
4.  **Multi-part, but logical:** While requiring reasons and evaluation, the parts naturally follow from the initial observation of "change." If a student understands decomposition, they can likely articulate its benefits for soil. The other examples often required disconnected pieces of information or specific scientific terminology.
5.  **Less prone to factual errors due to misinterpretation:** The "Pot 'A'" question responses show complete misunderstanding of the task. The turmeric question responses show mis
