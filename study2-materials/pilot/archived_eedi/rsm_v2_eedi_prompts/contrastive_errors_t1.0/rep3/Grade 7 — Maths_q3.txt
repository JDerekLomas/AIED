Let's break down the question and its demands on Class 7 students in Indian government schools.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geometric Shapes:** Recognition of a triangle.
    *   **Geometric Concepts:** Understanding of "base" and "height" in the context of a triangle. This is crucial as a common misconception is to confuse height with a side length, especially if the triangle isn't right-angled. However, for a direct question like this, they are usually taught to identify them explicitly.
    *   **Measurement:** Understanding of "area" as the space covered by a 2D shape, and units (cm, cm²).
    *   **Basic Arithmetic:** Multiplication of whole numbers and fractions (specifically multiplying by 1/2 or dividing by 2).
    *   **Formula Recall:** The most critical prior knowledge is the formula for the area of a triangle: `Area = 1/2 × base × height`. This is typically introduced and drilled in Class 6 or early Class 7.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **"Find":** A common instruction in math, generally understood.
    *   **"Area":** A core mathematical term, likely learned alongside its Hindi equivalent (क्षेत्रफल - kshetrafal).
    *   **"Triangle":** A basic geometric term, also likely learned alongside its Hindi equivalent (त्रिभुज - tribhuj).
    *   **"Whose base is `8` cm and height is `6` cm":** This phrase structure clearly identifies the given values. "Base" (आधार - aadhar) and "height" (ऊंचाई - unchai) are fundamental terms.
    *   **Overall:** The language is quite straightforward and uses core mathematical vocabulary. There are no complex sentence structures or obscure words. For students with limited English, the key terms are likely familiar due to their frequent use in math class, often with teachers using a mix of English and Hindi or providing Hindi translations. The numbers are also clearly presented.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   **Recall:** Directly recalling the formula for the area of a triangle. This is the primary demand.
    *   **Application:** Applying the recalled formula by substituting the given numerical values for base and height and performing the calculation.
    *   **Reasoning:** Minimal reasoning is required beyond identifying the correct formula and plugging in the numbers. There's no complex problem-solving or multi-step deduction. It's a very direct application of a learned procedure.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a *very typical and basic* textbook exercise. It's often one of the first few examples or practice problems after introducing the area of a triangle formula.
    *   It doesn't involve:
        *   Finding a missing base or height given the area.
        *   Composite shapes.
        *   Unit conversions.
        *   Word problems requiring extraction of information.
        *   Fractions or decimals for base/height (making calculation simpler).
    *   The numbers (8 and 6) are small and easy to multiply and divide by 2, leading to a whole number answer (24). This avoids complex arithmetic.

**Factors for Class 7 in Indian Government Schools (Economically Weaker Sections, Hindi-medium):**

*   **Formula Familiarity:** The area of a triangle formula is fundamental and would have been drilled extensively. It's a standard topic.
*   **Language:** As noted, the language is simple and uses common math terms. Most math classes, even Hindi-medium, will use these English terms or directly translate them, making comprehension likely.
*   **Conceptual Understanding:** The biggest hurdle might be if a student completely missed the concept of base and height or the formula itself, or has weak multiplication/division skills. However, for such a direct question, the likelihood of a student misidentifying base and height is low unless there's a diagram showing ambiguity, which isn't the case here.
*   **Average Pass Rate:** The 29% average pass rate across items is a general indicator of overall difficulty. However, *this specific item* is likely easier than the average, as it tests a very basic and frequently taught concept.

**Conclusion:**

This question is a straightforward test of formula recall and basic application. Its language demands are minimal for mathematical contexts. It's a foundational concept in geometry for this age group. Compared to the average 29% pass rate, this item should perform significantly better due to its simplicity and directness. The only real blockers would be complete lack of knowledge of the formula or very weak basic arithmetic.
