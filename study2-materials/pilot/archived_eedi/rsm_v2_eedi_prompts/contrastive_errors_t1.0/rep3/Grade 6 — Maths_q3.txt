Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and an estimate of the proportion of Class 6 students who would get it correct:

## Contrastive Analysis of Difficulty:

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Number Recognition:** Students must be able to recognize and distinguish between one, two, three, and four-digit numbers. This is a fundamental skill taught much earlier (Class 1-3).
*   **Place Value:** Crucially, students need to understand that a number with more digits is generally larger than a number with fewer digits. Within numbers of the same digit count, they need to compare digits from left to right (thousands, hundreds, tens, ones). This is also a foundational concept, typically introduced in Class 3-4 and reinforced in Class 5.
*   **Ascending Order:** Students need to understand the concept of "ascending order" (smallest to largest). This vocabulary is usually introduced alongside number comparison.

**2. Language Demands:**

*   **"Arrange":** A common English verb in math instructions, usually understood in context.
*   **"Ascending order":** This is the primary linguistic hurdle. While "smallest to largest" is more straightforward, "ascending order" is standard mathematical terminology. However, in Hindi-medium schools, students are likely to be taught the equivalent term in Hindi (e.g., "badhte kram mein" - increasing order/sequence). If they are tested on this regularly in Hindi, they might connect it to the English. If they haven't encountered it or learned the translation, this word could be a significant blocker.
*   **Numbers themselves:** The numbers are universal symbols, so no language demand there.

**3. Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   **Application:** This is an application question. Students are applying their understanding of number comparison and place value rules to a given set of numbers. It's not rote recall of a fact, nor does it require complex multi-step reasoning.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Lower-to-Medium Difficulty:**
    *   **Easier Aspects:** The numbers are whole numbers, relatively small, and distinct (no close calls like 3367 vs. 3376). The set is small (only four numbers). The task is a direct application of comparison rules.
    *   **Harder Aspects (Compared to the *easiest* exercises):**
        *   It includes numbers with different digit counts (one three-digit number, three four-digit numbers). This is a common "trick" to see if students prioritize digit count over initial digit value (e.g., mistaking 736 for larger than 4799 because '7' is bigger than '4'). However, correctly identifying that a three-digit number is smaller than a four-digit number is a fundamental aspect of place value understanding.
        *   The instruction "ascending order" itself, as mentioned, can be a language barrier.

Overall, this question is a standard application of number comparison and ordering, a core skill for Class 6. The main challenge will be the English term "ascending order" for students with limited English.

## Estimated Proportion Correct:

Given the context:

*   **Economically weaker sections:** This often correlates with less exposure to English outside school and potentially less robust foundational learning earlier on.
*   **Hindi-medium schools:** Direct instruction will be in Hindi. The crucial factor is whether English mathematical terms like "ascending order" are explicitly taught and practiced alongside their Hindi equivalents.
*   **Average pass rate ~29%:** This suggests a general difficulty across items. This particular question should be *easier* than many multi-step problem-solving questions.

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

1.  **Fundamental Math Skill:** The underlying math (number comparison, place value) is very fundamental and should have been covered extensively by Class 6. A student who genuinely struggles with comparing 3-digit and 4-digit numbers would be significantly behind.
2.  **Language Barrier:** This is the primary potential pitfall. If a student doesn't understand "ascending order," they might:
    *   Leave the question blank.
    *   Arrange them randomly.
    *   Arrange them in descending order (a common error if the instruction is misunderstood).
3.  **Rubric Focus:** The rubric only requires "correctly identifying the smallest number (736) and placing it first." This significantly lowers the bar for partial credit. A student only needs to identify 736 as the smallest and write it down first to get the 0.5 points. They don't need to order the remaining three correctly, nor do they need to write the full correct sequence. This makes
