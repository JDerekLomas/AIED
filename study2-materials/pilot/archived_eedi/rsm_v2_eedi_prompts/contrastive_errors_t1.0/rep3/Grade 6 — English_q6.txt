Let's break down the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and common errors.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Poem Comprehension:** Students need to have understood the poem sufficiently to identify at least one line and grasp its meaning. This is a significant hurdle, given the low pass rates on theme/central idea questions.
    *   **"Like" Concept:** Understanding what it means to "like" something in a literary context (e.g., resonance, imagery, meaning) rather than just a superficial preference.
    *   **"Why" Concept:** The ability to articulate a reason or justification for their preference. This requires basic causal reasoning.

*   **Language Demands for Students with Limited English:**
    *   **"Which line...?"**: This part is relatively straightforward. Students can likely point to a specific line.
    *   **"...do you like the most..."**: "Like" is a common verb, but "most" adds a comparative element, requiring them to evaluate and select from multiple options within the poem.
    *   **"...and why?"**: This is the major linguistic and cognitive hurdle.
        *   It requires the ability to form a complete sentence explaining a reason.
        *   It necessitates appropriate vocabulary to describe *why* they like a line (e.g., "because it is beautiful," "it makes me feel sad," "I understand it"). This might be difficult if their expressive vocabulary is limited.
        *   Grammatical structures for expressing causation ("because," "so") might be challenging.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall (Partial):** Recalling a specific line from the poem.
    *   **Application (Minor):** Applying the concept of "liking" to a literary text.
    *   **Reasoning (Major):** This question primarily tests *reasoning* and *expression*. Students need to analyze their own preference and articulate the justification for it. It's a subjective response, but requires logical connection.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical exercises:** Often focus on direct comprehension (e.g., "Who is the poet?", "What happened in the first stanza?"), vocabulary matching, or simple factual recall.
    *   **This question:** Is significantly harder than typical textbook exercises.
        *   It requires personal engagement and subjective interpretation, which is less common in lower-level, fact-based curricula.
        *   The "why" component moves beyond basic comprehension into analytical and expressive skills.
        *   The open-ended nature means there's no single "correct" answer to parrot, demanding original thought and formulation.

**Analysis of Common Errors and Relevance:**

*   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%)**: This question is *much* harder than the current one, requiring abstract critical analysis. However, the low pass rate highlights the difficulty with interpretive, abstract questions and the common "Empty Response" or irrelevant answers.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (pass rate: 5%)**: Similar to the above, this requires abstraction and synthesis. Again, "Empty Response" is prominent, indicating a lack of comprehension or inability to articulate complex ideas.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'" (pass rate: 10%)**: This is perhaps the most comparable. It's also open-ended, asks for personal information, and requires paragraph formation. The errors ("My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy", "My hobby is cricket play") show issues with:
    *   Following all parts of the prompt (paragraph structure, specific details).
    *   Grammar and sentence structure ("My hobby is cricket play" instead of "My hobby is playing cricket").
    *   Staying on topic or expanding sufficiently.

**Applying to "Which line... and why?":**

*   Students might be able to identify a line.
*   The "why" will be the major stumbling block. Many will likely give very simplistic reasons ("I like it"), irrelevant answers, or just reiterate the line.
*   Grammar and sentence construction for expressing the "why" will be poor for those who do attempt it.
*   "Empty Response" will be common for those who don't understand the "why" or lack the vocabulary/grammar to explain.
*   The rubric demands *both* a line *and* a reason. A simple statement of a line without a reason would not score. A simple reason without referencing a line would also not score.
