Let's break down the question "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it." to estimate the proportion of Class 7 students in Indian government schools who would answer it correctly.

### Analysis of the Question:

**1. What prior knowledge is assumed?**

*   **Vocabulary:**
    *   "Paragraph": Basic understanding of what a paragraph is (a group of related sentences). This might be a challenge if they primarily do sentence-level exercises.
    *   "Favourite": Common word, likely known.
    *   "Hobby": Common word, likely known.
    *   "Mention": Common word, likely known.
    *   "Enjoy": Common word, likely known.
    *   *Implicit:* Vocabulary related to common hobbies (e.g., cricket, drawing, reading, cycling) and simple adverbs of time (e.g., in the evening, on weekends) and reasons (e.g., fun, relaxing, makes me happy).
*   **Grammar/Syntax:**
    *   Basic sentence construction (Subject-Verb-Object).
    *   Use of simple present tense (e.g., "I play," "I enjoy").
    *   Ability to form simple conjunctions to link ideas (e.g., "and," "because").
    *   Understanding of personal pronouns (I, my).
*   **Content Generation:** Ability to think of a personal hobby and articulate simple reasons for enjoying it. This is generally accessible for this age group.

**2. What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**

*   **Prompt Comprehension:** The prompt itself is fairly straightforward. "Write a short paragraph," "My Favourite Hobby," and the explicit bullet points ("what it is," "when you do it," "why you enjoy it") make the task clear. This is much easier to understand than abstract instructions like "Describes the poet's writing style."
*   **Sentence Formulation:** Students need to construct 4-5 *related* sentences, not just isolated ones. This requires a slightly higher level of coherence than simply answering a direct question.
*   **Vocabulary Retrieval:** They need to recall appropriate words for their chosen hobby and reasons.
*   **Grammar Application:** Correct application of simple tenses and sentence structure. Errors in articles, prepositions, and singular/plural are highly probable but might still allow for rubric fulfillment if the meaning is clear.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

*   **Application:** It's primarily application. Students apply their vocabulary and grammatical knowledge to express personal information.
*   **Reasoning:** Very minimal reasoning is required beyond connecting a hobby to simple enjoyment (e.g., "it is fun," "it makes me happy"). It doesn't ask for analytical or critical thinking.
*   **Recall:** Some recall of basic grammar rules and vocabulary.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Similarities:** Many Class 7 textbooks would have similar "write about yourself" or "describe your favourite..." type exercises. "My Favourite Hobby" is a classic topic. The length requirement (4-5 sentences) is also standard for short paragraphs.
*   **Differences:**
    *   The explicit bullet points within the prompt ("what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it") are very helpful. They break down the task into manageable components, reducing ambiguity. This is a significant advantage over more open-ended prompts.
    *   It requires sustained writing for 4-5 sentences, which can be harder than single-sentence answers or fill-in-the-blanks.
    *   The topic is personal and accessible, unlike complex literary analysis.

### Contrast with Common Errors and Pass Rates on Other Questions:

*   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%)** This question is highly abstract, requires understanding of literary terms ("writing style," "poet"), and demands analytical reasoning. It's completely out of reach for students with limited English and no specific instruction in literary analysis. The current question is vastly simpler.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."" (pass rate: 5%)** Similar to the above, this requires understanding abstract concepts ("theme," "central idea"), interpretation of a poem, and expression of complex ideas. The current question is concrete and personal.
*   **"Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what" (pass rate: 10%) - *This is the exact question!***
    *   The provided common errors show students *attempting* the question,
