Let's break down the question "Define fable" for Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis of "Define fable"**

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Concept of "fable":** This is the core knowledge. While students might have encountered fables (Panchatantra stories, Aesop's fables, etc.) in their regional languages or even in English textbooks, the *term* "fable" itself might not be explicitly taught or emphasized, especially the formal definition. They might know the *stories* but not the *classification*.
*   **Vocabulary:** "Define" is a common instructional verb. "Short story," "animals as characters," "moral lesson" are relatively common terms, though "imparts" might be a stretch for many.

**2. Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
*   **"Define":** This is a straightforward command. It doesn't require complex sentence construction from the student, primarily a recall of information.
*   **Recall vs. Interpretation:** The question is a direct recall task. There's no interpretation of a text, no creative writing, and no need to infer meaning from context. This makes it simpler than questions requiring analysis of a poem or writing a paragraph.
*   **Keywords for the answer:** The expected answer relies on specific keywords: "short story," "animals," "moral." These are concrete concepts.
*   **Abstract concept "moral lesson":** While "moral" is an important part, articulating "moral lesson" or "imparts a moral" might be challenging. Some might say "teaches a lesson" or "gives a good lesson."

**3. Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
*   **Pure Recall:** This is almost entirely a recall question. Students either know the definition of a fable or they don't. There's minimal application or reasoning involved beyond retrieving a memorized or understood definition.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
*   **Compared to other English exam items (as provided):**
    *   **Much Easier than "Describes the poet’s writing style" (4% pass rate):** That question requires understanding abstract literary terms, analyzing a style, and articulating it in complex English. "Define fable" is concrete and requires factual recall. The common errors for "poet's writing style" (like "I am reading" or "Empty Response") suggest a complete lack of comprehension or relevant vocabulary.
    *   **Easier than "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate):** Identifying a theme requires higher-order thinking, synthesis, and abstraction, even if the story is understood. "Define fable" is a simpler, foundational concept. The common errors here ("The last bargin they about a child and labour...") show attempts but a struggle with articulation and understanding of "theme/central idea."
    *   **Easier than "Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'" (10% pass rate):** While seemingly simple, paragraph writing requires organizing thoughts, using connecting words, proper sentence structure, and generating original content. The common errors provided ("My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles") show a lack of paragraph structure and just listing items, or a very stunted attempt. "Define fable" only requires a sentence or two of factual recall.
*   **Compared to typical textbook exercises:** Textbooks often have "Define the following" or "What is a X?" questions. If "fable" has been explicitly defined and reviewed, this question would be a standard, low-difficulty recall exercise. However, if it was only implicitly introduced (e.g., by reading fables without explicitly defining the genre), then it becomes harder. Given the low pass rates on other questions, it's safer to assume explicit teaching of specific literary terms like "fable" might be inconsistent.

**Challenges Specific to "Define fable":**

*   **Specificity of "animals":** While many fables feature animals, some have human characters or inanimate objects. The *rubric* specifies "typically uses animals." Students might know the concept but miss this specific detail, or only remember the animal part and miss the moral.
*   **Articulating "moral lesson":** This is likely the most challenging part of the definition for many. They might understand "teaches a lesson" but struggle with the more formal "imparts a moral lesson."
*   **Direct recall emphasis:** If students haven't memorized a definition, or if the term wasn't explicitly covered, they'll struggle. There's little room for "figuring it out."

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%) and Common Errors:**

The extremely low pass rates on other English questions suggest a profound
