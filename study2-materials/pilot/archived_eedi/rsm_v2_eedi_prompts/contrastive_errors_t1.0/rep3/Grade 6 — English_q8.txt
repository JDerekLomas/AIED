Let's break down the question "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence: book/reading/a/is/he" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and common errors.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **What prior knowledge is assumed?**
    *   **Basic English vocabulary:** All words (book, reading, a, is, he) are extremely common and likely introduced in early English lessons (Class 1-3).
    *   **Basic sentence structure (SVO):** This is fundamental to English and should be a core component of Class 4-5 English curriculum, even in Hindi-medium schools. They would have encountered numerous examples of "He is reading," "She is eating," "I am playing," etc.
    *   **Understanding of present continuous tense:** "is reading" is a very common structure.

2.  **What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
    *   **Lexical:** Very low demand. All words are simple and high-frequency.
    *   **Syntactic:** Low demand for the target structure. SVO is the most basic and frequently encountered English sentence structure. The only challenge is reordering, but the words strongly suggest the correct order. There are no complex clauses, conjunctions, or advanced grammatical concepts.
    *   **Semantic:** Low demand. The individual meanings of the words are clear, and the resulting sentence conveys a simple, concrete action.
    *   **Absence of distractor words/complex phrasing:** Unlike "Describes the poet’s writing style," there are no abstract concepts or words that could be misinterpreted or lead to generic "empty responses." The task is concrete.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   It's primarily **application** of learned grammatical rules (SVO) and **recall** of common sentence patterns.
    *   It involves a very basic level of **reasoning** to identify the subject, verb, and object, but this reasoning is highly scaffolded by the simple vocabulary and the limited number of words. It's not abstract reasoning; it's pattern recognition.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Significantly easier** than the examples of common errors provided:
        *   "Describes the poet’s writing style": Requires understanding abstract vocabulary ("describes," "poet's," "writing style") and producing a descriptive answer. Highly difficult.
        *   "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain'": Requires comprehension of a poem, abstract conceptualization ("theme," "central idea"), and coherent paragraph writing. Extremely difficult.
        *   "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'": Requires sustained writing, idea generation, and grammatical coherence over multiple sentences. Moderate to high difficulty, depending on fluency.
    *   This "rearrange words" question is a **foundational exercise** often found in early primary school English textbooks (Class 3-5) as a direct way to teach sentence construction. It's a standard format for drilling SVO.
    *   The words are deliberately chosen to form only one logical, simple SVO sentence. There aren't multiple valid interpretations or complex grammatical choices.

**Why this question is easier than the examples given:**

*   **Concrete vs. Abstract:** This question deals with concrete words and actions, whereas the difficult examples involve abstract concepts (style, theme, description).
*   **Production vs. Manipulation:** This asks students to *manipulate* given words into a correct order, rather than *producing* original sentences or paragraphs from scratch, which is a much higher cognitive load.
*   **Vocabulary:** All words are highly familiar. The difficult examples contain more challenging vocabulary.
*   **Grammatical Complexity:** SVO is the most basic English sentence structure. The difficult examples imply a need for more complex sentence structures and varied vocabulary.
*   **Clear Right Answer:** There is one unambiguous correct answer. The more open-ended questions allow for more ways to be wrong.
*   **No "Empty Response" due to misunderstanding the *task*:** The task "Rearrange the words" is very clear, even if the student doesn't know the exact answer. They won't write "I am reading" or "Empty response" because they don't understand what "rearrange" means. They might rearrange it incorrectly, but they will attempt rearrangement.

**Potential Pitfalls (but less likely than for other questions):**

*   **Subject-verb inversion:** Some students might write "Is he reading a book?" (question form), but the instruction "make a meaningful sentence" usually implies a statement, and "He" starting a sentence is
