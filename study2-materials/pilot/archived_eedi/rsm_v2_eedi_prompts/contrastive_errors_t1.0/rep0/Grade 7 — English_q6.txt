Let's break down the question "Describes the poet’s writing style" to understand why the pass rate is so low (4%) and then estimate the proportion of Class 7 students who might answer it correctly.

**Contrastive Analysis of "Describes the poet’s writing style":**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Implicit understanding of "poet" and "writing style":** Students need to understand that a poet writes and that their *manner* of writing can be characterized. This isn't just about what they write, but *how* they write it.
    *   **Exposure to descriptive vocabulary for literary analysis:** Students need to have encountered and understood words like "simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct," "figurative," "narrative," "lyrical," etc., in the context of writing. This is a higher-order concept than just understanding basic vocabulary.
    *   **Ability to infer/analyze from text:** They must have read a poem (which isn't provided with the question, implying they're expected to recall or apply this to a *known* poem or just understand the general concept) and be able to extract observations about its style.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **"Describes":** This verb, while common, requires an action of explaining or characterizing, not just stating.
    *   **"Poet's":** The possessive form ('s) is generally understood, but combined with other terms, it adds to the cognitive load.
    *   **"Writing style":** This is the most challenging phrase.
        *   "Writing" is common, but "style" in this context is abstract. It's not about fashion or hair; it's about the *way* something is written.
        *   The combination "writing style" is a specific academic/literary term. Students might understand "writing" and "style" separately but struggle with the compound meaning.
    *   **Formulating an answer:** Even if they understand the question, they need to retrieve or construct an appropriate English adjective to describe a style. The common errors show a profound lack of this. "I am reading" indicates they might just be identifying the activity related to a poet. "Empty Response" highlights comprehension failure.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Reasoning/Application (primarily):** It requires analyzing a piece of text (or recalling such an analysis if the poem was given previously) and then applying a suitable descriptive term. It's not rote memorization.
    *   **Implicit Recall:** If this question refers to a specific poem studied in class, then it would involve recalling previously discussed characteristics of that poet's style. However, given the nature of the question (generic "the poet's writing style"), it seems to test the *concept* more broadly. The low pass rate suggests they haven't been taught this concept or the vocabulary for it.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Significantly harder than typical:**
        *   Typical Class 7 English exercises often focus on:
            *   Basic comprehension (who, what, where, when).
            *   Vocabulary matching/fill-in-the-blanks.
            *   Simple sentence construction.
            *   Grammar rules (tenses, prepositions).
            *   Identifying main ideas or moral lessons (as seen in "Write a theme or central idea..."). Even that has a very low pass rate.
        *   Questions about "writing style" are usually introduced later in literary studies or with explicit scaffolding. They require abstract thinking and specialized vocabulary beyond everyday English.
        *   The common errors for "My Favourite Hobby" show that even formulating a simple paragraph about a personal topic is challenging. Describing an abstract concept like "writing style" is several levels above this.
        *   The pass rate of 5% for "Write a theme or central idea" (which is still a conceptual question, but perhaps slightly more concrete than "writing style") suggests that *any* question requiring abstract analytical thinking and articulation in English is extremely difficult for this cohort. "Writing style" is even more abstract than "theme."

**Conclusion on Difficulty:**
This question is exceptionally difficult for Class 7 students from economically weaker sections in Hindi-medium schools with limited English proficiency.
*   It demands understanding of abstract literary concepts ("writing style").
*   It requires specific, specialized English vocabulary to answer correctly.
*   It necessitates analytical skills rather than simple recall or direct comprehension.
*   It's a high-level item, likely beyond the scope of typical English instruction or at least not adequately reinforced.
