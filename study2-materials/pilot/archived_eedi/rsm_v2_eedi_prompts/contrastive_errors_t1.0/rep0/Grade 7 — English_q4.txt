Let's break down the question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason." using the provided context and error analysis.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **What prior knowledge is assumed?**
    *   **Passage Comprehension:** Students must have understood the preceding story (likely "The Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy, a very common Class 7 English text in India). This involves understanding the *content* of the king's three questions and why he sought answers.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Important," "real life," "reason." These are relatively common words, but "important" and "real life" require a grasp of abstract concepts beyond simple factual recall.
    *   **Conceptual Understanding of "Importance":** Students need to understand what it means for something to be "important" and how to connect abstract concepts from a story to practical "real life."

2.  **What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
    *   **Question Structure:** "Do you think...?" is a relatively straightforward question structure, but it demands an *opinion* and *justification*, not just factual recall.
    *   **Expressing Opinion:** Students need to be able to phrase an affirmative (or negative) opinion, e.g., "Yes, I think..." or "No, I don't think..."
    *   **Providing a Reason:** This is the biggest linguistic hurdle.
        *   They need to use connecting words like "because," "so," or simply state a reason clearly.
        *   They need to articulate their reason in a coherent sentence or two. This moves beyond simple word recognition to sentence construction and expressing complex ideas.
        *   The common errors show a struggle with sentence formation ("My hobby is cricket play") and expressing complete thoughts.
    *   **Rubric Demands:** The rubric says "Any valid reason." This is lenient *conceptually*, but students still need to *express* that valid reason.
    *   **Comparison to Common Errors:**
        *   The "poet's writing style" question (4% pass rate) is abstract and requires specific analytical vocabulary. This question is less abstract in its *core idea* (importance) but still demands abstract *reasoning*.
        *   "Theme or central idea" (5% pass rate) requires summarizing and abstract thinking. Our current question requires a *personal opinion* about the *relevance* of a theme.
        *   "My Favourite Hobby" (10% pass rate) shows students struggling to write even simple paragraphs, often listing items or using very broken English. Our question asks for *one reason*, which is less demanding than a paragraph but still requires more than a simple word.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Minimal, only recalling the *content* of the king's questions from the passage.
    *   **Application:** Students must apply their understanding of the story's themes to a "real-life" context.
    *   **Reasoning:** Primarily reasoning. They need to form an opinion and logically justify it. This is a higher-order thinking skill.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Typical Textbook Exercises:** Often focus on factual recall ("Who was the king?", "What were the three questions?"), simple vocabulary matching, or basic sentence completion.
    *   **Difficulty Comparison:** This question is **more difficult** than typical recall or basic comprehension questions. It's closer to "think and discuss" or "value-based" questions, which are often challenging for students, especially those with limited language skills. The demand for an *opinion* and a *justified reason* elevates its difficulty significantly compared to simply identifying facts from the text.

**Specific Considerations for This Question:**

*   **Positive Framing:** The question "Do you think the king's questions are important...?" implicitly encourages a "Yes" answer, which might simplify the initial opinion part for some.
*   **Simplicity of "Reason":** The "right time," "right thing," "right people" are foundational life questions. Students might intuitively grasp their importance even if they struggle to articulate it perfectly. A simple answer like "Yes, because it helps us to live life better" or "Yes, because we need to know when to do things" could pass the rubric.
*   **"Give one reason":** This limits the output required, making it less daunting than a paragraph, but still demands a coherent sentence.

**Revised Analysis based on provided errors:**

The common errors (broken English, empty responses, listing) indicate a severe bottleneck in expressing *any* coherent thought in English. Even simple sentence construction is a hurdle. While
