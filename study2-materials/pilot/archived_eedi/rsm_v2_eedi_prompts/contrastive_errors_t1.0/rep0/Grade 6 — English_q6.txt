Let's break down the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" and analyze its difficulty for Class 6 Indian government school students with limited English proficiency.

**Contrastive Analysis of Difficulty:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Poem Comprehension:** Students need to have understood the poem to a basic extent to identify lines and form an opinion. This is a significant hurdle given the general low comprehension rates observed.
    *   **Concept of "Liking":** While "liking" is a fundamental concept, articulating *why* one likes something requires a slightly more nuanced understanding of personal preference and expression.
    *   **Literary Terminology (Line):** "Line" is a fairly basic term, but for students unfamiliar with poetic structure in English, it could still be a minor point of confusion.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   **Identifying a Specific Line:** This requires direct textual recall or the ability to find a specific phrase within the poem.
    *   **Expressing Personal Preference ("I like..."):** This is relatively straightforward, using common English structures.
    *   **Providing Justification ("because..."):** This is the biggest language demand. Students need to construct a sentence explaining their reasoning. This moves beyond simple recall or single-word answers.
        *   **Vocabulary:** They need some vocabulary to describe *why* they like a line (e.g., "it is sad," "it is happy," "it makes me think of," "it is beautiful," "it has a good message").
        *   **Sentence Structure:** They need to be able to form a simple cause-and-effect sentence ("I like X because Y").
    *   **"Most":** The superlative "most" indicates they need to select *one* line out of potentially many, adding a slight cognitive load of comparison, though practically, any identified liked line would likely get credit if justified.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Students need to recall or locate a specific line from the poem.
    *   **Application:** They are applying their understanding and personal judgment to the poem.
    *   **Reasoning:** The "why" part requires basic reasoning – connecting their preference to a characteristic or impact of the line. This is the most demanding aspect.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical exercises often focus on:**
        *   Direct comprehension questions (e.g., "Who is the poet?" "What is the poem about?").
        *   Vocabulary matching.
        *   Filling in blanks.
        *   Identifying rhyming words.
        *   Very simple sentence construction or short answer questions that can often be copied directly from the text.
    *   **This question is more challenging than typical exercises because:**
        *   It asks for a *personal opinion* rather than just factual recall.
        *   It requires *justification* for that opinion, which demands original thought and sentence construction in English, not just rote memorization or direct copying.
        *   The common errors listed ("Empty Response," "I am reading," "My hobby is cricket play") strongly suggest a lack of ability to construct coherent, relevant English sentences, especially when asked for an explanation or description. The "describes the poet's writing style" question (4% pass rate) is particularly telling, as it asks for descriptive reasoning, similar to the "why" in our target question.

**Anticipated Challenges and Common Errors for this Specific Question:**

*   **Empty Response:** Very likely due to inability to understand the question or formulate an answer.
*   **Copying a line without justification:** Some students might understand they need to pick a line but fail to explain why.
*   **Simple, irrelevant justification:** "I like it." "It is good." (Might get partial credit depending on strictness, but the rubric implies "why" needs more substance).
*   **Justification in Hindi/Native Language:** If allowed, but the exam context implies English only.
*   **Misunderstanding "line":** Could describe the *poem* generally rather than a specific line.
*   **Grammatical errors/awkward phrasing:** Even if they attempt an explanation, the English will likely be rudimentary.
*   **Failing to understand the poem:** If they don't grasp the poem's content at all, they can't genuinely pick a line they like or explain why.

**Likely Difficulty Compared to Other Items:**

*   It's harder than simple recall ("Who is the poet?").
*   It's comparable in difficulty to "Write a theme or central idea" (5% pass rate), as both require synthesizing information and formulating a
