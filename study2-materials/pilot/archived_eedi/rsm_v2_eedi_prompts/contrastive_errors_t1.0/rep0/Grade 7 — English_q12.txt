Let's break down the question "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away." for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering the provided context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Grammar:** A fundamental understanding of verbs, nouns, subject, object. Crucially, the concepts of "active voice" and "passive voice" must have been taught. This is typically introduced in Class 6 or 7 English grammar curricula.
    *   **Verb Conjugation:** Knowledge of past participle forms (e.g., "blown" from "blew"). This is a common area of struggle.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Ability to identify the subject, verb, and object in a simple sentence.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Wind," "blew," "leaves," "away" are all very common, basic words. No complex vocabulary.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Instructions:** "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice." This instruction itself requires understanding specific grammatical terminology. If students haven't internalized "active voice" and "passive voice" as concepts, the instruction is meaningless, even if they understand "change" and "sentence." The provided common errors like "Describes the poet's writing style" (4% pass rate) suggest that understanding abstract grammatical/literary terms is a major hurdle.
    *   **Sentence Analysis:** The sentence "The wind blew the leaves away" is relatively simple. The subject ("the wind") and object ("the leaves") are clear. The verb ("blew") is a common irregular verb.
    *   **Transformation:** The cognitive load comes from applying the rules of passive voice transformation:
        *   Object becomes subject: "The leaves..."
        *   Appropriate form of "to be" (past tense, plural): "...were..."
        *   Past participle of the main verb: "...blown..."
        *   "by" phrase (optional but expected for full credit): "...by the wind."
        *   Adverbial phrase remains: "...away."
        *   The complete transformation is: "The leaves were blown away by the wind."

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of learned grammatical rules. Students need to *recall* the rules of passive voice transformation and the past participle of "blow," and then *apply* them to the given sentence.
    *   It requires minimal "reasoning" beyond understanding the transformation process. It's not inferential like finding a theme, nor is it creative writing.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Typical Textbook Exercise:** This *is* a very typical textbook exercise for active/passive voice. Textbooks often provide similar simple sentences for transformation.
    *   **Compared to "Describes the poet's writing style" (4% pass rate):** This question is *easier* in terms of comprehension of the core task. "Describes the poet's writing style" requires abstract thinking about literary analysis, which is highly challenging for limited English proficiency and likely underdeveloped analytical skills at this level. This voice question is about applying a specific, teachable grammatical rule.
    *   **Compared to "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate):** Again, this active/passive question is *easier*. Identifying a theme requires higher-order thinking, comprehension of a poem, and expression, which are all complex.
    *   **Compared to "Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'" (10% pass rate):** This active/passive question is *easier* because it's a constrained grammar task, not an open-ended writing task. The writing examples show severe difficulty with basic sentence construction, spelling, and coherence even for simple topics. The active/passive question requires a single correct sentence, not a paragraph.

**Factors making it difficult despite being a typical exercise:**

*   **Reliance on Memorization and Application:** If students haven't properly learned and practiced the rules, they won't be able to apply them.
*   **Irregular Verb "blow-blew-blown":** Many students struggle with irregular verbs. "Blown" is key here.
*   **Pronounciation of "were":** While "the leaves was blown" is incorrect, it might be a common error if students struggle with subject-verb agreement in past tense for plural subjects.
*   **Terminology Barrier:** As noted, if "active voice" and "passive voice" are just jumbled words, the instruction is nullified.
*   **Overwhelm/Anxiety:** The general low pass rates
