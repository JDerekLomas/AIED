Let's break down the question "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it."

**Contrastive Analysis:**

**Compared to the common error examples, this question is likely to be significantly easier.**

*   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%)**
    *   **Prior Knowledge:** Requires understanding of literary analysis, abstract concepts like "writing style," and the ability to articulate such concepts in English. This is very advanced for Class 7 students, especially those with limited English.
    *   **Language Demands:** High. Requires precise vocabulary for literary criticism.
    *   **Cognitive Load:** High. Abstract reasoning and analytical skills.
    *   **Difficulty:** Extremely high. Beyond the scope of most Class 7 students in this context.

*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."" (pass rate: 5%)**
    *   **Prior Knowledge:** Requires comprehension of a specific poem, understanding the concept of "theme" or "central idea," and the ability to extract and summarize it.
    *   **Language Demands:** Moderate to high. Requires summarizing skills and understanding nuanced meaning.
    *   **Cognitive Load:** High. Application of comprehension and analytical skills.
    *   **Difficulty:** Very high. "Theme" is an abstract concept that many struggle with even in their native language.

*   **"Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what" (pass rate: 10%)**
    *   **This is the exact same question, with a reported 10% pass rate.** This specific data point is crucial.

**Now, let's analyze "My Favourite Hobby" in detail, assuming the 10% is representative, and consider what might make it *easier or harder* than that reported 10% on average, or why some might fail.**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Basic vocabulary:** "favourite," "hobby," "when," "why," "enjoy." These are generally common words introduced early in English learning.
    *   **Personal experience:** Every student likely has a hobby or an activity they enjoy. This draws on personal experience, making it relatable and accessible.
    *   **Basic sentence structure:** Subject-verb-object, simple declarative sentences.

*   **Language Demands on students with limited English:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** The core vocabulary is simple and high-frequency.
    *   **Sentence structure:** Requires constructing simple sentences.
    *   **Paragraph structure:** The prompt explicitly guides the student: "what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it." This provides a clear framework and reduces the need for complex organizational skills. The "4-5 sentences" also helps limit the scope.
    *   **Grammar:** Basic present tense is likely sufficient. Simple past tense might be used for "when I started," but not essential.
    *   **Common Errors observed (and how they relate here):**
        *   "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy" - This shows a lack of understanding of "paragraph" and the prompt's focus (it's about hobbies, not food). Also, poor spelling and sentence fragmentation.
        *   "My hobby is cricket play" - This is a good start, but grammatically incorrect ("cricket play" instead of "playing cricket"). It also doesn't meet the "4-5 sentences" or elaborate on "when" and "why."
        *   "My Favowrife Hobby cbaking\nMy Favowrife" - Similar issues with spelling, grammar, and meeting the sentence count/elaboration requirement.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   Primarily **application** of learned vocabulary and sentence structures to personal experience.
    *   Some element of **recall** for relevant vocabulary.
    *   Very little **reasoning** beyond expressing personal preference.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   "Write about yourself" or "Describe your favourite X" are very common early writing exercises in English textbooks for this age group. They are foundational.
    *   The structured prompts ("what, when, why") are helpful and typical of scaffolded writing tasks.
    *   The "4-5 sentences" is a manageable length.

**Refining the Estimate from the Reported 10%:**

The reported 10% pass rate for *this exact question* is critical. However, it
