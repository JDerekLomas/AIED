Let's break down the question for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering the specified context.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Time:**
    *   Understanding of "am" and "pm".
    *   Ability to calculate elapsed time between two points (e.g., 10 am to 4 pm). This involves understanding that 12 pm (noon) is a transition point.
    *   Basic arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication).
*   **Temperature:**
    *   Understanding that temperature can increase.
    *   Understanding of "$^0 C$" as a unit for temperature.
*   **Rate:**
    *   The concept of "per hour" – that an action (increase in temperature) happens repeatedly for each unit of time (hour).
*   **Word Problems:**
    *   Ability to extract numerical information and the core question from a text.

**Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**

*   "At 10 am in the morning": Fairly straightforward. "Morning" reinforces "am".
*   "temperature of Jodhpur was 30^0 C": Clear initial state.
*   "If the temperature increases by 2^0 C per hour":
    *   "increases": Key verb, might be understood from context or prior exposure to "more".
    *   "per hour": Crucial for understanding the rate. This phrase might be challenging if not specifically taught or if the student relies heavily on direct translation. "Each hour" might be easier.
*   "then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?":
    *   "what will be": Future tense, generally understood.
    *   "evening": Reinforces "pm".

**Potential Difficulties due to Language:**

*   The phrase "per hour" might be a hurdle for some. They might struggle to connect it with repeated addition or multiplication.
*   The overall sentence structure is slightly more complex than simple direct questions.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   **Application:** This is primarily an application problem. Students need to apply their knowledge of time calculation, rates, and basic arithmetic to a specific scenario.
*   **Reasoning:** There's a small element of reasoning required to understand that the temperature *increase* is cumulative over the elapsed time. It's not a direct recall of a formula, but applying a learned concept (rate of change) to find a final value.

**Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises (Class 6 Mathematics in India):**

*   **Time Calculation:** Class 6 textbooks definitely cover time, including calculating elapsed time. However, going from "am" to "pm" crossing noon can sometimes be tricky for students if not practiced thoroughly (some might just subtract 10 from 4 directly, getting -6 or 6 without proper understanding).
*   **Word Problems with Rates:** Simple rate problems (e.g., "If 1 pencil costs X rupees, how much do Y pencils cost?") are common. Problems involving *change over time* like temperature or speed are also introduced.
*   **Complexity:** This problem is on par with, perhaps slightly above, a "medium" difficulty word problem found in a Class 6 textbook. It combines two core concepts (time duration and rate of change) that need to be linked correctly. It's not a "trick" question, but it requires careful reading and sequential steps.

**Contrastive Analysis Summary:**

*   **Ease:** The numbers are small and simple (30, 2, 10, 4). The context (temperature) is familiar. The core operations are addition and multiplication.
*   **Hardness:**
    *   **Language:** "per hour" could be a specific lexical hurdle.
    *   **Time Calculation:** Calculating 10 am to 4 pm requires understanding the 12-hour clock and crossing noon (10 am to 12 pm = 2 hours, 12 pm to 4 pm = 4 hours, total 6 hours). This is a common point of error. Some might mistakenly calculate 4-10 = -6 or assume it's simply 4 hours from 10 am to 4 pm.
    *   **Multi-step:** It's not a single-step problem. Students must first find the time difference, then multiply that by the rate, and finally add to the initial temperature. Students who struggle with problem decomposition might falter.
    *   **Problem-solving strategy:** It requires a coherent strategy rather than just recalling a specific formula.

Given the average pass rate of 29% across *all items*, and considering the specifics of this question:
