Let's break down the question and its potential challenges for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and common error patterns.

**Contrastive Analysis of the Specific Question:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geographical Knowledge:** Basic understanding of India's states, specifically Rajasthan, and its common natural features. This is usually covered in Class 6 Social Science (Geography section).
    *   **Concept of "Natural Resources":** Students should understand what a natural resource is (something from nature that people use). This is a fundamental concept in geography.
    *   **Cause and Effect:** The second part of the question requires linking a resource to its influence on people's lives (e.g., water scarcity leading to specific agricultural practices, marble mining creating jobs). This is a basic reasoning skill, but articulating it clearly might be an issue.

*   **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   **"Mention any two natural resources":** Fairly straightforward command. "Natural resources" is a key term, likely taught in English, even in Hindi-medium schools.
    *   **"explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":** This is where the language demand increases.
        *   "Explain how" requires descriptive language and a clear articulation of a relationship.
        *   "influences the lives" is a relatively abstract concept. Students might understand the *impact* but struggle to phrase it using "influences."
        *   "the people there" refers to the people of Rajasthan.
    *   **Overall:** The vocabulary is not overly complex, but the second part demands more than just listing. Students who can list might struggle to explain.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Listing two natural resources of Rajasthan is primarily recall. Students would have encountered this in their geography lessons.
    *   **Reasoning/Application:** Explaining the influence requires a bit of basic reasoning or application of learned concepts. For example, recalling that Rajasthan is dry and then linking water scarcity to specific lifestyles (nomadic, drought-resistant crops) demonstrates this. It's not deep analytical reasoning, but a step beyond pure recall.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Listing:** Very typical and often explicitly asked in textbook questions (e.g., "List natural resources of State X").
    *   **Explaining Influence:** More challenging than just listing, but still a common type of question. Textbooks often include sections on how geography or resources shape livelihoods, which students are expected to internalize. It's more demanding than a simple fill-in-the-blank but less demanding than analyzing complex historical events.

**Comparison with Common Errors and Pass Rates:**

*   **"Explain how colonial rule..." (9% pass rate):** This question is far more complex. It's historical, requires understanding abstract concepts like "colonial rule" and "tribal communities," and demands analytical explanation over a long period. The current question is geographically specific and simpler in its scope.
*   **"Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes?" (10% pass rate):** This requires specific historical/cultural knowledge about Ashoka's pillar and its significance, which can be obscure if not explicitly taught or well-recalled. The current question on natural resources is more directly related to a standard Class 6 geography curriculum. The wrong answers ("Asher' stand," "ashok a second") show a struggling attempt at recall of the name Ashoka, indicating a gap in specific historical detail, not necessarily a lack of general knowledge about India.
*   **"Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign..." (12% pass rate):** Similar to the colonial rule question, this is historical, abstract, and requires more detailed recall and synthesis. "Significance" is a higher-order thinking skill.

**Strengths of the Current Question:**

*   **Concrete:** Natural resources are tangible.
*   **Locally Relevant:** Rajasthan is an Indian state, making it relatable for students.
*   **Clear Rubric:** Two distinct parts, making partial credit (if applicable) easier to achieve. The rubric explicitly lists common correct answers.
*   **Basic Concepts:** "Natural resources" and "influence on lives" are foundational concepts in geography.
*   **Multiple Correct Answers:** Students have a wide range of natural resources to choose from (water, minerals, sand, sun, wind), increasing their chances of naming at least two.

**Weaknesses/Challenges for Students:**

*   **English Explanation:** Articulating the "how it influences" part in English might be a significant barrier for many, even if they understand the concept in Hindi. This is likely where the most common errors will occur (e.g., listing resources
