Let's break down the question for Class 7 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geometric Shapes:** Recognition of a triangle.
    *   **Measurement Concepts:** Understanding of "base" and "height" in the context of a triangle. While standard, some students might confuse height with a side length if not explicitly taught or reinforced.
    *   **Basic Arithmetic:** Multiplication of whole numbers and fractions (specifically by 1/2 or division by 2). This is standard for Class 7.
    *   **Units:** Understanding of "cm" and "cm²" (though the question doesn't explicitly ask for units in the answer, good students might include it, or units might be implicitly part of the curriculum for "area").
    *   **Formula Recall:** The most critical prior knowledge is the formula for the area of a triangle: `Area = 1/2 × base × height`. This is typically introduced in Class 6 or 7.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   "Find the area": Very common phrase in math problems. Should be understood.
    *   "triangle": Common geometric term.
    *   "whose base is `8` cm and height is `6` cm": Direct and clear phrasing. The terms "base" and "height" are likely taught alongside diagrams, so visual association helps.
    *   **Overall:** The language is quite simple and direct for a math problem. There are no complex sentence structures, abstract concepts, or idiomatic expressions. For students with limited English, the key terms ("area," "triangle," "base," "height") would be the main hurdle, but these are core mathematical vocabulary often translated and reinforced in bilingual teaching contexts (e.g., "kshetraफल" for area, "adhar" for base, "unchai" for height). The numerical values are clear.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application** of a recalled formula.
    *   Students need to recall the formula: `Area = 1/2 × base × height`.
    *   Then, they need to identify the given values (base=8, height=6) and substitute them into the formula.
    *   Finally, they perform the arithmetic calculation.
    *   There is no complex reasoning or problem-solving strategy required beyond direct substitution.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question is a **very typical, foundational textbook exercise** when the topic of "Area of a Triangle" is introduced and practiced. It's the most straightforward application of the formula, without any distractions like extra information, finding a missing dimension, or composite shapes. It would likely be one of the very first problems after the formula is taught.

**Factors making it easier:**

*   **Direct application:** No need to derive anything or solve for a missing variable (e.g., given area and base, find height).
*   **Simple numbers:** `8` and `6` are easy to multiply, and `48/2` is a simple division.
*   **Clear language:** Minimal ambiguity.
*   **High frequency content:** Area of a triangle is a fundamental concept in Class 6/7 geometry.

**Factors making it harder:**

*   **Formula recall:** If a student hasn't memorized the formula, they cannot solve it.
*   **English vocabulary:** While simple, "base" and "height" might still be new or confusing for some with very low English proficiency, especially if they are primarily taught in Hindi without adequate English exposure in math class.
*   **Arithmetic error:** Small chance of calculation mistake (e.g., 8*6=42 instead of 48, or forgetting to divide by 2).
*   **Understanding "1/2":** Some students might struggle with multiplying by a fraction or dividing by 2 if their foundational fraction concepts are weak.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%):**

This question is significantly *easier* than an average item if that 29% average includes more complex problems involving multiple steps, reasoning, or more abstract concepts. The "area of a triangle" formula is a cornerstone of Class 6/7 geometry.

Given that it's a direct application, the biggest hurdle will be *formula recall* and basic arithmetic, followed by understanding the few key English terms. Since this topic is taught and reinforced, a good number of students should have memorized this fundamental formula.

I would expect this question to perform *above* the average pass rate of 29%.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:** 45%
