Let's break down the question "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning" using the provided context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Core Knowledge:** Students are expected to have learned about the Harappan Civilization (also known as Indus Valley Civilization) as part of their Class 8 Indian history curriculum. This is a foundational topic in ancient Indian history.
    *   **Specific Knowledge:** They need to recall details about its urban planning. Key features like the grid system, drainage, and division into citadel/lower town are typically highlighted in textbooks when this topic is covered.
    *   **Comparison to other difficult questions:** The previous difficult questions ("colonial rule and tribals," "lions on currency," "Ashoka's reign") also assume prior knowledge. However, the *type* of knowledge and the *depth* of explanation required differ. "Harappan urban planning" is a fairly straightforward factual recall topic, often presented with clear bullet points or distinct descriptions in textbooks.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   **Question Phrasing:** "Describe one key feature..." is relatively simple and direct. "Key feature" is a common phrase. "Urban planning" might be slightly more complex than individual words, but it's a core concept for the topic.
    *   **Expected Answer:** The rubric allows for straightforward descriptions. Students don't need complex sentence structures or extensive vocabulary. Words like "grid layout," "drainage system," "baked bricks," "citadel," "lower town" are specific terms associated with the topic that they would likely encounter in their textbooks (even if translated into Hindi).
    *   **Comparison to other difficult questions:**
        *   "Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi" requires understanding "affected," "colonial rule," and "tribal communities" and then synthesizing that information into an explanation. This is significantly more complex linguistically and conceptually.
        *   "Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes? Explain" requires understanding "why" (causation/symbolism) and "explain," which is harder than simply "describe."
        *   "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign..." also requires understanding "significance" and "explain," which is a higher-order thinking skill than simple description.
    *   **Overall:** The language demand for the Harappan question is moderate-low for an English-medium exam, especially compared to the other examples. A student with even limited English could likely identify and write a few key words or a simple sentence if they know the answer.

3.  **Type of Cognitive Demand (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   **Pure Recall:** This question is almost entirely recall. Students either remember one of the distinct features of Harappan urban planning or they don't. There's minimal application or reasoning required beyond retrieving factual information.
    *   **Comparison to other difficult questions:**
        *   "Colonial rule and tribals" requires *analysis* and *explanation* of impact.
        *   "Lions on currency" requires *reasoning* about symbolism and historical context.
        *   "Ashoka's significance" requires *analysis* and *synthesis* of his contributions.
    *   **Overall:** This makes the Harappan question inherently easier than the examples provided, which demand higher-order thinking.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical Textbook Question:** This type of question ("List features of...", "Describe the urban planning of...") is very common in textbooks and end-of-chapter exercises for the Harappan Civilization. It's often a direct information retrieval task.
    *   **Comparison to other difficult questions:** The other questions, while based on textbook content, often require a more nuanced understanding or a synthesis of information that goes beyond simple recall from a single paragraph. "Colonial rule" might involve linking multiple chapters or themes.
    *   **Overall:** This question aligns with a basic-to-moderate level textbook question, far less complex than the "difficult" examples given.

**Conclusion for Harappan Question:**

This question is significantly *easier* than the sample difficult questions for several reasons:
*   It's direct factual recall, not explanation or reasoning.
*   The language is simple and direct ("Describe one key feature").
*   Harappan Civilization is a core, well-defined topic in Class 8 history, with its urban planning features typically being very prominent in textbooks.
*   The distinctness of features (grid, drainage, bricks, citadel) makes them easier to remember and articulate.

The common errors in the sample difficult questions ("Empty Response," "Asher' stand," "ashok a second") suggest either a lack of knowledge,
