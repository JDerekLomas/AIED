Let's break down the question "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away" using the provided context and error analysis.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **What prior knowledge is assumed?**
    *   **Grammatical Concepts:** A fundamental understanding of active and passive voice. This means recognizing the subject, verb, and object in a sentence and understanding how their roles shift in passive voice (object becomes subject, "be" verb + past participle, "by" phrase).
    *   **Verb Conjugation:** Knowledge of irregular past participles (e.g., "blow" -> "blew" -> "blown").
    *   **Vocabulary:** Basic vocabulary: "wind," "blew" (past tense of blow), "leaves," "away." These are common words.

2.  **What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
    *   **Understanding Instructions:** "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice." This is a direct grammatical instruction. The terms "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" are technical grammatical terms. If these terms haven't been explicitly taught and reinforced in English class (or their Hindi equivalents explained), the student might not even understand *what* they are being asked to do, even if they can construct a passive sentence. The low pass rates for questions like "Describes the poet’s writing style" suggest that technical vocabulary, even in English instructions, is a major hurdle.
    *   **Syntactic Transformation:** Students need to mentally re-order the sentence components, identify the new subject, select the correct form of "to be" (past tense, plural: "were"), and use the past participle.
    *   **Irregular Verbs:** "Blew" to "blown" is an irregular verb. While "blown" is a relatively common past participle, it's still a point of potential error for students who struggle with verb forms.
    *   **Prepositional Phrase:** The "by the wind" phrase needs to be added correctly.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of grammatical rules. Students need to apply the rules of active-to-passive transformation to a given sentence.
    *   It requires **recall** of the definition of active/passive voice and specific verb forms (past participle).
    *   There's minimal *reasoning* beyond understanding the transformation rules.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Difficulty Level:** This is a very common type of grammatical transformation exercise found in Class 7 English textbooks. It's a standard skill taught.
    *   **Compared to "Describe the poet's writing style":** Much easier. That question demands abstract understanding, analytical skills, and descriptive language, which are far beyond the typical Class 7 EWS student's English proficiency.
    *   **Compared to "Write a theme...":** Much easier. "Theme" requires abstract conceptualization and expressing complex ideas, which is extremely challenging.
    *   **Compared to "Write a short paragraph...My Favourite Hobby":** This active/passive question is arguably *harder* than simply describing a hobby, even with the difficulties students show in that task. While the "hobby" question allows for simpler sentence structures, the active/passive transformation requires precise application of specific grammatical rules and verb forms, which might be less intuitive than just listing things about a hobby. The "My hobby is cricket play" error shows a lack of grammatical structure, which directly impacts active/passive.

**Common Errors & Specific Question Implications:**

*   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%) Wrong answer: "I am reading."** This highlights a fundamental misunderstanding of the question's intent and inability to engage with abstract prompts. The active/passive question is more concrete.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (pass rate: 5%) Wrong answer: "Empty Response" / "The last bargin they about a child and labour."** This points to extreme difficulty with abstract thought, identifying central ideas, and constructing coherent sentences. The active/passive question is less abstract.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'." (pass rate: 10%) Wrong answer: "My hobby is cricket play" / "My Favowrife Hobby cbaking"** These errors are crucial. They demonstrate:
    *   **Lack of basic sentence structure:** "My hobby is cricket play" is grammatically incorrect, missing a verb or using "play" incorrectly.
    *   **Spelling errors:** "Favowrife," "cbaking" are common, but "blown" might also be misspelled.
