Let's break down the question "Describes the poet's writing style" for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and common error patterns.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Implicit:** The student must have read a poem by *a* poet to be able to describe their style. However, the question as presented is out of context. If it's a standalone question, it's asking for a *general understanding* of what "writing style" means, not necessarily to apply it to a specific poem. This is a crucial distinction. If they are expected to describe the style of a *previously read* poem, then understanding that poem's content is also assumed. Given the general nature and the low pass rate, it's likely they struggle with the concept itself.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Describes," "poet's," "writing style." "Style" is the trickiest here. It's an abstract concept.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **"Describes":** This is a fairly common verb, but students might confuse it with "tell me about" or "write about."
    *   **"Poet's":** The possessive 's is usually understood. "Poet" itself is a common word.
    *   **"Writing style":** This is the core difficulty.
        *   "Writing" is common.
        *   "Style" is abstract and has multiple meanings. Students might associate "style" with fashion, appearance, or a specific *type* of writing (e.g., story, poem) rather than the *manner* in which it is written.
        *   The phrase "writing style" as a conceptual unit is likely unfamiliar. They might not have encountered explicit instruction on analyzing "writing style" in Class 7 English, especially in a way that requires them to generate descriptive adjectives.
    *   **Expected Output:** The rubric asks for "a suitable and relevant word describing the writing style (e.g., simple, descriptive, informal, direct)." These are all adjectives that require a relatively sophisticated understanding of literary analysis and vocabulary. "Simple" might be known, but "descriptive," "informal," "direct" are less common for this level, especially in an analytical context.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Reasoning/Application (High Level):** If this question requires them to analyze a *specific, previously read poem* and then deduce its style. This is very high-level for Class 7.
    *   **Recall (Conceptual):** If it's asking for a general understanding of what "writing style" means and how one *would* describe it. Even this requires recalling a definition and examples, which is difficult if the concept hasn't been explicitly taught.
    *   **As presented (standalone):** It seems to be testing their understanding of the *concept* "writing style." The wrong answers like "I am reading" suggest a fundamental misunderstanding of the question's intent. They might be trying to describe their *action* related to a poem, or simply struggling to form a coherent response. "Empty Response" further supports this.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 7 English exercises often focus on:
        *   Comprehension of explicit information (e.g., "Who is the main character?").
        *   Identifying themes (e.g., "What is the poem about?").
        *   Vocabulary building (matching, fill-in-the-blanks).
        *   Basic grammar (tenses, parts of speech).
        *   Simple creative writing (e.g., "Write a few sentences about your hobby").
    *   **Analyzing "writing style" is typically a higher-order skill introduced later.** While they might discuss *what* a poet writes about, they rarely delve into *how* they write it using specific adjectives. This kind of meta-analysis of language is usually reserved for higher classes (9th-10th grade and above) where literary criticism begins to be introduced.
    *   The "My Favourite Hobby" and "Theme or central idea" questions, despite their low pass rates, are more aligned with expected Class 7 tasks (describing, identifying main idea), even if the execution is flawed. The "writing style" question is conceptually much more advanced.

**Why the 4% Pass Rate is Plausible/Expected:**

*   **Abstract Concept:** "Writing style" is highly abstract. Students at this level, especially with limited English, struggle with abstract concepts.
*   **Lack of Explicit Instruction:** It's highly probable that "writing style" as
