Let's break down the question for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, keeping their specific context in mind.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Time:** Understanding of AM/PM, calculating elapsed time between two points (e.g., 10 am to 4 pm). This is a fundamental concept taught by Class 6, but calculating across noon (12 pm) can sometimes be a minor hiccup for some.
    *   **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition, multiplication. Specifically, adding the initial temperature and the total increase, and multiplying the hourly increase by the number of hours.
    *   **Temperature:** Understanding of degrees Celsius ($^0 C$) as a unit of temperature.
    *   **Word Problems:** Ability to extract numerical information and the operation required from a written scenario.

*   **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   "At 10 am in the morning": Fairly straightforward. "Morning" reinforces "am."
    *   "temperature of Jodhpur was 30^0 C": Clear.
    *   "If the temperature increases by 2^0 C per hour": "Increases by" is key. "Per hour" means for each hour. This is likely understandable with basic vocabulary.
    *   "then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?": "Evening" reinforces "pm." "What will be" asks for the future state.
    *   **Overall:** The language is quite simple and direct for a word problem. There are no complex sentence structures or highly academic vocabulary. The numbers are clearly presented. The key terms ("increases by", "per hour") are common in mathematical contexts even in Hindi medium and are often introduced with bilingual support.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily an **application** question. It requires applying the concepts of time calculation, rate of change (implicit multiplication), and addition to a real-world scenario.
    *   It's not pure recall (like memorizing a formula).
    *   It requires minimal "reasoning" beyond understanding the problem's structure (initial state + change over time = final state). It's a straightforward linear progression.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Moderate Difficulty:** This is a very common type of word problem in Class 6 mathematics textbooks, especially in chapters involving "time" or "simple interest/rates." It's often one of the first few application problems after introducing the core concepts.
    *   It's more complex than a direct calculation (e.g., $30 + 2 \times 6 = ?$) because it requires interpreting the time elapsed and the "per hour" rate.
    *   It's less complex than multi-step problems involving unit conversions, fractions/decimals, or more abstract variables.
    *   The numbers are whole numbers, making calculations easy without calculators.

**Potential Pitfalls/Challenges for These Students:**

1.  **Calculating Elapsed Time:** The jump from 10 am to 4 pm. Some might struggle with counting hours accurately, especially crossing noon (10->11->12->1->2->3->4 = 6 hours). A common error could be counting only 3 or 5 hours if they miscount.
2.  **Understanding "per hour":** While simple, some might just add 2 once, or mistakenly divide, or multiply by the wrong number.
3.  **Language comprehension:** Despite the simplicity, if a student has extremely low English proficiency, even basic words like "increases" or "per" could be stumbling blocks. However, in a math context, these terms are usually taught repeatedly.
4.  **Arithmetic error:** Simple addition or multiplication mistakes.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate of 29%:**

An average pass rate of 29% across *all items* suggests a generally low performance level. This problem, while common, is not *trivial*. It requires multiple steps:
1.  Identify initial temperature.
2.  Identify initial time.
3.  Identify final time.
4.  Identify rate of change.
5.  Calculate time elapsed. (Crucial first step for many)
6.  Calculate total change.
7.  Calculate final temperature.

The "Max score: 1" suggests it's an all-or-nothing question.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**

Given the points above:
*   The math content is appropriate and commonly taught.
*   The language is relatively simple.
*   The primary challenge will be accurately calculating the elapsed time and then
