Here's an analysis of the question, leading to an estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis of the Question:

**Question:** What are the main occupations of people in the rural areas of Rajasthan? Describe any one in brief.
**Rubric:** Names at least two main occupations correctly (e.g., Agriculture/farming, Animal Husbandry/pastoralism, handicrafts).
**Max score:** 1

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Geographical Awareness:** Basic understanding that Rajasthan is a state in India and that it has rural areas.
*   **Socio-economic Awareness:** General knowledge of common rural occupations in India, particularly those suited to Rajasthan's arid climate. This includes agriculture (though often rain-fed or irrigated), animal husbandry (due to less fertile land), and traditional crafts.
*   **Class 7 Social Science Curriculum:** This topic (livelihoods, regional geography, and economy) is typically covered in Class 6 or 7 Social and Political Life (Civics) or Geography textbooks. Students would have learned about different types of livelihoods, especially in rural areas.

**2. Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
*   **Keywords:** "main occupations," "rural areas," "Rajasthan," "describe in brief."
*   **Vocabulary:** "Occupations" might be challenging for some, but "karya" (work/job) is a common Hindi equivalent that students would understand conceptually. "Rural areas" (gramin kshetra) is also a very common term. Rajasthan is a direct name.
*   **Sentence Structure:** The question is straightforward, asking for a list and then a brief description. It doesn't use complex grammar or abstract concepts.
*   **Description Task:** "Describe any one in brief" requires them to articulate a few points about one occupation. This is a simple expository task.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
*   **Recall (Primary):** The question primarily tests recall of facts about common occupations in a specific region.
*   **Application/Understanding (Secondary):** The "describe in brief" part requires a basic understanding of what that occupation entails, not just memorizing its name. However, the description can be very simple (e.g., "farming involves growing crops").

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
*   **Lower-Middle Difficulty:** This is a very common type of question found at the end of chapters in Class 6 or 7 Geography/Social and Political Life textbooks, often phrased as "List the main occupations..." or "What are the livelihoods of people in X region?"
*   **Accessibility:** Unlike the common error examples provided, this question is specific, grounded in concrete reality, and doesn't require deep historical analysis, abstract reasoning, or interpretation of symbols.
*   **Low Cognitive Load for Recall:** Students are likely to have encountered this information repeatedly in their studies of different regions.
*   **Contextual Cues:** Even if they don't explicitly remember "Rajasthan," the term "rural areas" combined with common sense about Indian rural life might allow them to guess "agriculture" and "animal husbandry," which are likely correct for most parts of rural India, including Rajasthan.

**Contrast with Common Errors:**

*   **"Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi" (pass rate: 9%)**: This question requires complex historical analysis, understanding causality, and abstract concepts like "colonial rule" and its "effects." The language is more demanding.
*   **"Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes? Explain" (pass rate: 10%)**: This is an inferential question requiring knowledge of symbols (Ashoka Chakra/Sarnath lions) and their historical significance, which can be obscure for many students. The common errors show confusion with names.
*   **"Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign in Indian history, mentioning at leas" (pass rate: 12%)**: Similar to the tribal question, this requires understanding historical significance, linking events, and recalling specific details about a reign, which is a higher-order thinking skill than listing occupations.

**Why this question is easier:**

1.  **Concrete and Familiar:** Occupations in rural areas are part of students' lived experience or very close to it. They see farmers, shepherds, and artisans around them.
2.  **Direct Recall:** It asks for straightforward facts.
3.  **Low Language Barrier:** The terms are common, and the task is simple. Even if they struggle to *write* perfectly in English, identifying the *names* of occupations (e.g., "farming," "animal") is achievable.
4.  **No Abstract Thinking:** It doesn't require interpreting symbols, analyzing cause-and
