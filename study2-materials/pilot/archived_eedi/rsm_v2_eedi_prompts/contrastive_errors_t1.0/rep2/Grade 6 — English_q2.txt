Let's break down the question "Who lived inside the book?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and common errors.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Direct Answer Retrieval:** The primary assumption is that students have read the source material (a story, poem, or passage) from which this question is drawn. Without the source text, it's impossible to answer.
    *   **Basic Comprehension:** Students need to understand the concept of "who" (a person/character), "lived" (resided, existed), and "inside the book" (within the confines of the story).
    *   **Vocabulary:** "lived" and "inside" are relatively common words for this age group, even with limited English. "Book" is fundamental.
*   **Language Demands for Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Simplicity of Question Structure:** The question uses a very direct "Wh- question" structure ("Who lived X?"). This is one of the most basic question forms. There are no complex clauses, subordinate conjunctions, or abstract concepts.
    *   **Concrete Nature:** "Who," "lived," and "book" are all concrete concepts, making it easier to visualize and connect to the source material than abstract ideas (like "writing style" or "theme").
    *   **Low Cognitive Load:** The question asks for a direct factual recall. It doesn't require interpretation, synthesis, or extended writing, unlike the "writing style," "theme," or "favourite hobby" questions which require more complex thought processes and output.
    *   **Short Answer Requirement:** The expected answer ("a magical fairy" or "fairy") is very short and direct, minimizing the need for sentence construction, grammar, spelling, or punctuation beyond the core words. This is a significant advantage compared to "write a short paragraph."
*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is almost purely **recall**. If the student has read the passage and understood that a fairy lived in the book, they simply need to retrieve that information. There is no application of concepts or complex reasoning involved.
*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Easier:** This question is significantly *easier* than the examples provided of common errors.
        *   "Describes the poet’s writing style": Requires understanding abstract concepts and sophisticated vocabulary.
        *   "Write a theme or central idea": Requires high-level comprehension, synthesis, and abstract thinking.
        *   "Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'": Requires sustained writing, grammatical construction, and idea generation.
    *   "Who lived inside the book?" is a very common type of comprehension question found in the "answer the following questions" section of most English textbooks for this level. It's designed to check basic understanding of plot points, not deeper analysis.

**Factors Mitigating Difficulty (Making it easier):**

*   **Simple vocabulary and grammar:** All words are common and the sentence structure is basic.
*   **Direct factual recall:** No interpretation or inference needed.
*   **Short, precise answer:** Minimizes writing burden and grammatical errors.
*   **Concrete concepts:** Easy to grasp.
*   **Likely found directly in text:** The answer would probably be explicitly stated in the source text.

**Factors Exacerbating Difficulty (Making it harder):**

*   **Lack of Access to Source Text:** This is the *biggest* potential hurdle. If the question is presented in isolation without the accompanying story, it's unanswerable. Assuming the test provides the story, this point is moot.
*   **Complete Lack of Comprehension:** Even with simple words, if the student has absolutely no understanding of the source text, they can't answer.
*   **"Empty Response" Habit:** Some students, due to low confidence or lack of understanding, might default to "Empty Response," as seen in other examples, even for easier questions. However, the directness of this question might reduce this tendency for those who *do* know the answer.

**Conclusion:**

This question is a fundamental comprehension check. It avoids the pitfalls of abstract language, complex sentence structures, and extended writing requirements that plague the "common errors" examples. While "Empty Response" is a risk, students who have read the passage and grasped the core plot point will likely be able to identify "fairy." The low average pass rate of 29% across *all items* indicates a challenging exam environment, but this specific item is intrinsically simpler than those contributing to that low average.

Given its directness and minimal language demands, I expect a considerably higher pass rate for this question compared to the 4-10% seen in the harder examples.
