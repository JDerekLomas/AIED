Let's break down the question and its potential impact on Class 6 students in Indian government schools.

**Contrastive Analysis of the Question:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geographical Knowledge:** Basic understanding of Rajasthan's location within India and its general environmental characteristics (e.g., desert, dry).
    *   **Concept of Natural Resources:** Students should know what "natural resources" are (materials from nature that people use). This is a fundamental concept in geography/social science at this level.
    *   **Basic Economic/Social Connection:** The ability to link a resource to its impact on human life (e.g., water scarcity affects farming, mining provides jobs).
    *   **Specific Resources of Rajasthan:** While general knowledge might suggest "sand" or "sun," specific mineral resources like marble, copper, gypsum, zinc, etc., might be less universally known without specific textbook exposure or local context.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Keywords:** "Mention," "natural resources," "Rajasthan," "explain," "influences," "lives of the people." These are relatively straightforward vocabulary items for a Class 6 social science context.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The question is a compound request ("mention two... and explain how one..."). This requires students to follow two distinct parts of the instruction.
    *   **Complexity:** It's not overly complex syntactically. The most challenging part is the "explain how one influences" part, which requires more than just listing.
    *   **Limited English Proficiency Impact:** While the vocabulary is common, students might struggle with the nuance of "influences" or providing a coherent explanation in English, even if they understand the concept in Hindi. They might list resources correctly but then struggle with the explanatory part.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Listing two natural resources of Rajasthan is primarily recall. Students would have learned this from their geography textbooks or general knowledge.
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** Explaining *how* one of them influences lives requires a degree of application and basic reasoning. It's not just rote memorization. For example, recalling "water" is recall; explaining that "water scarcity means less farming and people walk far to fetch water" is application/reasoning.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Listing Resources:** This is a very common type of question in textbooks (e.g., "List natural resources of your state/country").
    *   **Explaining Influence:** This is also a common step up from mere listing, requiring students to think about the practical implications.
    *   **Rubric Simplification:** The rubric gives a maximum score of 1. This implies that even a relatively brief or slightly imperfect explanation, alongside two correct resources, might fetch the point. This simplifies the scoring.
    *   **Compared to other examples:**
        *   "Explain how colonial rule..." (9% pass rate): This requires deep analytical thinking, historical understanding, and complex language to explain cause-effect relationships over a broad period. Much harder.
        *   "Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes?" (10% pass rate): Requires specific cultural/historical knowledge (Ashoka's pillar) that might not be explicitly taught in all curricula or easily recalled.
        *   "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign..." (12% pass rate): Requires a broader understanding of historical significance, multiple points, and good explanatory skills. Much harder.

**Key Factors for This Question's Difficulty:**

*   **Specificity of Rajasthan:** While many students might know "water" or "sunlight," knowing specific minerals like "marble" or "copper" requires dedicated study of Rajasthan's resources. However, "sand" or "water" are very intuitive for Rajasthan.
*   **"Explain how... influences":** This is the tricky part. Simply listing "water" and "sand" isn't enough. They need to connect it to life, e.g., "Water is scarce, so people struggle for drinking water and farming is difficult," or "Sand leads to deserts, affecting farming and transport."
*   **Single Point Rubric:** This is crucial. It means students don't need a comprehensive, perfectly worded explanation. A basic connection might be enough.
*   **Common Errors in Other Questions:** The other questions show "Empty Response" and very garbled answers. This suggests a significant portion struggle with *any* coherent response in English.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%) and Common Errors:**

The average pass rate is low, and the common errors indicate major struggles with complex explanations and even basic recall in English. However, the current question is *less demanding* than the examples provided in terms of abstract reasoning
