Let's break down the question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason." using the provided context and error analysis.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Passage Comprehension:** Students are assumed to have read and understood the story about the king's three questions (likely "The Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy, or a similar tale). This is fundamental. If they haven't understood the core plot and the nature of the king's questions, they cannot answer.
    *   **Basic Life Concepts:** Understanding what "important," "real life," and "reason" mean in a general sense. This is relatively basic.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Do you think": Common phrase, likely understood.
        *   "king's questions": Direct reference, should be clear if they know "king" and "question."
        *   "important": Fairly common, but can be abstract.
        *   "real life": More abstract, but probably understood as "in actual life/day-to-day."
        *   "Give one reason": Clear instruction.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The question itself is a direct interrogative, followed by an imperative. It's relatively simple.
    *   **Response Formulation:**
        *   Students need to form an opinion ("Yes, I think...") or state it implicitly.
        *   They need to articulate *one reason*. This is the critical part. The reason doesn't need to be grammatically perfect, but it needs to convey a valid point.
        *   Common errors like "Empty Response" and very basic, disconnected sentences ("I am reading") are a major concern. The examples show a severe struggle with expressing even simple ideas in English.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall (Partial):** Recalling the *nature* of the king's questions from the passage is recall.
    *   **Application/Reasoning (Primary):** The core of the question is applying the *importance* of those questions to "real life" and *reasoning* why. This requires a small leap from the text to personal relevance. It's not just regurgitating facts from the story; it asks for an opinion and justification.

4.  **How it Compares in Difficulty to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Lower-Level Textbook Questions:** Often ask for direct recall from the passage (e.g., "What were the king's three questions?"). This question goes beyond that.
    *   **Higher-Level Textbook Questions:** Might ask for character analysis or thematic interpretation, which are generally harder.
    *   **Compared to the Common Errors:**
        *   "Describes the poet’s writing style": Much harder due to abstract vocabulary ("describes," "writing style") and the need for analytical thinking. The low pass rate (4%) confirms this.
        *   "Write a theme or central idea...": Also harder due to "theme," "central idea," and the need for synthesis. The 5% pass rate is indicative.
        *   "Write a short paragraph... about 'My Favourite Hobby'": This is an "easier" task as it's personal and doesn't require passage comprehension. However, the 10% pass rate shows the fundamental struggle with basic sentence construction and conveying coherent ideas. The errors like "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho" or "My hobby is cricket play" suggest *very* limited ability to form grammatically correct and complete sentences, even for simple topics.

**Specific Difficulty Considerations for "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."**

*   **Positive Aspects (Making it *easier* than the 4-10% pass rate questions):**
    *   The core concept of "importance" is relatable.
    *   It asks for "one reason," limiting the output requirement.
    *   The king's questions are about universal human concerns (right time, right thing, right people), which are intrinsically relatable to *real life*. This makes forming a "reason" more accessible than, say, analyzing poetic style.
    *   A simple "Yes, because it helps us make good decisions" would suffice.

*   **Negative Aspects (Making it *harder* than it might seem):**
    *   **The "Empty Response" problem:** This is the biggest killer. If students struggle to write *anything* coherent, the difficulty of the question is secondary. The examples show this is a significant issue.
    *   **Grammar/Sentence Structure
