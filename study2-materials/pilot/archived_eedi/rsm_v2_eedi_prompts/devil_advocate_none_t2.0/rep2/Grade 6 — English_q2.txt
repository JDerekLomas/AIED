To accurately estimate this, I need the "book" in question. The question "Who lived inside the book?" is a comprehension question, and without the accompanying text/story from which this question is drawn, I cannot estimate the correct proportion.

Please provide the story or context for "Who lived inside the book?". Once I have that, I can apply the given constraints and calibrate the estimate.
