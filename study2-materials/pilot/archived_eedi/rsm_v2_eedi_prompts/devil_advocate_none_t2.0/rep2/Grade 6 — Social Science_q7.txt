ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **15%**

Here's my reasoning, challenging initial instincts:

1.  **Limited English:** The prompt mentions "limited English." While "natural resources" might be a familiar term in their native language (e.g., "prakritik sansadhan"), translating it accurately and recalling specific English terms like "marble," "copper," or "gypsum" could be a significant hurdle. Even "water" might be written as "jal" if they struggle with the English word in an exam context.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:** While "natural resources" is a fundamental topic, specifically recalling *two* from Rajasthan and *then* explaining the influence of *one* on people's lives requires several steps:
    *   Recall definition of natural resources.
    *   Recall specific natural resources of Rajasthan.
    *   Choose two and name them in English.
    *   Choose one of those two.
    *   Formulate a sentence (or two) in English explaining its influence.

    Many students, especially those absent or with inconsistent learning, might know *what* natural resources are but struggle to *apply* it to Rajasthan specifically, or express the *influence* effectively in English. For instance, they might know Rajasthan is dry and mention "water," but struggle to explain *how* it influences lives (e.g., "scarce water leads to hardship" vs. "water is used for farming").

3.  **Anxiety and Novelty of Question Type:** This isn't just a recall question. It's a two-part question (mention *and* explain influence) which adds complexity. Many students might manage to list one or even two resources, but then freeze on the "explain how it influences lives" part due to anxiety or lack of practice with this level of elaboration in English. They might just list them and stop.

4.  **Specifics for Rajasthan:** While general natural resources are known, naming two *specific to Rajasthan* and explaining their impact is a step beyond. Students might name "trees" or "rivers" which are too generic or not sufficiently impactful/defining for Rajasthan in a way that suggests geographical understanding.

5.  **Passing the Bar for "Correct":** The rubric requires mentioning two *correct* natural resources and then *explaining how one influences lives*. Simply listing "water" isn't enough; the explanation is crucial for full credit (even though the max score is 1, it implies completeness for the credit). A student who writes "Water and sand. Water is important for us" might not be considered "correct" if the explanation is too simplistic or doesn't demonstrate influence. The explanation requires demonstrating cause and effect ("scarce water influences agriculture and daily life," or "marble is used for buildings and generates income").

Considering all these factors, a student achieving *both* steps accurately in English is likely a minority. My initial gut might have been 25-30%, but thinking about the "limited English," "struggling learners," and the specific demands of the "explain" part pulls the estimate significantly lower. Many will get one part right, or offer a weak explanation, not fully satisfying the implicit requirement of a "correct" response as per the prompt.
