Let's break down the difficulty factors for this question:

**Factors making it difficult:**

*   **Vocabulary:**
    *   "Contribute to" might be abstract for struggling learners.
    *   "Expansion of British power" requires understanding what "power" means in a historical, political context.
    *   "Political dominance," "puppet nawab" (from the rubric) are complex terms.
*   **Conceptual understanding:**
    *   Students need to recall specific historical facts (Battle of Plassey, 1757).
    *   They need to understand *causality* – how one event led to another, specifically the link between a battle victory and long-term political control. This is more abstract than just stating a fact.
    *   "British power" isn't just military might; it's about administrative and economic control, which can be hard for students to grasp fully.
*   **English Language Barrier:**
    *   The question itself is relatively simple English, but extracting the required *nuance* for the answer (political dominance, control over Bengal) is difficult if their comprehension is weak. Many might remember "British won" but not the *implications*.
*   **Syllabus Coverage/Teacher Quality:**
    *   While the Battle of Plassey is a core topic, the *depth* to which the *consequences* (political dominance, puppet rule) are explained might vary greatly. If it's taught as just "Britain won, good for Britain," students won't get to the rubric's specifics.
*   **Memory and Recall:** Even if taught, recalling the specific political outcome (control over Bengal, Mir Jafar as a puppet) rather than just "British victory" or "it was important" requires precise memory.
*   **Lack of Practice:** "How did X contribute to Y" questions are analytical. Students used to rote memorization might struggle with this question type.
*   **Exam Anxiety:** For low-performing students, even familiar topics can cause a mental block under pressure.

**Factors making it easier (relatively):**

*   **Core Topic:** The Battle of Plassey is a very important event in Indian history syllabi and is almost certainly taught.
*   **Single Key Idea:** The rubric focuses on one core idea (political dominance over Bengal), not multiple complex points.

**Challenging the first instinct:**

My first instinct might be "Oh, everyone knows Plassey, they should get this." But then I have to think about the average Class 8 student in a government school, mostly from economically weaker sections.

*   **Barely reads English:** A student who barely reads English will likely get stuck on "contribute to" or might just pick out keywords like "Battle of Plassey" and say something generic like "British became powerful." They might not grasp "political dominance."
*   **Absent for the topic:** If they missed the class on Plassey's *outcomes*, or if the teaching was superficial, they won't know the specific answer.
*   **Limited analytical skills:** Many students are taught to regurgitate facts. This question requires connecting the *cause* (victory) to the *effect* (political control), which is a step beyond simple recall.

Considering the *average pass rate of 29%*, it means a significant portion struggles across the board. While Plassey is a "big deal" historically, expressing its *contribution to political dominance in Bengal* in an accurate way that satisfies the rubric is a higher bar than just identifying the date or the victor. Many might give partially correct but insufficient answers, such as "British won and got more power," which wouldn't get the full mark according to the detailed rubric ("establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)").

Given the strong emphasis on how teachers/experts overestimate performance, I need to push my estimate lower than initial gut feelings. Even if they know Plassey was important, knowing the precise *contribution* to political dominance in *Bengal* and explaining it to meet the rubric is tough.

My initial thought might be around 25-30% for a core topic. However, considering the English limitation, the need for conceptual understanding beyond rote facts, and the common pitfalls:

*   Many will likely just state "British won the battle."
*   Some will say "British became more powerful."
*   Fewer will articulate "political dominance over Bengal" or mention the puppet nawab.

Therefore, the proportion who can provide an answer explicitly meeting the rubric's specific criteria (political dominance/control over Bengal, e.g., Mir Jafar as puppet nawab) will be significantly lower than those who know "something" about Plassey.

I'm going to bring it down further.
