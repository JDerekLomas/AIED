Let's break this down using the given context and warning.

**Initial Instinct (before calibration):** A fable is a common literary term. Most students would have heard of it. Probably around 50-60%.

**Applying the Calibration Lens:**

*   **English Proficiency:** "Define" itself might be challenging for students with limited English. "Fable" is an English word. While the concept might have been taught, the *specific English word* might not be deeply ingrained.
*   **"Basic" Concepts aren't Basic:** Even if taught, students from struggling backgrounds often don't internalize concepts at the same rate. They might remember *some* aspects (like animals) but struggle with the full definition.
*   **Anxiety/Recall:** Under exam conditions, recall can be significantly poorer than in a classroom.
*   **Exact Question Type:** Has this exact "Define X" question been practiced specifically for "fable" often enough that they can perfectly recall the three key elements (short story, animals, moral)? Probably not for most.
*   **Partial Knowledge vs. Full Credit:** The rubric requires *all three* elements (short story, animals, moral) for full credit. Many might get one or two, but not all three. For instance, "story with animals" or "story with a lesson." The prompt says "Max score: 1" implying partial credit isn't allowed here for a *correct* proportion.

**Re-evaluation:**

*   **The "29% average pass rate" is crucial.** This isn't just a randomly difficult question; it's within a larger assessment environment where most students struggle.
*   **Many might struggle with "define."** They might be able to *identify* a fable, but not *formally define* it.
*   The required definition ("short story that typically uses animals as characters and imparts a moral lesson") is quite precise. Students are often taught "stories with animals and a lesson," but the "short story" aspect and the formality of "imparts" or "moral lesson" might be a stretch.

Considering all these factors, the initial estimate is far too optimistic. I need to push it significantly lower, probably even below the average pass rate, given the *precision* required for a "correct" answer here and the limitations.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **12%**
