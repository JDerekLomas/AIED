Let's break down the thinking process, keeping the stated biases in mind.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**
My first thought might be: "Himalayas is common knowledge. Most Indian kids would know that. Aravalli, Vindhya are also pretty common. 0.5 points for one? Easily 60-70%."

**Challenging the Initial Instinct (Applying the biases):**

1.  **Limited English:** "Name any two major mountain ranges..."
    *   "Name" - generally understood.
    *   "any two" - implies choice, but also requires two distinct correct answers.
    *   "major mountain ranges" - The word "major" is key. Do they know the English word "major"? Do they know "mountain ranges"? "Ranges" might be a stretch. Even if they know "mountains," the concept of a "range" as a group of connected mountains might be fuzzy in English.
    *   A student struggling with English might understand "mountains in India" but struggle with "major ranges."

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   For a well-taught, fluent English speaker, "Himalayas" is a given.
    *   For a Class 6 student in a remote village school, learning English might be happening alongside geography in their regional language. The connection between the English term "Himalayas" and the geographic feature they might know by a local name, or just as "the big mountains to the North," might not be solid.
    *   "Aravalli," "Vindhya," "Satpura," "Western/Eastern Ghats" - These are more specific. Even if taught, without strong reinforcement, they fade, especially if taught in a different language first.

3.  **Exam Anxiety:** "Name any two..." If a student can't immediately recall one name clearly, they might blank on the entire question. The pressure of an exam can obscure even known facts.

4.  **Never Practiced this Exact Question Type:** While they might have learned about Indian geography, the *exact phrasing* of "Name any two major mountain ranges..." might not have been a direct question in their textbook or class exercises. This requires recalling specific *names* rather than, say, identifying them on a map.

5.  **Average Pass Rate is 29%:** This is a crucial data point. If the overall pass rate is very low, it implies a high degree of difficulty across *all* questions for the average student. A question that seems "easy" to an expert might still contribute to this low pass rate for the general student population.

6.  **"0.5 for one correct answer":** This is a key mitigating factor. They only need *one* correct answer to get *some* score (0.5).

**Revised Estimation Process:**

*   **Himalayas:** Even with limited English, I'd expect *some* recognition of "Himalayas" as *the* prominent mountain in India. But recalling it by that *specific English name* under exam conditions for a struggling student is not 100%. Perhaps 30-40% could reliably recall "Himalayas."
*   **Other ranges (Aravalli, Vindhya, etc.):** These are significantly harder for this demographic and language barrier. Many students will not know the English terms, or simply won't have committed them to memory, even if they've heard them. Perhaps another 5-10% (on top of those who know Himalayas) might recall one of these instead.
*   **Students who recall *none* correctly:** A significant proportion will fall into this category due to the combined issues of language, poor prior instruction, absence, and anxiety.

Given the 29% average pass rate, this particular question needs to contribute to that difficulty. While "Himalayas" seems easy to us, consider the cumulative effect of the constraints. Many might understand "mountains" but not be able to produce "Himalayas" by name. Others might just draw a blank.

If the *entire question* gave 1 mark for naming two and 0.5 for one, that implies partial credit for *one*. We're estimating the proportion who get at least one.

I think even 40% is optimistic, considering how truly limited English can be, and how "basic" knowledge for one person is advanced for another. If a student is scoring only 29% overall, how many items are truly "easy" for them? This question requires specific recall, not just general understanding.

Let's imagine the population:
*   **Very strong (10-15%):** Know English, know geography. Will get
