I will provide my estimated proportion correct, carefully considering the factors you've outlined and actively challenging my initial instincts.

**Initial Thought (and why I'm challenging it):** My first instinct, as a native English speaker and someone with a good education, is that this is a relatively simple sentence structure. "He is reading a book" is very basic SVO (Subject-Verb-Object). I might initially think 60-70% would get this right.

**Challenging Assumptions (based on your criteria):**

*   **Limited English:**
    *   The words are common, but putting them in the *correct* order is the task. "book," "reading," "a," "is," "he." A student with limited exposure might recognize "he," "book," "reading," but not necessarily the grammar.
    *   They might understand "he" means a person, "book" is a book, "reading" is an action, but struggle to parse "a/is."
    *   *Common mistakes/alternatives from limited English learners:* "Reading a book he is," "He a book reading is," "Book he is reading a." They might try to map their native language structure directly, which is likely SOV for many Indian languages. If they translate directly word-by-word into their native language structure and then try to put that back into English, they'll likely struggle with SVO.

*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   SVO structure, present continuous tense ("is reading"), and the article "a" are fundamental, but if they haven't explicitly learned and practiced sentence construction in English, it's not inherent.
    *   Many Indian government schools struggle with the quality and consistency of English instruction, especially grammar-focused lessons. Simply *hearing* sentences might not translate into *constructing* them correctly from jumbled words.

*   **Exam Anxiety:** Even if they know it, anxiety can cause them to freeze or make simple errors.

*   **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** If they haven't done "jumbled words" or "rearrange to make a sentence" before, the format itself is a barrier, even if they recognize the words. The instruction "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence" requires a certain level of comprehension of the task itself.

*   **Absent for the topic:** If the topic of present continuous tense or basic sentence structure was covered when they were absent, they will likely struggle significantly.

*   **Overall Average Pass Rate (29%):** This is a critical anchoring point. While this question might seem slightly easier than average *for English questions*, it's highly improbable that the *overall* average applies perfectly to just one type of question without considering how difficult English is for them in general. This means a substantial portion of students are barely passing, or failing.

Considering all these factors, particularly the "limited English," "basic concepts aren't basic," and the potential for a direct translation from an SOV native language, I expect a significant drop from my initial optimistic estimate. The grammatical order of "He is reading a book" (Subject-Verb-Object, with the helping verb and '-ing' for present continuous) is simple for a native speaker, but a considerable leap for a student who is likely translating word-by-word or trying to fit an L1 sentence structure.

Students might get some of the words correct but fail on the complete sentence. For example, "He reading a book is" or "Reading a book he is" would likely be common and incorrect.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Given that only 29% pass *overall*, and considering the specific challenges for this type of English question for students with limited exposure and potentially different native language sentence structures, I'd bring my estimate down considerably. Even though it uses common words, the *grammatical accuracy* required for a perfect score is substantial for this demographic.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 35%**
