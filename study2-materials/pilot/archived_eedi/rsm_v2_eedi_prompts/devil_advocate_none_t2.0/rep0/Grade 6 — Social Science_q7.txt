Let's break this down to arrive at a calibrated estimate.

**Initial Intuition vs. Reality Check:**

*   **Initial thought:** Rajasthan is known for desert, minerals, and maybe some solar/wind. Students *should* know some of these. "Two natural resources" and "explain how one influences" seems straightforward.
*   **Reality Check - Factors reducing scores:**
    *   **English proficiency:** "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there." This is a multi-part question with several slightly complex English words ("natural resources," "influences," "lives"). A student with limited English might understand "Rajasthan" and "two things" but miss "natural resources" or "influences."
    *   **Curriculum Coverage & Retention:** While these topics *should* be covered, Class 6 in government schools often faces challenges with consistent teaching, high teacher-to-student ratios, and uneven learning outcomes. Many students might have been absent, or the topic wasn't thoroughly grasped.
    *   **Defining "Natural Resources":** Some students might list man-made items or general geographical features without understanding the "natural resource" aspect. For instance, just "desert" might be given without mentioning *sand* or *water*.
    *   **"Explain how one influences":** This requires more than just naming. It demands a cause-and-effect understanding and the ability to articulate it, even if simply. A student might name "water" but struggle to explain "influences daily life, agriculture, etc." This is where the English barrier combined with conceptual understanding becomes critical.
    *   **Exam Anxiety/Question Type:** If they haven't seen this *exact* structure frequently, they might get confused or intimidated.
    *   **Prior Knowledge Gaps:** The concept of "natural resources" itself, and their specific examples within a state, might not be solidified for all students. They might know "water is important" but not link it precisely as a "natural resource" of Rajasthan that "influences lives" in a formal answer.
    *   **Focus on the Rubric:** The rubric requires "two correct natural resources" and an "explanation for one." Even if they get one resource correct, missing the second or failing the explanation part means 0.

**Calibrated Estimate Derivation:**

1.  **Likelihood of naming at least one natural resource:** Higher. Many might think of "water" (scarce but present), "sand" (desert), "solar energy" (if discussed at all), or a major mineral like "marble" or "copper" if their local region emphasizes it. Let's say maybe 50-60% could name at least *one*.
2.  **Likelihood of naming *two* natural resources *correctly*:** Significantly drops. Students often get one correct, but the second one might be vague or incorrect. Perhaps 30-40%.
3.  **Likelihood of explaining how one influences *and* doing so clearly enough in English to satisfy the rubric:** This is the toughest part. Even if they name water, articulating "it's essential for drinking, irrigation in an arid region, and thus dictates settlement patterns" is a big leap for a Class 6 student with limited English. Many might simply say "Water is important" which might not meet the "explain how it influences" bar for a full mark. The requirement for *any* two correct resources and *one* explanation for *full* credit means a minor flaw elsewhere zeroes out the attempt.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for these students across subjects, a multi-part question requiring specific terminology, recall of two facts, and a descriptive explanation in English is challenging. Teachers consistently overestimate. If 29% is the *average*, a question like this, demanding structured articulation beyond simple recall, will likely fall below average.

My first instinct might be 35-40% because Rajasthan has famous minerals and water issues. But then applying the filters: *limited English, anxiety, conceptual clarity for "natural resources" and "influences," and needing* ***two*** *resources plus an explanation*:

I'm pushing down my estimate considerably. If the average pass rate is 29%, this specific question with its demands is likely to be harder for the average student than a simple recall question.

Let's estimate the probability of success for each component:
*   Identify 2 *correct* natural resources: ~35% (Water is easy, then maybe sand, or a prominent local mineral like marble/copper)
*   *Then*, clearly explain influence for *one*: ~25% of those who identified two (so 35% * 25% = ~8.75%).
    *   This is assuming
