Let's break down this question and apply the critical thinking requested.

**The Question:** "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."

**The Rubric:** The king wanted to answer (based on the reading passage) the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with. Any valid reason. Max score: 1.

**My Initial Instinct (and why I'll challenge it):** My first instinct might be that this is quite straightforward. "Important in real life?" Yes, most people would agree that knowing the right time, the right thing, and the right people is important. Providing one reason shouldn't be too hard either, e.g., "to make good decisions," "to succeed." I might initially lean towards a higher percentage, perhaps 45-55%.

**Challenging Assumptions (based on the prompt):**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "Important in real life" - This phrase itself is common enough, but could "important" be confused? Could "real life" be a new idiom?
    *   "Give one reason" - This instruction is clear.
    *   The *implicit understanding* needed from the reading passage about what the king's questions *are* (the right time, thing, people) is crucial. If a student struggles with English comprehension of the passage, they might not even understand what "the king's questions" refer to, beyond a vague sense of "questions the king asked."

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   The concept of *importance* might seem basic, but connecting abstract concepts like "the right time/thing/people" to "real life importance" might be challenging for students not accustomed to analytical thinking or applying story concepts to practical life. It requires a certain level of abstraction and critical engagement beyond just recalling facts.
    *   Formulating *a reason* in coherent English can be difficult. It's not just "yes/no," but explaining *why*.

3.  **Exam Anxiety:**
    *   Under pressure, even if they *understand* the questions, students might struggle to articulate a reason. They might know the *feeling* of why it's important but lack the vocabulary or sentence structure to express it.
    *   Blank responses are common.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   Many questions in Indian government schools focus on recall (e.g., "What were the three questions the king asked?"). This question requires inferential thinking, application, and opinion articulation with justification ("Do *you* think... Give one reason."). This is a higher-order thinking skill question. Students might not be familiar with being asked for their opinion or needing to provide justification for it, especially when it goes beyond simple recall.

5.  **Prior Passage Comprehension:** The rubric states, "The king wanted to answer (based on the reading passage) the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with." This means successful students must have understood the *gist* of the king's questions *from the passage*. If their comprehension of the story itself is weak due to English limitations, then understanding *what* questions are being discussed here (even implicitly) becomes an insurmountable hurdle. If they just think it's about "some questions the king asked," they might struggle to find relevance.

**Revised Thinking:**

*   A significant portion will struggle with general passage comprehension, making it hard to link "the king's questions" to their content.
*   Of those who grasp the content of the questions, formulating a coherent *reason* in English, explaining why those concepts are important in "real life," requires a level of abstract thinking and English proficiency beyond basic recall.
*   Many might answer "yes" but fail to provide a valid reason, or provide a very superficial one that might not fully meet the rubric's "valid reason" expectation if interpreted strictly.
*   The transition from factual recall to personal opinion and justification is a common difficulty.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for *all* questions, and this particular question being more complex (requiring comprehension, inferential thinking, and structured articulation in limited English), I expect the performance on this specific item to be below average. While the underlying concept (the importance of making good decisions) is universal, expressing it and linking it to the story under exam conditions, with limited English and lack of practice with such question types, will be a major barrier.

I think even students who *do* understand the general concept might fumble on the "give one reason" part, or their reason might be too simplistic or poorly phrased to get full marks from a human grader.

Therefore, my calibrated estimate
