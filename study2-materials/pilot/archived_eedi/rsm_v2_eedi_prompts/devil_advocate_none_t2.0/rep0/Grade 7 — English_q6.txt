Here's a breakdown of the thinking process, keeping the given constraints and biases in mind:

1.  **Initial Instinct (and why to discard it):** My first thought, based on just the question, would be "pretty easy, they just need one word." If I were a teacher/expert, I might think 50-60%. *This is exactly the bias to avoid.*

2.  **Applying the Constraints - The Lens of a Class 7 Indian Government School Student:**
    *   **Limited English:** "Describes," "poet's," "writing style." While these are fairly common words, "style" specifically can be abstract. Students might confuse it with "topic" or "feeling." "Poet's" might be an extra possessive to trip them up.
    *   **Economically Weaker Sections:** Less exposure to a wide vocabulary, potentially less reading at home.
    *   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** What *is* "writing style"? Do they understand it as a distinct concept? Have they been *explicitly taught* terms like "descriptive," "simple," "informal," "direct" in the context of analyzing poetry style? Or have they just been asked to summarize the poem? This is a crucial distinction. Many students might struggle to separate the *content* of the poem from its *method of presentation*.
    *   **Exam Anxiety:** Even if they know it, anxiety can cause a blank.
    *   **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** This is huge. If they've always been asked "What is the poem about?" or "What feeling does the poem convey?", then "What is the poet's writing style?" is a novel demand that requires a different kind of analytical thinking and vocabulary.
    *   **Rubric - "suitable and relevant word":** This requires not just *understanding* the concept but *recalling a specific word* that fits. What if they understand the idea but can't think of the right descriptor in English?

3.  **Reframing "Most Students Could Do This":**
    *   **A student who barely reads English:** Will struggle with "describes," "poet's," "style." Even if they grasp *some* meaning, extracting a descriptive *word* for "style" might be too advanced. They might give a word related to the *content* of the poem ("sad," "happy," "about nature") instead of the *style*.
    *   **A student absent for this topic:** Completely lost. They might try to describe the poem's theme, not its style.
    *   **A struggling learner:** This question requires metacognition about writing. It's not just recall of facts from the poem, but an analytical judgment *about the writing itself*.

4.  **Considering Potential Answers and Pitfalls:**
    *   **Correct (Rubric words):** simple, descriptive, informal, direct, narrative, emotional (if the *style* is presented emotionally), vivid. These require a level of abstraction.
    *   **Incorrect (Common student errors):**
        *   Describing the *content*: "It's about a dog." "It's a happy poem." "It talks about freedom."
        *   Giving a personal reaction: "I liked it." "It was easy to understand." (While "easy to understand" *could* be construed as "simple," it's likely more a personal reaction.)
        *   Stating a poetic device: "It uses rhyme." (This is part of style but not the overarching descriptor the question seeks for "writing style" – though an expert might accept it if pressed, the rubric probably looks for broader terms.)
        *   Blank/No answer.
        *   Mismatched word: Using "colourful" when the poem isn't necessarily colourful, just because it's a "good word."

5.  **Revisiting the Average Pass Rate (29%):** This is for the entire exam. Individual items can be much lower. If this question relies on more abstract understanding and specific vocabulary recall, it's likely to be *below* the average.

6.  **Calibrating the Estimate:**
    *   It's not 0%, as some highly capable or well-taught students will get it.
    *   It's certainly not above 30-35%.
    *   Given the significant linguistic and conceptual hurdles for the target population, and the demand for a specific type of analytical response and vocabulary, it feels like a low-frequency success.

My challenged and calibrated estimate:

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 18%**
