Let's break down the challenge.

**Initial Instinct vs. Calibrated Reality**

My initial, idealized instinct might be that a significant portion would get this, especially if "Harappan Civilization" has been taught. Features like "drainage" or "grid layout" seem like standard points of discussion.

**Applying the "Challenge" Lenses:**

*   **Limited English:** "Describe one key feature" is reasonably straightforward. "Urban planning" might be an issue, but the Harappan context usually means it's about the cities. However, accurately describing "grid layout" or "advanced drainage system" requires a certain level of vocabulary and sentence construction in English. Many students might *know* a feature but struggle to articulate it in correct English.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While "Harappan Civilization" is in the curriculum, the specifics of urban planning, beyond "they had big cities," might not be deeply ingrained. "Grid layout" or "citadel and lower town" requires recalling specific details, not just a general understanding. Students might remember the *name* but not the *details*.
*   **Exam Anxiety:** Even if they know it, anxiety can cause a complete blank, or lead to a partial, muddled answer that doesn't meet the "correctly describes" bar.
*   **Lack of Practice with Exact Question Type:** While "describe" is common, many students might be more used to multiple-choice or very direct recall questions rather than open-ended descriptive tasks in English for social studies.

**Teacher/Expert Overestimation Pitfall:**

A teacher would think, "I taught drainage systems and the grid plan very clearly. They *should* know this." But they forget:

1.  Many students likely learned these concepts primarily in a local language, not English. Translating on the fly is a challenge.
2.  Attendance is an issue; many students might have missed parts of this topic.
3.  Their classroom recall (with prompting, in their native language) is far better than independent written recall under exam pressure in English.
4.  The pass rate of 29% suggests a high baseline level of difficulty for *most* questions for this demographic.

**Re-evaluating based on the "Worst-Case" and Common Scenario:**

*   **The student who barely reads English:** They would likely struggle to even understand the nuances of "key feature" or articulate an answer that precisely matches the rubric's expectations of describing a feature *correctly*. They might write something vague like "they had good cities."
*   **The student who was absent:** Would know nothing.
*   **The student who struggled with the topic:** Would have only vague recollection.

Consider the precision required: "correctly describes one key feature."
"Good drainage" might be too vague. "Advanced drainage system" is better.
"Roads were straight" might be too vague. "Well-planned grid layout of streets" is better.

Many students might offer something like "clean drains" or "roads were straight," which could be borderline or too imprecise to get full credit according to a strict rubric.

Given the limited English, the struggle with academic concepts, the general low pass rate, and the need for a precise *description* in English, I have to calibrate significantly downwards from a first optimistic gut feeling.

If the average pass rate for general questions is 29%, a question requiring specific factual recall and articulate description in a second language, even for a "basic" social studies topic, would likely be tougher than the average.

I'm challenging my first instinct to say 30-40%. It's likely much lower due to the articulation barrier and lack of deep conceptual understanding for many.

**Calibrated Estimate:** 18%
