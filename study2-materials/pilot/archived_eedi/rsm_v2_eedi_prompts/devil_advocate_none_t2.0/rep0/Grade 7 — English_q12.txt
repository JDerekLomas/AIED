Let's break down the thought process to arrive at a calibrated estimate.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**
My first thought might be something like: "This is a pretty standard active-to-passive transformation. They should have learned this by Class 7." This might lead to an initial estimate in the 40-50% range.

**Challenging the Assumptions (Applying the Given Constraints):**

*   **Economically Weaker Sections, Limited English:** This is *crucial*.
    *   "The wind blew the leaves away" - "Blew" is an irregular verb, past tense. "Blow" might be recognized, but "blew" could be a stumbling block for those with limited vocabulary.
    *   Understanding "active voice" and "passive voice" itself requires a certain level of meta-linguistic understanding, which is harder for limited English speakers.
    *   They need to understand "by the wind." The preposition "by" is simple, but its function here needs to be clear.

*   **Average Pass Rate is About 29%:** This is a strong anchor. If the *overall* pass rate is 29%, it means a lot of students are struggling across the board. This single question cannot reasonably be expected to have a *much* higher success rate than the average, unless it's exceptionally simple.

*   **Teachers/Experts Overestimate:** This forces me to distrust my initial "most students could do this" thought. I am *explicitly told* that "basic concepts aren't basic for struggling learners."

*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   **Identifying Subject/Verb/Object:** For "The wind (subject) blew (verb) the leaves (object) away (adverbial particle)," this isn't always easy.
    *   **Changing Object to Subject:** "The leaves..."
    *   **Auxiliary Verb + Past Participle:** "were blown..."
        *   "Were" (past tense of 'be' matching plural 'leaves') - needs tense agreement and subject-verb agreement.
        *   "Blown" (past participle of 'blow') - irregular verb forms are a *major* hurdle for learners. Many will simply use "blewed" or stick with "blew."
    *   **Reintroducing Original Subject with "by":** "...by the wind." This part is usually straightforward *if* they get to this stage.

*   **Exam Anxiety / Blank Responses:** Some students will simply freeze and not attempt it.

*   **Never Practiced this Exact Question Type:** While they might have learned about active/passive, they might not have practiced this specific sentence, or sentences with irregular past tense verbs where the past participle is completely different (blow/blew/blown).

**Recalibration Process:**

1.  **Anchor to Average:** Starting around the 29% overall pass rate is a good base.
2.  **Complexity of Transformation:**
    *   Requires knowledge of irregular verb forms (blow-blew-blown). This alone eliminates a significant chunk of students.
    *   Requires understanding of tense agreement for the auxiliary verb (past tense, plural subject -> "were").
    *   Requires the overall structural change (object becomes subject, use of "by").
3.  **Language Barrier:** The limited English and "basic concepts aren't basic" argument applies strongly to understanding the *instructions* and the grammatical terminology ("active voice," "passive voice").
4.  **Absence Factor:** A student who missed a few classes on verb forms or active/passive voice would be completely lost.

Considering all these factors, expecting *more* than the average pass rate seems overly optimistic, and even matching it is a stretch for such a specific grammatical transformation. The irregular verb "blown" is the biggest single difficulty.

*   If they put "The leaves were blow by the wind," it's wrong.
*   If they put "The leaves were blew by the wind," it's wrong.
*   If they miss "were," it's wrong.
*   If they miss "by the wind," it's a partial success but probably still not full credit for "correctly transforms."

This question, while seemingly straightforward to a proficient English speaker, layers several difficulties for struggling learners, especially the irregular past participle and the required understanding of grammatical structure.

My initial overestimate needs to be significantly adjusted downwards.

**Revised Estimate:** I believe it will be lower than the average pass rate, largely due to the irregular verb "blown."

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **18%**
