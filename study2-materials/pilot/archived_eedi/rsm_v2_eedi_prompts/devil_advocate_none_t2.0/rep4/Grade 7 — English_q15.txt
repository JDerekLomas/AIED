Here's my calibrated estimate after challenging assumptions:

**Initial Instinct (before challenging):** I might have thought around 50-60%. "My Favourite Hobby" is a very common topic, seemingly simple, and almost every student would have a hobby.

**Challenging Assumptions:**

*   **Limited English:** "Write a short paragraph" already creates a barrier. Many students at this level struggle with forming more than a few simple, often grammatically incorrect, sentences in English, let alone connecting them into a coherent paragraph. They might just list things. "Clearly mentions," "why it is enjoyable" requires more nuanced vocabulary than they possess.
*   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic:** The concept of a "paragraph" itself, with a main idea and supporting sentences, might not be solidly understood or consistently practiced in English for many. They might provide bullet points, or 3 unrelated sentences.
*   **Exam anxiety:** The pressure of writing *anything* in English for an exam, especially a paragraph, can be paralyzing.
*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** While "My Hobby" is common, "write a *short paragraph (4-5 sentences)* about it, *mentioning specific elements* (when, why)" is a more structured writing task. Many students might only have practiced speaking about it, or writing single sentences, but not this level of sustained paragraph construction under these specific instructions.
*   **Prior knowledge/Exposure:** Some students might genuinely not have a defined "hobby" in the way it's implicitly understood in the question (a structured leisure activity). Their free time might be spent on chores, helping family, or unstructured play. They might struggle to articulate *why* they enjoy something in English beyond "it is good."

Considering these factors, especially the paragraph structure, sentence count, and inclusion of all specific points *in English*, this task is much harder than it appears. Many will get lost at "paragraph" or "4-5 sentences." Even if they identify a hobby and give one reason, missing the structure or the "when" could lead to a score of 0.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 15%**
