Let's break this down.

**Initial instinct (the one to challenge):** Many students in Class 6 would have learned about Rajasthan and natural resources. "Water" is a very obvious natural resource, and its importance is universal. Marble, sandstone, or even sunlight (solar energy) are also pretty common knowledge for the region. Explaining influence on life isn't overly complex either. Perhaps 50-60%.

**Challenging the instinct based on provided constraints:**

1.  **Limited English:** "Mention any two natural resources," "explain how one of them influences the lives." While these aren't super complex phrases, for a student with "barely reads English," "mention," "influence," and even "resources" could be stumbling blocks. They might recognize "natural" and "Rajasthan" but struggle with the full prompt.
2.  **"Basic" concepts not basic for struggling learners:** Even "natural resources" might be a jargon term for some. They might know things like "water," "minerals," "sun," but not frame them specifically as "natural resources."
3.  **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** This is a huge factor. Faced with a question that isn't exactly like something practiced, anxiety can shut down thinking, leading to a blank.
4.  **Never practiced this exact question type:** "Mention two AND explain one's influence" combines two tasks. They might be able to list resources but struggle with the "influence" part, especially articulating it in English.
5.  **Average pass rate ~29%:** This is a strong indicator of overall academic performance and suggests a significant proportion of students struggle generally.
6.  **Economically weaker sections:** Often implies less access to supplementary learning materials, fewer opportunities for English practice outside school, and potentially inconsistent attendance or focus in class due to home circumstances.
7.  **"Absent for this topic":** A significant portion of the class could have missed key lessons on resources of Rajasthan.

**Re-evaluating with the challenges in mind:**

*   For a student to get full marks (1), they need two correct resources *and* a relevant explanation for one, all articulated in passable English.
*   "Water" is the most likely first resource. Its influence (drinking, farming, scarcity leading to hardships) is also the most intuitive.
*   However, naming a second *specific* resource beyond water (like Marble, Gypsum, Zinc, Copper) requires specific knowledge of Rajasthan's resources. "Sunlight for solar energy" or "Wind for wind energy" are good, but slightly more conceptual than "Marble."
*   The "explain how one of them influences" part in English will be tough for many. They might understand it in their mother tongue but struggle to phrase it. For instance, "Water important because no water no farm" might be the extent of their English explanation, which *might* pass, but shows struggle.
*   Given the average pass rate of 29% for *all* questions, a question requiring specific knowledge, articulation in English, and multiple parts will likely perform lower than the average, or at best, only slightly higher for students who have this specific knowledge.

Taking all this into account, the proportion that can *successfully meet the rubric criteria* (two resources, one explanation, in English) will be quite low. A student might get one resource right, but fail on the second or the explanation.

**Calibrated Estimate:** 18%
