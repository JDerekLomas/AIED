Let's break down this question and consider the factors for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, especially those from economically weaker sections with limited English.

**Analysis of the Question and Rubric:**

*   **"Do you think the king's questions are important in real life?"** This requires critical thinking and a connection from a fictional story to real-world relevance. It's not a direct recall question.
*   **"Give one reason."** This requires articulation of that connection.
*   **Rubric context:** "The king wanted to answer (based on the reading passage) the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with."
    *   **"based on the reading passage":** This implies the student must have understood the *purpose* of the king's questions from the passage, not just remembered *what* the questions were. Understanding purpose is harder than simple recall.
    *   **"Any valid reason":** This is quite lenient, but students still need to articulate *a* reason that makes sense.

**Considering the Student Profile and Expert Biases:**

*   **Limited English:**
    *   "Important in real life" is a relatively straightforward phrase, but connecting it abstractly is the challenge.
    *   Formulating "one reason" in English might be difficult beyond very simple statements.
*   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic:** The concept of connecting fictional learning to real-life wisdom is a higher-order thinking skill. While simple on the surface ("Is it important? Why?"), applying it in an exam setting under pressure for students who primarily learn by rote is not "basic."
*   **Exam anxiety:** Can shut down critical thinking. Students might remember the questions but not be able to articulate *why* they are important.
*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** Students often excel at direct recall from texts. Questions asking for *opinion* and *justification* in an abstract sense ("important in real life") are much less common in this context. They might struggle even if they vaguely grasp the idea.
*   **Pass rate ~29%:** This is a crucial benchmark. It implies a significant portion struggle with even foundational tasks.
*   **Absent for the topic:** If a student was absent when the passage was read and discussed, or if they struggle with reading comprehension, they might not even remember the *content* of the king's questions, let alone their importance.

**Challenging Initial Instinct:**

My first instinct might be: "Well, of course, these questions *are* important, and students will recognize that!" But then I have to think:

*   **Could a student who barely reads English do this?** They might grasp the *story* but connecting it to abstract "importance in real life" and articulating a reason is tough. They might say "yes" but fail to give a valid reason.
*   **Could a student who was absent for this topic?** No. They wouldn't know the king's questions, making it impossible to answer.
*   **What kind of reason would they give?** Many might struggle to move beyond "because it helps the king." The question requires generalizability.
*   **The cognitive leap:** Moving from "The king asked..." to "This is important for *me/us* in real life because..." is a significant leap for a struggling learner. Many will stick to facts from the passage.

Given the low pass rate, the specific challenges of limited English, the higher-order thinking required, and the difficulty in articulating a "reason" in English, the number will be much lower than what might seem intuitively "easy" for this question.

They need to:
1.  Understand the question: "Are the king's questions important in real life?"
2.  Recall/understand the king's questions and their purpose from the passage.
3.  Formulate a connection between those questions and "real life."
4.  Articulate that connection as "one reason" in English.

Each step has potential for failure for a struggling student. Many will stop at step 2, if they even get that far accurately.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

I'd expect a small fraction to successfully articulate a *valid reason*. Many might answer "yes" but fail on the "reason." Given the overall pass rate, this particular question asks for more abstract reasoning and expression than many students are prepared for.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **18%**
