Okay, I'm going to deliberately challenge my initial instinct, which would be much higher, based on the warnings provided.

My "teacher brain" screams "This is simple SVO! Almost everyone should get this!" But then I remember:

*   **Limited English:** "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence" itself is a complex instruction for someone with limited English. Do they understand "rearrange"? "meaningful"? "sentence"? The individual words in the sentence ('book', 'reading', 'a', 'is', 'he') are relatively common, but understanding the *task* is a barrier.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) might seem basic, but forming grammatically correct sentences, especially when jumbled, requires a level of syntactic understanding that isn't universal, even in the native language for struggling learners, let alone L2. Many students may still be at a word-by-word comprehension stage.
*   **Anxiety/Unfamiliarity:** For a student not regularly exposed to English sentence formation exercises, this specific "jumbled words" format could be confusing and induce anxiety, leading to a blank or incorrect response. They might just list the words in the order given, or in an order that makes *some* sense to them ("book reading is he a").
*   **Context:** These are Class 6 students. Some will have strong foundations, but others will have very patchy attendance, inconsistent teaching quality, and minimal home support for learning English.

Considering an average pass rate of 29% for *all* subjects (implying English proficiency might be even lower for some), and specifically thinking about students who barely read English, who might not have grasped subject-verb agreement or sentence structure fully:

*   Many will likely just write the words as they appear, or in a random order.
*   Some might get 'He is reading' correct but struggle with 'a book'.
*   Some might manage to get 'He is reading a book.' right.

My initial gut says 70-80%. My calibrated instinct, *after challenging it heavily*, would bring it down significantly. If the average pass rate for *everything* is 29%, then something as specific as this English structure question, requiring comprehension of the instructions and specific grammatical knowledge, should probably be below average, but perhaps not drastically so if they *have* covered basic sentence structure.

Let me adjust from "my teachers know this is simple" to "what will *these specific students* do given the limitations."

If 29% is the *overall* average, this English sentence formation question is probably somewhat correlated with overall ability.
Those who can minimally understand the question and have encountered basic English will probably attempt it.

Let's break it down:
*   Understand "rearrange words" & "meaningful sentence": Maybe 50%
*   Know 'he is' goes together: Perhaps another chunk.
*   Know 'reading a book' goes together: Another chunk.
*   Put it all together in the right order: Fewer still.

I need to assume that *some* proportion of students, even those who struggle, will have absorbed basic SVO in English if it's part of the curriculum, or if they've seen enough examples. However, "a book" could be written as "book a".

I am going to drastically lower my estimate, imagining the bottom 30-40% of the class. They simply won't get it.
Another 20-30% might get partial answers or struggle with the word order of "a book."
That leaves only the top half to a third who might confidently get this.

Let's aim for something that isn't insultingly low, but clearly accounts for the barriers. If 29% is the pass rate *overall*, then maybe this specific English task is accessible to slightly more students, as it's quite fundamental, *if taught well*. But "if taught well" is a big assumption for these contexts.

My very first thought: 85%
My challenged first thought: 60%
My deeply challenged and re-calibrated thought:

Considering the instruction comprehension barrier, the potential for simple misordering (e.g., "He is reading book a"), anxiety, and the overall pass rate of 29%, it implies a *lot* of students are fundamentally struggling. This question requires a specific synthesis of grammatical knowledge.

I think slightly above the overall pass rate for this fundamental skill for those who even attempt it.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **42%**
