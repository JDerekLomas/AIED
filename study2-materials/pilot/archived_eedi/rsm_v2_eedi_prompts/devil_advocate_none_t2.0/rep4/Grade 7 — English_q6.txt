After challenging my assumptions, especially considering the limited English proficiency, economic background, potential learning gaps, and test anxiety, my estimate is significantly lower than an initial optimistic guess.

Here's my thought process for lowering the estimate:

1.  **Limited English:** "Writing style" is an abstract concept. While they might understand "write" and "style" separately, putting them together to describe *how* a poet writes, using a single descriptive word, is a higher-level linguistic task. Many might just stare blankly.
2.  **Vocabulary for Description:** Even if they grasp the concept, what words do they have in their limited English vocabulary to describe "style"? "Simple," "easy," "good" might be their range. "Descriptive," "informal," "direct" are more sophisticated. "Simple" or "easy to understand" might be the most common correct response, if any.
3.  **Understanding "Poet":** While they are Class 7 and likely exposed to poetry, understanding the "poet's writing style" as distinct from the poem's content is also abstract. They might try to describe the poem itself (e.g., "sad," "happy") rather than *how* it's written.
4.  **Novelty of Question Type:** "Describes the poet's writing style" isn't a very common or direct comprehension question in basic texts. It requires inference and analysis of a metalinguistic concept. Many will have never explicitly practiced this.
5.  **Average Pass Rate Context:** With an average pass rate of 29% for general questions, this particular question feels more challenging than an average one, even for single-word answers. It's not a recall question.

Considering all these factors, an optimistic guess would be around 25-30% if it were a more straightforward question. However, this question has multiple hurdles.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **12%**
