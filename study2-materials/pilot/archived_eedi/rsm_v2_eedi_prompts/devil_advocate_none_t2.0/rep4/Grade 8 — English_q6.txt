This question tests specific vocabulary and an understanding of literary terms, both of which can be challenging for the target student population.

Let's break down the potential difficulties:

1.  **"Define":** While a common instruction, for students with limited English, just understanding what "define" means and what kind of answer is expected can be a hurdle. They might think of giving an example rather than a definition.
2.  **"Fable":** This is a relatively specific literary term.
    *   Many students, even if they've heard fables (like stories with talking animals), might not have explicitly learned the *word* "fable" and its formal definition in English class.
    *   If they were taught it, it might have been in their local language, and they might struggle to translate the concept into English, especially formal academic English.
    *   Their teachers might *assume* they know it because "fables" are common story types, but formal definitions are harder.
3.  **Rubric requirements:**
    *   "Short story": Fairly accessible concept.
    *   "Typically uses animals as characters": Many might get this part as it's the most common characteristic they might recall from examples.
    *   "Imparts a moral lesson": This is a more abstract concept and crucial for the definition. This part might be particularly difficult for students to articulate correctly, even if they intuitively understand that stories "teach something." They might use simpler terms like "teaches a lesson" or "good message," which are close but not quite "imparts a moral lesson."
    *   "And": Linking these elements correctly in a cohesive definition requires a certain level of English fluency and understanding of conjunctions.

**Challenging the first instinct:**

My first instinct, based on it being a "common literary term," might be to put it higher. However, when I think about the constraints:

*   **Limited English:** Articulating a formal definition in English is tough. Many might understand the concept if asked in their local language but struggle in English.
*   **"Basic concepts aren't basic":** Even if teachers think fables are "basic" story types, explicitly defining them in a rubric-matching way is a different skill.
*   **Absent for topic:** Literary terms are often taught in specific units. If a student missed that lesson, they're unlikely to know the definition.
*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** Defining terms formally might not be a common question type for them, or they might only practice very specific terms.
*   **Economically weaker sections / struggling learners:** These students often prioritize practical skills over nuanced literary definitions.

Many students might give partial answers ("stories with animals" or "stories that teach something"), but combining all three rubric points successfully (short story, animals, moral lesson) *in English* will be the challenge. Some might only know one aspect, or they might have trouble formulating the "moral lesson" part.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for general subjects, this specific question is likely more difficult than average for this cohort, given the precise English required and the potential for a missed topic.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

I'd expect a significant drop-off for students who need to articulate all three specific components correctly in English. Some might get partial credit in a more generous marking scheme, but for a strict "max score 1" rubric that expects *all* parts, the percentage will be low.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 12%**
