The key here is to really challenge the initial instinct and put myself in the shoes of a struggling Class 6 student in an Indian government school, especially one with limited English and from an economically weaker section.

Here's the breakdown of why the intuitive "this is easy" is likely wrong for *many* students:

1.  **Limited English:** While "some" and "any" are basic, understanding their nuances for affirmative vs. negative/interrogative sentences can be tricky. A student who primarily translates word-for-word might struggle to grasp this subtle grammatical rule. They might just know "some" means "kuch" and "any" means "koi bhi," without the grammatical context.
2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** This rule (some for affirmative, any for negative/question) is often taught explicitly. If a student was absent when this specific rule was taught, or if the teacher rushed over it, or if it wasn't taught using examples directly relevant to their daily life, it wouldn't be "basic" to them.
3.  **No Direct Practice:** Many government schools focus on rote memorization or simpler fill-in-the-blanks with less distinction required. If they haven't specifically practiced differentiating between "some" and "any" in affirmative statements vs. others, they might guess or default to what sounds vaguely familiar.
4.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** For a student already struggling, seeing a choice between two seemingly similar words ("some/any") in English might trigger anxiety. If they're unsure, they might just pick one randomly, or worse, leave it blank if allowed (though this is usually a forced-choice question).
5.  **Distractions/Poverty Related Issues:** Students from economically weaker sections often come to school hungry, tired, or preoccupied with home issues. Their cognitive load for understanding abstract grammar rules is already higher.
6.  **"Apples in the basket":** This phrase itself, while simple, might still be abstract. They might visualize it, but that doesn't necessarily help them choose the *correct* determiner based on the sentence type.

**Initial Instinct Challenge:** My first thought might be 60-70% because it's "basic English grammar."
**Re-evaluation:**

*   Considering an average pass rate of 29% for *all* questions, this single item needs to be evaluated relative to that.
*   "Some/any" differentiation is tricky. It's not just about knowing the meaning of individual words. It requires understanding sentence structure and context (affirmative vs. negative/interrogative).
*   A student who just barely reads English might simply pick the word they've seen more often or the one that 'feels' right, which isn't always accurate.
*   Many could just be guessing. A 50/50 chance means a fair proportion *will* get it right by luck alone.

If 29% is the *average* pass rate, some questions will be higher, some lower. While "some/any" is important, the subtle rule behind it pushes it closer to a moderate-difficulty item for this population, rather than a very easy one. A good chunk will struggle with the grammatical *rule*, not just the vocabulary.

However, the question is a direct 50/50 choice. If a student has even a glimmer of familiarity with "some" in positive sentences, or has just heard the phrase "some apples" more often in general English learning than "any apples" (in a positive context), they might get it right. Random guessing would lead to 50% success on its own. The fact that *some* students will know the rule, combined with the high probability of random guessing, makes me adjust upwards from the very lowest possible rates. But not too high.

Let's imagine:
*   20% clearly know the rule and get it right.
*   40% are completely clueless and guess randomly (20% correct).
*   40% are semi-clued, maybe have heard "some apples" more, and choose it for a soft reason, not a hard rule (estimate 50% of them get it right due to weak intuition/luck, so another 20% correct).

Total: 20% + 20% + 20% = 60%. This feels too high given the *overall* 29% pass rate and the significant limitations. My breakdown is probably overestimating how many would get it right even through intuition.

Let's adjust again, remembering the "barely reads English" aspect:
*   Perhaps 10-15% truly grasp the "some" for affirmative rule.
*   A large group (say 40%)
