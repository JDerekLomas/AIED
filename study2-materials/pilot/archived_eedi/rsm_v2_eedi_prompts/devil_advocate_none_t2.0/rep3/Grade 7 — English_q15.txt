Let's break down the difficulties involved for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, especially those from economically weaker sections.

1.  **"Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences)"**: This immediately screens out a significant portion.
    *   **English proficiency**: Many students struggle with forming even simple, grammatically correct sentences. Combining them into a coherent paragraph is a higher-order skill.
    *   **Sentence length**: "4-5 sentences" might be overwhelming for those who can barely write 1-2 correct sentences. They might write shorter, choppy sentences or one very long run-on sentence.
    *   **Paragraph structure**: The concept of a "paragraph" itself, with a topic sentence and supporting details, might not be well-understood or practiced.

2.  **"about 'My Favourite Hobby'."**:
    *   **Understanding "hobby"**: While a common word, some might struggle to understand it or relate it to their own lives if they don't have traditionally recognized "hobbies." Their leisure activities might be chores, helping family, or unstructured play.
    *   **Conceptualization**: Even if they understand "hobby," choosing *one* and articulating it clearly can be tough.

3.  **"Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it."**: This imposes specific structural requirements and content points.
    *   **Explicit instruction following**: Many students struggle to address all parts of a multi-part prompt, especially under exam conditions. They might write about their hobby but forget to mention *when* or *why*.
    *   **"When you do it"**: Requires specific temporal phrasing (e.g., "every evening," "on weekends," "after school").
    *   **"Why you enjoy it"**: Requires articulating reasons, which demands slightly more complex vocabulary and sentence structures (e.g., "It makes me happy," "I learn new things," "It helps me relax"). Simply saying "I like it" might not be sufficient for a "complete paragraph."

4.  **Rubric: "Student writes a complete paragraph that clearly mentions the hobby, when it is done, and why it is enjoyable."**: This is a fairly strict rubric.
    *   "Complete paragraph": Not just scattered sentences. Implies some logical flow.
    *   "Clearly mentions": No ambiguity.
    *   All three points (what, when, why) *must* be present. If even one is missing or unclear, they might score 0.

**Challenging the first instinct:** My first instinct might be "Oh, a simple paragraph, Class 7 should be able to do this." But then I remember:
*   **Limited English**: Many might not know enough vocabulary or grammar to form 4-5 *coherent* sentences.
*   **"Basic" concepts**: Paragraph writing is not basic for a struggling learner. Explicitly detailing "when" and "why" requires conscious effort and appropriate vocabulary.
*   **Exam anxiety**: A prompt like this can feel daunting. Students might freeze, misinterpret, or simply write what little they can.
*   **No practice**: Many might not have practiced this exact format of writing about a hobby, specifically hitting all three required points, under timed conditions.

Considering an average pass rate of 29% and knowing that paragraph writing and fulfilling all prompt requirements are advanced skills for this demographic, even a "simple" task like this becomes difficult.

Many might write 1-2 sentences about a hobby, but fail to complete the paragraph or miss one of the required points. Others might have hobbies but struggle to articulate *why* they enjoy them beyond a simple "I like it." The requirement for "4-5 sentences" is also a hurdle, as many might fall short or exceed it with irrelevant rambling.
