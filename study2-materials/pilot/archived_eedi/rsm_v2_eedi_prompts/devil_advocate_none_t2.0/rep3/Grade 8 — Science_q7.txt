Let's break down the question and the likely struggles:

**The Question:**
"A gardener has collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit. Does gardener notice any change after some days? Give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health"

**Breakdown of Difficulties:**

1.  **"Collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit."**: This concept is likely taught as composting. While the Hindi equivalent (khaad banana/gadhdhe mein kachra dalna) might be understood, the phrasing "waste of plants, vegetables and fruits" might be a bit formal for some. "Pit" is likely fine.

2.  **"Does gardener notice any change after some days?"**:
    *   **Vocabulary**: "Notice" (dhyan dena/dekhna) should be generally understood. "Change" (badlav) is also common.
    *   **Concept**: Do they understand *what kind* of change? This requires recalling the composting process.

3.  **"Give reasons"**: This is where many students will falter. They might vaguely know *that* it changes, but explaining *why* (decomposition, microorganisms, bacteria, fungi) requires a more robust understanding and recall of scientific vocabulary, often in English, which is a major hurdle. Even if they understand it in Hindi, translating it to the correct English scientific terms (like "microorganisms" or "decomposition") will be very difficult for many.

4.  **"evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health"**:
    *   **Vocabulary**: "Evaluate" (mulyankan karna) might be a slightly more advanced term than they are comfortable with, possibly causing a pause. "Beneficial" (faydemand) is probably known. "Soil health" (mitti ka swasthya) should be understandable.
    *   **Concept**: Connecting decomposition to nutrient enrichment and improved soil structure requires synthesizing information.

**Specific Barriers for This Group:**

*   **Limited English:**
    *   "Decomposition," "microorganisms," "nutrients," "organic matter," "enrichment," "structure." These are all key terms required for a complete answer, and very few will be able to articulate them correctly.
    *   Even "change" and "beneficial" might require careful thought or direct translation for the weaker students.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While composting is taught, the detailed biological reasons (microorganisms breaking down matter) might not have truly stuck or been internalized, especially for those with gaps in foundational learning. They might know the *outcome* but not the *process*.
*   **Anxiety/Unfamiliarity:** Explaining *reasons* in their own words, especially when the vocabulary is challenging, can lead to blank responses even if they have some implicit understanding. This isn't just a recall question; it requires constructive thinking and articulation.
*   **Absenteeism/Lack of Practice:** If the specific mechanism of composting (decomposition by microorganisms) wasn't emphasized or practiced for articulation in English, many will struggle.

**Initial Instinct vs. Challenged Assumption:**

My initial instinct might be: "Composting is a common topic, many students should know it's beneficial." However, challenging that leads me to focus on:
*   The **"reasons"** part, specifically in English, is a huge differentiator.
*   The expectation of explaining *how* it's beneficial beyond just "it's good."
*   The **"notice any change"** requires knowing it turns into dark, rich soil, which again might require specific vocabulary.

Given an average pass rate of 29% for the *entire exam*, and considering that answering *all parts* of this question well enough for even 0.5 points (which is very generous) requires multiple correct statements and some technical vocabulary, I anticipate a significant drop-off. Many will likely only say "yes, it changes" and "it is beneficial" without proper reasons or explanation of *how* it changes or *why* it's beneficial, scoring 0.

To score *anything* (0.5 max means even partial credit is scored here), they likely need to mention decomposition or at least the organic matter becoming "manure" or "fertilizer."

**Calibrated Estimate:**

I expect many students will:
*   Say "yes, it changes" (easily)
*   Say "it is beneficial" (easily)
*   Struggle significantly with "give reasons" for the change (e.g., mention microorganisms or decomposition)
*   Struggle with "evaluate how it is beneficial for soil health" (e.g., mentioning nutrients, improved texture, water retention)
