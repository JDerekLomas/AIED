Here's a breakdown of how an average Class 7 student from an Indian government school, especially from economically weaker sections, might approach or fail this question, keeping the specified biases in mind:

**Potential Challenges for Students:**

*   **English Comprehension:** "Active Voice," "Passive Voice," "transform," "sentence" are all English terms. A student with limited English might struggle just to understand the instructions, let alone the question itself. "The wind blew the leaves away" might be understood, but applying the *grammatical transformation* requires deeper comprehension.
*   **Vocabulary/Concepts:** "Blown" is the past participle of "blow." While "blew" is understood, forming the past participle correctly for irregular verbs is a challenge even for students with better English, let alone those with limited exposure. Many would likely try "blowed."
*   **Grammar Rules (Active/Passive):**
    *   **Identifying Subject/Object:** They need to identify "the wind" (subject) and "the leaves" (object). This basic grammatical identification itself is not guaranteed for a struggling learner.
    *   **Changing Object to Subject:** Swapping them.
    *   **Using "to be" verb + Past Participle:** "Were blown" is complex. They need to understand:
        *   Why "were" (plural and past tense) is used instead of "was" or "is."
        *   That "blown" is the form required.
    *   **Adding "by the subject":** The "by the wind" part. Some might miss this entirely.
*   **Novelty of Question Type:** Even if they've *seen* active/passive, practicing this *exact sentence* or many varied examples isn't a given. Rote learning might apply to familiar examples, but transfer to a new one is harder.
*   **Anxiety:** The pressure of an exam, coupled with weak foundational knowledge, can cause students to draw a complete blank or make common errors they might avoid in a low-stakes setting.
*   **Topic Coverage/Absence:** Was this topic taught well? Was the student present and attentive that day? In many government schools, consistent attendance and quality instruction are issues.

**Re-evaluating First Instinct:**

My first instinct (as someone fluent in English) might be "this is a fairly standard transformation." However, overlaying the constraints:
*   "Average pass rate is about 29%." This is a significant indicator of overall struggles.
*   "Economically weaker sections with limited English." This highlights foundational gaps.
*   "Teachers and experts consistently MISJUDGE." This forces me to be more critical.

Consider a student who "barely reads English." They would struggle profoundly with the instructions and the expectation of forming a grammatically correct transformation with an irregular verb. A student absent for the topic would likely score 0. Even those who *were* present might have just scratched the surface or understood it poorly.

The key challenges are:
1.  Understanding the instruction (linguistic hurdle).
2.  Correctly identifying the components of the original sentence.
3.  Knowing the rules for *forming* passive voice (specifically the correct "to be" verb tense/number and the past participle). "Blew" -> "blown" is an irregular verb, making it harder than "played" -> "played."

Given these challenges, a score of 1 implies a perfect transformation, including "were blown" and "by the wind." Many will likely make errors such as:
*   "The leaves was blew away by the wind." (Wrong "to be" verb and wrong past participle)
*   "The leaves blew away by the wind." (Missing "to be" verb)
*   "The leaves were blowed away by the wind." (Incorrect irregular past participle)
*   "The leaves were blown away." (Missing "by the wind")

Achieving all components correctly (tense, participle, subject-object swap, "by the...") for *this specific type* of irregular verb structure for a Class 7 student from this background will be very difficult.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **12%**
