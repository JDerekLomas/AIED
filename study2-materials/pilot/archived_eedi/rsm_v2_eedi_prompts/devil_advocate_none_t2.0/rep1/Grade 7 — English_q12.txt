I'll break down my thought process, keeping in mind the caveats about overestimating.

**Initial Instinct (before challenging):** My immediate thought might be around 40-50%. It's a fairly common grammatical transformation, uses simple vocabulary, and the verb "blow" is also common.

**Challenging Assumptions:**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "Wind," "blew," "leaves," "away" are all relatively basic words. However, understanding the *instructions* ("Change...from Active Voice to Passive Voice") itself is an English hurdle. Many students might know what wind and leaves are, but not necessarily grasp "active voice" or "passive voice" even in their native language, let alone English.
    *   The grammatical structure required (auxiliary verb "be" + past participle) is not intuitive for a student with limited English exposure, especially if they struggle to identify the object and subject.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   While teachers consider active/passive voice transformations basic, it relies on several foundational understandings:
        *   Identifying the subject and object of a sentence.
        *   Recognizing a transitive verb.
        *   Knowing the past participle form of irregular verbs (like "blow" -> "blown"). "Blew" to "blown" is an irregular verb conjugation that is often a point of error.
        *   Understanding the role of auxiliary verbs in forming passive voice ("was/were").
        *   The concept of agency shifting from the original subject to being performed "by the X."

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** When instructions themselves are partly opaque, anxiety magnifies this, often leading to no attempt or a random guess rather than a thoughtful one. Students might try to change one word, or simply copy the sentence.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** Even if active/passive voice was *taught*, was this specific type of sentence (simple past tense, irregular verb) practiced enough, and *specifically the full transformation with "by the wind"*? Or were simpler, present tense examples used? If it's a new or infrequently practiced structure, performance will plummet. The need to rearrange the sentence structure, identify the correct "be" verb (was/were), and use the past participle can be a lot for a struggling learner.

5.  **Target Group (Class 7, EWS, Indian Government Schools):** The 29% average pass rate is a very strong indicator. This suggests that a significant proportion struggle with fundamental concepts across the board, not just English. Grammatical transformations like this require abstract understanding and application, which is harder than mere recall.

Considering all these factors, particularly the "active voice to passive voice" instruction barrier, the irregular verb "blow/blew/blown," and the general low average pass rate, I anticipate significant difficulty. Students might be able to identify "leaves" as the object, but then struggle with "were blown away by the wind." They might just write "The leaves blew away." Or "The leaves was blowed by the wind." Or "The leaves are blew away."

**Recalibrating:**
If the average pass rate is 29%, a grammatical transformation that requires multiple steps, irregular verb knowledge, and clear understanding of specific grammatical terms (active/passive voice) is likely to be harder than average for this group. The 29% average pass rate usually encompasses easier, more direct questions. This question is multi-layered.

I believe that for a Class 7 student from EWS in an Indian government school, with limited English and foundational understanding, a significant number would fail to get the full transformation correct. The most common error points would likely be:
*   Not understanding "active voice" to "passive voice."
*   Not correctly identifying the subject/object for rearrangement.
*   Not knowing "blown" (irregular verb).
*   Using "was" instead of "were" (or vice versa).
*   Forgetting "by the wind."

A student needs to get all components right for 1 mark.

Therefore, challenging my initial instinct substantially, I think it will be significantly lower than even the average pass rate.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **18%**
