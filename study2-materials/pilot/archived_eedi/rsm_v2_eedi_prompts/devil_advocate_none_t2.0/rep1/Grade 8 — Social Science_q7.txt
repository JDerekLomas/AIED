Let's break down the difficulty factors for this question:

**Content Difficulty:**

*   **Specific Historical Event:** "Battle of Plassey in 1757" is a specific event in Indian history. Students who were not present for this particular topic, or who struggle with retaining historical dates and events, will not know it.
*   **Cause-and-Effect Relationship:** The question asks for a "contribution to expansion." This requires understanding cause and effect, which can be an abstract concept for some students.
*   **Political Dominance/Control:** The key to a correct answer involves understanding concepts like "political dominance," "control over Bengal," or "puppet nawab." These are not simple, concrete terms. Students need a grasp of how power structures work historically.
*   **Nomenclature:** "Mir Jafar" and "Nawab" are specific terms. Even if a student knows the general concept, recalling the specific name could be a challenge.

**Language/Literacy Difficulty:**

*   **"Contribute to the expansion of British power":** This phrase, while common in academic history, could be tricky for students with limited English. "Contribute" and "expansion" are not always everyday words for struggling learners.
*   **Abstract Concepts:** The *rubric* itself ("political dominance/control") contains abstract concepts that can be hard to articulate, even in one's native language, if the underlying understanding isn't solid.

**Common Pitfalls/Contextual Factors:**

*   **Memorization vs. Understanding:** Students might have memorized "Plassey 1757" but not fully grasped its significance beyond a rote fact.
*   **Curriculum Coverage:** Even if it's in the syllabus, actual coverage in under-resourced schools can be inconsistent.
*   **Prior Knowledge:** Building an understanding of a complex event like Plassey relies on prior understanding of European trade, Indian states, etc. If that foundation is weak, this specific event won't connect meaningfully.
*   **Exam Anxiety:** The pressure of an exam can easily block recall for many students, especially for open-ended questions that require more than just picking an option.
*   **"Never practiced this exact question type":** Many students in these environments are trained for recall of facts, not necessarily for explaining historical causality in detail, especially not for a single mark where such a specific understanding is expected.

**Recalibrating:**

My first instinct might be "this is a pretty important event, most history students should know this." However, applying the filters:

*   **Limited English:** A student struggling with basic English might misunderstand "contribute to the expansion."
*   **"Basic" isn't basic:** The *idea* of "political dominance" is not basic for a student with inconsistent education.
*   **Absent for topic/Never practiced type:** These are significant factors. If a student missed the day, or was only taught to memorize names/dates without the "why," they fail.
*   **Only a small proportion truly grasp it:** To get to the core of "political dominance over Bengal/puppet nawab" requires more than superficial recall. Many might simply say "British won." "British won Plassey" doesn't get a point according to the rubric's specific requirement.

Given the average pass rate of 29% for this demographic, a question that requires specific historical detail, an understanding of political consequences, and articulation of abstract concepts, combined with language barriers, will likely have a much lower success rate. It's not enough to know *of* the Battle of Plassey; they need to know *what it caused* in a specific political sense.

My initial thought, even after some thought, was around 20-25%, because it's a key historical event. But then I remember the rubric, and the specific requirement to explain the *political dominance* and *control over Bengal*. Just "British won" or "British gained power" would likely not score the point. Students have to connect it specifically to political control over a region/local rulers. That's a significantly higher bar.

Considering the specificity of the rubric (political dominance over Bengal, puppet nawab), and the cumulative difficulty factors for these students:

*   Knowing the event (Plassey, 1757)
*   Knowing the outcome (British victory)
*   Understanding the *consequence* as specified in the rubric (establishment of political dominance/control over Bengal, e.g., puppet nawab like Mir Jafar)
*   Articulating this in English, correctly.

Many students might know it was an important British victory, but miss the nuanced political impact required by the rubric for the full mark. "British won Plassey" is an insufficient answer based on the given rubric.
