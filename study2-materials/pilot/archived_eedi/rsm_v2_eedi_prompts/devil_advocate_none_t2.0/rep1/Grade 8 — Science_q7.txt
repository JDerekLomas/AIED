Here's a breakdown of how I'm calibrating my estimate, focusing on the provided instructions:

**Initial Instinct (and why I'm challenging it):**
My first thought might be: "This is a pretty straightforward question about decomposition. Class 8 students should have covered this in science." This leads to a higher initial estimate.

**Challenging Assumptions (based on instructions):**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "Gardener has collected waste..." - This is probably okay.
    *   "...waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit." - Understandable.
    *   "Does gardener notice any change after some days?" - Simple enough, "change" is a common word.
    *   "Give reasons" - This is where the English difficulty will kick in. They might understand *what* is happening but struggle to articulate *why* in English, especially with specific science terms like "decomposition," "microorganisms," "nutrients," "humus."
    *   "evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health" - "Evaluate" is a slightly higher-level vocabulary word. "Beneficial" is relatively common. "Soil health" should be recognizable.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   **Concept 1: Decomposition:** While covered, truly internalizing *why* it happens and *what* changes occur might be surface-level for many. They might just know "stuff breaks down."
    *   **Concept 2: Role of Microorganisms:** This is a key part of the "reasons." If they just say "it rots," they've missed the scientific explanation.
    *   **Concept 3: Beneficial for Soil Health:** Linking decomposition to nutrient enrichment and humus formation might be missed by those who grasp the first part superficially. They might just say "it's good for plants" without the scientific rationale.
    *   **Absenteeism:** Many students might have missed this specific topic, or it was taught poorly.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:**
    *   The multi-part nature ("Does gardener notice...", "Give reasons...", "evaluate...") can overwhelm anxious students. They might answer the first part correctly and then freeze on "reasons" or "evaluate."
    *   The "give reasons" part requires more than a simple yes/no. It demands an explanation, which is harder under pressure, especially in a second language.

4.  **Never Practiced this Exact Question Type:**
    *   They might have learned about decomposition, but translating it into a scenario-based question requiring "reasons" and "evaluation" can be challenging if not explicitly practiced.
    *   It's not just a recall question; it requires applying knowledge and explaining it.

**Specific Scoring Point (based on rubric):** "The user suggests that the gardener will notice significant changes."
This is a low bar. It means they need to say "yes, change will happen" and perhaps vaguely mention it will decompose or rot. They *don't* need to give reasons or evaluate to score the max points *for this specific prompt*.

**Recalibrated Estimation for *this specific prompt*:**

*   **Understanding "notice any change":** Most students, even with limited English, would likely infer that "waste" in a "pit" "after some days" will *change*. This is a very common observation, even without formal science education. They might use words like "rot," "decompose," "break down," or just "get dirty/smaller." The prompt just asks if they "notice change." Yes, they would.
*   The instruction for the score is *very specific*: "The user suggests that the gardener will notice significant changes." This means a simple "Yes, the waste will rot/decompose/reduce in size/turn into soil-like substance" would satisfy it. They don't need to elaborate on *why* or *if it's beneficial* *for this prompt*.

Considering these points, the initial "notice any change" is far more accessible than "give reasons" or "evaluate." A student who barely reads English and might only grasp keywords could still intuitively say "yes, it will change" or "it will rot."

Given the *low bar* for this specific score component (just noticing a change), the proportion should be relatively high for this first part, even with all the limitations. The average pass rate is 29%, but this single element is simpler than the full question.

I think the key is "does gardener notice any change?" not "what is the *nature* of the change." A simple affirmative coupled with any common observation of decomposition would suffice.

Therefore, many students, even those who can only pick up keywords ("waste," "pit," "days
