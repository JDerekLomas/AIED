Let's break this down by challenging assumptions:

**Initial Instinct vs. Challenged Instinct:**

*   **Initial Instinct:** "Himalayas are so obvious! Everyone knows them. Aravallis or Ghats are also common knowledge. Most students should get at least one." -> Maybe 70-80%?

*   **Challenged Instinct:**
    *   **Limited English:** "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India." Even if "mountain" is understood, "range" might be tricky. "Located in" could be a bit much for struggling readers. "Major" adds another layer.
    *   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While Himalayas are indeed prominent, recall might be an issue. Other ranges like Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, or the Ghats might not have been taught thoroughly or remembered, especially for students with less access to resources (maps, textbooks at home, extra tutoring). Some schools might focus exclusively on the Himalayas and barely touch others.
    *   **Exam Anxiety:** For students from disadvantaged backgrounds, exams can be highly stressful, leading to blanks even if they *could* recall some information under different circumstances.
    *   **Question Type:** "Name any two" requires recall rather than recognition. If they only know one, they don't get the second point (though for this rubric, they *can* score 0.5 for one correct). They might *know* of mountains, but not connect them to "ranges" or recall specific names.
    *   **Curriculum Coverage:** Geography might not be a high-priority subject in terms of thoroughness for all schools. Some might rush through it, or the teacher might not emphasize the major ranges. "Absent for this topic" is a very real scenario.
    *   **Cultural Context:** While maps exist, many students might not have frequent exposure to geography beyond what's directly taught.

**Applying the Rubric (0.5 for one correct):**

*   **Himalayas:** This is likely the *most* known. However, if a student's English is too weak, they might struggle to even understand the question. Or they might know "mountain" but not recall "Himalayas" under pressure.
*   **Other Ranges:** Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats – these are definitely less universally known and remembered than the Himalayas. For a student with limited resources and potentially irregular attendance, their recall would be very low.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for this group, a geography question requiring recall and comprehension of potentially unfamiliar vocabulary ("ranges," "major," "located") is challenging. Even getting *one* correct for 0.5 points means understanding the question and recalling at least one specific, correct name.

It's highly probable that a significant portion will struggle with the English, get blank due to anxiety, or simply not have internalized the specific names of *even one* major range beyond perhaps a vague idea of "mountains."

Let's imagine:
*   20% might genuinely know at least one and understand the question.
*   Another 10-15% might have a faint idea but struggle with the language or recall.
*   The rest will likely draw a blank or provide an irrelevant answer.

Therefore, an estimate of **35-40%** seems reasonable for scoring 0.5, allowing for a group that clearly knows at least the Himalayas and understands the prompt, and a small sliver more who might surprise you. However, pushing that estimate up too much disregards the barriers.

Considering the consistent misjudgment tendency, I need to go *lower* than my instinct for a moderate-difficulty item for this population.

*   My challenged instinct says maybe 35-40%.
*   The instruction says: "Teachers and experts consistently MISJUDGE... underestimate the difficulty... Challenge your first instinct."

This forces me to lean even lower. Many will likely know *there are mountains*, but "name two major ranges" might just be too specific for recall under pressure, coupled with language barriers. For 0.5 points (just one name), it's more forgiving, but still a hurdle.

Let's estimate that a strong 20% would confidently know at least one and articulate it. Another 5-10% might fumble through but manage one correct answer.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **28%**
