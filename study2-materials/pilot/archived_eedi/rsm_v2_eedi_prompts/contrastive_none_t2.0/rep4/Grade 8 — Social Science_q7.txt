Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty for Class 8 Indian government school students, followed by the estimate.

## Contrastive Analysis of the Question:

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **High Assurance:** Students are highly likely to have studied the Battle of Plassey (1757) in their Class 8 Social Science/History textbooks. It's a foundational event in the story of British colonization of India. The date, the name, and key players (East India Company, Nawabs of Bengal) would have been covered extensively.
*   **Slight Uncertainty:** The direct link between *victory* and *political dominance/control over Bengal* through a *puppet nawab* is the precise explanation sought by the rubric. While textbooks would explain the *consequences*, whether every student would articulate it so precisely in terms of "political dominance" might vary. They might understand "British started ruling" or "British gained power."

**2. Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
*   **"How did... contribute to..."**: This is a common phrase and generally understandable in the context of historical events. It asks for causation/consequence.
*   **"expansion of British power"**: This phrase is relatively straightforward. "Power" is a basic concept, and "expansion" would be associated with increasing their presence or control.
*   **Key terms:** "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "India" are all proper nouns they would recognize from their studies.
*   **Rubric terms:** "political dominance," "control over Bengal," "puppet nawab" – these are core concepts that they *should* have learned in their history class. The challenge isn't the words themselves, but accurately recalling the *mechanism* of that control.
*   **Overall:** The language is academically appropriate but not overly complex. Students used to the academic register of English social science texts (even if they primarily study in Hindi) should be able to process the question. The core concepts are frequently used in history.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
*   This is primarily **recall and understanding**. Students need to recall the direct consequence of the Battle of Plassey as presented in their textbooks. It's not asking them to synthesize multiple pieces of information or apply a concept to a new scenario.
*   It does require more than just *identifying* the Battle of Plassey; it requires articulating its *impact* on British power. This moves beyond mere fact recall to explaining a causal relationship.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
*   **Typical Difficulty:** This question is very similar to "explain the causes/consequences of..." or "describe the significance of..." questions found at the end of chapters in Class 8 history textbooks.
*   **Not a "Trick" Question:** It directly assesses a major historical event and its commonly understood significance. There's no hidden complexity or nuance beyond what would be expected for this age group.
*   **Ease:** The question asks for the *primary, immediate* consequence. It doesn't ask for a detailed military analysis, or its long-term social impact. It focuses on the political shift.

**Synthesis of Difficulty Factors:**

*   **Positive Factors (Makes it Easier):**
    *   Highly prominent, core historical event.
    *   Directly addressed in textbooks.
    *   Question wording is clear and academic but not overly complex.
    *   Seeks a fundamental, direct consequence (political control).
    *   Primarily recall/understanding.

*   **Negative Factors (Makes it Harder):**
    *   Requires more than simple identification; students need to articulate the *mechanism* of "contributing to expansion."
    *   Even with textbook exposure, precisely linking "victory" to "political dominance over Bengal" via "puppet nawab" can be a point of struggle for some. They might give more generalized answers like "British gained more land" or "British became powerful."
    *   General low pass rate (29%) suggests that many students struggle even with fundamental content, possibly due to poor teaching quality, lack of consistent attendance, or difficulty with retaining information across subjects.

**Conclusion:** This is a mid-range difficulty question within the context of Class 8 Social Science. It assesses core content in a standard way. However, the general academic struggles of this population and the need for a somewhat specific explanation for a full score mean the "average pass rate across items on this exam" (29%) acts as a strong anchor. While it's an easier content item *compared to other Social Science content*, it still sits within a generally struggling population.
