Let's break down the question for Class 6 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic understanding of singular/plural nouns ("apples").
    *   Basic understanding of prepositions ("in the basket").
    *   Knowledge of the articles "a/an/the" might be present, but not directly tested here.
    *   The crucial prior knowledge assumed is the *usage rules of 'some' and 'any'*. This is typically introduced at this level but can be a point of confusion. 'Some' is used in affirmative sentences and offers, 'any' in questions and negative sentences.

*   **Language Demands (with limited English proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Apples," "basket" are very common, highly likely to be known even with limited English. "There are" is also a common construction.
    *   **Grammar:** The core of the question is a grammatical distinction. Understanding "affirmative statement" versus "question/negative statement" in English might be a challenge if their grasp of sentence types is weak. The concept of "positive sentence" in Hindi/their mother tongue might be strong, but mapping it to English 'some'/'any' usage can be tricky.
    *   **Context:** The context ("apples in the basket") is simple and concrete, reducing cognitive load.
    *   **Cognitive Load:** The sentence is short and direct. The only difficult part is choosing between the two very similar-sounding options.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of a grammatical rule. Students need to *recall* the rule for 'some' and 'any' and then *apply* it to the given affirmative sentence. It doesn't require complex reasoning or inference beyond recognizing the sentence type.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Structure:** This question is very similar to common fill-in-the-blanks or multiple-choice grammar exercises found in Class 6 English textbooks in India. It's a standard type of practice item.
    *   **Concept:** The 'some'/'any' distinction is a fundamental topic covered at this level. Textbooks would usually have entire sections or chapters dedicated to such quantifiers.
    *   **Complexity:** It's on the simpler end of application questions. It's not embedded in a paragraph or requires multiple steps. There are only two choices, which limits the chance of random guessing significantly (50% if purely random, but they might have partial knowledge).
    *   **Distractors:** "Any" is a good distractor because it sounds similar and is used for similar quantity ideas. However, the rule of affirmative vs. negative/interrogative is usually taught quite explicitly.

**Challenges Specific to this Question for the Target Group:**

*   **Memorization vs. Understanding:** Students might have *memorized* rules for some grammar points but struggle to *apply* them consistently, especially under test conditions or if they haven't practiced enough with varied sentences.
*   **Interference from L1:** The exact usage rules might not have a direct, simple one-to-one mapping in Hindi or other regional languages, leading to confusion if not thoroughly taught and practiced in English.
*   **"Feeling it out":** While taught explicitly, some students might rely on how it "sounds" to them. Since both "some apples" and "any apples" (if they aren't acutely aware of the rule for this sentence type) might sound somewhat plausible without a strong grasp of the rule, it could lead to incorrect choices.

**Likely Performance:**

While 'some' and 'any' are taught, the average pass rate across items (29%) suggests that general English grammar application can be a significant hurdle. However, this is a *very common and frequently practiced rule*.

Compared to other Class 6 English grammar points (like complex tenses, reported speech, or more nuanced prepositions), the 'some'/'any' rule for affirmative sentences is relatively straightforward. There are only two choices, and the rule is binary for this type of sentence.

Students who have a basic, functional understanding of English grammar, even if their fluency is low, would likely have encountered and practiced this specific rule. Those who merely guess would get 50%. Given it's a core concept, many should recall it.

Considering the general difficulty, limited English, but the commonality and explicitness of this specific rule:

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **50%**

*   Why not lower? It's a binary choice, and this specific rule for affirmative sentences is often one of the first and most explicitly taught 'some'/'any' usages. Students are likely to have seen
