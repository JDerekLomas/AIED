Let's break down the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering the context provided.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geography of India:** This is core Class 6 Social Science content. Students are expected to learn about major physical features, including mountain ranges, rivers, plains, and plateaus.
    *   **Vocabulary:** Understanding "mountain ranges" (पहाड़ी श्रंखलाएँ) is fundamental. Names of specific ranges are introduced in textbooks.
    *   **Recall:** This question directly assesses factual recall of information taught in geography lessons.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   **"Name any two":** This is a simple, direct instruction. "Two" is a low cognitive load.
    *   **"major mountain ranges":** "Major" is important – implies the well-known ones, not obscure local hills. "Mountain ranges" is a standard geographical term.
    *   **"located in India":** Clear geographical scope.
    *   **Limited English Proficiency Impact:**
        *   While the words are fairly common geographical terms, the combination might be a stretch for students with *very* limited English, especially if they have been primarily taught in Hindi.
        *   However, the question is quite literal and specific. If they've seen "Himalayas" or "Aravalli" in an English context or a bilingual context, they might recognize it.
        *   The biggest hurdle would be translating "mountain ranges" correctly if they only know the Hindi equivalent and haven't had much exposure to English geography terms. *However, the average pass rate across items at 29% suggests that some degree of English exposure and comprehension for simple factual recall questions is assumed and present within the cohort.* Many Class 6 textbooks in government schools, even if predominantly Hindi, will introduce key geographical terms in English or provide bilingual glossaries.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   **Pure Recall:** This is a classic factual recall question. Students simply need to remember names taught in class. There's no application of concepts or reasoning required beyond remembering.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Textbook Exercises:** Most Class 6 geography chapters on India's physical features will have "name the following," "fill in the blanks," or "match the column" type questions asking for major geographical features, including mountain ranges. This question is almost identical to a very common textbook exercise.
    *   **Complexity:** It's at the lower end of the cognitive difficulty scale for Social Science questions. It's much simpler than, say, explaining the causes of monsoon or comparing two types of government.

**Analysis of the Rubric:**

*   **Names one correct mountain range:** This is a very lenient rubric. Even getting one out of two correct provides half credit. This significantly increases the chances of *some* score for many students.
*   **Examples provided:** Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats are all standard, commonly taught mountain ranges in India for this age group. The Himalayas, in particular, are extremely prominent and likely the first one any student would think of.

**Likely Performance Factors:**

*   **Dominance of Hindi Medium:** Students might struggle to write the *English* spelling correctly even if they know the name in Hindi. However, phonetic spellings are usually accepted if comprehensible for geographical terms.
*   **Emphasis on Himalayas:** The Himalayas are arguably the most famous geographical feature of India and receive significant attention in textbooks. Even weaker students are likely to remember "Himalayas."
*   **Limited English Proficiency & The 29% Baseline:** The 29% average pass rate suggests that only about one-third of the students, on average, are consistently grasping the content and English phrasing. However, *this specific question is easier than average* because of its direct recall nature and high saliency of "Himalayas."

**Estimating the Proportion Correct:**

Considering:
*   Core Class 6 content.
*   Pure factual recall.
*   High prominence of the Himalayas.
*   Lenient rubric (one correct name gives half credit).
*   Low cognitive demand.
*   Simplicity of English compared to many other types of questions.
*   The baseline of 29% for *all* items (some of which will be harder or more English-dependent).

Students who can manage to write *Himalayas* and perhaps *Aravalli* (another commonly taught range) in English, or at least one of them reasonably intelligibly, will get credit. Many will get one correct.

While the average is 29
