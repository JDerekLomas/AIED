Let's break down the question "Describes the poet's writing style" and its rubric for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their typical profile.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Directly relevant:** Students need to have been exposed to the concept of "writing style" and possibly different *types* of writing styles (though not necessarily formal labels like "romantic" or "metaphorical"). They need to understand that authors write in distinct ways.
    *   **Implicitly relevant:** They need to have read *poetry* (likely in Hindi first, and perhaps simpler English poems). They also need to be able to comprehend the specific poem they are being asked about to derive its style. This question doesn't *provide* a poem, which is a major point – it assumes they *just read one*. If this question appears in isolation, it's impossible. We must assume it's part of a set, immediately following a poem they were meant to read.
    *   **School context:** Poetry is part of the curriculum. Discussion of *kavita ka andaz* (poet's style/manner) or *rachna shaili* (compositional style) might happen in Hindi classes.
    *   **Difficulty:** High, if "writing style" hasn't been explicitly taught or discussed in *English* context, or if the associated poem is complex. Lower, if the preceding poem is very simple and has an obvious style.

2.  **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   **Key Vocabulary:**
        *   "Describes": Common enough verb, probably understood.
        *   "Poet's": Possessive, but "poet" is a relatively common word in literary contexts.
        *   "Writing style": This is the trickiest phrase.
            *   "Writing": Common.
            *   "Style": This word can be problematic. In daily life, "style" can mean fashion, a way of doing something. In a literary context, it means the distinctive manner in which a writer expresses himself. Many students might struggle to grasp this specific academic meaning. They might confuse it with "topic" or "feeling."
    *   **Phrasing/Syntax:** Simple, direct question structure. No complex clauses.
    *   **Rubric Words:** "Simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct" – these are good. "Simple" and "direct" are likely known. "Descriptive" might be inferred if they know "describe." "Informal" is likely a lower-frequency word for them. The flexibility ("or other appropriate word") is helpful.
    *   **Overall Difficulty:** High for "writing style." If they don't understand *style* in this context, they're lost regardless of the rest of the question.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application** and **Reasoning**.
        *   **Application:** Applying the concept of "style" to a given text.
        *   **Reasoning:** Analyzing the characteristics of the *specific* poem just read (vocabulary, sentence structure, tone, imagery, directness, etc.) and inferring a suitable descriptor for its "style." It's not recall, as the answer isn't directly stated in the poem. It's not merely memorizing.
    *   **Difficulty:** This moves beyond basic comprehension. It requires inferential and analytical skills, which are more advanced.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical exercises often focus on:**
        *   Direct factual recall (Who said X? What happened next?).
        *   Understanding explicit meaning of words/phrases.
        *   Identifying main idea or moral of a story.
        *   Grammar application (fill-in-the-blanks, re-ordering).
    *   **This question:** Requires higher-order thinking skills. Questions about "style" are common in advanced literature classes but less frequent as explicit tasks in Class 7 English comprehension, especially for students with limited English. They might be asked about "the poet's feelings" or "the theme," which are easier concepts to grasp in English. The conceptual jump from "what the poem is about" to "how the poem is written" can be significant.

**Combined Impact & Likelihood of Correctness:**

The single biggest hurdle is the understanding of "writing style" itself in the English literary context. If a student's prior education in English hasn't explicitly introduced this concept or given them practice applying it, they will struggle, even if they perfectly understood the poem and know the English words for potential descriptors.

*   Students might interpret "style" as "theme,"
