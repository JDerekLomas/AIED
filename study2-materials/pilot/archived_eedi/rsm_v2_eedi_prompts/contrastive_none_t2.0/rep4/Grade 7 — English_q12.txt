Let's break down the difficulty of this specific question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools from economically weaker sections, predominantly Hindi-medium.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Core Concept:** Understanding of "Voice" in grammar (Active and Passive). This is a standard topic in English grammar for Class 7, even in Hindi-medium schools. Students would likely have been introduced to it.
    *   **Grammar Rules:** Knowledge of:
        *   Identifying the subject, verb, and object in a sentence.
        *   The basic structure of passive voice (object + be verb + past participle of main verb + by + agent).
        *   Verb tenses, specifically identifying the past simple tense ("blew") and knowing the corresponding 'to be' verb ("were") and past participle ("blown").
        *   Identifying irregular verbs like "blow-blew-blown."
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "wind," "blew," "leaves," "away." These are common, everyday words.
        *   "Active Voice," "Passive Voice," "sentence," "Change," "following." These are instructional terms. "Change" is very common. "Following" is understood from context. "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" are technical terms that would be taught explicitly in an English grammar class.

2.  **Language Demands (English Proficiency):**
    *   **Instructional Language:** "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice."
        *   "Change": Very common word, likely understood.
        *   "Following sentence": Fairly common and easy to infer.
        *   "Active Voice," "Passive Voice": These are technical grammar terms. While the concepts would be taught, recognizing these specific English terms might be a hurdle if their primary instruction was in Hindi, using Hindi equivalents (e.g., 'कर्तृवाच्य' and 'कर्मवाच्य'). However, given it's an English exam, these terms are expected to be known.
    *   **Sentence Language:** "The wind blew the leaves away."
        *   "Wind," "leaves," "away": Basic vocabulary.
        *   "Blew": Past tense of "blow," an irregular verb. This is common enough. The sentence structure is simple Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), though the "away" makes it a phrasal verb, which slightly complicates things but isn't a major barrier here.
    *   **Overall:** The sentence to be transformed is syntactically simple and uses common vocabulary. The challenge lies more in the *grammar rules* and applying them in English, rather than deciphering complex English prose.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   This is primarily an **Application** task. Students need to recall the rules of active-to-passive transformation and apply them to a given sentence.
    *   It also involves some **Recall** of the past participle of "blow" ("blown").
    *   There's minimal high-level **Reasoning** beyond the rule application.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very **typical textbook exercise** for teaching active-to-passive voice transformation. It's a straightforward sentence, not a trick question, and doesn't involve multiple clauses or complex tenses. It's often one of the first types of sentences students learn to convert.
    *   The irregular verb "blow-blew-blown" adds a slight notch of difficulty compared to a regular verb, but irregular verbs in common usage (like 'go,' 'see,' 'do,' 'eat,' 'make,' 'take,' 'blow') are typically introduced and practiced extensively by Class 7.

**Key Challenges Specific to this Group:**

*   **Irregular Verb Past Participle:** Knowing "blown" is critical. While taught, retention of irregular verb forms can vary.
*   **"By the wind":** The concept of adding "by + agent" at the end. Students sometimes forget or misplace this.
*   **"Away":** Phrasal verbs sometimes cause minor confusion about their placement in passive voice, but "were blown away" is quite natural.
*   **English Terminology:** Even if the concept is understood, the exact English grammar terms "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" must be recognized.

**Mitigating Factors:**

*   The sentence is very common and uses basic vocabulary.
*   The concept of Active/Passive Voice is fundamental and heavily drilled in Class 7 English curricula.
*   The tense is simple past, which is less complex than perfect or continuous tenses.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**
