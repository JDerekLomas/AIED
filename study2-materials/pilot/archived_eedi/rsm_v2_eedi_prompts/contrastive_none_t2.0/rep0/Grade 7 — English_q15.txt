Let's break down the question for Class 7 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Low Cognitive Load:** The topic "My Favourite Hobby" is extremely relatable and personal. Every student likely has a hobby or something they enjoy doing in their free time. It doesn't require specific academic facts, historical dates, or complex scientific concepts. This is a significant advantage.
    *   **Basic Essay Structure:** The question implicitly assumes knowledge of what a "paragraph" is (a collection of related sentences). This is taught in earlier classes, typically from Class 3 or 4.
    *   **Grammar/Vocabulary for Description:** Basic vocabulary to name a hobby (e.g., cricket, reading, drawing) and simple descriptive adjectives/verbs (e.g., fun, relaxing, interesting, play, read, draw) is needed. Simple past, present, or future tenses for describing *when* they do it (e.g., "I play after school," "I read at night") and *why* they enjoy it (e.g., "It makes me happy," "I learn new things"). These are basic English structures taught early on.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Relatability:** The personal nature of the topic reduces language pressure because students aren't struggling to understand *what* to write about. They can access their own experiences directly.
    *   **Simple Sentence Structure:** The expected output (4-5 sentences) is short. Students can rely on simple declarative sentences (SVO - Subject-Verb-Object).
    *   **Keywords and Scaffolding:** The prompt provides explicit prompts: "what it is," "when you do it," and "why you enjoy it." These act as excellent scaffolding, guiding the student on *what information to include* without requiring complex sentence structures or extensive vocabulary. Even if they don't fully understand "paragraph," these bullet points guide the content.
    *   **Common Vocabulary:** Words like "favourite," "hobby," "when," "enjoy" are generally among the earlier learned words in English as they relate to daily life and personal preferences.
    *   **Risk of Hindi Influence:** While sentence structures might be basic, some students may form sentences with Hindi grammatical patterns or use anglicized Hindi words if they don't know the English equivalent (e.g., "My hobby is playing cricket" might become "My hobby cricket play"). However, the rubric is quite lenient.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Primarily Recall/Description:** It's mainly descriptive. Students recall information about their own hobby.
    *   **Some Application:** Applying basic sentence construction rules and organizing thoughts into a paragraph.
    *   **Minimal Reasoning:** "Why you enjoy it" requires a tiny bit of personal reflection, but it's not complex reasoning; usually, a simple feeling (happy, relaxed) or a basic benefit (learns, exercises).

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Easier:** Most textbook exercises at this level often involve reading comprehension of more complex passages, filling in blanks with appropriate grammar/vocabulary, transforming sentences, or writing short factual answers. This question, "My Favourite Hobby," is a common *very early* writing exercise. It's often one of the first independent writing tasks given to build confidence, usually from Class 4-5 onwards.
    *   **Low Stakes:** It's not a factual question that can be definitively wrong; it's personal expression. The only "wrong" would be not addressing the prompts at all. The leniency of the rubric (writes a *complete paragraph* clearly mentioning the hobby, when, why) means even slightly grammatically incorrect but understandable sentences would pass.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate of 29%:**

That 29% average implies a significant challenge across *all* items. However, this specific item stands out as likely being on the easier side due to:
1.  **Extreme Relatability:** Reduces cognitive load drastically.
2.  **Explicit Scaffolding:** "What it is, when you do it, why you enjoy it" provides a clear checklist.
3.  **Basic Language Demands:** Simple sentences, common vocabulary.
4.  **Lenient Rubric:** Focus on content fulfillment rather than grammatical perfection.

While sentence formation will still be a struggle for many, simply stringing together 4-5 *understandable* sentences that address the three points is achievable. Even a response like "My hobby is play cricket. I play in evening. I like it. Because it is fun." would likely get the point for fulfilling the rubric, despite grammatical errors.

The major hurdle would be students
