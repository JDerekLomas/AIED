Let's break down the question for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, considering their background.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students should have covered the Harappan Civilization (also known as Indus Valley Civilization) in their Social Science curriculum. This is a foundational topic in ancient Indian history, typically covered in Class 6 or 7, and definitely reviewed or expanded upon in Class 8. The term "urban planning" might be slightly more technical than simply "cities" but the core concepts (streets, drainage, buildings) are part of typical descriptions.
    *   **Potential Gaps:** While the civilization itself is known, the specific *features of urban planning* might be recalled with varying degrees of detail. They might remember *that* Harappan cities were well-planned, but struggle to articulate a specific feature clearly. Some students might only have a superficial understanding from rote learning rather than deep comprehension.

2.  **Language Demands (English):**
    *   **Keywords:** "Describe," "one key feature," "Harappan Civilization," "urban planning."
    *   **Difficulty:**
        *   "Describe" is a common command word, likely understood.
        *   "Key feature" is fairly straightforward.
        *   "Harappan Civilization" - Most students will recognize this.
        *   "Urban planning" is the trickiest term. While related to cities (nagar-niyojan in Hindi), some students might not immediately link it precisely to city design and infrastructure. They might interpret it more generally as "how the cities were."
    *   **Overall:** The sentence structure is simple (subject-verb-object). The vocabulary, save for "urban planning," is relatively basic. Students might struggle if they don't have a specific term for a feature readily available in English.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily a **recall** question. Students are expected to remember factual details about the Harappan Civilization's city design.
    *   There is a minor element of *selection* – they need to choose *one key feature* from several possibilities, indicating some level of understanding of what constitutes a "key feature."

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Commonality:** This type of question is very common in Class 6-8 history textbooks and exams. "List two features of Harappan cities," "Explain the drainage system of Harappa," or "What was special about Mohenjodaro's architecture?" are frequently asked.
    *   **Difficulty Level:** This question is on par with, or slightly easier than, typical textbook exercises because:
        *   It only asks for *one* feature, reducing the burden of recall compared to questions asking for two or three.
        *   The rubric offers multiple correct answers (grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town), increasing the chances a student recalls at least one. These are very prominent and usually the first things taught about Harappan urbanism.
        *   It doesn't require deep analysis or comparison, just accurate factual recall.

**Factors making it easier:**

*   **Core Topic:** Harappan Civilization is a central and mandatory topic.
*   **Simple Command:** "Describe one key feature" is easy to understand.
*   **Multiple Correct Answers:** Students have several popular options (drainage, grid, baked bricks, citadel) to choose from, increasing the likelihood they hit one.
*   **Fundamental Feature:** Urban planning is often presented as *the* defining characteristic distinguishing Harappa from other early civilizations, making these features emphasized.

**Factors making it harder:**

*   **English Terminology ("urban planning"):** As noted, this might be a slight hurdle for those with limited English if their internal conceptualization is purely in Hindi. However, the context of Harappan cities would likely cue them.
*   **Recall vs. Recognition:** It requires active recall, not just recognition from a multiple-choice list.
*   **Precision:** While "good drainage" would likely be accepted, a slightly more precise phrasing like "advanced drainage system" is better, and some might struggle with that precision in English.

**Conclusion:**

Despite the "economically weaker sections," "Hindi-medium," and "limited English" context, the Harappan Civilization is a heavily emphasized topic. The core features of its urban planning (drainage, grid streets) are often highlighted as the most impressive and unique aspects. The question asks for *only one* feature and accepts several common answers. Compared to the average pass rate of 29% for general items, this specific item taps into a very familiar and foundational historical concept.

Given that students are likely drilled on this topic, even with language barriers, a direct factual
