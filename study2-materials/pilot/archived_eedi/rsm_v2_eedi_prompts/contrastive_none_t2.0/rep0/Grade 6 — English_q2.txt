Let's break down the question "Who lived inside the book?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Direct:** The student must have read the specific passage or story from which this question is drawn. This isn't a general knowledge question; it's a *comprehension* question tied to a specific text. If they haven't encountered that text, they cannot answer correctly.
    *   **Implicit (General):**
        *   Understanding of basic concepts like "who," "lived," "inside," "book." These are fairly common words even in limited English contexts.
        *   Basic understanding of character/setting in a narrative.
        *   Exposure to simple English stories, potentially involving common fantasy elements like "fairies."

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Who," "lived," "inside," "book" are generally foundational vocabulary for Class 6. "Lived" might be slightly more challenging than "live" if verb tenses are new, but in context, it's comprehensible.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple interrogative sentence. "Who [verb] [prepositional phrase]?" is a common and relatively easy structure to process.
    *   **Reading Level:** Assumes the source text itself was at a readable level for them. The answer required ("a magical fairy") uses "magical" which is slightly higher vocabulary, but "fairy" is common in children's stories. The rubric accepts just "fairy," which is easier.
    *   **Ambiguity:** There's no significant ambiguity in the question itself.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily a **recall** question. The student needs to retrieve a specific piece of information (the inhabitant of the book) directly stated or strongly implied in the preceding text.
    *   There is no significant application of knowledge to a new situation, nor complex logical reasoning required beyond basic text comprehension.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question style is extremely common in English textbooks for primary and middle school grades: direct comprehension questions immediately following a short story or passage.
    *   The vocabulary and sentence structure of the question are generally simpler than many other exercises which might involve ordering events, predicting outcomes, or analyzing character traits.
    *   However, its difficulty hinges entirely on the *prior text* it refers to. If the text was complex, too long, or contained unfamiliar vocabulary, then retrieving this seemingly simple answer becomes much harder. Given the "average pass rate across items about 29%," many of the passages themselves are likely challenging for these students.

**Specific Factors for "Who lived inside the book?"**

*   **Ease:**
    *   Short, direct question.
    *   Uses very common English words ("who," "lived," "inside," "book").
    *   Common comprehension question type (recall a specific detail).
    *   "Fairy" is a widely recognized character, even in diverse cultural contexts, and likely appears in simple stories.
*   **Hardness:**
    *   **Absolute dependency on the preceding text.** If they haven't read/understood the source passage, or if the relevant detail was buried, obscured, or complexly phrased in the text, then this question is impossible, regardless of the simplicity of the question itself.
    *   The word "magical" (if it's crucial for their memory) could be a slightly harder vocabulary word for some, though the rubric accepts "fairy."
    *   "Lived" (past tense) requires understanding simple verb conjugation.

Considering the "average pass rate across items on this exam is about 29%", and that students often struggle with *any* English content due to limited proficiency, even simple questions tied to a text can be challenging if the text itself is problematic.

However, "Who lived inside the book?" is about as basic as a comprehension question can get, using very high-frequency words. The *text itself* and their ability to extract the *specific fact* "magical fairy" (or just "fairy") will be the primary hurdle. Assuming the text presented "a magical fairy" relatively clearly, this question targets a very fundamental detail.

I would expect this specific question to perform *slightly better* than the overall average, simply because the question's language is maximally simple. The success will be overwhelmingly tied to their comprehension of the source text itself. If they extracted "fairy" from the text, then the question is easy.
