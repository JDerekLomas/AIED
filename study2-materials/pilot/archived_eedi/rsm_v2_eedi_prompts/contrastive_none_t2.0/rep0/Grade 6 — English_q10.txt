Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion correct:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic understanding of singular/plural nouns (apples/basket).
    *   Familiarity with the concepts of existence and quantity.
    *   Most crucially, knowledge of the usage of 'some' and 'any' in affirmative vs. interrogative/negative sentences. This is a specific grammar rule.
*   **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Choose," "correct word," "apples," "basket" are likely familiar words. "There are" is also a common construction. The words themselves ('some', 'any') are common but their nuanced usage is the challenge.
    *   **Grammar/Syntax:** The sentence structure "There are... in the basket" is relatively simple and direct. The core difficulty lies in discriminating between 'some' and 'any'. This distinction is entirely grammatical, not semantic (both mean an unspecified quantity).
    *   **Cognitive Load:** Low on general comprehension once the individual words are understood. The main cognitive load is on retrieving the specific grammar rule.
*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **recall and application** of a specific grammar rule. Students need to recall the rule for 'some' and 'any' (some for affirmative, any for negative/interrogative) and then apply it to an affirmative sentence. There's very little complex reasoning involved beyond identifying the sentence type.
*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This type of fill-in-the-blank 'some/any' exercise is *extremely common* in English language learning textbooks, particularly at the early intermediate level. It's a foundational point of grammar often introduced alongside countable/uncountable nouns and 'a/an/the'.
    *   It's generally considered an entry-level grammar point, usually covered within the first year or two of formal English instruction. Compared to reading comprehension passages or writing tasks, it's a very discrete and specific skill.

**Difficulty Assessment:**

*   **Ease:**
    *   Simple sentence structure.
    *   Common vocabulary.
    *   A very common, frequently practiced grammar rule in EFL/ESL contexts.
    *   Clear-cut answer, no ambiguity.
*   **Hardness:**
    *   Requires specific grammatical knowledge that may not have been sufficiently taught or practiced, especially given "limited English proficiency."
    *   Many Indian government schools, even if English is taught, may focus more on rote memorization or basic vocabulary rather than functional grammar use.
    *   Students whose first language (e.g., Hindi) doesn't have a direct equivalent distinction for 'some'/'any' in the same grammatical context might find it abstract. However, Hindi uses *kuchh* (some/any) for both, so the differentiation is precisely the learned difficulty.

Given the average pass rate across items is 29%, this particular question, being a foundational grammar point, might fare slightly better than some more complex questions. However, the explicit *grammatical distinction* for 'some' and 'any' requires specific instruction and practice. If this instruction has been inadequate, students will likely guess or make errors based on intuition from their native language.

It's a step up from choosing between singular/plural or identifying a basic noun, but not as complex as understanding an idiom or inferring meaning from a passage. It sits squarely as a specific grammatical application.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 35%**
