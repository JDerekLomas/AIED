Let's break down the question "Define fable" for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, keeping their specific context in mind.

### Contrastive Analysis of "Define Fable"

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Positive:** Fables (especially popular ones like "The Thirsty Crow," "The Ant and the Grasshopper," "The Fox and the Grapes") are very common in Indian storytelling traditions and are often introduced early, even in primary school, usually in Hindi or local languages. Students will likely have heard or read fables, even if they don't know the English term for them. The *concept* is likely familiar.
*   **Negative:** The *formal definition* of a fable might not have been explicitly taught in English in many schools. While they know examples, they might not have broken down the defining characteristics (short story, animals, moral lesson) using those precise English terms.

**2. Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**

*   **Word "Define":** This is a fairly common instructional verb. Most Class 8 students should understand "define" as "explain what it is" or "give the meaning of."
*   **Word "Fable":** This is the crucial vocabulary word.
    *   **Exposure:** "Fable" is a literary term. Its exposure might be inconsistent. Some English textbooks might use it; others might prefer "story with a moral." It's less common in everyday English conversation.
    *   **Cognate Potential:** "Fable" isn't a direct cognate for common Hindi words for story (कहानी - kahani) or moral story (नैतिक कहानी - naitik kahani). However, similar-sounding words in Hindi might not be directly relevant to the literary term.
    *   **Answering in English:** Even if they understand the concept, articulating the definition accurately in English (using terms like "short story," "animals," "moral lesson") requires specific vocabulary and sentence structure. They might know the *components* in Hindi but struggle to translate them into concise, correct English. For example, they might understand "जानवर की कहानी जिससे कुछ सीखने को मिले" (animal story from which something is learned) but struggle to phrase "story that typically uses animals as characters and imparts a moral lesson."

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

*   This is primarily **recall**. Students need to recall the standard definition of "fable."
*   It's a step beyond simple recall of an example (e.g., "Give an example of a fable"). It requires the recall of descriptive characteristics.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Conceptual Difficulty:** Low. The concept is widely familiar.
*   **Language & Recall Difficulty:** Moderate to High.
    *   Typical textbook exercises for English literature at Class 8 level often involve comprehension questions about specific stories, identifying literary devices in context, or matching definitions. Directly *defining* a literary term like "fable" can be challenging if it hasn't been explicitly memorized or practiced.
    *   Many exercises might focus on *identifying* a fable rather than *defining* it. "Is this a fable?" is easier than "Define fable."
    *   The "average pass rate across items on this exam is about 29%" suggests that many items are challenging. A precise English definition is likely to be on the harder side given the limited English proficiency.

**Likely Challenges:**

*   **Understanding "fable" itself in English:** This is the primary hurdle. If they don't know the English word, they're stuck.
*   **Articulating the definition precisely in English:** Even if they have a conceptual understanding in Hindi, translating it into grammatically correct English using the specific descriptive terms ("characters," "imparts a moral lesson") will be difficult for many. They might provide a partial answer (e.g., "a story with animals") but miss the moral lesson aspect, or struggle with the phrasing.

**Strengths:**

*   **Familiar concept:** This significantly helps, as students are not grappling with an entirely new idea.

### Estimated Proportion Correct:

Considering the above points:

*   Many students will be familiar with the *concept* of a fable from their cultural and educational background in their native languages.
*   However, the *English word "fable"* itself, and the precise articulation of its definition in grammatically correct English, poses a significant hurdle given limited English proficiency.
*   The 29% average pass rate implies that most questions are challenging. This question, while conceptually simple, has a relatively high English vocabulary and recall demand.

I estimate that a significant portion will either not know the word "fable" or will struggle to form
