Let's break down the question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason" for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their specific background.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Understanding of the story/passage context (from which the "king's questions" originate). This is a crucial prerequisite. If they haven't read or understood the passage, the question is meaningless. The rubric states "The king wanted to answer (based on the reading passage)...", confirming this dependence.
    *   **Assumed:** Basic understanding of "importance," "real life," and "reason." These are fundamental concepts.
    *   **Not Assumed (but might be challenging):** No complex scientific, historical, or mathematical facts are required beyond general life experience.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Key Vocabulary:**
        *   "Do you think": Fairly common, probably understood.
        *   "king's questions": Literal understanding, depends on passage comprehension.
        *   "important": Very common word, likely understood.
        *   "real life": Common phrase, likely understood, especially if explained in class or contrasted with fiction.
        *   "Give one reason": Clear instruction, common academic phrase.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple interrogative followed by a simple imperative. No complex clauses, passive voice, or idiomatic expressions. This is a strength.
    *   **Cognitive Load:** The vocabulary is basic, making it relatively accessible. The structure doesn't add much cognitive load due to grammar. The main language hurdle is decoding and understanding the passage itself *before* tackling this question.
    *   **Potential Challenges:** If the word "important" itself isn't fully grasped in its nuanced meaning, or if "real life" is interpreted too narrowly. However, for a Class 7 student, these are common enough.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall (Partial):** Recalling what the king's questions *were* is essential (the three questions about right time, right thing, right people). However, the question doesn't ask for a list of these; it asks if they are *important*.
    *   **Reasoning (Primary):** The core of the question requires students to:
        1.  Understand the king's questions (based on the passage).
        2.  Reflect on these questions in the context of their own life experience or general understanding of life.
        3.  Formulate an opinion ("Do you think...")
        4.  Provide a justification for that opinion ("Give one reason"). This involves abstract thought and connecting classroom content to broader concepts. This is more demanding than simple recall.
    *   **Application:** It's an application of critical thinking to a literary context, linking it to real-world relevance.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Easier aspects:** Simple language, direct question, single reason needed. The question is open-ended, meaning many different "valid reasons" are acceptable, which reduces the pressure to find a single 'correct' answer (as long as it's logically sound). This is often less intimidating than a multiple-choice or factual recall question.
    *   **Harder aspects:** It moves beyond literal comprehension or vocabulary check. It requires analytical thinking and personal reflection, connecting a story to abstract concepts like "importance" and "real life." Many textbook questions at this level still focus heavily on 'who, what, when, where' recall or basic comprehension checks. Crafting a reason in English can also be a challenge if their expressive skills are weak, even if they have the idea.

**Overall Difficulty:**

The question is conceptually rich despite its linguistic simplicity. The biggest hurdle will be *two-fold*:

1.  **Comprehension of the Source Text:** If the students struggle to understand the passage where the king's questions are introduced, this question is automatically failed.
2.  **Formulating a Coherent Reason in English:** Even if they understand the source text and conceptually grasp the importance, articulating a valid reason clearly and grammatically in English is a significant skill that many in this demographic might lack. They might have the "right" thought in Hindi but struggle to express it. The rubric's simplicity ("Any valid reason") helps, but clear articulation is still key for a max score.

Compared to the 29% average pass rate, which might be skewed by recall-based or multiple-choice questions, this question demands more independent thought and expression.
