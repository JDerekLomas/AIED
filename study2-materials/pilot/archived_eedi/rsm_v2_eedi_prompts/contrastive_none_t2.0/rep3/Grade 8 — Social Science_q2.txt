Let's break down the question for Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students should have covered the Harappan Civilization (also known as Indus Valley Civilization) in their history syllabus by Class 8. This is a foundational topic in ancient Indian history. Textbooks (NCERT or state board) would definitely include detailed sections on its urban planning, architecture, and other features.
    *   **Potential Gaps:** While the topic is covered, the depth of understanding and recall might vary greatly. Rote memorization of facts is common, but analytical understanding might be weaker. Some students might only remember surface-level facts (e.g., "old civilization") without specific features.

2.  **Language Demands (English):**
    *   **Keywords:** "Describe," "key feature," "Harappan Civilization," "urban planning."
    *   **Difficulty:**
        *   "Describe" is a common command verb, generally understood.
        *   "Key feature" might be slightly more demanding than just "feature," implying a significant characteristic, but still accessible.
        *   "Harappan Civilization" is the direct name of the historical period, students will recognize it if they've studied it.
        *   "Urban planning": This is the most crucial term. Students might know "city planning" but "urban planning" specifically could be a challenge. They might understand "town" and "city" but linking "urban" to it conceptually might require slightly more sophisticated English vocabulary.
    *   **Overall:** The English is not overly complex in sentence structure. The challenge lies mainly in understanding "urban planning" precisely and recalling the specific historical details in English. Students used to Hindi mediums might struggle to formulate a descriptive answer in English, even if they know the facts in Hindi.

3.  **Nature of the Task (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   This is primarily a **recall** question. Students need to remember specific details taught about Harappan cities.
    *   It requires some basic **description**, but not application or complex reasoning. They don't need to analyze *why* they planned it that way, just *what* was a feature.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question is highly typical of Class 8 Social Science exams. Questions like "List features of X," "Describe the causes of Y," or "Explain Z" are common.
    *   It's comparable in difficulty to exercises asking for simple descriptions or listings of facts from a specific historical topic. It's not a higher-order thinking question that requires synthesis or critical analysis.
    *   The open-ended nature ("Describe one key feature") provides flexibility, allowing students to choose any feature they recall strongly from a set of common ones. This makes it slightly easier than if it asked for a *specific* feature.

**Strengths:**
*   The topic (Harappan Civilization) is central and heavily covered.
*   The question asks for only *one* feature, reducing the cognitive load.
*   It's a direct recall question, which many students are accustomed to.
*   The rubric offers multiple valid answers, increasing the chance of a match.

**Weaknesses:**
*   The term "urban planning" might be slightly unfamiliar in English for some students, even if they understand the concept in Hindi.
*   Formulating a descriptive answer in correct English, even a short one, can be difficult for students with limited proficiency. They might know the Hindi equivalent (e.g., "shahr yojana" / "nagar yojana") but struggle with the English translation of the feature itself (e.g., "advanced drainage system" vs. "acchi naliyon ki vyavastha").
*   General lack of strong retention and analytical study could mean many only remember the civilization's name.

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

Considering all factors:

*   The core content is definitely in the syllabus.
*   It's a straightforward recall task.
*   The flexibility of answering *one* feature is a major advantage.
*   However, the English terminology ("urban planning") and the requirement to formulate an English answer, combined with generally low proficiency and the average exam pass rate of 29%, will significantly bring the score down. Many might know the features in their native language but fail to articulate them correctly in English.

Given these points, especially the language barrier despite familiar content and simple task, I anticipate it will be harder than the average pass rate on *any* item but not impossibly hard for a significant minority.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **25%**
