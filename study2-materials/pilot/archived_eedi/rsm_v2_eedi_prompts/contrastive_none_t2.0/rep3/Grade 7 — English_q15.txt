Let's break down the question "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it." for a Class 7 student in an Indian government school, primarily from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "paragraph," "sentence," "favourite," "hobby," "enjoy." While "favourite" and "enjoy" are relatively common at this level, "paragraph" and "sentence" might be more challenging for students whose primary instruction in grammar and composition is in Hindi. "Hobby" itself might be understood in concept, but linking it directly to the English word could be an issue for some.
    *   **Grammar/Structure:** Basic sentence formation (Subject-Verb-Object), tenses (simple present for stating hobby, habitual present for when they do it, expressing feelings), conjunctions (e.g., 'and,' 'because'). Understanding of paragraph structure – that sentences relate to a single topic.
    *   **Content:** The ability to self-reflect and articulate personal experiences/preferences. This is usually not an issue, as children inherently have hobbies.
    *   **"When you do it"**: Implies understanding of time expressions (e.g., "every evening," "on weekends," "after school").
    *   **"Why you enjoy it"**: Requires expressing feelings or benefits (e.g., "it makes me happy," "I learn new things," "it helps me relax").

2.  **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **Reading Comprehension:** Understanding the prompt itself. The core terms like "paragraph," "hobby," "favourite," "when," "why," "enjoy" need to be grasped. The length instruction "4-5 sentences" is a clear numerical constraint. The structure "Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it" provides scaffolding but still requires translating those instructions into coherent English sentences.
    *   **Writing Production:**
        *   **Lexical Gaps:** Students might know their hobby in their mother tongue but struggle to find the precise English equivalent (e.g., *patang udana* for 'kite flying,' *kho-kho khelna* for 'playing Kho Kho'). Even common hobbies like 'reading' or 'drawing' might be transliterated incorrectly or have errors.
        *   **Syntactic Challenges:** Forming grammatically correct sentences in English, especially when linking ideas with 'why' clauses ("I enjoy it *because*..."). Subject-verb agreement, correct tense usage.
        *   **Cohesion:** Connecting 4-5 sentences to form a coherent paragraph, rather than just disconnected sentences.
        *   **Spelling:** Common words are likely manageable, but specific vocabulary related to their unique hobby could be challenging.
        *   **Idea Generation vs. Expression:** They might have strong ideas about their hobby but struggle significantly to express them simply and correctly in English.
    *   **Direct Translation Trap:** Students might try to directly translate Hindi sentence structures, leading to awkward or incorrect English.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   Primarily **Application**. It requires applying known vocabulary and grammatical structures to a personal context.
    *   It's **not recall** of specific factual information.
    *   It requires minimal **reasoning** (identifying *why* they enjoy it), but the main cognitive load is on language production.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Similarities:** "My Hobby" is a very common topic in early English composition in India, often introduced through fill-in-the-blanks or sentence starters. So, the *topic* itself is likely familiar.
    *   **Differences (Increased Difficulty):**
        *   **Open-ended vs. Structured:** Textbook exercises often provide much more scaffolding: vocabulary lists, sentence frames (e.g., "My favourite hobby is _____."), or short answer questions that can be copied. This question requires *generating* the content entirely, albeit with explicit points to cover.
        *   **Paragraph Length:** Writing a full 4-5 sentence paragraph from scratch, maintaining coherence, is significantly harder than completing sentences or answering one-word questions.
        *   **Rubric's Completeness:** The rubric ("clearly mentions the hobby, when it is done, and why it is enjoyable") means merely writing *some* sentences won't get a full score; all specific elements must be present and intelligible. Many students might struggle to address *all three* components comprehensively.

**Overall Assessment:**

This question is conceptually simple (every child has a hobby and
