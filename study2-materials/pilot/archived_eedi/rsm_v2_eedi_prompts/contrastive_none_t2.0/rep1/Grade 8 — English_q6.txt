Let's break down the question "Define fable" for Class 8 Indian government school students.

### Contrastive Analysis of "Define fable."

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Positive:** The concept of a "story" and "animals in stories" is almost universally present, even in oral traditions. Most students will have heard fables like "The Tortoise and the Hare" or stories from the Panchatantra (which are fables) in their regional languages or Hindi. They might not know the *term* "fable" but would be familiar with the *genre*.
*   **Challenging:**
    *   **"Moral lesson":** While students experience moral lessons in their stories, explicitly identifying "moral lesson" as a defining characteristic and articulating it in English might be a step up. They might understand "good advice" or "what you should learn" but not directly "moral lesson."
    *   **"Typically uses animals as characters":** Again, they know animal characters are common, but formulating it as a *definition* could be tricky.

**2. Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**

*   **Challenging:**
    *   **"Define":** This is a specific academic command verb. While "What is X?" is common, "Define X" expects a structured explanation. Students might provide an example rather than a definition if they struggle with the verb.
    *   **"Fable":** This is the core vocabulary word itself. If they don't know this word at all, they cannot answer. Given the limited English proficiency, "fable" might not be part of their active or even passive vocabulary, especially if their textbooks predominantly use simpler terms or if the topic isn't heavily emphasized in English. Many might only know the Hindi/regional language equivalents (like 'kahani' or 'neetikatha' for moral stories).
    *   **Articulating the definition in English:** Even if they understand the *concept* of a fable, expressing "short story," "typically uses animals as characters," and "imparts a moral lesson" precisely in English can be difficult. They might use simpler, less formal English, or just give fragments.

*   **Potentially Easier:** The words "short story," "animals," and "lesson" are relatively common English words for Class 8. The challenge is in combining them meaningfully under the umbrella of "define fable."

**3. Is this Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   This is primarily **Recall**. Students are expected to recall the definition of a specific literary term.
*   It also requires a small degree of **synthesis/application** in bringing together the different components of the definition (short, animals, moral) to form a coherent response. However, the core is knowledge retrieval.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Variable:**
    *   **Difficulty - Low End:** If their English textbook specifically covers "Fables" as a genre and provides a clear definition that they are expected to memorize, then it would be a straightforward recall question, similar to "Define noun."
    *   **Difficulty - High End:** If "fable" is introduced but not explicitly defined, or if the definitions provided are complex, or if it's primarily covered in a different subject (e.g., Hindi literature), then it becomes significantly harder. Many textbooks for this demographic prioritize grammar and basic comprehension over precise literary terminology in English. "Defining a literary term" might be considered more advanced than typical exercises like answering comprehension questions about a paragraph or filling in blanks.
    *   The term 'fable' itself is not obscure but whether it is *explicitly taught and defined* in English for these students is key.

**Contrastive Summary:**

*   **Easier aspects:** The underlying concept (animal stories with morals) is culturally familiar. Words like "story," "animals," "lesson" are generally known.
*   **Harder aspects:**
    *   The English vocabulary term "fable" might be unknown or passively known.
    *   The command verb "Define" expects a specific type of answer (formal definition).
    *   Articulating the full definition in grammatically correct and accurate English for these specific characteristics (typically uses animals, imparts a moral) poses a significant language barrier for students with limited English proficiency.
    *   It's a literary term, which may or may not be heavily emphasized in English language instruction for this group.

### ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 15%

**Rationale for Estimate:**

1.  **Limited English Proficiency:** The biggest hurdle is the term "fable" itself and then articulating the definition. If "fable" is not in their English vocabulary, they cannot even begin.
2.
