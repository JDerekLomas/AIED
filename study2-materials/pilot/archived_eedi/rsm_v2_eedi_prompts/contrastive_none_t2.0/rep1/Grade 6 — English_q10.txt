Let's break down the question's difficulty for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their specific background.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Grammar:** Students are expected to understand the basic usage of "some" and "any." Specifically, they need to know that "some" is generally used in affirmative sentences and "any" in negative or interrogative sentences (questions). This is a fundamental concept in English grammar typically introduced at an earlier stage (Class 4/5), but mastery can vary greatly.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Apples," "basket," "there are in the" are very basic, high-frequency words that should be well within the Class 6 vocabulary even for students with limited English. No complex vocabulary.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple declarative sentence structure.

*   **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Simplicity:** The sentence is extremely simple and direct. The words are short and common.
    *   **Phonological/Orthographical Familiarity:** "Some" and "any" are short, common words they might have encountered orally or visually.
    *   **Context:** The context of "apples in a basket" is concrete and easily visualized, even if the student doesn't understand every word, they can likely grasp the gist if they understand "apples" and "basket."
    *   **Grammatical Rule:** The difficulty hinges on knowing the *specific grammatical rule* for "some" vs. "any" in an affirmative statement, rather than understanding complex sentence meaning or abstract concepts. This rule is often explicitly taught in English grammar lessons.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of a learned grammatical rule. Students need to *recall* the rule for "some" and "any" and then *apply* it correctly to the given affirmative sentence. It doesn't require complex reasoning or inference beyond applying the rule.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   This question is *very typical* and often one of the *easier types* of grammar exercises found in Class 5/6 English textbooks in India. These exercises often involve fill-in-the-blanks with choices between "some/any," "many/much," "a/an/the," etc.
    *   It doesn't require composing sentences, understanding metaphors, reading a lengthy passage, or complex arithmetic concepts embedded in English. It's a direct test of a discrete grammar point.

**Overall Assessment:**

While students from economically weaker sections and Hindi-medium schools may have limited English proficiency, the question tests a very fundamental and frequently taught grammar point ("some" vs. "any"). The vocabulary is simple, and the sentence structure is straightforward.

Compared to the average pass rate of 29% across *all items*, this specific question, being a foundational grammar item, should fare significantly better. Many students, even with overall low proficiency, would likely have drilled this specific rule during their English lessons. The low cognitive load and the direct application of a taught rule make it one of the easier questions an English exam at this level might present.

Students who understand basic English sentence structure and have been exposed to this grammar rule in their textbooks and classrooms stand a good chance of getting this correct. The primary challenge would be if they entirely missed the teaching of "some/any" or have not adequately practiced it.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:** **60%**
