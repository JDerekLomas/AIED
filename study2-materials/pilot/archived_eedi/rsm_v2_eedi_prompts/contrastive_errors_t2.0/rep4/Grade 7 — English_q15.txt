Let's break down the question "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it." to estimate the proportion of Class 7 students in Indian government schools who would answer it correctly.

### Contrastive Analysis

**1. What prior knowledge is assumed?**

*   **Content Knowledge:**
    *   Students need to understand the concept of a "hobby" (a leisure activity done regularly). This is a common and relatively basic concept, likely discussed in general life or introductory English classes if they have them.
    *   They need to have a hobby themselves or be able to invent a plausible one. This is universally relatable.
*   **Structural Knowledge:**
    *   Understanding of a "paragraph" as a collection of related sentences, distinct from just a list or disconnected sentences.
    *   Basic sentence construction in English (Subject-Verb-Object).
*   **Lexical Knowledge:**
    *   Familiarity with words like "favourite," "hobby," "mention," "when," "why," "enjoy." These are relatively high-frequency words that are likely introduced early in English language learning.

**2. What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**

*   **Vocabulary:** The core vocabulary ("favourite," "hobby," "paragraph," "mention," "when," "why," "enjoy") is accessible. There are no obscure or complex words.
*   **Grammar/Syntax:**
    *   **Sentence Complexity:** Students need to form simple present tense sentences to describe their hobby, when they do it, and why they enjoy it. While "why you enjoy it" might push some to use slightly more complex conjunctions (e.g., "because it makes me happy"), simple statements like "I enjoy it. It is fun." could still meet the rubric if phrased clearly.
    *   **Connecting Ideas:** The instruction to write a "paragraph" requires some logical flow and coherence, connecting the sentences about the hobby, time, and reason.
    *   **Instructions Clarity:** The instructions "Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it" are very direct and specific, almost acting as a mini-outline. This greatly reduces ambiguity.
*   **Response Length:** "4-5 sentences" is a specific and manageable length. It doesn't demand extended discourse, which can be challenging for limited proficiency.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

*   This is primarily **application** and **personal expression**.
    *   **Application of learned grammar/vocabulary:** Students apply their knowledge of sentence structure and basic English words to describe a personal experience.
    *   **Personal Expression:** It requires students to articulate their own hobby and reasons, rather than recalling facts or analyzing external texts. This can sometimes be easier for students who struggle with academic content but have basic communication skills.
    *   **Minimal Reasoning:** While expressing "why you enjoy it" involves some light reasoning, it's about personal feeling rather than complex logical deduction.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Familiarity:** This type of question (describing oneself, one's likes/dislikes) is extremely common in elementary English textbooks globally. It's often one of the first essay/paragraph writing tasks introduced because it's relatable and provides a framework for practicing basic sentence construction.
*   **Structured vs. Open-ended:** Unlike a truly open-ended essay, the question explicitly guides the content ("what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it"). This structure significantly simplifies the task compared to, for example, "Write about your dreams for the future," which requires more abstract thought and less defined parameters.
*   **Lexical Content:** It avoids complex literary analysis terms (like "writing style," "theme") that are often difficult and unfamiliar. The previous "COMMON ERRORS" show how drastically students struggle with abstract or literary analysis questions ("describes the poet's writing style" 4% pass rate, "Write a theme or central idea" 5% pass rate).

### Why this question might be "easier" than the examples provided:

*   **Personal and Concrete:** It asks about a personal, concrete topic ("my favourite hobby"). This is much easier than describing abstract concepts like a poet's style or a poem's theme, where both the subject matter and the required vocabulary are more complex. Students likely *have* a hobby, even if they struggle to express it perfectly in English.
*   **Direct Prompting:** The prompt breaks down the required content into bullet points ("what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it"). This acts as a clear checklist, guiding students on what to
