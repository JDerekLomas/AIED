Here's a breakdown of the question "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence: book/reading/a/is/he" and its difficulty for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering the provided context:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **What prior knowledge is assumed?**
    *   **Basic vocabulary:** All words (`book`, `reading`, `a`, `is`, `he`) are very common, foundational English vocabulary that should be introduced by Class 3-4, if not earlier. They are high-frequency words.
    *   **Basic sentence structure (SVO - Subject-Verb-Object):** This is the core skill being tested. Students are expected to understand that a sentence typically starts with who or what is doing the action (subject), followed by the action (verb), and then what the action is being done to (object). This is fundamental to forming correct English sentences.
    *   **Understanding of present continuous tense:** The "is reading" implies the present continuous. While they might not articulate the tense name, they should be familiar with the "is + -ing" construction for ongoing actions.
    *   **Capitalization for sentence start:** Implicitly, "He" should be capitalized.

2.  **What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
    *   **Vocabulary:** Minimal demand, as noted above. Words are extremely common.
    *   **Grammar/Syntax:** The *core demand* is grammatical – arranging words into a standard English SVO structure. This requires understanding fundamental English syntax, which is often a challenge for L2 learners, especially if their L1 (e.g., Hindi) has a different standard word order (Hindi is typically SOV - Subject-Object-Verb, though SVO is also common in various contexts). The presence of only five words makes the task manageable compared to longer sentences.
    *   **Sentence meaning:** The individual words themselves combine to form a very simple and concrete meaning, which aids comprehension. It's not abstract.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of grammatical rules. Students are not just recalling facts but applying their knowledge of English sentence structure to an unscrambled set of words.
    *   There is an element of **reasoning** to determine the logical flow and relationship between the subject, verb, and object, but it's basic reasoning based on language convention.
    *   It's *not* creative writing or complex inferential reasoning like some of the low-pass rate questions ("Describes the poet's writing style").

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Easier:** Compared to "describes the poet's writing style" or "write a theme/central idea," this is significantly easier. Those require higher-order thinking, inference, abstract comprehension, and the ability to articulate complex ideas in full sentences.
    *   **Similar difficulty to simple grammar drills:** This type of rearrangement exercise is a very common and fundamental grammar drill found in most English language learning textbooks from elementary levels onward. It directly targets basic sentence formation.
    *   **Harder than pure vocabulary recall but easier than paragraph writing:** It's more demanding than just matching a word to its meaning, but much less demanding than generating original sentences or paragraphs on a given topic.
    *   The brevity (5 words) also makes it simpler than rearranging a longer, more complex sentence.

**Comparison with "Common Errors" examples:**

*   **Q: "Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%)** This is analytical, abstract, and requires sophisticated vocabulary and analytical skills in English. Students clearly struggled with the *concept* and *language needed to express it*.
*   **Q: "Write a theme or central idea..." (pass rate: 5%)** Again, abstract comprehension and articulation in English are the hurdles. The attempt "The last bargin they about a child and labour..." shows understanding of *some* keywords but a complete breakdown of syntax and grammar.
*   **Q: "Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'." (pass rate: 10%)** This is *production* of text, requiring grammatical accuracy, coherence, and idea generation. The errors ("My hobby is cricket play") demonstrate basic SVO struggle even in free production, suggesting a shaky foundation. However, the question about "Rearranging" provides the words, reducing the burden of word choice and full sentence generation, focusing solely on arrangement.

**Why this question might fare better:**

*   **Constrained Response:** Students don't need to invent words or ideas. All components are given.
*   **Concrete Meaning:** "He is reading a book" is a very common
