Let's break down the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" based on the provided context and common error analysis for Class 6 students in Indian government schools.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geographic awareness:** Students are expected to know the major geographical features of India, specifically mountains. This is a fundamental topic covered in Class 6 Social Science (Geography section).
    *   **Identification:** They need to be able to recall specific names of mountain ranges.
    *   **Implicit understanding of "major":** While "major" might be a nuanced term, at this level, students would likely focus on the most prominent ones learned.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Name," "major," "mountain ranges," "located," "India."
        *   "Mountain ranges" (पहाड़ी श्रंखला / पर्वतमाला) is a core geographical term.
        *   "Located" (स्थित) is common.
        *   "Major" (मुख्य/प्रमुख) might be a slight discriminator but usually implies what's been heavily emphasized in textbooks.
    *   **Sentence structure:** Simple imperative.
    *   **Cognitive load:** The language itself is fairly direct and not convoluted. Compared to explaining "colonial rule" or "significance," it's much simpler.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Pure Recall:** This is a direct recall question. Students either know the names or they don't. There's no application of concepts or complex reasoning required.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Less difficult:** This question is very similar to common fill-in-the-blanks, matching, or "list two examples" type questions found at the end of geography chapters. It directly tests factual knowledge that would be repeatedly presented.
    *   **Compared to the common error examples:**
        *   "Explain how colonial rule..." (Pass rate 9%): Requires historical analysis, cause-and-effect reasoning, understanding of social impact, and strong explanatory language. Much harder.
        *   "Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes?" (Pass rate 10%): Requires cultural/historical understanding of symbols (Ashoka Chakra/pillar) and explanatory skills. Much harder.
        *   "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign..." (Pass rate 12%): Requires understanding historical "significance," chronology, and key achievements, followed by explanation. Much harder.

**Factors making this question relatively *easier* for this demographic:**

*   **Concrete and Factual:** Mountains are physical entities. Their names are taught as distinct facts. This is often easier for rote learning, which is prevalent in many Indian schools, especially at lower grades.
*   **Direct Recall:** No complex reasoning or abstract explanation is needed. Just pull information from memory.
*   **Likely Emphasized in Textbooks:** Major geographical features of India (rivers, mountains, plains) are foundational and usually given significant prominence in Class 6 geography chapters.
*   **Potential for Hindi Transfer:** While the exam is in English, if the student understands "mountain range," they likely learned the names in Hindi first (e.g., Himalaya - हिमालय, Aravalli - अरावली, Vindhya - विंध्य). The conversion to the English spelling of the name is often practiced. Even if they spell it imperfectly, it might still be recognized by a rubric focused on content.
*   **Partial Credit:** The rubric gives 0.5 points for just *one* correct range. This significantly lowers the bar for a "correct" response (even if only half correct).

**Factors that might still make it challenging:**

*   **Limited English Proficiency:** While "mountain range" is fundamental, a student struggling with basic English might misinterpret the question or not understand the prompt "Name." However, for Class 6, core geography terms are likely part of their vocabulary building.
*   **Spelling:** Spelling the names correctly (e.g., "Himalayas," "Aravalli") can be an issue, but the rubric likely allows for phonetic variations if the intention is clear.
*   **Recall of *two* ranges:** Some students might remember one prominent range but struggle to recall a second. However, given options like Himalayas, Aravallis, Vindhyas, Satpuras, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats – there's a good variety of well-known ranges.

**Estimation Rationale:**

The common errors from the difficult questions show "Empty Response" or fragmented, incorrect attempts. This question is a completely different beast. It tests a very
