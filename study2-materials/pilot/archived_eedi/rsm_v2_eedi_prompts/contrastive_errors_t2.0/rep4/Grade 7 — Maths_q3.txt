Let's break down the question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering the context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geometric Shapes:** Recognition of a triangle, base, and height. This is fundamental geometry typically introduced much earlier, probably Class 4-5.
    *   **Area Concept:** Understanding what "area" means (the space enclosed by a 2D shape). This is also foundational.
    *   **Basic Multiplication:** Multiplying integers and fractions. Students at Class 7 will have covered this extensively.
    *   **Units:** Understanding "cm" and "cm²" (though not explicitly required for a full score here, it's part of the concept).
    *   **Formula Recall:** Remembering the specific formula for the area of a triangle. This is the primary mathematical hurdle. Students would have been taught this in Class 6 or 7.

*   **Language Demands (limited English proficiency):**
    *   "Find": A common command verb. Most students would understand this in a mathematical context.
    *   "Area": A key mathematical term. While they might struggle with general English vocabulary, "area" (क्षेत्रफल - kshetrafal) would have been introduced in their mathematics classes, often with Hindi translations alongside.
    *   "Triangle": Another key mathematical term (त्रिभुज - tribhuj), likely understood.
    *   "Whose": Connective pronoun. Might be slightly confusing if not very strong in English, but the context clarifies that 'base' and 'height' refer to the triangle.
    *   "Base": Mathematical term (आधार - aadhar), understood.
    *   "Height": Mathematical term (ऊँचाई - unchai), understood.
    *   "cm": Units are universally recognized.

    *Conclusion on language:* The language is fairly direct and uses common mathematical terminology that would likely have been reinforced in both English and Hindi in their textbooks and classrooms. The biggest potential linguistic barrier would be "whose," but the structure of the sentence (triangle + description) should make the meaning clear enough for most.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application** of a **Recalled** formula.
    *   It requires recalling the formula ($Area = 1/2 \times base \times height$).
    *   It then requires substituting the given values into the formula and performing basic calculations.
    *   There is no complex reasoning or problem-solving strategy involved beyond knowing which formula to use for this specific context.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is an **extremely direct and basic application** of the area of a triangle formula.
    *   It's a "level 1" problem on this topic. Typical textbook exercises would start with this, then move to finding a missing dimension (e.g., given area and base, find height), composite figures, word problems, or questions with more complex numbers/decimals.
    *   The numbers (`8` and `6`) are simple integers, making calculation straightforward. There are no tricky fractions or decimals to manage.

**Overall Assessment:**

This question is a fundamental test of whether a student has learned and can apply the area of a triangle formula.
*   **Ease:** The language is quite accessible given the mathematical context. The numbers are simple. It directly asks for the application of a basic formula. It doesn't require complex reasoning.
*   **Difficulty:** The only real hurdle is the **recall of the formula**. If a student has learned this concept, this question should be very easy. If they haven't learned it or have forgotten it, they won't be able to get it correct, even if they have good arithmetic skills.
*   **Comparison to Average Pass Rate (29%):** Given that the average pass rate across items is 29%, this specific question *should* have a significantly higher pass rate. This question is foundational, presented in a very straightforward manner, and involves skills that should be core to their Class 7 math curriculum. The fact that the rubric only asks for stating or using the correct formula further lowers the bar for getting *some* credit, even if they make a calculation error.

Students from economically weaker sections in government schools might struggle more with advanced topics or multi-step problems due to learning gaps or inconsistent instruction. However, a foundational concept like the area of a triangle, presented so simply, would likely be taught thoroughly. The main failure point would be either not having thoroughly understood the concept (a learning gap) or rote memorization failing.

**Considering "states or uses the correct formula" for max score 1:** This lowers the bar. They don't even need to calculate the correct area (24
