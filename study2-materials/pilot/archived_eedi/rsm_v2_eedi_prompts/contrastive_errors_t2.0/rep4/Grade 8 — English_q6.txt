Let's break down the question "Define fable" in the context of Class 8 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency.

### Contrastive Analysis of "Define fable"

**1. What prior knowledge is assumed?**

*   **Implicit Knowledge of Fables:** Many students, even with limited English, will have been exposed to fables in their mother tongue (e.g., Panchatantra stories are ubiquitous). They will understand the concept of animals talking and a moral lesson, even if they don't know the English term "fable."
*   **Vocabulary:**
    *   **Define:** This is a common directive verb in exams, and students at Class 8 should have encountered it.
    *   **Fable:** This is the key English term being assessed. Its recognition and understanding are crucial.

**2. What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**

*   **Verb "Define":** This is a direct command. It requires students to articulate a meaning, not just identify something.
*   **Target Term "Fable":** This term might be new to many, or they might only recognize it passively if they've heard it in English class. Its etymology or sound might not immediately suggest its meaning to a Hindi speaker, unlike some more cognate words.
*   **Production of English Sentence(s):** The rubric requires defining it as "a short story that typically uses animals as characters and imparts a moral lesson." This is a multi-clause sentence requiring a moderate level of grammatical structure and specific vocabulary.
    *   Key vocabulary needed: "short story," "animals," "characters," "moral lesson." While "animals" and "short story" are fairly basic, "characters" in this context (as story participants) and "moral lesson" might be slightly more challenging for weaker students to spontaneously produce correctly. "Imparts" is likely too high-level; they'd more likely say "gives" or "teaches."

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

*   **Recall (and slightly application):** It primarily requires the recall of a definition learned in class or from a textbook. If they've never *explicitly* been taught the definition of "fable" in English, they would have to reason from context if they know the stories themselves (e.g., "The Fox and the Grapes" is a fable) to the definition, which is a higher bar. Given it's a "define" question, explicit recall is the expectation.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Likely Standard:** Defining literary terms is a common exercise in English textbooks for this age group. It might appear as "What is a fable?" or "Define the following: fable, poem, prose, biography."
*   **Contrast with Examples Provided:**
    *   **"Describes the poet's writing style" (4% pass):** This is *much harder*. "Describes," "poet's," "writing style" are all higher-level vocabulary. "Writing style" is an abstract concept. Students struggled with empty responses or generic replies. This required *analysis* of a text, not just recall.
    *   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem..." (5% pass):** Also *much harder*. "Theme," "central idea" are abstract literary concepts. "Of the poem" requires prior reading and comprehension. It asks for interpretation, not recall. Again, many empty responses or highly erroneous attempts.
    *   **"Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby" (10% pass):** This is an easier *concept* (personal experience) but the "paragraph (4-5 sentences)" and "mention what" demands significant sustained writing. Errors show struggles with sentence structure, basic vocabulary, and following multi-part instructions.

**Comparing "Define fable" to these examples:**

*   **Pros (makes "Define fable" easier):**
    *   It's a single, direct question about a specific term, not an abstract analysis.
    *   The concept (animals talking, moral lesson) is culturally familiar.
    *   The expected answer is relatively concise.
*   **Cons (makes "Define fable" harder):**
    *   Requires *productive* English (writing out a definition), not just multiple choice.
    *   The term "fable" itself might be unfamiliar to students who have only read stories and never connected the English word to them.
    *   Key terms in the definition (e.g., "moral lesson") might be challenging to express correctly for some.

**Predicted Performance and Common Errors:**

*   **Correct/Partially Correct:** Some students will have encountered this term and its definition in English class
