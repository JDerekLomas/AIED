Let's break down the question "Who lived inside the book?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering the provided context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Who": Basic interrogative, likely learned early.
        *   "Lived": Common verb, usually acquired.
        *   "Inside": Preposition, very common.
        *   "The book": Very basic noun phrase.
        *   *Crucially:* The content of the story itself is the primary prior knowledge assumed. Students need to have *read or heard* the story from which this question originates and retained the key character information. This is the biggest unknown variable for external assessment. Assuming it's from their prescribed textbook or a known passage, they *should* have encountered "a magical fairy."
    *   **Grammar:** Basic subject-verb inversion for questions, understanding "who" asks for a person/character.

2.  **Language Demands for Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** The words themselves are simple and foundational English. No complex vocabulary.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The question structure ("Who lived inside X?") is very straightforward and common. It doesn't involve subordinate clauses, passive voice, or other complex grammatical constructions that trip up students.
    *   **Output Demand:** The expected answer is short and direct: "A magical fairy" or "A fairy." This avoids the need for extended sentence construction or complex descriptive language, which were challenges in the example errors. The example "My favourite game is Badminton..." shows students struggling with sentence formation for a paragraph, but this question only requires a phrase.
    *   **Lack of Redundancy/Ambiguity:** The question is unambiguous. There's only one "book" referred to in the context of the story this likely comes from, and "who lived inside" clearly asks for a character residing there.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** This is almost purely a recall question. Students need to remember a specific piece of information (the character's identity) from a previously encountered text. There's no application of concepts or complex reasoning involved.
    *   Compared to the examples:
        *   "Describes the poet's writing style": Requires abstract understanding and description, much harder than recall.
        *   "Write a theme or central idea": Requires synthesis and understanding beyond literal recall, more challenging.
        *   "Write a short paragraph about 'My Favourite Hobby'": Requires generation of ideas, personal reflection, and sustained writing, very high demand.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   "Who lived inside the book?" is a quintessential "comprehension check" question often found at the end of story chapters in Class 1-6 textbooks. It tests basic factual recall from the story.
    *   These types of direct recall questions are generally among the easiest in typical English comprehension sections. More difficult questions would ask for 'why' or 'how' or 'what do you think'.
    *   The examples provided for common errors show significantly higher demands: stylistic analysis, thematic identification, and paragraph writing. This question is on a much lower rung of cognitive demand.

**Analysis of Difficulty Based on Given Context:**

*   **Average pass rate ~29%:** This overall pass rate is a strong benchmark. However, the examples for "common errors" correspond to very low pass rates (4-10%). This implies that *some* questions are much harder than others.
*   **English proficiency and "Empty Response":** "Empty Response" is a recurring wrong answer for harder questions. The simplicity of "Who lived inside the book?" makes an empty response less likely *if* they understand the question and know the answer from the story. They might simply write "Fairy" or "Book," showing some understanding.
*   **Target Answer ("A magical fairy," "fairy"):** Both are simple, one-word or two-word answers. This mitigates the writing burden significantly compared to "My Favourite Hobby."

**Likely Challenges:**

*   **Not having read/understood the source text:** The primary reason for error would be a lack of exposure to, or understanding of, the story from which this question is drawn. If they simply haven't read that particular story or didn't comprehend it, they can't answer.
*   **Failure to connect "book" to the "fairy":** A student might understand the words individually but fail to make the specific connection established in the story.
*   **Very minimal English literacy:** While the words are basic, for truly non-English proficient students, any English sentence can be a barrier. However, the simplicity of this sentence makes it
