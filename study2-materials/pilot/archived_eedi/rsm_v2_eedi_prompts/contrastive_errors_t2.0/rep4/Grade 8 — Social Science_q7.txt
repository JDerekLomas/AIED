Let's break down the question "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?" based on the given context of Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Directly Assumed:** Students should know about the Battle of Plassey (date and involved parties - British East India Company, Nawab of Bengal). They should also have a basic understanding of what "expansion of British power" means in the Indian context (e.g., control over territory, trade, politics).
    *   **Implicitly Assumed:** Some understanding of the political landscape of Bengal before and after the battle, and the concept of a "puppet ruler" or political control. This is foundational content for understanding the British Raj.

2.  **Language Demands (English):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Contribute to," "expansion," "power," "political dominance/control," "puppet nawab." While "battle" and "British" are likely known, terms like "contribute to expansion" and the nuanced explanation of "political dominance" or "puppet ruler" can be challenging for students with limited English proficiency. They might grasp "British won, then British rule expanded" but struggle to articulate *how* or the specific mechanism (political control over Bengal, puppet nawab).
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The question uses a direct "how did... contribute" structure. Students need to form a causal explanation.
    *   **Compared to other examples:**
        *   "Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi" – Higher language demand, requires analyzing *effects* across a broad group, abstract concept of "colonial rule."
        *   "Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes? Explain" – Potentially simpler, a direct factual recall.
        *   "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign in Indian history, mentioning at leas" – "Significance" can be abstract, requires synthesizing information about a period.
    *   **This question:** Sits in the middle. "How did X contribute to Y?" requires more than simple recall; it requires establishing a cause-and-effect relationship using specific historical details.

3.  **Nature of the Task (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   This is primarily a **recall and explanation** task. Students need to recall the outcome of Plassey and then explain its direct political consequence. It's not abstract application or complex reasoning, but it does require more than just stating "British won." They need to connect the win to the *expansion of power*.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Standard Textbook Question:** This is a very common and central question regarding the British conquest of India. Textbooks often explicitly discuss Plassey as a turning point, emphasizing its political implications rather than just military victory.
    *   **Emphasis on "Political Dominance/Puppet Nawab":** The rubric requires a specific level of detail regarding political control, which indicates a need to go beyond simply saying "British became powerful." This nuance might be missed by students who only remember the superficial victory.
    *   **Comparison to high failure rate questions:**
        *   "Tribal communities" question: Requires understanding socio-economic impacts, more complex.
        *   "Lions on notes": More about cultural/national symbols, less historical causation.
        *   "Ashoka's reign": Broader historical synthesis.
    *   **This question is likely *easier* than the "tribal communities" question but comparable to or slightly harder than the "Ashoka's reign" if a precise political explanation is required beyond mere recall of "victory."** The concept of a "puppet ruler" is a specific historical detail that, if taught well, can be recalled, but without it, answers might be vague.

**Factors for Success:**
*   Strong recall of Plassey's *political* aftermath (not just the battle itself).
*   Ability to articulate the concept of "control over Bengal" or "puppet ruler" in simple English.
*   Good teachers who emphasized the *consequences* of the battle.

**Factors for Failure:**
*   Weak English, leading to an inability to phrase the causal link.
*   Recalling only "British won the Battle of Plassey" without detailing its political impact.
*   Limited focus in teaching on the *mechanism* of power expansion (i.e., Mir Jafar, revenue collection) after Plassey, focusing instead only on the military aspect.
*   Confusion or partial recall.

Given that the average pass rate for Social Science is around 29%, and the specific common errors listed show difficulties with both abstract concepts and specific factual recall combined with
