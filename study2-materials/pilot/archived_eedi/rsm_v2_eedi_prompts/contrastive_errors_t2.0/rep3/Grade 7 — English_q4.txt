Let's break down the question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason." using the provided context and common errors.

**Analysis of the Specific Question:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Passage Comprehension:** Students must have read and understood the story about the king's three questions (likely from "The Three Questions" by Tolstoy). This implies understanding the plot, characters (the king, the hermit, the wounded man), and the *nature* of the questions themselves (What is the right time? Who are the most important people? What is the most important thing to do?).
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Important," "real life," "reason." These are relatively common words for this age group, but "real life" might be slightly abstract for some.
    *   **Basic Argumentation:** The prompt requires providing "one reason," implying a cause-and-effect or explanatory statement.

*   **Language Demands for Limited English Proficiency:**
    *   **Simple Sentence Structure:** The question itself uses very basic syntax ("Do you think X is important? Give Y").
    *   **Open-ended Response:** This is where the difficulty lies for students with limited English. They need to generate a grammatically coherent sentence or two to express their opinion and a reason. This moves beyond mere recall or multiple-choice.
    *   **Abstract Concepts:** "Important in real life" requires students to bridge the fictional story to their own lived experience and articulate *why* those specific questions (time, people, action) have broader relevance. This is more demanding than simply restating plot points.
    *   **Grammar/Syntax for Explanations:** While the question allows for "one reason," expressing it clearly in English ("because...", "so that...", "it helps us...") can be a significant hurdle, as evidenced by common errors like fragmented sentences or topic shifts.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **reasoning** and **application**. While it *relies* on recall of the passage's content, the core task is to form an *opinion* and provide *justification* that extends beyond the story itself. It asks students to apply the themes of the story to a real-world context.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **More difficult than basic recall:** Many textbook exercises might ask "What were the king's three questions?" or "Who did the king ask for advice?" This question goes beyond that.
    *   **Potentially more difficult than simple sentence formation:** The *conceptual* leap is harder.
    *   **Comparable to inferential questions:** It's similar to questions asking students to infer a character's feelings or the author's message, but it adds the "real life" application component.
    *   **Writing a coherent "reason" in English is the key challenge.** The "common errors" show that students struggle with even simple descriptive writing or staying on topic, let alone providing a coherent justification for an opinion. The example for "Write a theme" ("The last bargin they about a child and labour. many people tried to force the la") indicates a struggle with linking ideas logically and grammatically.

**Contrastive Analysis with Common Errors:**

*   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%) vs. "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life?"
    *   The "poet's writing style" question is *highly abstract* and requires sophisticated analytical language, hence the extremely low pass rate.
    *   Our target question is more grounded. "Important in real life" is easier to grasp conceptually than "writing style."
    *   However, both require generative English output and an understanding of underlying concepts.

*   "Write a theme or central idea..." (pass rate: 5%) vs. "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."
    *   These are *very comparable* in terms of the cognitive demand. Both ask for abstract interpretation/application and require students to express it generatively in English.
    *   The low pass rate for "theme" suggests students struggle significantly with expressing abstract ideas in English, even if they might grasp them implicitly.
    *   Our target question asks for a "reason," which is functionally similar to explaining a theme.

*   "Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'." (pass rate: 10%) vs. "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."
    *   "My Favourite Hobby" is personal and concrete, yet still yields a very low pass rate. This strongly indicates the *language barrier
