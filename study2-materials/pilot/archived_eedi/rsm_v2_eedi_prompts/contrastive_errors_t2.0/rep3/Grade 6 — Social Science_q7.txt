Let's break down the question "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there" using the provided context and rubric.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geography:** Basic knowledge of Indian states, specifically Rajasthan's location and general characteristics (e.g., desert, minerals). This is fundamental Class 6 geography.
    *   **Natural Resources:** Understanding what "natural resources" are (things from nature that humans use). This is a core concept taught in Social Science.
    *   **Causal Relationship:** The ability to link a resource to its impact on human life (e.g., water -> agriculture, drought, camel use; minerals -> mining, industry, specific crafts). This requires a basic understanding of cause and effect in a social context.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   "Mention any two natural resources": Straightforward recall. "Natural resources" is a common term, likely learned in English, Hindi, or a regional language and associated.
    *   "found in Rajasthan": Specific geographical context.
    *   "explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there": This is the more demanding part. "Influences" requires understanding impact/effect. "Lives of the people" is clear. Students with limited English might struggle to articulate a detailed explanation but could probably provide a simpler link (e.g., "water is for farming").
    *   **Key Challenge:** While listing resources might be fine, elaborating on *how* they influence lives could be tough for those struggling with expressing complex thoughts in English, even if they have the conceptual understanding. However, the rubric implies a simple connection is sufficient for "explain."

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Naming two natural resources from Rajasthan is pure recall (factual knowledge).
    *   **Reasoning/Application (Simple):** Explaining the influence of one resource is a basic application of geographical and economic understanding. It's not deep reasoning or complex application but requires connecting facts to a consequence. It's a "tell me how X affects Y" type of question.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Resource Identification:** Naming natural resources of a state is a very common type of Class 6 Social Science question. Often, there are "list the natural resources of your state/country" exercises.
    *   **Influence/Impact:** Explaining the *impact* is slightly more challenging than just listing but is still a standard type of question in textbooks ("How do rivers help farmers?", "What is the importance of minerals?"). The simplicity of the rubric for "explain" makes it more accessible.
    *   **Specific Context (Rajasthan):** For students in Rajasthan or neighboring states, this would be highly relevant and often covered. For students elsewhere in India, it might be slightly less directly emphasized but still part of general Indian geography.

**Comparison with Common Errors/Low Pass Rate Questions:**

*   **Q: "Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi" (pass rate: 9%)**
    *   **Difficulty:** Much harder. "Colonial rule," "tribal communities" are abstract, multi-faceted concepts requiring synthesis of historical knowledge, understanding of power dynamics, and articulating socio-economic changes over time. Many "empty responses" indicate students didn't even attempt, likely due to a complete lack of understanding of the complex historical process.
*   **Q: "Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes? Explain" (pass rate: 10%)**
    *   **Difficulty:** This is very specific, culturally loaded, and potentially an obscure historical/symbolic fact for Class 6. It requires knowledge of Ashoka's symbols. The "Asher' stand" type answers show fragmented or confused recall, suggesting they picked up bits without understanding the full context.
*   **Q: "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign in Indian history, mentioning at leas" (pass rate: 12%)**
    *   **Difficulty:** Again, historical synthesis. "Significance" requires understanding *why* something was important, which is more complex than just recalling events. Ashoka's reign is key, but explaining its "significance" (spread of Buddhism, moral governance, symbols) is harder than just stating facts.

**Why this Rajasthan question is *easier* than the examples provided:**

*   **Concreteness:** "Natural resources," "Rajasthan" are tangible. The connection between a resource (like water or minerals) and people's lives (farming, mining) is quite direct and concrete.
*   **No complex abstract concepts:** Unlike "colonial rule," "sign
