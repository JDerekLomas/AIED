Let's break down the question "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it." for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering the provided context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Short paragraph": This term should be familiar from language classes, referring to a group of related sentences.
        *   "Hobby": This is a very common and relatable word. Most students will understand what a hobby is.
        *   "Mention": Straightforward instruction.
        *   "Enjoy": Common verb.
    *   **Grammar/Sentence Structure:** Basic sentence formation (Subject-Verb-Object), ability to use simple present tense, and some conjunctions (e.g., "because," "and," "when").
    *   **Concept:** The idea of having a hobby and being able to express personal preference and reason. This is a universal concept.
    *   **Paragraph Structure:** Awareness that a paragraph should have a few connected sentences about a single topic.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Relatability:** The topic "My Favourite Hobby" is extremely relatable and personal. Students don't need external knowledge; they just need to describe their own experiences. This significantly reduces cognitive load compared to questions about a specific poem, story, or abstract concept.
    *   **Lexical Access:** Students will likely have a core vocabulary related to common hobbies (playing cricket, drawing, reading, cycling, watching TV/movies, etc.). This makes it easier to find words.
    *   **Grammatical Complexity:** The required grammatical structures are mostly simple present tense ("I play," "I do it," "I enjoy"). It doesn't demand complex tenses, passive voice, or highly sophisticated sentence structures.
    *   **Question Format:** The instructions are very clear and broken down:
        *   "What it is"
        *   "When you do it"
        *   "Why you enjoy it"
        *   This provides a scaffold for the content they need to include.
    *   **Length Requirement:** "4-5 sentences" is specific but achievable. It's not overwhelming like "write a long essay."

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Application:** This question primarily requires application of basic English writing skills to a personal topic. Students need to *apply* their understanding of vocabulary, grammar, and paragraph structure.
    *   **Recall (personal):** They need to recall their own hobby and reasons.
    *   **Reasoning:** Very minimal reasoning is required beyond explaining *why* they enjoy something, which can be done with simple cause-and-effect statements.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question is a **staple** of early English language learning. "My Hobby," "My School," "My Favourite Game/Animal" are very common composition topics in Indian school textbooks from Class 4-5 onwards.
    *   The structure provided ("mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it") is also typical scaffolding found in such exercises.
    *   The previous examples of low pass rates indicate that open-ended writing and specific literary analysis are very challenging. This "My Favourite Hobby" question is much more direct, personal, and less cognitively demanding in terms of English expression and external knowledge.

**Comparison with Provided Common Errors:**

*   **"Describes the poet's writing style" (pass rate: 4%)**: Requires understanding "describe," "poet," "writing style," and ability to analyze literature – far too abstract and specific for students with limited proficiency. "I am reading" and "Empty Response" are logical outcomes for such a difficult question.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain'" (pass rate: 5%)**: Again, understanding "theme," "central idea," analyzing a specific poem – highly challenging. "The last bargin they about a child and labour..." shows an attempt at content but very poor English structure, suggesting the cognitive load of understanding the poem and the question overwhelmed their language ability.
*   **"Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what" (pass rate: 10% - THIS IS THE EXACT QUESTION'S PRIOR DATA)**
    *   The provided previous wrong answers are interesting:
        *   "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy": This shows an attempt but gets sidetracked by listing multiple favourites and
