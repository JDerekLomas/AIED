Let's break down the Harappan Civilization question using the provided context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **What makes this SPECIFIC question easy or hard compared to similar Social Science content at the Class 8 level?**

    *   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:** This question assumes direct factual recall about the Harappan Civilization. This topic is typically covered in Class 6 or 7 History textbooks in India (often within the chapter on Early Civilizations or Indus Valley Civilization). By Class 8, it might have been reviewed, but it's not newly introduced content. Students would need to have specific details about *urban planning* aspects stored in their memory.

    *   **Language Demands:**
        *   "Describe": This is a fairly straightforward command verb, common in exams.
        *   "one key feature": This simplifies the task – they only need to provide *one* rather than multiple, and "key" implies something important, not a trivial detail.
        *   "Harappan Civilization's urban planning": These are specific, identifiable terms that should have been taught. "Urban planning" might be the most abstract term, but in the context of Harappa, it directly refers to their unique city structures.
        *   *Comparison to other questions:*
            *   "Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi": "Explain how... affected" is a more complex causal reasoning task. "Tribal communities" might be specific knowledge.
            *   "Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes? Explain": "Why" demands reasoning and specific cultural/historical knowledge (Ashoka's symbolism).
            *   "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign...": "Significance" and "reign" are abstract terms, requiring synthesis and understanding of long-term impact.

        *   The language here is considerably *less* demanding than the "difficult" example questions. It's direct and avoids complex sentence structures or highly abstract concepts.

    *   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?** This is primarily **recall**. Students are expected to remember factual information about Harappan urban planning. There's no application to a new scenario or complex reasoning required.

    *   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
        *   This is a very common type of recall question found at the end of chapters or in comprehension exercises about ancient civilizations. Textbooks often list "Features of Harappan Cities" or "Town Planning of Harappa" explicitly.
        *   The open-ended nature ("one key feature") gives some flexibility, which can be easier than a multiple-choice question where distractors might be confusing.

**Analysis of Difficulty vs. Common Errors:**

*   **Compared to "Explain how colonial rule..." (9% pass rate):** This question is *much* easier. The colonial rule question requires understanding of cause-and-effect over time, impact on a specific social group, and synthesis of historical information. The Harappan question is a direct fact recall.
*   **Compared to "Why are lions shown..." (10% pass rate):** Again, easier. The lion question demands knowledge of symbolism, specific historical figures (Ashoka), and the ability to explain "why." The Harappan question is just "what."
*   **Compared to "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign..." (12% pass rate):** Easier. "Significance" requires evaluative judgment and synthesis of various achievements/policies, which is a higher-order thinking skill than simply recalling a feature.

**Factors mitigating difficulty for this specific question:**

*   **Clear target:** "one key feature" and "urban planning" narrow down the possible answers considerably.
*   **Multiple correct answers:** The rubric allows for grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, or citadel/lower town. This increases the chances of a student remembering *any* one correct detail.
*   **Common textbook topic:** The Harappan Civilization, especially its urban planning, is a universally emphasized topic in Indian history curricula. It's often highlighted with diagrams and specific bullet points.

**Factors contributing to difficulty:**

*   **Reliance on recall:** If a student hasn't studied this chapter well, or if a significant amount of time has passed since it was covered, recall will be difficult.
*   **Limited English proficiency:** While the terms are simple, for students struggling with basic English, even "describe" or "feature" could be minor hurdles. However, "urban planning" likely corresponds closely to taught Hindi/local language terms for city construction.
*   **Overall exam context:** If the average pass rate for Social Science is 29%, it suggests a significant baseline difficulty for students in this demographic and schooling environment. The prevalence of "Empty Response" errors on other questions indicates general academic struggle, lack
