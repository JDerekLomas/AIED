Let's break down the question "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away." to estimate the proportion of Class 7 students in Indian government schools who would answer it correctly.

### Contrastive Analysis

**What prior knowledge is assumed?**

*   **Understanding of English Sentence Structure:** Students need to grasp Subject-Verb-Object relationships.
*   **Knowledge of Verbs and Tenses:** Specifically, recognizing the past simple tense ("blew") and knowing its past participle form ("blown").
*   **Concept of Voice:** Students need to have been *taught* active and passive voice. This is typically introduced in Class 6 or 7, but mastery varies greatly. Many will have only a superficial understanding.
*   **Preposition "by":** Understanding its role in attributing agency in passive voice.

**What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**

*   **Understanding "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice":** These are grammatical terms that, even if taught, can be challenging to grasp conceptually, especially if explained primarily in English to students whose first language is not English. If the instruction was in Hindi, they might connect the terms but struggle with application.
*   **Vocabulary:** "Wind," "blew," "leaves," "away" are relatively common words and should generally be understood. "Change" and "sentence" are also common.
*   **Syntactic Transformation:** The core task requires them to re-arrange sentence elements and change the verb form, which is a significant cognitive load for students with limited proficiency. It's not just understanding words, but manipulating grammatical structures.

**Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

*   **Application:** It's not just recalling the *definition* of active/passive voice. Students need to *apply* the rules of transformation to a specific sentence. This involves identifying the object, making it the new subject, changing the verb form (auxiliary + past participle), and often adding "by + agent."
*   **Some Recall:** Recalling the specific rules for forming passive voice, especially for the past simple tense.
*   **Minimal Reasoning:** While there's an element of procedural application, complex analytical reasoning is not the primary demand.

**How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Similar in form to textbook exercises:** This exact type of question (converting a single sentence from active to passive voice) is a very common textbook exercise after the topic has been introduced.
*   **Relatively straightforward example:** "The wind blew the leaves away" is a canonical SVO sentence. There are no tricky direct/indirect objects, phrasal verbs that complicate things, or unusual tenses.
*   **Higher-order than simple recall:** It's more demanding than filling in a blank with a correct word, but less demanding than writing a descriptive paragraph (which many failed at significantly in the common errors).
*   **Crucial dependency on direct instruction:** If this specific grammatical concept (active/passive voice transformation) was thoroughly taught and practiced in their Class 6 or 7 curriculum, some students will have a working knowledge. If it was rushed or poorly explained, very few will get it right.

### Common Errors Observed on This Exam vs. This Question

The common errors provided for other questions are highly revealing:

*   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%)**: This required abstract thinking and sophisticated understanding of literary analysis terminology, which is clearly beyond most students' English level. The responses like "I am reading" show a complete disconnect.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem..." (pass rate: 5%)**: Similar to the above, requiring high-level comprehension and abstract conceptualization, coupled with extended writing skills. The response "The last bargin they about a child and labour..." indicates some content understanding but a severe lack of grammatical structure.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'" (pass rate: 10%)**: This required structured writing and generation of ideas. The errors ("My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho", "My hobby is cricket play") indicate very basic sentence construction issues, fragmented ideas, and a lack of grammatical accuracy, even on a familiar topic.

**Comparison:**

The active/passive voice question is **different** from the very low-pass-rate questions above. It does not require:

*   Abstract literary analysis.
*   Deep inferential reasoning beyond the explicit sentence structure.
*   Extended paragraph writing or idea generation.
*   Sophisticated vocabulary or idiomatic expressions.

Instead, it primarily requires the **application of a specific grammatical rule set**. If that rule set was taught adequately, some students *can* get it. However, the existing evidence from common errors suggests
