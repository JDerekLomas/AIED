Let's break down the question "Describes the poet's writing style" for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and common error patterns.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **What prior knowledge is assumed?**
    *   **Literary Concepts:** This question *assumes* students have encountered and understand the concept of a "writing style." They need to know that authors have distinct ways of writing, and these can be characterized by adjectives. This is a foundational concept in literary analysis, usually introduced and developed across several grades. For students mostly from rote-learning backgrounds, this conceptual understanding might be weak or absent, especially if literary analysis isn't a strong focus in their curriculum.
    *   **Vocabulary:** They need to know common adjectives used to describe writing (e.g., simple, descriptive, informal, direct, clear, complex, lyrical, narrative). This vocabulary is relatively advanced for students with limited English proficiency.
    *   **Poem Content:** The question *implicitly* assumes they have read and understood a specific poem whose writing style they are meant to describe. Without the poem, the question is unanswerable, even if they understand "writing style."

2.  **What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
    *   **Abstract Noun:** "Writing style" is an abstract concept, more difficult to grasp than concrete nouns or simple verbs.
    *   **"Describes":** This verb itself might be understood in a very literal, basic sense ("tell me about it") rather than "characterize" or "label."
    *   **Expressing Abstract Ideas:** Even if they *understand* the concept in their native language (Hindi), formulating an appropriate answer in English requires a specific, relatively advanced vocabulary and sentence structure to convey an abstract idea. The common error "I am reading" suggests a complete misunderstanding of the prompt, possibly interpreting "describes" as "what are you doing with the poem?" or a general instruction to engage with it.
    *   **Lack of Scaffolding:** There are no sentence starters or simpler options provided, which increases the linguistic load.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** and **reasoning**.
        *   **Reasoning:** Students need to analyze the poem, identify recurring linguistic features, and infer a broader characteristic.
        *   **Application:** They then need to apply appropriate descriptive vocabulary to summarize their reasoning.
    *   It's *not* simple recall of facts.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Much harder.** Typical textbook exercises for Class 7 in these contexts often focus on:
        *   Literal comprehension (Who, What, When, Where).
        *   Vocabulary matching/fill-in-the-blanks.
        *   Simple grammar drills.
        *   Recalling lines from the poem or factual information from a prose passage.
        *   The common errors listed ("I am reading", "Empty Response") are typical of students struggling even with basic comprehension of English questions beyond factual recall or simple tasks. The high pass rate for paragraph writing (10%) shows they can produce *some* English when the topic is concrete and personal, even if ungrammatical. Abstract analysis like "writing style" is a significant leap.

**Analysis of Common Errors Provided:**

*   **"Q: 'Describes the poet’s writing style.'" (pass rate: 4%)**
    *   **"Wrong answer: 'I am reading.'"** This is critical. It indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the question. The student is likely latching onto keywords (poet, writing, style) and either misinterpreting "describes" or simply feeling lost and resorting to a default English phrase they know. It suggests they don't grasp the analytical demand.
    *   **"Wrong answer: 'Empty Response'"**: This confirms students either don't understand the question or don't know how to formulate an answer in English, even if they vaguely grasp the concept.

**Conclusion based on analysis:**

This question is extremely challenging for this demographic.
*   The concept of "writing style" is abstract and requires analytical skills beyond simple comprehension or recall.
*   The vocabulary needed to answer correctly is advanced for their limited English proficiency.
*   The "I am reading" error strongly suggests a profound misinterpretation of the task's analytical demand.
*   Compared to a 10% pass rate for a "My Favourite Hobby" paragraph (which is concrete and personal), this abstract literary analysis is several levels higher in difficulty.
*   The overall exam pass rate of 29% for general items means this particular item is likely far below that average, which the given
