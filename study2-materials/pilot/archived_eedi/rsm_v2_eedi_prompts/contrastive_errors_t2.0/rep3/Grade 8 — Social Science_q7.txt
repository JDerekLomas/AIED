Here's a detailed analysis and estimation for the given question:

## Contrastive Analysis: "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Difficulty Level: Medium-High**
    *   **Specific event recognition:** Students need to know "Battle of Plassey" and its date "1757". This is a key historical event, so it's likely taught, but recall of *both* might be challenging for some.
    *   **Causality:** Understanding that a specific event can *contribute* to *expansion* of power requires basic causal reasoning in history.
    *   **British expansion in India:** This implies knowledge of the broader historical context of British colonization.
    *   **Basic understanding of political dominance/control:** Students need to grasp what it means for one power to gain control over another, even if expressed simply (e.g., "they became strong").
    *   **Specific outcome of Plassey:** The most direct answer requires knowing about Mir Jafar becoming a puppet ruler, or simply that British control over Bengal began.

**2. Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**

*   **Difficulty Level: Medium**
    *   **Keywords:** "Battle of Plassey," "contribute to," "expansion," "British power," "India." These are relatively straightforward historical terms. "Contribute to" might be a slight stretch, but its meaning should be decipherable in context.
    *   **Sentence structure:** The question uses a clear, direct interrogative sentence structure.
    *   **Expected answer complexity:** The rubric allows for a relatively simple explanation ("establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal"). This means students don't need complex grammatical structures to convey the core idea.
    *   **Common error observation:** The observed "Empty Response" for other questions suggests a significant number of students might struggle with formulating *any* coherent English response, regardless of content knowledge. Even simple English output is a hurdle.

**3. Is this Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   **Difficulty Level: Low-Medium**
    *   **Primarily Recall:** It's largely a recall question. Students are expected to have learned about the Battle of Plassey and its direct consequences.
    *   **Simple Reasoning/Connection:** There's a minimal element of connecting the event (Plassey) to its outcome (expansion of British power). It's not just "What was the Battle of Plassey?" but "How did it contribute?" This requires articulating the *link*, not just defining the event. However, this is a very direct link explicitly taught in textbooks.
    *   **Not application or complex reasoning:** It doesn't require applying a concept to a new scenario or critically evaluating historical arguments.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Difficulty Level: Medium**
    *   **Typical:** This is a very common type of question found at the end of a chapter on British expansion in India. Textbooks routinely highlight Plassey as a turning point.
    *   **Specific details:** The rubric asks for the *consequence* (political dominance over Bengal, puppet nawab). This is the key takeaway taught.
    *   **Compared to other examples:**
        *   "Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi" (Pass rate 9%) - This is much harder. It requires detailed understanding of *impact* (multiple effects, social/economic implications) rather than a direct political consequence. It's more analytical and requires synthesising information.
        *   "Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes? Explain" (Pass rate 10%) - This is knowledge-based but potentially obscure or not emphasized in standard history texts for Class 8 (it relates to Ashoka's pillar, which they may learn about but not necessarily its currency application).
        *   "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign in Indian history, mentioning at leas" (Pass rate 12%) - This is similar in type (historical significance/contribution) but "significance" often implies broader, multiple impacts, whereas Plassey's contribution is very direct. Ashoka's reign has multiple facets, making it harder to synthesize a complete answer compared to the direct consequence of Plassey.

**Summary of Relative Difficulty for THIS question:**

*   **Strengths:** Direct question, very central historical event, core consequence explicitly taught, rubric allows for relatively simple phrasing. Less analytical than the "tribal communities" question, and less obscure/indirect than the "currency notes" question.
*   **Weaknesses:** Relies on recall of a specific date and event, and linking it to a specific political outcome
