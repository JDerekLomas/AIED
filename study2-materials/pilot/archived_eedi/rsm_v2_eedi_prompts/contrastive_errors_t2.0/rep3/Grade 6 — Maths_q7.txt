Here's a contrastive analysis of the question, focusing on its suitability for Class 6 Indian government school students from EWS backgrounds:

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Number Operations:**
    *   Addition of two-digit numbers (30 + 12 = 42).
    *   Multiplication of single-digit numbers (6 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 12 degrees).
*   **Time:**
    *   Understanding of "am" and "pm".
    *   Ability to calculate elapsed time between two given times within the same day (10:00 am to 4:00 pm). This involves understanding a 12-hour clock cycle.
*   **Temperature:**
    *   Basic understanding of temperature units (`^0 C`).
    *   Understanding that "increases by" means addition.
*   **Context:** While the Jodhpur context is geographically relevant, it doesn't add complexity beyond a simple location marker.

**2. Language Demands (English):**

*   **Vocabulary:**
    *   "temperature": A common science term, likely encountered in primary science or everyday conversation even in Hindi-medium contexts, though "taapman" is the Hindi equivalent.
    *   "increases by": Key phrase for mathematical operation (addition). "Badhta hai" in Hindi.
    *   "per hour": Crucial for understanding the rate. "Prati ghanta" in Hindi.
    *   "morning", "evening": Standard time vocabulary.
*   **Sentence Structure:**
    *   The question uses relatively straightforward declarative sentences and a direct interrogative.
    *   "At 10 am in the morning..." and "...at 4:00 in the evening?" These phrases indicate specific points in time.
    *   "If the temperature increases by 2^0 C per hour, then what will be the temperature..." - This conditional structure links the rate to the final outcome.
*   **Impact on EWS students:** For students with limited English proficiency, deciphering "increases by" and "per hour" might be the biggest hurdle. While "per hour" is often understood implicitly with rate problems, explicitly knowing what "per" means can be an issue. They might recognize the numbers and the word "temperature" but struggle to correctly set up the calculation due to linguistic barriers. If similar problems have been taught in Hindi, they might connect the structure, but the direct translation requirement adds cognitive load.

**3. Type of Task (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**

*   **Application:** This is primarily an application problem.
    *   Students need to apply their knowledge of time calculation (elapsed time).
    *   They need to apply their understanding of rates (temperature change per hour).
    *   They need to apply basic arithmetic operations (multiplication and addition) to solve a multi-step problem in a real-world context.
*   It is not simple recall (like "What is 30+12?").
*   While it requires logical steps, the "reasoning" component is at the level of understanding cause-and-effect (temperature increase over time) rather than abstract, complex reasoning or problem-solving with multiple unknown variables.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises (Class 6 Indian Textbooks):**

*   **Comparable Complexity:** This question's mathematical complexity is generally aligned with Class 6 word problems. Students would be learning about time, basic rates, and multi-step word problems involving multiplication and addition.
*   **Multi-step:** The question requires two main steps:
    1.  Calculate elapsed time (10 am to 4 pm).
    2.  Calculate total temperature increase and add it to the initial temperature.
*   **Real-world context:** Such problems (e.g., bus travel time, money spent per day, etc.) are common in Indian textbooks to make math relatable.
*   **Key challenge point:** The main difficulty for this *specific student demographic* lies more in the English language comprehension of key operational phrases ("increases by," "per hour") and accurately calculating elapsed time spanning across noon/midday than the core arithmetic operations themselves.
    *   Calculating 10 am to 4 pm: This requires understanding the 12-hour clock (10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 = 6 hours). Some might make a mistake and count only up to 3 hours, or miscalculate by simply subtracting (4-10).
    *   If the question were asked in Hindi, the mathematical content would likely be considered moderate difficulty. The English significantly elevates it.
