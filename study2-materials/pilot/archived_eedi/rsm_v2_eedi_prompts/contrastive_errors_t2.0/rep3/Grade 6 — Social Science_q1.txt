Here's a breakdown of the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" and a comparison with typical Class 6 Social Science content and the common errors observed:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   **Assumed:** Basic geographical knowledge of India's major physical features, specifically mountain ranges. Students would likely have covered a chapter on the physical features of India, where mountain ranges are a prominent topic.
    *   **Compared to other questions:** This question's assumed knowledge is more direct and factual recall than the analytical demands of "Explain how colonial rule..." or the more nuanced historical context of "Why are lions shown..." or "Ashoka's reign...". It's a fundamental geographic fact.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Limited English:**
        *   "Name any two": Simple, direct instruction.
        *   "major mountain ranges": "Major" is a common and fairly easy word to understand in this context. "Mountain ranges" is a core vocabulary term for geography that students would encounter repeatedly.
        *   "located in India": Clearly specifies the geographic scope.
    *   **Compared to other questions:** The language is significantly simpler and more accessible. Questions like "Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi" involve more complex vocabulary ("colonial rule," "affected," "tribal communities") and a demand for explanation (a higher-order thinking skill). Even "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign..." requires understanding "significance" and "reign." This question is largely a vocabulary/factual recall test.

*   **Type of Cognitive Task:**
    *   **Recall:** This is almost purely a recall question. Students simply need to retrieve two names from memory.
    *   **Compared to other questions:** All the example difficult questions demand explanation, analysis, or historical context ("Explain how," "Why explain," "Explain the significance"). This question is much lower on Bloom's taxonomy.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question is extremely common in Class 6 geography chapters. Textbook exercises often include "List two major mountain ranges" or "Identify the mountain ranges on the map." It's a foundational piece of information.
    *   The rubric requiring only *one* correct name for a partial score further reduces the hurdle for obtaining points.

**Reasons for Potential Success:**

*   **Direct Factual Recall:** Geography, particularly physical features, is often taught through memorization and visual aids (maps) in Indian schools. Names of prominent features like the Himalayas are introduced very early.
*   **Simple Language:** The low linguistic barrier makes the question understandable even for students with limited English.
*   **Fundamental Topic:** "Mountain ranges of India" is a core, unavoidable topic in Class 6 geography.
*   **Likely Repetition:** Teachers often repeat such facts and test them frequently.
*   **Visual Reinforcement:** Maps depicting these ranges are standard in classrooms and textbooks.
*   **Ubiquity of the Himalayas:** "Himalayas" is such an iconic and nationally significant feature that it's highly likely most students will know it, providing at least half the answer or satisfying the rubric for 0.5 points with just one name. The Aravallis are also often emphasized for being among the oldest.

**Reasons for Potential Difficulty (Though Less Significant Here):**

*   **"Empty Response":** While the question is easy, some students might still leave it blank if they don't know *any* names or misunderstand the instruction. However, the directness minimizes this.
*   **Incorrect Names/Spellings:** Students might attempt a name but spell it incorrectly or provide an unrelated geographic feature (e.g., a river, a plain) if their foundational knowledge is weak. However, even a partially correct or phonetically recognizable spelling of a known range might get credit, depending on the human evaluator's interpretation, though the rubric states "Names one correct mountain range."

**Likely Performance Analysis (Considering Common Errors):**

The common errors ("Empty Response," misspellings of historical figures, non-sequiturs) point to either complete lack of knowledge, inability to articulate in English, or genuine confusion/misunderstanding.

For "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India":
*   **English Comprehension:** The simple English makes this less of a barrier compared to "Explain how colonial rule..."
*   **Recall:** Many students will know "Himalayas." This single correct name would satisfy the rubric for a partial score (0.5).
*   **Specific Error Patterns:** "Empty Response" might occur if a student genuinely draws a blank on any mountain name, but for a fundamental geographic feature, this should be less common than for a complex historical explanation. Misspellings
