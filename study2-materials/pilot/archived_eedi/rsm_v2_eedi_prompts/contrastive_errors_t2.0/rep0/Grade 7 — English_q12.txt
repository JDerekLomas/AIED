Let's break down the question "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away." to understand its potential difficulty for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their common English errors and background.

### Contrastive Analysis

**1. What prior knowledge is assumed?**

*   **Understanding of Subject, Verb, Object:** Students need to identify "the wind" (subject), "blew" (verb), and "the leaves" (object). This is fundamental grammar usually taught by Class 7.
*   **Knowledge of verb tenses (specifically Simple Past):** "blew" is the past tense of "blow." They need to recognize this to form the correct past participle.
*   **Concept of "Voice" (Active vs. Passive):** This is the core concept being tested. Students need to have been explicitly taught what active and passive voice are, their structures, and the rules for transformation. This is typically introduced around Class 6 or 7.
*   **Knowledge of Irregular Verbs (blow-blew-blown):** Crucially, "blow" is an irregular verb. Students must know its past participle form "blown." This is a significant hurdle.
*   **Prepositions:** They need to use "by" correctly when introducing the agent in the passive voice.

**2. What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**

*   **Grammatical Terminology:** The terms "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" themselves can be barriers if not thoroughly understood and frequently practiced. These are abstract grammatical concepts.
*   **Vocabulary:** "Wind," "blew," "leaves," "away" are relatively common words for Class 7. The main vocabulary challenge comes from the grammatical terms.
*   **Sentence Structure Manipulation:** This isn't just about understanding words; it requires rearranging sentence elements, changing verb forms, and adding prepositions according to specific rules. This is a higher-order language skill than just reading comprehension or simple sentence formation.
*   **Abstract Rule Application:** It's not about memorizing a phrase but applying a set of grammatical rules to a given sentence. This demands a deeper understanding than rote learning.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

*   **Application:** Primarily application. Students need to recall the rules of active-passive voice transformation (rules are taught/recalled), but then apply them correctly to a *new* sentence.
*   **Recall (of irregular verbs):** There's an element of recall for the past participle "blown."

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Typical Textbook Exercises:** English grammar textbooks for Class 7 often include dedicated chapters on Active and Passive Voice. They usually start with simpler sentences, frequently with regular verbs first, then move to irregular verbs.
*   **Level of Difficulty:** This sentence ("The wind blew the leaves away") is fairly standard for a mid-level active-passive transformation exercise for Class 7. It's not the easiest (e.g., "She eats apples.") but also not the most complex (e.g., involving modal verbs, perfect tenses, or compound sentences).
*   **Crucial Challenge: Irregular Verb:** The use of "blew" (irregular verb) significantly increases the difficulty compared to "He kicked the ball" (regular verb). Knowing "blown" is often a stumbling block.
*   **Common Pitfalls:**
    *   Failing to change the verb form (e.g., "The leaves blow away by the wind").
    *   Incorrect auxiliary verb (e.g., "The leaves *are* blown away..." instead of "were"). This requires understanding past tense.
    *   Not using the past participle (e.g., "The leaves were blew away...").
    *   Incorrect subject-verb agreement in passive voice (less likely here as "leaves" is plural).
    *   Missing "by the wind" or incorrect preposition.
    *   Incorrect word order.

### Comparing with Common Errors:

*   **"Describes the poet's writing style." (pass rate: 4%)**: This is an abstract, higher-order reasoning question requiring analytical English expression. Our active-passive question is a direct grammatical transformation. It's less abstract, but demands precise rule application. The pass rate for that question highlights how difficult expressing *complex ideas* in English is for these students.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (pass rate: 5%)**: Similar to the above, this requires interpretive and analytical writing. Again, our question is about grammatical mechanics, not literary analysis. The low pass rate indicates general weakness in written expression and critical thinking in English.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby
