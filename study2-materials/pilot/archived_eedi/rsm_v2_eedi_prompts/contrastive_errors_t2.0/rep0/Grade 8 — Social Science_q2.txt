Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis: "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Basic understanding of Ancient Indian History:** Students are expected to have been introduced to the Harappan Civilization (also known as Indus Valley Civilization) in their Social Science curriculum, likely in Class 6 or 7, and possibly reviewed in Class 8. This topic is fundamental to early Indian history.
*   **Concept of "urban planning":** They need to understand what this term generally means in the context of a historical civilization. This is usually explained when discussing ancient cities.

**Language Demands:**
*   **"Describe one key feature":** This is a relatively straightforward directive. "Describe" is a common instructional verb. "Key feature" indicates a main characteristic.
*   **"Harappan Civilization's urban planning":** The specific terminology might be a challenge if they haven't seen "Harappan" in English, or if their instruction was solely in Hindi. However, "civilization" and "urban planning" are likely concepts they've encountered. The name "Harappan Civilization" is relatively unique and generally not confusable with other historical terms once taught.
*   **Low complex sentence structure needed for answer:** A simple, direct sentence can satisfy the rubric, e.g., "The cities had a good drainage system." or "The streets were built in a grid pattern." This reduces the burden of complex English grammar.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
*   **Primarily Recall:** This question is almost entirely recall. Students are expected to remember factual details about the Harappan Civilization that they would have been taught in their textbooks. There's very little application or higher-order reasoning required beyond remembering and stating a fact.

**Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   **Very common type of question:** "Describe features of..." or "List characteristics of..." are staple questions for history topics, especially for ancient civilizations.
*   **Focus on 'key feature':** Textbooks and teachers frequently highlight features like the drainage system or grid layout as distinct aspects of Harappan cities. This makes them relatively memorable points.
*   **Accessibility of multiple correct answers:** The rubric lists several distinct correct answers (grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town). This significantly increases the chances a student might recall at least one. Other Social Science questions (like the "Why lions on currency?") often have only one highly specific correct answer.

**Contrast with "COMMON ERRORS" Questions:**

*   **"Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi" (pass rate: 9%)**
    *   This question requires explaining a *process* and its *impacts*, not just recalling facts. It's more complex conceptually and requires synthesis and potentially multi-part answers. The answer needs to show an understanding of cause-and-effect. "Empty Response" suggests students don't know *what* to explain or how to structure the explanation.
*   **"Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes? Explain" (pass rate: 10%)**
    *   This asks for the *reason* behind a specific symbol, linking it to Ashoka. While recall, it's a very specific piece of information and might not be taught with the same emphasis as "urban planning." The incorrect answers ("Asher' stand", "Ashok a second") show students vaguely associate it with Ashoka but can't articulate the connection (Ashoka Chakra/pillar, its significance).
*   **"Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign in Indian history, mentioning at leas" (pass rate: 12%)**
    *   Again, this asks for *significance*, which is a higher-order concept than mere description. It requires understanding the impact and lasting importance of a reign, not just recounting events. "Empty Response" again points to a lack of understanding of "significance" or the historical details themselves.

**Why the Harappan question is comparatively easier:**

*   **Direct factual recall:** Unlike "explain," "why," or "significance," "describe" is less demanding conceptually.
*   **High probability of taught content:** Harappan urban planning is a universally taught and emphasized aspect of this civilization.
*   **Multiple entry points for correct answers:** Having multiple key features that are considered correct means students only need to remember *one* to score.
*   **Simpler English structure for answers:** A basic descriptive sentence suffices.
*   **Less room for misinterpretation of the question itself:** The question is quite literal.

**Considering factors specific to Class 8 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections, with limited English:**

*   Even if taught in
