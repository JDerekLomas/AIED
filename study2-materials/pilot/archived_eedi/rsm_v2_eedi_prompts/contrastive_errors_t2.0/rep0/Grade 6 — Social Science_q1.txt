Let's break down the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering the provided context.

### Contrastive Analysis

**1. What prior knowledge is assumed?**

*   **Geographical Awareness:** Students are assumed to have a basic understanding of India's geography, specifically the concept of mountain ranges and the names of major ones within their country.
*   **National Focus:** This question is specifically about India, which aligns with the curriculum focus at this level (understanding one's own country).
*   **Simple Identification:** It requires recall of names rather than complex geographical processes or analysis.

**2. What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**

*   **Key Terms:**
    *   "Name": A very common and simple verb.
    *   "any two": Clear quantitative instruction.
    *   "major": While nuanced, its meaning here is generally understood in context (not minor hills).
    *   "mountain ranges": This is the crucial phrase. Even with limited English, "mountain" is often recognized, and "ranges" might be inferable in context, especially if accompanied by a picture or map study in class.
    *   "located in India": Clearly specifies the geographical scope.
*   **Sentence Structure:** Simple, direct question.
*   **Response Type:** Requires a short, specific recall (names).
*   **Contrast with Other Questions:**
    *   Much simpler language than "Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi..." which demands understanding abstract concepts, cause-and-effect, and expressive writing.
    *   Simpler than "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign..." which uses more complex historical vocabulary ("significance," "reign").
    *   "Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes? Explain" demands inferential reasoning and more elaborate explanation, while "mountain ranges" is a direct fact recall.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

*   **Primarily Recall:** This is a direct knowledge recall question. Students either know the names of mountain ranges in India or they don't.
*   **Minimal Application/Reasoning:** There's no application of geographical principles or complex reasoning involved. It's a memory test for factual information.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Core Curriculum:** Naming major physical features of India (mountains, rivers, plateaus) is a fundamental part of Class 6 Social Science/Geography curriculum in India. Textbooks heavily cover this.
*   **Direct & Expected:** Questions like "Name two mountain ranges" or "List major rivers" are very common end-of-chapter or revision exercises.
*   **Likely Covered Visually:** Geography lessons often use maps extensively, making visual association with names strong for many students. This could aid recall even for students struggling with written English.
*   **Simpler than analytical or explanation-based questions** found in typical exercises (e.g., "Describe the climate of the Thar Desert" would be harder).

### Factors Influencing Difficulty:

*   **Ease (compared to other examples):**
    *   **Direct Factual Recall:** No complex explanation, inference, or historical narrative required.
    *   **Common Geography Topic:** Physical features of India are core to the curriculum.
    *   **Clear Language:** The question's English, while present, is fairly straightforward and uses common geographical terms (even if "ranges" might be less common than "mountain").
    *   **Multiple Correct Answers:** Students have several options (Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats).
    *   **Partial Credit (0.5 max score):** Students only need *one* correct answer to get the maximum possible score (assuming the full score for two correct is 1, and for one correct is 0.5 as per the rubric). This significantly lowers the bar for getting *some* credit.
*   **Hardness (compared to other examples):**
    *   **English Medium Exam:** For students primarily from Hindi-medium schools, even simple English can be a barrier. However, "mountain" and common range names are likely encountered.
    *   **Memory vs. Understanding:** Pure rote memory, if not backed by visual learning or deeper understanding, can be fragile.
    *   **Possible Misinterpretation of "major":** Though unlikely to prevent giving *any* answer, some might overthink this.
    *   **Limited Exposure/Quality of Teaching:** If the specific geography units were poorly taught, or resources like maps were scarce, even a basic question like this could suffer.
