Let's break down the question "Define fable" for Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis of "Define fable"**

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Concept of "fable":** This is the core knowledge required. Many Class 8 textbooks (even Hindi-medium ones) will likely introduce the concept of fables as part of literature or moral science. Students will probably have encountered several examples of fables (e.g., *The Thirsty Crow*, *The Hare and the Tortoise*) either in English or their vernacular language, even if they don't explicitly know the English word "fable" for the genre.
*   **Vocabulary for defining:** Students need to be able to access words like "short story," "animals," "characters," "moral lesson," "teach," etc., in English.
*   **Understanding "define":** Students need to grasp that "define" means to give the meaning or explanation of a word or concept. This is a common directive in academic settings.

**2. Language Demands for Students with Limited English:**
*   **"Define":** This is a fairly common and straightforward instruction. While not "describes" or "write a theme," it's generally understood.
*   **Target Vocabulary:** The rubric's suggested vocabulary ("short story," "animals," "characters," "moral lesson") contains mostly high-frequency words that Class 8 students should have encountered. "Imparts" might be too advanced for some, but synonyms like "teaches," "gives," or "has" would be acceptable and are more accessible.
*   **Sentence Structure:** Constructing a simple declarative sentence to give a definition (e.g., "A fable is a short story...") is less complex than writing a paragraph or explaining a poet's style.
*   **Compared to other common errors:**
    *   **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%)**: This is much harder. "Describes," "poet's," "writing style" are all abstract and complex. It requires higher-order analytical skills and specialized vocabulary. The *type* of expected response (analysis) is also challenging. "I am reading" suggests a complete misunderstanding of the prompt or its complexity.
    *   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (pass rate: 5%)**: "Theme" and "central idea" are relatively abstract literary terms, and extracting one from a poem, then articulating it in English, is difficult. "The last bargin they about a child and labour..." shows an attempt at identifying a subject but not a refined *theme*.
    *   **"Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby." (pass rate: 10%)**: While "My Favourite Hobby" is a very common topic, the demand for a "short paragraph (4-5 sentences)" and the general struggles with grammar, spelling, and coherence evident in the wrong answers ("My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy" or "My hobby is cricket play") indicate the difficulty of extended English production for these students.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
*   This is primarily **recall** of a definition. While students might draw on examples they know, the task itself is to state the definition, not to analyze a fable or apply the concept.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
*   Defining terms is a very common textbook exercise, usually found at the end of chapters or in glossaries. It's often the most direct form of comprehension check.
*   Most textbooks (even Hindi-medium ones) are likely to present such definitions explicitly. The challenge comes if the *English equivalent* of the vernacular concept has not been clearly established or if the definition itself wasn't directly learned in English.
*   Compared to the examples given with 4-10% pass rates, "Define fable" is significantly easier. It doesn't require inferential reasoning, abstract analysis of style or theme, or sustained paragraph writing. It's a single, fairly concrete piece of information.

**Specific Points that make "Define Fable" Easier:**

*   **Concrete concept:** Fables themselves are simple, usually memorable stories.
*   **Common knowledge:** The concept of stories with animal characters teaching morals is universally understood, even if the English term "fable" is new.
*   **Short answer:** It requires only one or two sentences.
*   **Keywords are relatively accessible:** "Short story," "animals," "moral," "lesson" are generally basic vocabulary.
*   **Less ambiguity in the prompt:** "Define" is straightforward.

**Potential Difficulties:**

*   **Limited English vocabulary:** Students
