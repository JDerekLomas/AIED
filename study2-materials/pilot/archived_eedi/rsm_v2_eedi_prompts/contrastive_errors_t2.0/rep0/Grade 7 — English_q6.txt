Let's break down the question "Describes the poet’s writing style" for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering the context provided.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Implicit:** The student must have read *a* poem by *a* poet to even begin to describe their style. The prompt doesn't refer to a specific poem from the exam, which suggests it might be a general knowledge question, or relies on a recently read text. Assuming it's linked to a text they've just encountered within the exam, they would need some basic understanding of the *content* of that poem.
    *   **Conceptual:** A foundational understanding of what "writing style" means. This is a relatively abstract concept. Do students at this level routinely analyze "style" or are they primarily focused on comprehension of the plot/surface meaning? Based on the example of common errors, their understanding of English *vocabulary* is limited, making abstract concepts harder. They need to understand what "poet" means.
    *   **Vocabulary:** Understanding "describes," "poet's," and "writing style." "Style" itself might be known in other contexts (e.g., fashion style) but "writing style" is more academic.

2.  **Language Demands for Limited English Proficiency:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** As noted above, "describes" and "writing style" are the key terms. "Poet" might be recognized. The examples of common errors strongly suggest limited vocabulary beyond very basic functional English.
    *   **Syntactic Complexity:** The sentence "Describes the poet’s writing style" is grammatically simple (verb + noun phrase), but the *concept* embedded within the noun phrase "writing style" is complex. It's a prompt, not a question ("Describe..."). This isn't inherently more difficult than a "Why?" or "How?" question, but the abstract nature of the answer is problematic.
    *   **Open-endedness:** This is a very open-ended question. Students need to *generate* an appropriate descriptive word. This requires not only understanding the prompt but also having a relevant vocabulary ready. The rubric lists words like "simple, descriptive, informal, direct." These are not typically among the first words an L2 learner would acquire unless specifically taught for literary analysis.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application** and **Reasoning**. It's not recall (they don't recall a specific phrase about a poet's style).
    *   It requires applying an understanding of the poet's work (if one was provided) and reasoning to abstract a stylistic element, then articulating it.
    *   The alternative, if no poem was given, is even harder: general knowledge about "what a poet's style can be like," which would involve high-level reasoning and generalization.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 7 English textbook exercises often focus on:
        *   Reading comprehension (answering explicit questions about a text).
        *   Vocabulary building (matching words, fill in the blanks).
        *   Grammar (tenses, parts of speech).
        *   Basic writing tasks (simple paragraphs, short descriptions of concrete things).
    *   Analyzing "writing style" is typically introduced later or is a more advanced activity. It moves beyond "what happened" or "who said what" to "how it was said." This makes it significantly **harder** than typical textbook exercises for this demographic.
    *   The examples of low pass rates on other questions ('poet's writing style', 'theme or central idea', 'My Favourite Hobby' resulting in concrete descriptions of *games* instead of hobby itself) indicate a struggle with abstract concepts, generating sentences, and staying on topic. The "writing style" question exemplifies this abstract difficulty.

**Specific Difficulties for THIS question based on context:**

*   **Abstractness of "writing style":** This is the single biggest barrier. For students used to concrete questions (e.g., "What did the child do?"), asking for an abstract quality of *how* something is written is a major leap.
*   **Lack of Specific Referent (implied):** If the poem wasn't presented right before the question, students might not know *which* poet. Even if it was, identifying "style" requires focused attention beyond understanding the narrative.
*   **Vocabulary to articulate style:** Even if a student *understood* a poet's style intuitively (e.g., "It's simple"), they might lack the English vocabulary to express it ("simple," "direct," etc.).
*   **Exam Mindset:** The low pass rates and "Empty
