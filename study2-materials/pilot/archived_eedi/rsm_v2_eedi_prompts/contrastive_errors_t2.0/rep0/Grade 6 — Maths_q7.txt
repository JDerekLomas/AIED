Here's a contrastive analysis of the question, focusing on its suitability for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, followed by an estimate of the proportion correct.

**Contrastive Analysis**

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Positive Integer Operations:** Students need to be comfortable with addition and multiplication of small positive integers. (Strong)
*   **Time Calculation (Duration):** Students need to understand how to calculate the difference between two times, crossing AM/PM boundaries. Specifically, calculating the number of hours elapsed from 10 AM to 4 PM. (Moderate difficulty)
*   **Units (Temperature, Time):** Basic understanding of $^0 C$ for temperature and "per hour" for rate. (Strong)
*   **Contextual Understanding:** Real-world problem involving temperature changes. (Strong)

**2. Language Demands (English):**

*   **"At 10 am in the morning..."**: Relatively straightforward time expression.
*   **"...temperature of Jodhpur was 30^0 C."**: Clear statement of initial condition.
*   **"If the temperature increases by 2^0 C per hour..."**:
    *   **"increases by"**: Key phrase indicating addition.
    *   **"per hour"**: Key phrase indicating multiplication (or repeated addition). This phrasing is crucial for understanding the rate of change.
*   **"...then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?"**: Clear question, specifies target time.
*   **Vocabulary:** "temperature," "increases," "per hour," "morning," "evening." These are common terms taught in primary school.
*   **Overall:** The language is quite direct and uses relatively simple sentence structures. The key phrases "increases by" and "per hour" are critical but common in mathematical word problems at this level. Students who struggle with English might misinterpret "per hour" if they lack familiarity with this common phrasing for rates. However, in mathematics, this phrase is quite standard even in local languages.

**3. Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   **Recall:** Students need to recall how to perform basic addition and multiplication. They also need to recall the structure of time (12-hour clock, AM/PM).
*   **Application:** This is primarily an application problem. Students need to apply their knowledge of:
    *   Calculating time duration.
    *   Multiplying a rate by a duration.
    *   Adding an initial value to a calculated change.
*   **Reasoning:** Minimal complex reasoning is required beyond understanding the problem's structure. It's a straightforward "rate x time + initial value" type problem. The main "reasoning" hurdle is the multi-step nature: (1) find time elapsed, (2) find total temperature increase, (3) find final temperature.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Similar Type:** This type of problem (rate of change over time, multi-step calculation) is common in Class 5/6 mathematics textbooks. Temperature problems, profit/loss problems (which are structurally similar, initial value + change), and distance/speed problems are all precursors.
*   **Added Complexity:** The AM/PM transition for calculating time is a minor step that can sometimes trip students up, as it requires moving past noon (12:00 PM). Calculating 10 AM to 4 PM is usually taught: 10 to 11 (1 hour), 11 to 12 (1 hour), 12 to 1 (1 hour), 1 to 2 (1 hour), 2 to 3 (1 hour), 3 to 4 (1 hour). Total 6 hours. Alternatively, $12-10=2$ hours (till noon) and $4-0=4$ hours (after noon), $2+4=6$ hours. This step, while taught, can be prone to simple errors.
*   **Overall:** It is slightly above a *very basic* recall problem, but firmly within the "application" category that constitutes a significant portion of textbook exercises. It's not a higher-order thinking problem but requires combining a few standard skills. The "per hour" concept might be initially challenging but is covered.

**Specific Points of Difficulty:**

*   **Time Elapsed Calculation:** This is likely the trickiest part for many students. Simple arithmetic errors here will lead to a wrong final answer.
*   **"Per hour" interpretation:** While common, some may struggle to link it directly to multiplication, instead doing repeated addition or misunderstanding its application.
*   **Multi-step nature:** Students need to successfully complete three steps. Missing or incorrectly performing one step leads to the wrong answer.
