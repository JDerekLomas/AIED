## Contrastive Analysis of "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"

Let's break down this question using the provided framework and compare it to the common errors observed.

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Key Event:** Students need to know *what* the Battle of Plassey was (a conflict between the British East India Company and the Nawab of Bengal).
*   **Date:** The date "1757" is provided, which is helpful.
*   **Concept of "Expansion of British Power":** Students need to understand that the British were consolidating and increasing their control in India.
*   **Basic Cause-and-Effect:** Understanding how one historical event can lead to broader political changes.
*   **Political Terms:** Concepts like "political dominance," "control," "nawab," "puppet ruler" (even if not using the exact term "puppet," understanding the idea of British controlling the local ruler).

**2. Language Demands:**

*   **Vocabulary:** "Contribute," "expansion," "dominance," "control," "political" are moderately challenging. "Plassey" and "Bengal" are specific proper nouns.
*   **Sentence Structure:** The question is a straightforward "How did X contribute to Y?" This is a common interrogative structure, but requires understanding the nuance of "contribute."
*   **Recall vs. Synthesis:** While largely recall of a factual consequence, it requires synthesizing the *link* between the battle and the expansion of power. It's not just "Who won?" but "What was the *impact*?"
*   **Comparison to common errors:** The question's language is less abstract or vague than "Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi." It's more direct about a specific event and its consequence. However, students struggle with providing *explanations*, often resorting to empty responses or non-answers.

**3. Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   **Primarily Recall:** The core of the answer comes from memorizing the key consequence of the Battle of Plassey. Textbooks often explicitly state that Plassey marked a turning point, establishing British political supremacy in Bengal.
*   **Some Level of Reasoning/Synthesis (Implicit):** To fully explain "how," students need to connect the dots: British victory -> removal of existing Nawab -> installation of a subservient Nawab (Mir Jafar) -> British gaining financial/administrative control -> this amounts to "expansion of British power." This is usually taught as a direct cause-effect chain.
*   **Not Application:** Not applying a historical principle to a new scenario.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Typical:** This is a *very common* textbook question in Class 8 history sections dealing with the British conquest of India. The Battle of Plassey is a landmark event.
*   **Expected Answer:** Textbooks often highlight that it gave the British control over Bengal's revenues and politics, leading to their subsequent expansion. The "puppet nawab" is a frequently emphasized detail.
*   **Contrast with Error Examples:**
    *   **"Explain how colonial rule...tribal communi":** This is much broader, more analytical, and requires a deeper understanding of social/economic impacts, not just political outcomes of a single event. It's also open to various valid interpretations and examples, making it harder to formulate a concise correct answer, leading to "empty responses."
    *   **"Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes?":** This is a question about cultural symbolism and modern usage, requiring specific knowledge of the Ashoka Pillar's significance in current national identity. It's a slightly different type of historical-cultural knowledge and the *specific* association with currency notes might be tricky. The "Asher' stand" error suggests confusion or lack of clarity.
    *   **"Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign...":** While Ashoka's reign is fundamental, the *significance* (e.g., spread of Buddhism, administration, edicts) is broader and potentially requires listing multiple points or synthesizing ideas, which students struggle with ("Empty Response").

**Analysis for THIS Question's Difficulty:**

This question is **easier than the problematic examples** for several reasons:

*   **Specificity:** It focuses on a single, major event (Battle of Plassey) and its immediate, well-defined political consequence.
*   **Directness:** "How did X contribute to Y?" is a direct causal question, typical of factual recall.
*   **High Salience:** The Battle of Plassey is almost universally covered as a critical turning point in any Class 8 Indian history curriculum. The details of Mir Jafar as a puppet are often emphasized.
*
