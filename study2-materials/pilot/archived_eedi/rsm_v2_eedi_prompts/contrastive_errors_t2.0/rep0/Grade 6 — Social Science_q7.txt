Let's break down the question "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there" to estimate the proportion of Class 6 Indian government school students who would answer it correctly.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Basic understanding of "natural resources":** This is a core concept taught early in Geography/Environmental Science. Class 6 students should have encountered this term and understand what it means.
*   **Geographical knowledge of Rajasthan:** Students are expected to know that Rajasthan is a state in India and have some general idea of its geographical characteristics (e.g., desert, dry climate).
*   **Specific natural resources in Rajasthan:** This is the most demanding prior knowledge. Students need to recall at least two specific resources. Common ones like "water" (due to scarcity) or "sand" (due to desert) might come to mind, but others like minerals (Marble, Copper, Gypsum) might require more specific recall. The inclusion of "Sunlight for solar energy, Wind for wind energy" broadens the possible correct answers.
*   **Relationship between resources and human life:** A basic understanding that resources influence how people live (e.g., water scarcity means a particular lifestyle, agriculture dependent on water, mining creates jobs) is expected.

**Language Demands:**
*   **"Mention any two natural resources":** "Mention" is straightforward. "Natural resources" is a key vocabulary term they should know. "Any two" is clear.
*   **"explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":** "Explain" requires more than just listing. "Influences the lives" is slightly more abstract than simply stating facts, requiring them to connect the resource to daily activities or economic impact. "People there" refers to people in Rajasthan.

**Cognitive Demands (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
*   **Recall:** Naming two natural resources in Rajasthan is primarily recall.
*   **Application/Simple Reasoning:** Explaining the influence requires a basic level of application or reasoning, linking the resource to an effect on human life. For example, if they recall "water," they might link it to agriculture, scarcity leading to difficulties, or a focus on conservation. If they recall "solar energy," they might link it to power generation or specific industries.

**Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises & Overall Difficulty:**

*   **Structure:** This question is fairly typical for Social Science, asking for recall followed by a short explanation/justification.
*   **Content (Resources):** Many Class 6 textbooks would have chapters on different states or natural resources in India, so identifying resources for Rajasthan would be covered.
*   **Difficulty vs. Common Errors:**
    *   **Compared to "Explain how colonial rule...":** This question is *significantly easier*. Colonial rule is a complex historical concept requiring higher-order thinking and abstract understanding of societal impact, which is very difficult for this demographic and contributes to "Empty Responses." This question is concrete and grounded in geography.
    *   **Compared to "Why are lions shown...":** This question is also easier. That question about lions (Ashoka's symbols) is a very specific historical/cultural recall, and the wrong answers suggest a mix-up with names/spellings. "Natural resources" is a broader, more widely applicable concept.
    *   **Compared to "Significance of Ashoka's reign...":** Similar to the colonial rule question, this is abstract history requiring a synthesised understanding, leading to "Empty Response."

**Factors that make it easier:**
1.  **Concrete Subject Matter:** Natural resources are tangible, and Rajasthan's characteristics (desert, dryness) are relatively well-known.
2.  **Multiple Correct Answers for Resources:** The rubric provides a wide range of acceptable resources, increasing the chances a student can name two. Water, sand, and sunlight are particularly accessible.
3.  **Relatively Simple Explanation:** Explaining influence can be basic (e.g., "water for drinking and farming," "sand for building houses," "solar energy for electricity").
4.  **No complex historical context or abstract reasoning required.**

**Factors that make it harder (for this specific group):**
1.  **Limited English Proficiency:** While "mention," "natural resources," "explain," and "influences" are relatively common terms, piecing together a coherent English sentence for the explanation might be challenging. They might know the Hindi equivalent (प्राकृतिक संसाधन - Prakrutik Sansadhan) but struggle with the English translation/expression.
2.  **Recall Specifics for Rajasthan:** While general concepts are easy, specific recall for Rajasthan might still be a hurdle for some.
3.  **"Empty Response" possibility:** Even if they know the answer, the cognitive load of translating and writing it in English can
