Let's break down the question "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away" in the context of Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering the common errors and challenges.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **What prior knowledge is assumed?**
    *   **Grammatical concepts:** A fundamental understanding of verbs, subjects, objects, past tense, and most critically, the *concept* of active and passive voice. This is usually introduced in Class 6 or 7, but mastery is another matter.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "wind," "blew" (past tense of blow), "leaves," "away." These are common words and likely familiar. "Active voice" and "Passive voice" are the technical terms, and their meaning (even if not their specific grammatical rules) needs to be graspable.

2.  **What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
    *   **Understanding instructions:** "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice." This is a highly technical grammatical instruction. If they struggle with general descriptive instructions like "Describe the poet's writing style," they will likely struggle with this.
    *   **Transformational grammar:** This isn't just about understanding a word or writing a sentence. It requires manipulating sentence structure.
    *   **Auxiliary verbs:** The transformation requires using the correct form of "to be" (were) and the past participle of the main verb (blown). This is a common stumbling block.
    *   **Prepositional phrase:** Adding "by the wind" is part of the transformation.
    *   **Syntactic understanding:** The *order* of words changes significantly.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Application:** It's primarily an application question. Students need to *apply* the rules of active-to-passive transformation, not just recall a definition or identify examples.
    *   **Some Recall:** They need to recall the general structure/formula for passive voice (object + be + past participle + by + subject).
    *   **Limited Reasoning:** While understanding the *logic* of why we use passive voice is reasoning, for this type of transformation question, it's mostly formulaic application once the concept is grasped.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Typical but challenging:** This type of question is a standard exercise found in Class 7 English grammar textbooks. However, it's often an item that many students find difficult. While examples are given in textbooks, the ability to *produce* the correct transformation consistently, especially without scaffolding, is not trivial.
    *   **More structured than open-ended:** Unlike writing a paragraph or describing a style, this question has a very specific, single correct answer, which could be *easier* in the sense of eliminating ambiguity if the student knows the rule. However, it's *harder* if the rule is not internalized.

**Comparing with common errors observed:**

*   **"Describes the poet's writing style" (pass rate: 4%)** and **"Write a theme or central idea..." (pass rate: 5%)**: These questions are about comprehension, interpretation, and extended written expression. They require understanding nuances and constructing original responses. The *active/passive voice* question is more mechanical/grammatical. Students performing poorly on comprehension/description often perform equally poorly or worse on complex grammar application.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby" (pass rate: 10%)**: This is writing personal information. Students can sometimes latch onto keywords. The observed errors ("My hobby is cricket play") show struggles with basic sentence structure and appropriate vocabulary/phrasing even for personal topics.
    *   The active/passive question is much more demanding in terms of *grammatical correctness* and *transformation rules*. The "My hobby is cricket play" type error suggests a fundamental difficulty in constructing grammatically sound English sentences, which is critical for transforming voice. If they can't form simple correct sentences, forming a transformed complex sentence is very unlikely.

**Specific Difficulties for this Question:**

*   **Lack of direct keyword mapping:** Unlike "My Favourite Hobby" where they might recognize "hobby," here the transformation is abstract.
*   **Technical terms:** "Active Voice," "Passive Voice" are high-level grammatical terms. Many might not understand the instruction itself.
*   **Irregular past participle:** "blew" -> "blown." If they haven't memorized verb forms, they might struggle with "blowed."
*   **Changing subject/object roles:** Understanding that "the leaves" becomes the new subject.
*   **Introduction of "were":** Knowing to use the
