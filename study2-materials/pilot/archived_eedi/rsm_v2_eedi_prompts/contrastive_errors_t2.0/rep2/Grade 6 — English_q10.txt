Here's an analysis of the question "Choose the correct word. There are (some/any) apples in the basket." for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, followed by an estimate of the proportion correct.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior knowledge assumed:**
    *   **Basic English vocabulary:** Students need to know "there are," "apples," "in the basket." This is generally expected at a Class 6 level.
    *   **Concept of countable nouns:** "Apples" is a straightforward countable noun, unlikely to cause confusion.
    *   **Grammar rule for "some" vs. "any":** This is the core knowledge being tested. Students need to understand that "some" is used for affirmative statements with positive quantity, while "any" is typically used in questions or negative statements. This is a common grammar point introduced at the elementary level, often around Class 3-5, but mastery is expected later.

*   **Language demands on students with limited English:**
    *   **Sentence structure:** The sentence is simple and direct: Subject-Verb-Prepositional Phrase. No complex clauses or inversions.
    *   **Vocabulary load:** Minimal, common words.
    *   **Choice options:** Only two very common determiners ("some," "any"). The distinction between them is grammatical, not lexical.
    *   **Lack of context dependency:** The sentence stands alone; no larger paragraph or story context is needed to understand the grammar.
    *   **Absence of complex instructions:** "Choose the correct word" is extremely straightforward, even for limited English speakers. Unlike the examples provided, there's no demand to "describe," "write a theme," or "write a paragraph."

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of a learned grammatical rule. Students need to recall the rule (when to use "some" vs. "any") and then apply it to the given simple sentence.
    *   It's not pure recall (like memorizing definitions) and it's not complex reasoning (like analyzing a text for themes).

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Easier:**
        *   The common errors cited in the prompt involve *production* of language (writing descriptions, themes, paragraphs), which is inherently much harder than selecting a word from two options.
        *   "Describes the poet's writing style" requires analytical skills, abstract vocabulary, and sustained written output. "Write a theme..." also requires comprehension of a poem and abstract reasoning. "Write a short paragraph..." demands vocabulary, sentence formation, coherence, and spelling.
        *   The given examples of common errors suggest a significant struggle with comprehension of complex instructions and *generating* original English sentences/paragraphs.
        *   This question involves selecting from two very specific, often explicitly taught, grammatical words.
        *   The sentence is grammatically standard and straightforward, mirroring typical fill-in-the-blanks exercises found in almost any English textbook from an early stage.

    *   **Potentially harder aspects (minor):**
        *   While "some" and "any" are common, for students with very minimal exposure, *any* grammatical distinction can be challenging. However, this is one of the *first* such distinctions taught in grammar.

**Analysis of the Provided Common Errors and their Implications:**

The common errors are highly instructive:

1.  **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%) Wrong answers: "I am reading." / "Empty Response"**
    *   This shows a severe lack of comprehension of academic English prompts, inability to formulate relevant responses, and very limited analytical vocabulary. The question "Choose the correct word" doesn't have these abstract language demands.

2.  **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."" (pass rate: 5%) Wrong answers: "Empty Response" / "The last bargin they about a child and labour..."**
    *   Again, abstract conceptual understanding, synthesis of information from a poem, and generating a coherent English sentence/idea are huge hurdles. "Some/any" doesn't require these. The partial incorrect answer ("The last bargin they about a child and labour") suggests an attempt to convey *meaning* but a fundamental breakdown in grammar and sentence structure, which is *precisely* what the "some/any" question is testing, but in a much more controlled and basic manner.

3.  **"Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what" (pass rate: 10%) Wrong answers: "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho..." / "My hobby is
