Let's break down the question "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?" based on the given context of Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Core Event:** Students are expected to know *of* the Battle of Plassey, its year (1757), and that it involved the British. This is a foundational event in Class 8 history textbooks when discussing the advent of British colonial rule.
    *   **Causality:** They need to understand the concept of a "battle contributing to expansion of power," implying a cause-and-effect relationship.
    *   **Key Players:** Ideally, they'd have some familiarity with the key figures (e.g., Siraj-ud-Daulah, Mir Jafar, Robert Clive), though the question doesn't explicitly demand their names.
    *   **Geography:** They should know Bengal was a significant region where this battle occurred.
    *   **Political Terms:** Concepts like "political dominance," "control," "puppet ruler," or "revenue collection" (if mentioned) would be helpful, but even simpler explanations suffice per the rubric.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   **Keywords:** "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "contribute," "expansion," "British power," "India." These are relatively straightforward historical terms in English.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The question is a direct "how did X contribute to Y?" This is a common interrogative structure.
    *   **Vocabulary Difficulty:** "Contribute" is an important verb here. Students might understand it as "helped" or "led to." "Expansion" is also key. These are likely words encountered in social science lessons, even if their general English vocabulary is limited.
    *   **Potential for Misinterpretation:** Less likely here than in abstract "explain significance" questions. The prompt is quite direct.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Predominantly Recall:** Students need to recall the immediate consequences of the Battle of Plassey as taught in their history textbooks. The rubric supports this by accepting explanations of political dominance over Bengal or the installation of a puppet ruler.
    *   **Basic Reasoning:** There's a minimal level of reasoning required to link the *victory* in the battle to the *expansion of power*. It's not a complex abstract concept; rather, it's a direct logical outcome. It's not an application of a broader principle, nor is it high-level synthesis.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Standard Textbook Question:** This is a very common type of question found at the end of chapters on early British expansion. "What was the significance of the Battle of Plassey?" or "How did the British gain control of Bengal?" are almost identical.
    *   **Less Ambiguous:** Unlike questions asking to "explain significance" (which can invite broader answers and abstract thinking), this question specifically asks "how did it *contribute to the expansion of British power*," narrowing the focus to a political outcome.
    *   **Direct Linkage:** The cause-and-effect relationship is often clearly laid out in textbooks: British win Plassey -> control over Bengal -> revenues -> funding for further expansion. The rubric focuses on the most immediate and critical part: *political dominance/control over Bengal*.
    *   **Contrast with Examples Provided:**
        *   "Explain how colonial rule...affected tribal communi": Much broader, requires deeper understanding of social, economic, cultural impacts over a long period. Prone to "Empty Response."
        *   "Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes?": Requires knowledge of a specific symbol (Ashoka Chakra/Sarnath lions) and its historical/national significance. This might be considered "cultural general knowledge" for some, but specifically ties to ancient history. Less directly taught in "colonial rule" sections. Errors show misunderstanding of "Ashok."
        *   "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign...": Similar to the tribal question in its breadth. "Significance" can be hard to articulate for these students. Again, many "Empty Response."

    *   **Our Question's Advantage:** It focuses on a **single, discrete, high-impact event** with a clear and frequently repeated consequence in the curriculum. The expected answer is quite specific and often rote-learned or emphasized. Students would be explicitly taught that Plassey gave the British political control of Bengal.

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

Considering the above:

*   **Positive Factors:**
    *   The Battle of Plassey is a central, landmark event in Class 8 history.
    *
