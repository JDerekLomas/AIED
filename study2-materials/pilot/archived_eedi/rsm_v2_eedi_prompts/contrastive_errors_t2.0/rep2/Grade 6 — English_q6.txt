Here's an analysis of the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" for Class 6 Indian government school students, followed by an estimate of the proportion who would answer it correctly.

**Contrastive Analysis of the Specific Question:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Poem Comprehension:** Students must have understood the *gist* of the poem. They don't need a deep literary analysis, but a basic understanding of what happens or what feelings are conveyed.
    *   **Vocabulary:** They need to understand the words within the lines of the poem themselves to form an opinion.
    *   **Subjective Preference:** The ability to form and articulate a personal opinion or preference. This is often less emphasized in rote learning environments.

*   **Language Demands for Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Identify a line:** This is relatively straightforward if they can visually locate text.
    *   **Transcribe/Recite a line:** If it's a short line, this is easier. Longer lines could lead to transcription errors or incomplete answers.
    *   **"Which line...do you like the most":** The phrase "like the most" is common and generally comprehensible at this level.
    *   **"and why?":** This is the biggest hurdle.
        *   It requires generating a *reason* in English. This moves beyond recall or simple identification.
        *   It necessitates forming a complete sentence or two to express the "why."
        *   Students often struggle with causal connectors ("because," "so that") or expressing nuanced emotions/reasons in English. They might default to very simplistic answers ("It is good," "I like it").
        *   The common error patterns show a struggle with even basic sentence construction ("My hobby is cricket play"). Providing a *reason* requires slightly more complex thought and sentence structure.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Identifying the line (if they remember it) involves some recall, but they can also refer to the text.
    *   **Application:** Minimal application in the sense of applying a rule.
    *   **Reasoning:** This question *heavily* emphasizes simple reasoning/personal expression. Students need to *reason* why they prefer one line over others, even if the reasoning is basic. This moves beyond simply finding information in the text or answering factual questions.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typical exercises often focus on:**
        *   Factual recall from the text ("Who said this?" "What happened next?")
        *   Vocabulary matching/filling blanks.
        *   Grammar exercises.
        *   Simple summary questions (which also pose challenges, as seen with "theme or central idea").
    *   **This question is different because:** It demands a personal, subjective response and a justification. Textbook questions encouraging personal opinion and elaborate justifications are less common, especially with the expectation of written English explanations. Students are often trained to provide factual answers directly from the text or short, formulaic responses.

**Overall Difficulty Assessment Compared to Common Errors:**

The common errors provided for other questions highlight significant struggles:
*   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%) -> *Very abstract, requires complex understanding and advanced vocabulary/analytical skills.*
*   "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" (pass rate: 5%) -> *Requires abstraction, synthesis, and formulating a coherent summary.*
*   "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'." (pass rate: 10%) -> *This is the most comparable. It requires sustained writing about a personal topic. The errors show difficulty in sentence structure, focus, and meeting length requirements.*

**How "Which line... and why?" compares:**

*   It's **easier than** "poet's writing style" or "theme" because it doesn't require high-level abstraction or deep literary analysis. The prompt is concrete.
*   It's **comparable in difficulty, but potentially slightly easier in the writing demand,** than "My Favourite Hobby."
    *   **Ease:** The *output* needed for "why" can be shorter than a 4-5 sentence paragraph. A single sentence explaining the reason *might* suffice for full marks, depending on strictness. Also, the students don't have to generate an entire topic, just a reason for a given line.
    *   **Hardship:** The "why" still requires independent sentence generation and reasoning in English, which is the major hurdle shown by "My favourite hobby" errors ("My hobby is cricket play"). Students might write "I like it because it
