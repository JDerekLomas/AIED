Here's a breakdown of the question's likely difficulty for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, followed by the estimated proportion correct:

**Contrastive Analysis of "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."**

**Compared to Common Errors (as listed):**

The listed common errors mostly involve:
*   **"Empty Response":** Suggests either lack of knowledge, inability to comprehend the question, or an unwillingness/difficulty in articulating an answer.
*   **Misspelled/Garbled Attempts:** For "lions on currency," the answers like "Asher' stand," "ashok a second," "Ashok seamb" suggest students *know* it's related to Ashoka but struggle with recall of the *specific* connection and accurate spelling/articulation.
*   **Irrelevant Text:** "Eco Public Beuratt M.R.P low" for Ashoka implies complete misdirection or a total lack of understanding.

**Analyzing the Harappan Question:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Direct Recall:** Students are expected to have studied the Harappan Civilization in Social Science (History) at Class 6, 7, or 8. This is a fundamental topic in early Indian history.
    *   **Key Features:** Specifically, urban planning is one of the *most emphasized* aspects when discussing Harappan civilization. Topics like grid patterns, drainage, citadel/lower town, and use of baked bricks are universally covered.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Harappan Civilization," "urban planning," "key feature" – these are standard terms in the curriculum.

2.  **Language Demands (limited English proficiency):**
    *   **Question Structure:** "Describe one key feature..." is relatively straightforward. "Describe" is a common command verb. "One key feature" focuses the answer.
    *   **Complexity:** The sentence structure is simple.
    *   **Content Vocabulary:** The concepts for answers (grid, drainage, bricks, citadel) often have Hindi equivalents that might be known.
    *   **Potential Challenge:** Articulating a coherent answer in English, even if the student knows the concept in Hindi, can be a hurdle. They might know "nagra niyojan" or "jali dar sarak" but struggle to form an English sentence.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Primarily Recall:** This question is almost entirely recall-based. Students need to remember specific facts taught about Harappan urban planning. There's no application to a new scenario or complex reasoning required beyond stating a learned fact.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Standard:** This is a very common type of question found in end-of-chapter exercises or review questions for the Harappan Civilization topic. "List features of Harappan cities" or "Explain their drainage system" are ubiquitous. It's a foundational understanding.
    *   **Relatively Easier:** Compared to explaining *how* colonial rule affected lives (requiring analytical depth and understanding of cause-effect over a complex period), or explaining the *significance* of Ashoka's reign (also demanding higher-order thinking), this question is simpler. It asks for a factual description of *one* thing.
    *   The low pass rates for the listed example questions indicate that even recall for those more complex or less distinct topics is very poor, suggesting difficulty in knowledge retention *and* articulation.

**Likely Outcomes & Common Errors for *This* Question:**

*   **Positive Factors:**
    *   Harappan Civilization is a well-taught and frequently revisited topic in early history.
    *   Urban planning is *the* standout feature usually highlighted.
    *   "One key feature" is a narrow, achievable scope.
    *   The possible answers (grid, drainage, bricks, citadel) are quite distinct and easy to remember individually.
*   **Negative Factors:**
    *   **"Empty Response":** Still a significant risk due to general lack of confidence, not recalling *any* feature, or struggling with English expression.
    *   **Partial Recall/Misspelling:** Students might remember "drainage" but not be able to write "system" or might describe it in broken English. However, even "drainage good" might be partially creditable depending on interpretation of "describe."
    *   **Confusing with Other Civilizations:** Less likely for Harappan as its urban features are quite unique and emphasized.
    *   **Generic Answer:** "Cities were big" – might not be specific enough for "key feature."

**Compared to the ~10% pass rate examples:**

This question is fundamentally *simpler* in terms of the cognitive demand. It's a
