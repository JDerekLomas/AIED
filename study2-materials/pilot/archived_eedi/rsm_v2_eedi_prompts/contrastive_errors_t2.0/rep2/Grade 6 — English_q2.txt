Let's break down the question "Who lived inside the book?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their common errors and learning context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Direct Story Recall:** This question directly tests recall of a specific detail from a story. To answer it correctly, students must have read, understood, and remembered the content of the particular story from which this question is drawn. This is the primary and most significant assumption. If the story itself (featuring the magical fairy in the book) was not covered, poorly understood, or simply forgotten, the student cannot answer this.
    *   **Basic Vocabulary:** "Who," "lived," "inside," "book" are very common, basic English words that would be introduced early in primary education. Understanding these individual words is unlikely to be a major hurdle.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Simple interrogative sentence structure is also basic.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Simplicity of Question:** The question itself is exceptionally simple in its grammatical structure and vocabulary. It uses a straightforward "Who + verb + prepositional phrase" construction.
    *   **Demand for Specific Detail:** The demand isn't for an abstract concept or a description, but for a single, specific noun phrase ("a magical fairy" or "fairy"). This makes the required output short and concise.
    *   **Minimal Production Requirement:** Compared to writing a paragraph ("My Favourite Hobby") or a theme ("The Last Bargain"), the production required is minimal. Students only need to recall and state the name of the character.
    *   **Lower Chance of Misinterpretation due to phrasing:** Unlike "describes the poet's writing style" where "describes" and "writing style" are abstract and might lead to "I am reading," "Who lived inside the book?" is very concrete. The chances of producing an "Empty Response" because of *question misunderstanding* (rather than story recall failure) are lower.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Pure Recall:** This is a pure recall question. There's no application of concepts, no interpretation, and no reasoning required beyond accessing stored information from the story.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Typical Textbook Exercise:** This is a very common type of "comprehension check" question found in almost every English textbook after a story. They are designed to ensure students have understood the basic plot points.
    *   **Easier than others provided:**
        *   "Describes the poet’s writing style": Requires understanding of "describes," "poet," "writing style," and ability to formulate a descriptive response – high language demand, abstract.
        *   "Write a theme or central idea...": Requires inferential understanding of the story's message, not just facts, and ability to articulate it concisely – higher cognitive and language demand.
        *   "Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby": Requires sustained writing, organizing thoughts, using varied vocabulary, and correct grammar for multiple sentences – significantly higher language production demand.
    *   **Potentially Difficult if Story Not Mastered:** Its simplicity hinges entirely on the student's familiarity with the source story. If the story was poorly taught, if students didn't pay attention, or if they struggle with reading comprehension in general (even for simple stories), then this question becomes impossible. However, *if they understood the story*, this specific question is on the easier end.

**Key Observations for this Specific Question:**

*   **Low Linguistic Barrier (Question Itself):** The vocabulary and sentence structure of "Who lived inside the book?" are as basic as they come for a Class 6 question.
*   **High Reliance on Story Comprehension:** The sole difficulty driver is whether the student understood and remembered the story detail. If the story was understood, this answer is direct and simple.
*   **Minimal Output Required:** Just one or two words. This avoids the pitfalls of sustained writing, complex grammar, or sophisticated vocabulary seen in the "My Favourite Hobby" or "theme" questions.
*   **Less Ambiguity:** Unlike "describes the poet's writing style," the question "Who lived inside the book?" is not prone to misinterpretation if the individual words are known. An "Empty Response" is more likely due to forgetting the story detail rather than misunderstanding the question itself.

Given the common errors observed (Empty Response, completely irrelevant answers, inability to describe or write paragraphs), the simplicity of the question *structure* and the *required answer* for "Who lived inside the book?" makes it significantly easier *if the student understood the underlying story.* The "Empty Response" common error will still apply if the story wasn
