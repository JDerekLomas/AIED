Here's a detailed analysis of the question:

**What prior knowledge is assumed?**

*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Students need to be able to multiply whole numbers and understand division (specifically by 2).
*   **Geometric Shapes:** They must know what a "triangle," "base," and "height" refer to in a geometric context. They don't need to visualize it perfectly, but they need to recognize these terms in relation to a triangle.
*   **Formula Recall:** The most critical prior knowledge is the formula for the area of a triangle: `Area = 1/2 × base × height`. This is typically taught in Class 6 or 7.
*   **Units:** Understanding that "cm" is a unit of length and "cm²" (or 'square cm') is a unit of area.

**What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**

*   **Key terms:** "Find," "area," "triangle," "base," "height." These are fairly common mathematical terms. "Whose" is a conjunction that might be slightly less common but shouldn't be a major barrier in this simple sentence structure.
*   **Sentence Structure:** The sentence is direct and uses common subject-verb-object structure. There are no complex clauses or abstract concepts.
*   **Clarity:** The question clearly states what needs to be found ("area") and provides all necessary information ("base is 8 cm and height is 6 cm").
*   **Compared to other subjects:** This is very low language demand for a mathematics question. There's no narrative, no abstract reasoning requiring nuanced language interpretation, and no complex instructions.

**Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

This question primarily tests **application** of a learned formula, combined with a crucial element of **recall** (remembering the formula). There is very little "reasoning" beyond applying the formula correctly and performing the arithmetic. It's not a multi-step problem, nor does it require creative problem-solving or abstract thinking.

**How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Ease:** This is a **very straightforward, foundational application** problem. It's likely one of the easiest types of area problems a student would encounter once the formula is introduced.
*   **Complexity:** Textbooks often introduce:
    *   Problems where base or height needs to be *calculated* from the area and the other dimension.
    *   Problems involving compound shapes that include triangles.
    *   Problems with unit conversions.
    *   Problems embedded in word problems with more contextual information.
    *   Problems where base and height are not immediately obvious from a diagram.
*   **Compared to "typical":** This question is *easier* than the average textbook exercise after initial introduction of the formula. It's usually the very first type of problem students learn after deriving or being given the formula. It directly provides the necessary inputs.

**Contrastive Analysis Summary:**

*   **Ease Factors:** Very low language demand, direct application of a single formula, all information given, simple whole numbers, no complex conversions or multi-step problem-solving. This is an "entry-level" application of the area of a triangle formula. The concepts of 'base' and 'height' for a triangle are typically introduced visually, making them relatively concrete.
*   **Difficulty Factors:** Students need to *know* the formula (1/2 * b * h). If they don't recall it, they can't answer. While "Area = base × height" is similar (and for rectangles), confusing the two is a common error if the '1/2' isn't explicitly remembered. Arithmetic errors (e.g., multiplying by 2 instead of dividing by 2, or multiplying 8*6 but forgetting to divide by 2) are also possible.

Given the average pass rate of 29% across *all* items (which would include much harder problems in various subjects), this question is comparatively quite easy for Class 7 Mathematics. Students are introduced to basic geometric formulas around Class 6-7. The economic background might mean less exposure to extra tutoring, but the core curriculum is expected to cover this. The primary barrier will be formula recall and simple calculation.
