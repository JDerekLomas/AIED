Here's a breakdown of the question "Define fable" for Class 8 Indian government school students, followed by an estimated proportion correct.

**Contrastive Analysis of "Define fable"**

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **English Vocabulary:** Understanding of "define." This is a foundational academic term.
*   **Literary Terminology:** Prior exposure to the term "fable" itself, likely in English or its Hindi equivalent ("कहानी," "कथा," though "fable" specifically implies a moral). They might have read fables, but not necessarily learned the definition explicitly in English.
*   **Concepts within the definition:** Understanding "short story," "animal characters," "moral lesson." These are fairly common and concrete concepts.

**2. Language Demands for Students with Limited English:**
*   **"Define":** This is a key word. If a student doesn't understand "define," they won't know what to do. However, it's a common instruction word in exams, so many might have encountered it before.
*   **Formulating a definition:** This requires some level of productive English, not just receptive. They need to generate sentences that convey the meaning accurately. This is a significant challenge, as seen in the "writing style" and "theme" questions.
*   **Specific vocabulary within the definition:** "imparts a moral lesson" is slightly more formal English. Simpler phrases like "teaches a lesson" or "has a moral" might be more accessible, but the rubric requires "imparts."
*   **No context:** The question stands alone. There's no poem or story snippet to provide context clues.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
*   **Primarily Recall:** It asks for a direct definition of a literary term. Students need to remember what a fable is.
*   **Some Application/Formulation:** While it's recall, they also need to *formulate* that recalled information into a coherent English sentence(s). This is where the language difficulty lies. It's not just "true/false" or matching.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
*   **Similar to "glossary" type questions:** Many textbooks have glossaries or sections where literary terms are defined. Students might be asked to "know the definitions" of such terms.
*   **Often simpler than analytical tasks:** It's generally less demanding than "describe writing style" (which requires analysis of text and sophisticated vocabulary), or "write a theme" (which requires abstract thought and synthesis).
*   **Potentially harder than fill-in-the-blanks:** If it were a multiple-choice "what is a fable?" or "a short story with animals that teaches a moral is called a _____", it would be much easier.
*   **Compared to the common errors observed:**
    *   **"Describes the poet's writing style" (4% pass):** This is much harder due to abstract nature of "writing style" and the high-level English required to describe it. "Define fable" is more concrete.
    *   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass):** Similar to the above, identifying and articulating a "theme" requires abstract reasoning and advanced English. "Fable" is more definable.
    *   **"Write a short paragraph about 'My Favourite Hobby'" (10% pass):** While "fable" is shorter, this question allows for personal expression, even if rudimentary. The "fable" definition is specific and requires accuracy. However, "My Favourite Hobby" often leads to disconnected sentences or basic phrases, not coherent paragraphs, which suggests challenges in constructing extended text.

**Specific Considerations for "Define fable":**

*   **Ubiquity of Fables:** Fables (like Panchatantra, Aesop's) are very common in Indian storytelling traditions, even if not explicitly called "fables" in English. This underlying familiarity could help.
*   **Memorization Strategy:** Students might try to recall a definition given in class or a textbook and reproduce it, even if they don't fully grasp every word. This "rote learning" is a common strategy.
*   **Partial Credit Potential (if allowed, though here max score is 1):** If a student writes "short story with animals" or "teaches a lesson," they have part of the definition, which is more likely than a fully correct answer for more complex questions. However, the rubric demands the full, correct definition for 1 mark.

**Why this might be *relatively* easier than the extremely low pass rates:**

*   It's a more *direct* question, requiring recall of a known item, not interpretation or abstract description.
*   The components
