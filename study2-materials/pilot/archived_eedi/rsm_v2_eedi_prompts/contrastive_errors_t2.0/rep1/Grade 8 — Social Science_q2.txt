Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis: "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Basic understanding of Ancient Indian History:** Students are expected to know about the Harappan Civilization (also known as Indus Valley Civilization) as a distinct historical period. This is typically covered in Class 6 or 7 Social Science textbooks in India, so it should have been introduced.
*   **Concept of "urban planning":** They need to understand what constitutes planning in a city context (layout, infrastructure, housing).
*   **Specific features of Harappan urban planning:** This is the core knowledge required. They need to recall at least one distinct feature taught in their curriculum. Common features emphasized are:
    *   Grid pattern of streets
    *   Advanced drainage system (sewers, covered drains)
    *   Use of standardized baked bricks
    *   Division into Citadel and Lower Town
    *   Great Bath, Granaries (though "urban planning" suggests more systemic features than individual structures)

**Language Demands:**
*   **"Describe":** A fairly common and straightforward instruction. It asks for a factual recounting, not complex analysis.
*   **"key feature":** Students need to identify one prominent and important aspect, not just a minor detail.
*   **"Harappan Civilization's urban planning":** The specific subject matter is clearly stated.
*   **Overall:** The vocabulary is not overly complex for Class 8. However, given limited English proficiency, students might struggle to formulate a grammatically correct and coherent sentence even if they know the answer. They might use simplified or broken English.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
*   **Predominantly Recall:** This is a direct recall question. Students are expected to remember specific facts about Harappan urban planning as taught in their history lessons.
*   **Minimal Application/Reasoning:** There's no scenario to analyze, no comparison to make, and no need to infer information. It's about remembering a learned fact.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   **Standard difficulty:** This question is very similar to typical end-of-chapter or internal comprehension questions found in Social Science textbooks for this age group. "List two features of Harappan cities," "Explain the drainage system of Harappa," or "What was special about the Harappan streets?" are common variations.
*   **Focus on a single point:** The instruction "one key feature" makes it easier than asking for multiple points, reducing the cognitive load and chances of making multiple errors.
*   **Well-defined answer:** The correct answers are very specific and usually highlighted in textbooks (e.g., "The cities were divided into two or more parts, often a citadel and a lower town," "Streets and houses were laid out in a grid pattern," "A sophisticated drainage system was a hallmark").

**Comparison to Common Errors Examples Provided:**

*   **"Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi" (pass rate: 9%):** This question is far more complex. It requires:
    *   Understanding abstract concepts like "colonial rule" and "affected."
    *   Recall of specific historical impacts (land loss, forest laws, loss of traditional livelihood, forced labor, exploitation).
    *   Synthesis of multiple pieces of information.
    *   Ability to explain cause and effect.
    *   *Our Harappan question is simpler:* It asks for a descriptive fact, not an analytical explanation of a process or impact.
*   **"Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes? Explain" (pass rate: 10%):** This asks for historical symbolism and its rationale. It's inferential to some degree, linking a modern symbol to ancient history (Ashoka's pillars). Students might know "Ashoka" but not the "why" or "significance."
    *   *Our Harappan question is simpler:* It directly asks for a physical feature, which is often easier to recall than symbolism or reasoning.
*   **"Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign in Indian history, mentioning at leas" (pass rate: 12%):** "Significance" is a higher-order thinking skill. It requires students to understand *why* Ashoka's rule was important (spread of Buddhism, dharma, rock edicts, administrative reforms), not just what he did.
    *   *Our Harappan question is simpler:* It asks for a straightforward descriptive feature, not the "significance" or impact.

**Key advantages of the Harappan question:**

*   **Concrete concept:** Urban planning features (streets, drains, bricks) are more concrete and less abstract than "significance" or
