Let's break down the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering the provided context.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Basic Geographical Awareness:** Students are expected to know that mountains exist and that India has them.
*   **Specific Geographical Knowledge:** They need to be able to recall the names of at least two *major* mountain ranges within India's borders. This would typically be covered in a Class 6 Social Science (Geography) curriculum. Topics like "Physical Features of India" usually start by introducing major mountain ranges.

**Language Demands:**
*   **Keywords:** "Name," "two," "major," "mountain ranges," "located in India."
*   **Vocabulary Level:** "Major" is a common word. "Mountain ranges" is a core geographical term. "Located in India" specifies the geographical domain.
*   **Complexity:** The sentence structure is very simple: a direct command to recall.
*   **English Proficiency:** While students have limited English proficiency, this question uses very straightforward, frequently encountered vocabulary and a simple sentence structure. It's much less abstract and grammatically complex than the "Explain how colonial rule..." or "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign..." questions. Even students with very basic English should grasp the intent if they recognize "mountain" and "India."

**Type of Cognitive Demand:**
*   **Recall:** This is a purely recall-based question. Students either know the names or they don't. There's no application or complex reasoning required.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   **Expected Difficulty:** This type of question (naming major physical features) is extremely common in Class 6 geography. It would likely appear as a "fill in the blanks," "match the following," or direct short-answer question in textbooks and end-of-chapter exercises.
*   **Simplicity:** It's often one of the first things taught about India's physical geography. Identifying major features like mountains, rivers, and plateaus is foundational.

**Contrastive Analysis Against Common Errors & Other Questions:**

*   **Compared to "Explain how colonial rule..." (Pass Rate: 9%):** This mountain question is *vastly* simpler. The colonial rule question requires abstract historical understanding, cause-and-effect reasoning, and the ability to articulate complex concepts in English. The empty responses for that question highlight the inability to process the complex historical context and formulate an answer.
*   **Compared to "Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes?" (Pass Rate: 10%):** This lion question requires cultural and historical knowledge (Ashokan pillars) that might not be explicitly taught in Class 6 or understood beyond rote memorization, if at all. It's also an "explain why" question, demanding reasoning. The mountain question is purely factual recall.
*   **Compared to "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign..." (Pass Rate: 12%):** Similar to the colonial rule question, this demands historical reasoning, understanding of "significance," and the ability to elaborate. The "Empty Response" suggests students simply don't have the grasp of the concept or the language to explain it.
*   **Rubric:** The rubric for the mountain question is very generous (names one correct range for 0.5 points). This means partial knowledge is rewarded, which boosts the expected score. The *target* is two, but getting one still earns a point.

**Why this question will likely perform much better:**

1.  **Core Curriculum:** Naming major mountain ranges of India is fundamental geography for this age group. It's highly likely to be taught and drilled.
2.  **Simple Vocabulary and Syntax:** "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" is as direct as it gets. Even students with poor English will likely understand "mountain," "India," and "name two."
3.  **Pure Recall:** No complex reasoning, explanation, or synthesis is needed.
4.  **Common and Iconic Examples:** The Himalayas are practically synonymous with "mountain in India." Aravallis, Vindhyas, Satpuras are also very well-known and visually represented on maps.
5.  **Partial Credit:** The rubric rewarding just *one* correct answer for 0.5 points significantly increases the chance of students getting *some* credit. Many might recall at least one, if not two.

Considering these factors, this question aligns much more with what Class 6 students in government schools would be expected to recall directly from their geography lessons. It avoids the linguistic, abstract, and reasoning hurdles that lead to very low pass rates on the example questions provided.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **50-60%**
