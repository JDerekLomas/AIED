Let's break down the question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason." for a Class 7 student in an Indian government school, considering the common errors and background.

**Analysis of the Question:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Passage Comprehension:** The most significant assumption is that the student has read and understood the preceding passage, likely "The Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy. Without understanding what the king's questions *were* (What is the right time to do everything? Who are the most important people? What is the most important thing to do?), answering whether they are "important in real life" is impossible.
    *   **General World Knowledge:** The concept of "real life" and what makes something "important" are assumed. This is relatively basic and shouldn't be a major barrier.

2.  **Language Demands for Students with Limited English:**
    *   **"Do you think..."**: This phrasing requires expressing an opinion. It's common and generally understood at this level.
    *   **"...the king's questions..."**: This requires connecting "king's questions" to the specific content of the story. If the student hasn't fully understood the story or key vocabulary (e.g., "king"), this is a hurdle.
    *   **"...important in real life?"**: "Important" and "real life" are relatively high-frequency words. "In real life" might be slightly idiomatic but generally decodable for those with some English exposure.
    *   **"Give one reason."**: This is a direct instruction that demands a supporting argument. While common, expressing a coherent reason in English can be challenging for students struggling with sentence construction.
    *   **Lexical Complexity:** "Important," "reason," "real life" are more common than, say, "describes" or "theme."

3.  **Nature of the Task (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   This is primarily a **reasoning** and **application** question.
        *   **Reasoning:** Students need to form an opinion ("Do you think...") and justify it ("Give one reason"). This goes beyond mere recall of facts from the story.
        *   **Application:** They need to apply the *content* of the king's questions (understood from the passage) to the *concept* of "real life."
    *   It's *not* simple recall of a fact directly stated in the text.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Narrative Comprehension:** Indian Class 7 English textbooks heavily feature story comprehension. Questions often include:
        *   "Who was the king?" (Recall)
        *   "What were the three questions?" (Recall)
        *   "Why did the king go to the hermit?" (Inferential, low reasoning)
        *   "What did the king learn?" (Summarizing, recall/inferential)
    *   **"Do you think..." questions are present but less frequent or might accept simpler answers.**
    *   **"Give one reason" is common for explaining actions or feelings.**
    *   **Crucial Difference:** Many textbook questions directly relate to the plot or character's actions within the story. This question explicitly asks to bridge the story's themes to the student's own perception of "real life," which can be a higher-order thinking skill.
    *   **Open-ended vs. Specific:** It's more open-ended than a typical "find the answer in the text" question, allowing for various "valid reasons."

**Considering Common Errors and Context:**

*   **"Empty Response":** This is a huge threat. If the student doesn't understand the king's questions from the passage, or struggles with the English to formulate *any* response, they'll leave it blank.
*   **Difficulty with Abstraction:** "Describes the poet's writing style" (4% pass rate) suggests that questions requiring abstract thinking or meta-commentary on text are extremely hard. While "importance in real life" is less abstract than "writing style," it still requires a degree of generalization from the story.
*   **Literal Interpretation/Plot Focus:** The "The last bargin they about a child and labour..." error for "Write a theme" suggests students might try to summarize the plot rather than extracting a central idea. Here, they might say "The king asked three questions" instead of giving a reason for their importance.
*   **Simple Sentence Construction:** Errors like "My hobby is cricket play" indicate struggles with basic grammar (e.g., verb forms, noun usage). While a simple "Yes, they are important" and a fragmented reason might get partial
