Here's an analysis of the question "Who lived inside the book?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, followed by an estimate of the proportion who would answer it correctly.

**Contrastive Analysis of Difficulty:**

*   **What prior knowledge is assumed?**
    *   **Vocabulary:**
        *   "Who": Fairly basic interrogative, likely familiar.
        *   "lived": Past tense of "live," common verb.
        *   "inside": Common preposition, likely familiar from context (e.g., "inside the house," "inside the bag").
        *   "the book": Very common noun phrase.
        *   Crucially, it assumes the students have read (or been read) the preceding text/story from which this question is drawn. The answer "a magical fairy" comes *directly* from the text.
    *   **Grammar:** Basic subject-verb-object structure, understanding of a simple question.
    *   **World Knowledge:** Understanding of "fairy" as a magical being associated with stories is common in children's literature/folklore, even if encountered in their local language first.

*   **What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**
    *   **Sentence Structure:** "Who lived inside the book?" is a simple "Wh-" question. This is a common and relatively basic question structure learned early in English acquisition. It doesn't involve complex clauses, inversions, or unusual tenses.
    *   **Vocabulary:** All the words ("Who," "lived," "inside," "the book") are likely to be among the earliest and most frequently encountered in a Class 6 English curriculum.
    *   **Answering:** The expected answer "a magical fairy" is a simple noun phrase. Students don't need to construct a complex sentence, just recall and provide the core information.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is purely **recall**. The student simply needs to remember a specific piece of information explicitly stated in the source text (e.g., "A magical fairy lived inside the book"). There's no application of concepts or complex reasoning required.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Easier:** This question is significantly easier than the example common errors provided:
        *   "Describes the poet’s writing style": Requires abstract thinking, understanding "style," "poet," and "describes," and forming a coherent descriptive sentence. This is far beyond most Class 6 students' capacity.
        *   "Write a theme or central idea...": Requires inferential comprehension, identifying the main point, and summarizing it. This is a higher-order thinking skill.
        *   "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'": Requires sentence construction, vocabulary generation, sustained writing, and topic development. This question tests productive writing, which is extremely difficult for these students.
    *   **Similar (or Slightly Easier):** Typical textbook exercises for Class 6 often involve basic comprehension questions like: "What is the boy's name?", "Where did they go?", "What did the girl see?". "Who lived inside the book?" fits this pattern very well. The key here is that the answer is *direct* and explicit in the text.

**Factors making this SPECIFIC question easier:**

1.  **Direct Recall:** The answer is explicitly stated in the text. No inference or complex understanding is needed beyond basic reading comprehension.
2.  **Simple Question Structure:** "Who lived X?" is very straightforward.
3.  **Basic Vocabulary:** All words in the question are fundamental.
4.  **Concise Answer:** The expected answer ("a magical fairy" or "fairy") is short and requires minimal English production. This reduces the chance of common errors seen in longer responses (grammar, spelling, sentence structure).
5.  **Child-Friendly Concept:** Fairies and books are common elements in children's stories, making the topic relatable.

**Why the "Empty Response" and "Wrong Answer" examples are not good comparisons:**
The error examples you provided are for questions demanding significantly higher-order skills (analysis, theme identification, paragraph writing). "Who lived inside the book?" is a foundational comprehension question that would typically precede those. The issues like "Empty Response" often indicate a complete lack of understanding of the question or an inability to formulate *any* English response. However, the simplicity of this question should lower that threshold. The common "wrong answers" on the "Writing Style" or "Theme" questions demonstrate a breakdown in understanding complex ideas or producing extended text, which are not relevant for "Who lived inside the book?".

**Revisiting Common Errors & Applying them:**
While there will still be "
