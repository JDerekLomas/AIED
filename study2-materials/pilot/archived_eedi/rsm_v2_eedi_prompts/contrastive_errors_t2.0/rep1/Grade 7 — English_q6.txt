Let's break down the question "Describes the poet’s writing style" for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering the context provided.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Implicit Literary Terminology:** The core difficulty lies in "writing style." This concept, while seemingly simple to a proficient English speaker, requires an understanding of what constitutes "style" in writing (i.e., how a poet uses language, structure, imagery, tone, etc., to convey their message). Many Class 7 students, especially with limited exposure to literary analysis, might not have this meta-linguistic concept internalized for English poetry. They might be able to *identify* features of a poem (like it's sad or about nature) but not articulate *how* the poet's choices contribute to a style.
    *   **Poetry Comprehension:** Students would need to have read a specific poem to describe its style. The question itself doesn't provide the poem, implying it's either referencing a previously studied poem or is a general question meant to test the *understanding of the concept* rather than application to a specific text. Assuming it's the latter, the prior knowledge required is even more abstract. If it *does* refer to a known poem, the difficulty would then also hinge on their comprehension of *that* poem. For this analysis, I'll assume it's asking for the *understanding of the term* style, or the ability to apply it *if* a poem were present, and thus, the primary barrier is the "style" concept itself.
    *   **Vocabulary:** Students need the vocabulary to describe style (e.g., simple, descriptive, informal, direct). While these are relatively common adjectives, applying them correctly to "writing style" might be new.

*   **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Abstract Noun:** "Style" is an abstract noun. Abstract concepts are generally harder to grasp and express than concrete ones for second language learners, especially at lower proficiency levels.
    *   **"Describes" vs. "Is":** The verb "describes" requires them to articulate *characteristics* of something. This is more complex than a simple "What is...?" or "Who is...?" question.
    *   **Grammar for Description:** To answer correctly, they would need to formulate a sentence like "The poet's writing style is [adjective]" or just provide the adjective. This isn't inherently complex grammar, but it still requires some structural understanding.
    *   **Passive Construction:** If students try to paraphrase, a simple "How does the poet write?" might be easier than "Describes the poet's writing style." The question phrasing itself isn't exceptionally difficult, but it leans slightly formal.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Conceptual Application/Reasoning:** This is not a recall question in the sense of memorizing a fact. It requires students to apply the concept of "writing style" to a perceived or assumed poetic work and then articulate an appropriate descriptor. This leans heavily on *reasoning* about literary qualities, which is a higher-order thinking skill than simple recall. If they haven't been taught "writing style" explicitly, it requires inference.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Higher Difficulty:** This question appears to be significantly more difficult than typical Class 7 English textbook exercises, especially for students from the described background.
        *   Typical exercises focus on:
            *   Basic comprehension (answering direct factual questions about a text).
            *   Vocabulary (matching words, using words in sentences).
            *   Grammar (fill-in-the-blanks, sentence transformation).
            *   Creative writing (short paragraphs on familiar topics, like "My Favourite Hobby," although even these have low pass rates, suggesting structural challenges).
        *   Analyzing "writing style" falls into literary analysis, which is usually introduced gradually and explicitly, often with simpler questions first (e.g., "What kind of words does the poet use often?").
        *   The low pass rates on the *other* difficult questions ("describes the poet's writing style" at 4%, "theme or central idea" at 5%, "My Favourite Hobby" paragraph at 10%) are strong indicators that questions requiring abstract thinking, critical analysis, or sustained written output are extremely challenging for this group. The current question falls squarely into the abstract analysis category.
        *   The common wrong answers ("I am reading," "Empty Response") for *this exact question* (with a 4% pass rate) strongly suggest that students either do not understand the question at all, or they completely lack the conceptual framework to answer it. "
