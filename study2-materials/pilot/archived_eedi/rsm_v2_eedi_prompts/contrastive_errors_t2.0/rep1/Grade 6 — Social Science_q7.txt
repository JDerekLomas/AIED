Let's break down the question "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there" in the context of Class 6 students in Indian government schools from economically weaker sections with limited English proficiency.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Definition of "Natural Resources":** Students need to understand what a natural resource is. This is typically introduced in earlier grades or early Class 6 Social Science/Geography.
*   **Basic Geography of Rajasthan:** They need to know *some* resources specific to Rajasthan. This is a crucial piece of recall. Textbooks often list resources for different regions.
*   **Causality/Influence:** The second part requires understanding how a resource impacts human life (e.g., availability of water leads to agriculture, desert sand leads to specific housing/transport). This is a foundational social science concept.

**Language Demands:**

*   **"Mention":** Straightforward recall of names.
*   **"Natural Resources":** A key technical term. If not understood, the entire question is inaccessible.
*   **"Found in Rajasthan":** Requires geographical specificity.
*   **"Explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":** This is the most demanding part.
    *   "Influences": This is a slightly higher-level vocabulary word.
    *   "Lives of the people there": Requires them to connect the resource to daily activities, occupations, housing, etc., of people in Rajasthan. This requires expressing a causal relationship in English.
    *   The structure of the explanation (identifying a resource, then linking it to an influence) can be challenging in English for students with limited proficiency. They might know the *facts* but struggle to *articulate* the "how."

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   **Recall (70%):** Naming two natural resources found in Rajasthan is purely recall.
*   **Reasoning/Application (30%):** Explaining *how* one influences lives involves a degree of reasoning or application of known facts. They need to connect a resource (e.g., water scarcity) to its consequence (e.g., nomadic life, specific crops, reliance on canals). While often presented in textbooks, articulating this connection independently requires some thought beyond pure memorization.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Naming resources:** This is a very common type of textbook question (e.g., "List the natural resources of State X"). Relatively easy.
*   **Explaining influence:** This is slightly more complex. Textbooks might provide examples (e.g., "Water scarcity leads to..." or "Minerals provide raw materials for..."), but formulating their own coherent explanation can be harder.
*   **Combining both:** Asking for two and then elaborating on one increases the overall cognitive load and the potential for errors.

**Contrastive Analysis with Common Errors:**

*   **"Empty Response":** Likely for this question as well, especially if they don't know any resources or can't formulate the explanation.
*   **Poor English/Spelling (like "Asher' stand", "ashok a second"):** Highly probable. Even if they know the resource (e.g., *Paani* for water, *Marbal* for marble), spelling it in English or articulating the influence will be fraught with errors.
*   **Lack of specificity ("Eco Public Bureaucrat"):** If they only name a general resource not specific to Rajasthan, or if their explanation of influence is too generic, it might not score.
*   **Difficulty articulating causality ("Explain how..."):** The other difficult questions (e.g., "Explain how colonial rule...") show a struggle with complex causal explanations. "How one influences" is simpler than "how colonial rule affected," but still demands this skill.
*   **Rubric sensitivity:** The rubric allows for a variety of correct resources, which is helpful. The "explain how" part will be the major hurdle.

**Specific Points for this Question:**

*   **"Water" as an easy pick:** Rajasthan is famous for its scarcity of water, and water itself is a universal resource. Students are likely to identify it. Its influence (irrigation, drought, specific crops, lifestyle) is also a prominent topic.
*   **Other common resources:** Salt (Sambhar Lake), marble (Makrana), solar/wind energy (desert climate) are often highlighted. Copper and Zinc might be less prominent in early geography.
*   **Opportunity for partial credit:** If they name two resources but fail the explanation, or vice-versa, there's a chance they get partial understanding. However, the rubric for this specific question indicates "Max score: 1" for meeting *all* criteria. This is quite strict and will bring down the
