I will break down the analysis of the likely errors and then provide the estimated proportion correct.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the student demographic (economically weaker sections, limited English, Class 6) and the average pass rate of 29% for this exam, here's an breakdown of potential errors for the question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?":

1.  **"Which line from the poem..." - Identifying a Line (Lower Difficulty, but still a hurdle):**
    *   **Misconception/Language Misunderstanding:** Students might not understand "line" in the poetic sense, or might pick a phrase that isn't a complete line. They might just pick a random word or concept from the poem.
    *   **Attempt/Failure:** Many would attempt to pick something. Some might successfully identify a line, others might provide a word, a phrase, or even just a general idea from the poem.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** Just a word from the poem, or a phrase that isn't a full line. "Happiness" (from "The Last Bargain" context). Or a general statement like "I like the part where he is looking for a job."

2.  **"...do you like the most..." - Personal Preference (Moderate Difficulty):**
    *   **Misconception/Language Misunderstanding:** While "like" is a basic word, expressing *personal preference* in a structured way might be challenging. Some might just restate a part of the poem without indicating *they* like it.
    *   **Attempt/Failure:** Most would attempt to state a preference, but the clarity might vary.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "The king was happy." (without explicitly saying "I like this line because...")

3.  **"...and why?" - Justification (Highest Difficulty):**
    *   **Misconception/Language Misunderstanding:** This is the biggest hurdle. "Why" requires cause-and-effect reasoning and the ability to articulate that reason in English. This is a common struggle for students with limited language proficiency. They might know *why* in their native language, but struggle to translate that into English. They might provide a very simplistic or circular reason.
    *   **Attempt/Failure:** Many would attempt, but struggle significantly. They might:
        *   Provide no reason at all.
        *   Provide a reason that's a simple restatement of the line.
        *   Provide a reason that is grammatically incoherent.
        *   Provide a reason that isn't connected to the line itself but to the general theme.
        *   Provide a reason in their native language (if allowed, but usually not for scoring).
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "I like this line because it is good." or "I like this line because it is about happiness." (very superficial). Or simply omit the "why" part entirely.

4.  **Overall Rubric "Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why." (Max score: 1.5):**
    *   The rubric is quite strict. To get *any* score, they need both components.
    *   The "denotes a line" part can be failed if they just write a word or an idea.
    *   The "mentions why" part is where the majority will fail or provide insufficient justification.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract understanding and articulation. "Happiness is find in innocence" shows a struggle with grammar but an attempt at a theme. This question is *harder* than simply picking a line and giving a superficial reason.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** Requires conceptual understanding, comparison, and examples. More complex than this question.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires sustained writing, organizing thoughts, and specific details. "Winter Sweater Baju Hot water Tea..." shows the struggle with paragraph structure and complete sentences, but they can list *what* they like. This question is somewhat comparable in terms of expressing a preference, but "why" is harder. Students could likely list *what* they like, but articulating *why* is tougher.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is recall from a story, directly stated. Much easier than interpreting, expressing preference, and justifying.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Pure recall of facts. Very easy for those who studied it.

**Conclusion based on likely errors:**

The requirement to both *denote a specific line* and *explain why* is a significant barrier.
