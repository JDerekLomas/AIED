Here's my thought process for estimating the pass rate for the "Battle of Plassey" question:

**1. Analyze the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question:** "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"
*   **Key terms:** "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "contribute," "expansion of British power," "India."
*   **Rubric:** "For explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)."
*   **Max score:** 1 (meaning a concise, correct answer is sufficient).

**2. Analyze Calibration Anchors:**

*   **5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and decent English expression. Very difficult.
*   **15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires understanding two distinct concepts and providing examples. Conceptual understanding plus specific recall. More accessible than the poem, but still requires structured knowledge.
*   **30% (Paragraph "My favorite season"):** Requires basic paragraph writing, personal expression, and some vocabulary. Very open-ended, allowing for partial credit even with poor English, as long as the topic is addressed. This is a *productive* task.
*   **50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Pure recall from a specific story. If they know the story, it's easy. If not, it's impossible. Low cognitive load if knowledge is present.
*   **66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Pure recall of specific facts. High probability if they've studied the topic. Very direct.

**3. Evaluate Cognitive Demands of the Plassey Question:**

*   **Recall:** Students need to remember the Battle of Plassey, its date (1757 is given, but linking it to the event is key), and its immediate consequence.
*   **Causal Linkage:** They need to understand *how* it contributed – it wasn't just a battle, but a turning point. This requires understanding the concept of political dominance and control.
*   **Specific Detail (optional but helpful):** Mentioning Mir Jafar or Bengal helps, but the core is "political dominance/control over Bengal."
*   **Language:** Requires expressing a historical cause-and-effect relationship in English. This is more complex than simple recall (like Fundamental Rights) or personal expression (My Favorite Season).

**4. Predict Common Errors and Misconceptions:**

*   **Lack of Knowledge:** Many students simply won't have studied this topic sufficiently or won't remember the details. This will lead to empty responses or vague incorrect answers.
*   **Partial Knowledge/Vagueness:**
    *   "British won." (True, but doesn't explain *how* it expanded power).
    *   "British became powerful." (Again, true, but lacks the "how").
    *   "It was an important battle." (Not specific enough).
    *   "Mir Jafar became king." (Close, but needs the "puppet" aspect or "British control").
*   **Geographical Misunderstanding:** Students might not connect it specifically to Bengal, or might generalize it to "all of India" immediately, missing the crucial first step of Bengal.
*   **Language Barrier:**
    *   Difficulty expressing "political dominance," "control," "puppet ruler." They might use simpler terms that don't quite hit the rubric, or struggle to form coherent sentences.
    *   Misunderstanding "contribute to expansion."
*   **Chronological Errors:** While the date is given, they might confuse it with other battles or events.
*   **Not attempting:** Given the average pass rate is 29%, and some questions are quite difficult, a significant portion might not even try if they feel they don't know the answer.

**5. Compare to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Harder than 66% (Fundamental Rights):** Plassey requires more than just recalling two facts; it requires explaining a consequence.
*   **Harder than 50% (King's questions):** While recall-based, Plassey requires a more nuanced answer than just listing.
*   **Similar to/Slightly Easier than 15% (Differentiate sources) in terms of conceptual understanding:** The Plassey question requires understanding a historical consequence, similar to understanding historical source types. However, the Plassey answer is a single concept (impact), whereas differentiating sources requires two concepts and comparison. The Plassey question is slightly more direct if the knowledge is there.
*   **Much Easier than 5% (Poem theme):** Plas
