The question asks to describe the poet's writing style. This question requires students to understand the concept of "writing style" and then apply it to a given poem (though the poem is not provided here, we are estimating based on the *type* of question). The rubric is quite open, accepting a single word like "simple," "descriptive," "informal," or "direct."

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

*   **Misconception about "Writing Style":** This is the biggest hurdle. Many Class 7 students, especially those with limited exposure to literary analysis, might not understand what "writing style" refers to. They might confuse it with the *topic* of the poem, the *poet's feelings*, or the *message*.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer 1 (Topic/Feeling):** Students might describe the theme or the emotion conveyed rather than the *how* it's conveyed. E.g., "The poet writes about nature," "The poet is sad," "The poet writes about love." These are not descriptions of *style*.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer 2 (Literary Device, without style context):** They might identify a literary device if it's very obvious (e.g., "rhyming") but not link it to a broader style description. "Rhyming" could be considered a part of style, but alone, it might not fully capture the rubric's intent unless implicitly understood as "simple and rhythmic" or similar.
*   **Vocabulary Limitations:** Even if a student grasps the concept of "writing style," they might lack the appropriate English vocabulary to articulate it. Words like "descriptive," "evocative," "metaphorical," "simple," "direct," "formal," "informal" might not be part of their active vocabulary.
    *   They might use simpler, less precise words that don't quite fit the rubric.
*   **No Attempt/Empty Response:** Given the abstract nature of "writing style," many students who don't understand the term will simply leave it blank or write something completely irrelevant (as seen in the 5% pass rate example).
*   **"Passage Dependency" Issue:** Without the actual poem, it's hard to judge. However, if the poem itself is complex or uses archaic language, understanding the *style* becomes even harder. Assuming the poems taught in Class 7 are relatively straightforward, the difficulty primarily lies in understanding the *question*.
*   **"Simple" as a default answer:** Some students might default to "simple" because many poems taught at this level are designed to be accessible. This could be a correct answer if the poem truly is simple in style.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate):** This is a conceptual question about literary analysis, similar in abstractness to "writing style." The low pass rate suggests that understanding abstract literary concepts and articulating them in English is very challenging. The prompt specifically asks for "theme or central idea," which is easier to grasp than "style," yet still yields a very low rate.
*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15% pass rate):** This requires understanding definitions and giving examples, which is more concrete than literary analysis.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My favorite season.'" (30% pass rate):** This is creative writing on a familiar topic. While it requires writing skills, it's less about abstract understanding.
*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50% pass rate):** This is a recall question from a specific text. If students have read the story, they can answer this. It requires understanding the text, but not abstract analysis.
*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights..." (66% pass rate):** This is pure recall of factual information.

**Conclusion:**

The question "Describes the poet’s writing style" is highly conceptual and requires both an understanding of literary analysis terminology and the ability to apply it. Based on the 5% pass rate for "theme or central idea," which is arguably *less* abstract than "writing style" for many students, I anticipate a very low pass rate. Students are likely to misunderstand "style," lack the vocabulary, or simply not attempt it. The rubric is lenient in accepting a single word, but getting *that* word correctly requires significant understanding.

Given that "theme or central idea" is at 5%, and "writing style" is arguably a more advanced concept, I would place it slightly higher than 5% because a simple word like "simple" or "descriptive" is acceptable, whereas theme might require a more complete thought. However, the fundamental conceptual difficulty remains very high for this demographic.
