The question asks for a personal opinion ("Do you think...") and requires a reason. This type of question often elicits attempts from students, even if their English is weak, as they feel they can express a personal view.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

*   **Misunderstanding "important in real life":** Students might not fully grasp the abstract concept of the "importance" of the questions in a general, real-world context. They might focus too narrowly on the story itself.
*   **Difficulty articulating a reason in English:** Even if they understand the question and agree, expressing a coherent reason in English will be a significant hurdle for students with limited English proficiency. They might struggle with vocabulary, sentence structure, and logical flow.
*   **Not recalling the king's questions accurately:** The previous question (pass rate 50%) asked to list the three questions. Some students might have gotten that wrong, or may struggle to connect those specific questions to their "real-life importance." However, the rubric implies that merely answering "yes" and giving *any valid reason* would suffice, so a perfect recall of the questions isn't strictly necessary if they can infer their general nature.
*   **Simple "Yes/No" without a reason:** Some students might just write "Yes" or "No" without elaborating, indicating an attempt but a failure to meet the "give one reason" part of the rubric.
*   **Irrelevant or nonsensical reasons:** Due to language limitations, some students might provide reasons that are tangential, poorly expressed, or don't logically connect to the importance of the questions.
*   **No attempt:** While the open-ended nature might encourage attempts, some students might still find it too challenging to formulate an answer in English.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% ("Write a theme..."):** This is highly abstract and requires nuanced understanding of literature and sophisticated expression. Our current question is less abstract, more personal.
*   **Pass rate 15% ("Differentiate..."):** This requires specific factual recall and comparison, which is generally harder than expressing an opinion if the language isn't a barrier.
*   **Pass rate 30% ("My favorite season"):** This is similar in structure (personal opinion + description) but allows for very simple, fragmented sentences as long as they convey some meaning. The key difference is the complexity of the *reason* required. "My favorite season is winter because I wear sweater" is much simpler than articulating *why* the king's questions are important.
*   **Pass rate 50% ("What were the three questions..."):** This is pure recall from the passage. Our question requires critical thinking and application beyond recall.
*   **Pass rate 66% ("Name any two Fundamental Rights..."):** This is direct recall of facts, which can be done with minimal English (e.g., "Right to equality, Right to freedom").

**Likely Common Wrong Answers:**

*   "Yes." (No reason given)
*   "Yes, it is important." (Too vague, no specific reason)
*   "Yes, because king is important." (Misunderstanding the subject of importance)
*   "Yes, for good life." (Vague reason, but possibly scoreable depending on interpretation)
*   Some attempt at a reason that is grammatically incorrect or unclear but might show intent (e.g., "Yes, because to know what time is right for do work.")

**Reasoning for Estimate:**

The question is opinion-based, which usually encourages more attempts than pure recall or complex analysis. The core concept (importance of making good decisions) is relatable. However, the requirement to provide a *reason* in English, when many students struggle with basic sentence construction, will significantly limit the pass rate. It's harder than simply naming facts but potentially easier than articulating a literary theme. It's probably harder than "My favorite season" because the *reason* for "My favorite season" can be very concrete (what they do, wear, eat), whereas the reason for the king's questions requires a slightly more abstract explanation of their utility.

Given the 30% anchor for "My favorite season" where simple descriptions counted, and the 50% anchor for pure recall, this question sits somewhere in between in terms of cognitive load and English proficiency. Students might understand "yes" but fail to articulate a reason. Many will attempt, but their reasons will often be too vague or grammatically flawed to meet the "valid reason" criterion.

I expect a significant number of "Yes" without a reason, or very poorly constructed reasons that don't quite make sense.
