This question asks about the main occupations in rural Rajasthan and requires a brief description of one. Let's break down the potential pitfalls and estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Potential Errors:**

*   **Social Science Misconceptions:**
    *   **Lack of Specific Knowledge about Rajasthan:** Many students might have a general idea of rural occupations in India (agriculture, animal husbandry) but might not specifically connect them to Rajasthan or understand the emphasis there. Rajasthan is known for its arid climate, impacting agriculture and making animal husbandry prominent.
    *   **Limited understanding of "Occupation":** While basic, some might struggle to differentiate "occupation" from other activities.
    *   **Difficulty in "Describing":** Even if they name an occupation, briefly describing it might be challenging for students with limited expressive English, leading to incomplete or simplistic answers that don't meet the "brief description" criterion.

*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Main occupations":** Most students should understand this.
    *   **"Rural areas":** This term should be generally understood, especially given the context of most students' backgrounds.
    *   **"Rajasthan":** Students are likely to recognize this as an Indian state.
    *   **"Describe any one in brief":** This is where English proficiency becomes crucial. A student might *know* what animal husbandry is but struggle to put it into a concise, understandable sentence or two in English. They might provide a list of animals rather than a description of the activity itself.

*   **Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**
    *   This is a factual recall question that relates to everyday life and general knowledge about India. Most students will likely attempt it. Even if they don't know specifically about Rajasthan, they might list general rural occupations.
    *   The "describe in brief" part might deter some or lead to very minimal attempts at description.

*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   **Generic list of occupations without specific Rajasthan relevance:** e.g., "Farmer, labourer, shopkeeper." While not entirely wrong, it lacks the specificity the question implies by mentioning Rajasthan.
    *   **Correct occupations but no description or insufficient description:** e.g., "Agriculture, Animal Husbandry." (Would get 0 if description is required for 1 mark, or partial if rubric allows for just naming). The rubric states "Names at least two main occupations correctly (e.g., Agriculture/farming, Animal Husbandry/pastoralism, handicrafts)." This implies *just* naming two correctly is enough for the mark. The "Describe any one in brief" part seems to be an added instruction for quality but the rubric focuses solely on naming two. This is crucial for estimation.
    *   **Listing things *made* by people in rural areas rather than their occupations:** e.g., "Pots, clothes."
    *   **Partial or incorrect naming of occupations:** e.g., "Farming, animals."

**Revisiting the Rubric:**

"Names at least two main occupations correctly (e.g., Agriculture/farming, Animal Husbandry/pastoralism, handicrafts)."
"Max score: 1"

This rubric is surprisingly lenient. It *only* requires naming two correct occupations. The instruction "Describe any one in brief" seems to be part of the question's expectation but is *not* reflected in the scoring rubric for this 1-mark item. This significantly increases the pass rate. If description were required, the pass rate would be much lower.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Pass Rate 50% ("What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"):** This is pure recall from a text, often requiring verbatim or near-verbatim answers, but the concepts are straightforward.
*   **Pass Rate 66% ("Name any two Fundamental Rights..."):** This is also factual recall, but "Fundamental Rights" is a core concept taught in Social Science, and students are likely to know at least two, even if simplified. The answer is short.

Our question requires naming two common occupations. Agriculture and Animal Husbandry are extremely common and widely known rural occupations across India. Even without specific knowledge of Rajasthan, these are highly probable guesses that would be correct. The lack of a description requirement makes this even easier.

Students from "economically weaker sections" often have direct or indirect experience with these occupations, making them highly recognizable. They might use terms like "kheti" (farming) and "pashupalan" (animal rearing) and then translate or transliterate them.

Given that just naming two is enough, and these are very common activities, the difficulty is relatively low. It's comparable to the "Fundamental Rights" question in terms of requiring two specific pieces of information.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:** 70%
