Here's an analysis of the likely errors and an estimated pass rate for the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

*   **Misconceptions about Social Science (Geography in this case):**
    *   **Limited Geographical Knowledge:** Many students, especially from economically weaker sections, might have limited exposure to detailed geography beyond their immediate surroundings. They might know the Himalayas as "the big mountains to the north" but struggle to name other specific ranges.
    *   **Confusion with States/Cities/Rivers:** Students might confuse mountain ranges with other geographical features like major rivers (Ganga, Yamuna), states (Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan), or even large cities. They might have learned lists of these things and mix them up.
    *   **Lack of Specific Terminology:** They might know what a mountain is but not the specific names of the ranges.
    *   **Knowing only one:** They might know the Himalayas but struggle to recall a second one. The rubric only requires one for 0.5 points, which is significant.

*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Major":** While "major" is a relatively simple English word, some students might struggle if they only know very local hills or smaller ranges and don't understand the scale implied by "major."
    *   **"Located in India":** This is generally straightforward, but some might name a range that borders India but is primarily outside (e.g., parts of the Karakoram, though technically it's also in India).

*   **Attempt Rate:**
    *   This is a recall-based question. Students are likely to *attempt* it if they have any idea. An empty response would suggest a complete lack of knowledge.
    *   Many will likely write something, even if incorrect, rather than leaving it blank, especially if they recognize "mountain" and "India."

*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   **Himalayas only:** This is highly probable. Many will get one correct.
    *   **Names of rivers:** Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari.
    *   **Names of states/cities:** Delhi, Mumbai, Rajasthan.
    *   **Generic "Mountains" or "Big Mountains":** Not specific enough.
    *   **Local hills/mountains:** Naming a local, non-major range if they lack broader geographical knowledge.
    *   **Spelling errors:** Expected, but generally wouldn't lead to a score of 0 if the range is identifiable.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Pass rate 15%: "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..."** This requires understanding concepts and giving examples. It's more complex than just recall.
*   **Pass rate 30%: "Write a short paragraph... on 'My favorite season.'"** This is personal and allows for simple sentences and basic vocabulary, but requires forming a coherent paragraph. The "Winter / Sweater / Baju" example shows how basic responses still score.
*   **Pass rate 50%: "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"** This is pure recall from a specific story. Students either know it or they don't. It's similar in cognitive demand to naming mountain ranges. The key difference is that the story might be more recent or salient than geography lessons for some.
*   **Pass rate 66%: "Name any two Fundamental Rights..."** This is also recall. Many students would have been repeatedly exposed to this in Social Science/Civics. It's often taught directly.

**Reasoning for Estimate:**

The question about mountain ranges is pure factual recall, similar to the "king's questions" and "fundamental rights." However, geographical knowledge, especially specific names of ranges beyond the very obvious, can be less consistently reinforced than fundamental rights or popular stories.

*   Almost everyone will likely know the **Himalayas**. This alone gets them 0.5 points (which is the maximum score for the rubric).
*   Knowing a *second* major range (Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western/Eastern Ghats) requires a slightly deeper geographical understanding.

Given the rubric allows for maximum points for just *one* correct answer, this significantly boosts the pass rate compared to needing two. The 50% anchor (king's questions) required recall of *three* specific items. This question, requiring essentially *one* for full credit, is easier. The 66% anchor (fundamental rights) required *two* correct answers for full credit.

I anticipate a significant number of students will name the Himalayas. A smaller but still substantial group might also name one other, or just one and still get the points.

Considering the 50% and 66% anchors, and the
