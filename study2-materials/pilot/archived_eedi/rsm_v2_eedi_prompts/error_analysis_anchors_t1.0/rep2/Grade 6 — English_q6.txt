Let's break down the likely student responses and errors for the question: "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"

**Analysis of the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question:** Requires two parts:
    1.  Identify a specific line from the poem.
    2.  Provide a reason/justification for liking that line.
*   **Rubric (Max score: 1.5):** "Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why." This implies both parts are necessary for a full score. A partial score might be given for just identifying a line, or maybe a very weak "why." Given the "Max score 1.5," it's likely that just stating a line is insufficient for a full pass. A "pass" (score 1 or 1.5) will almost certainly require *both* elements.

**Likely Errors and Student Behavior:**

1.  **No Poem Provided:** A crucial missing piece of information is *which poem* students are referring to. If this question is given in isolation, or if the poem was given much earlier and students have forgotten it, this will be a massive hurdle. *Assuming a poem has just been read or is present in the exam paper.* If the poem is not there, the pass rate would be almost 0.

2.  **Misunderstanding "Line from the poem":**
    *   Students might write their *own* sentence about the poem's theme, rather than quoting an actual line.
    *   They might summarize a part of the poem in their own words, thinking that's a "line."
    *   They might remember a concept but not the exact wording.

3.  **Misunderstanding "like the most":**
    *   Some might just identify a part of the poem that they understand, not necessarily "like."
    *   They might just copy a random line without genuine preference.

4.  **Misunderstanding/Difficulty with "why":** This is likely the biggest hurdle.
    *   **Lack of Vocabulary/Expressive Skills:** Students from EWS backgrounds with limited English often struggle to articulate abstract reasons or personal preferences in English. They might know *why* in their native language but can't translate it effectively.
    *   **Simplicity:** Their "why" might be very basic ("It is good," "I like it," "It is happy"). While simple, if it connects to the line, it might get credit.
    *   **Irrelevant Reasons:** They might give a reason that has nothing to do with the line chosen or the poem's context.
    *   **No "Why" at all:** Many will just quote a line and stop, thinking that's enough.

5.  **Copying the whole poem/stanza:** Some might just copy a large chunk of the poem, hoping one line within it counts. This would likely fail the "denotes a line" part unless they specifically highlight one.

6.  **No Attempt:** Some students, especially those struggling with English comprehension or expression, might leave it blank rather than attempting a difficult two-part answer.

**Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **"I like this poem."** (No line, no specific why)
*   **A line copied from the poem, with no "why."** (Partial attempt, likely not a pass)
*   **"This line is good." / "I like this."** (Potentially a pass if the line is identified, but a very weak justification)
*   **A summary of the poem's content, not a specific line.**
*   **An answer in their native language.**

**Comparing to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% ("Write a theme or central idea..."):** This requires abstract thinking and expression, very difficult for these students. Our question requires less abstraction (personal preference) but still needs articulation.
*   **Pass Rate 15% ("Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..."):** Requires factual recall and comparative analysis. More structured than our question, but also demanding.
*   **Pass Rate 30% ("Write a short paragraph... My favorite season."):** This is the closest comparison. It requires personal expression about a familiar topic. The *length* (6-8 lines) makes it harder, but the content is accessible. Students could string together simple sentences. Our question is shorter in output but requires *analysis of a text* (the poem) and then *personal justification*.
*   **Pass Rate 50% ("What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"):** Pure recall from a story. If they remember, it's easy. Our question requires recall (the line) *and* generation (the why).
*   **Pass Rate
