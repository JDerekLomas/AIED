The question asks for an opinion and a reason, linking the king's questions to real life. The previous question (pass rate 50%) asked to list the three questions the king wanted to answer, so students who answered that correctly will already know the questions.

Here's an analysis of potential errors and success factors:

**Factors increasing pass rate:**

*   **Opinion-based:** Students don't need to recall specific facts from the text beyond the king's questions (which they might have just answered). They can provide any plausible reason.
*   **Simple Language:** The question uses relatively straightforward English: "Do you think...", "important in real life?", "Give one reason."
*   **Relatability:** The concept of "right time," "right thing," and "right people" is universally relatable, even if students don't articulate it perfectly.
*   **Low Bar for "Valid Reason":** Given the general low pass rates and the nature of opinion questions, even a very simple, loosely connected reason might be accepted (e.g., "Yes, because it helps us to do work").

**Factors decreasing pass rate (Likely Errors):**

*   **Understanding "Important in real life":** Some students might struggle to abstract the king's philosophical questions to their own daily lives or general importance. They might interpret "real life" too literally or struggle with the concept of practical application.
*   **Formulating a Reason:** Even if they agree it's important, articulating *why* it's important in a coherent sentence (or two) can be challenging for students with limited English proficiency.
    *   **Common Wrong Answers:**
        *   "Yes" (without a reason).
        *   "Yes, it is good." (too vague, might not be accepted).
        *   Repetitive statements: "Yes, because it is important."
        *   Attempts to explain *what* the questions are again, rather than *why* they are important.
        *   Grammatical errors making the reason unclear.
*   **Misunderstanding the King's Questions:** While the previous question tested recall, some students might have gotten it wrong, or struggle to hold those questions in mind while answering this follow-up. If they don't know the king's questions, they can't effectively comment on their real-life importance.
*   **Attempt vs. Failure:** Many students will likely attempt this because it's an opinion question and they might grasp "important." However, the quality of the "reason" will be the deciding factor. Many attempts might be too vague, grammatically incorrect, or simply rephrase the question without adding a valid reason.
*   **No Attempt:** Some may simply leave it blank if they are unsure how to formulate an answer in English or haven't grasped the core meaning.

**Comparison to Anchors:**

*   **"My favorite season" (30%):** This required writing 6-8 lines, which is significantly more complex in terms of sustained writing and vocabulary. This question only requires one reason.
*   **"King's three questions" (50%):** This was direct recall from the passage. Students who got this might be primed for this follow-up.
*   **"Fundamental Rights" (66%):** This was direct recall of factual information. Students generally do better with direct facts if they know them.

This question requires a slightly higher level of critical thinking and expression than simple recall but is less demanding than a multi-sentence paragraph. The "valid reason" criterion is key. Many students might offer very simplistic reasons.

Given that 50% could list the questions, a good portion of those would likely attempt this. The hurdle is articulating a *valid* reason. Many might just say "yes" or provide a very weak reason.

I expect the pass rate to be *lower* than the "Fundamental Rights" (66%) because it requires more than just recall, but *higher* than "My favorite season" (30%) because the output required is much smaller and the concept is directly related to prior context. It's likely to be slightly higher than the "King's questions" (50%) given the opinion-based nature, assuming they recall the questions. However, the requirement for a "reason" will weed out many who can only provide a "yes."

Let's consider the breakdown:
*   Those who don't know the king's questions (around 50% from the previous item) will struggle or fail.
*   Of the 50% who do know the questions, how many can articulate a valid reason? Some will say "yes" without a reason (score 0). Some will give a very basic reason like "it helps to live life better" or "it
