I will break down the thought process for estimating the pass rate for the given question.

**1. Analyze the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question:** "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"
*   **Rubric:** "For explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)." Max score: 1.

**Key elements required for a correct answer:**
    *   Mention of Battle of Plassey (implicit, as it's in the question).
    *   Link to British *victory*.
    *   Consequence: Establishment of British *political dominance/control*.
    *   Location: *Bengal*.
    *   (Optional but helpful example): Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab.

**2. Consider the Student Cohort (Class 8, Indian Government Schools, EWS, Limited English, Avg. Pass Rate 29%):**

*   **Social Science Knowledge:** Class 8 history curriculum in India heavily covers the British Raj, and the Battle of Plassey is a foundational event. Students would have been taught about it.
*   **Language (English):** This is a significant barrier. Students struggle with complex sentence structures, precise vocabulary, and articulating nuanced historical concepts in English.
*   **Writing Ability:** Even with correct knowledge, expressing it clearly and concisely for a 1-mark question can be challenging.
*   **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is crucial context. It means the average question is quite difficult for this group.

**3. Analyze Calibration Anchors:**

*   **5% (Poem Theme):** Very difficult, abstract concept, requires deep comprehension and articulation.
*   **15% (Archaeological vs. Literary Sources):** Requires differentiation and examples, somewhat conceptual, but definitional.
*   **30% (Favorite Season Paragraph):** More creative writing, less factual recall, but requires coherence and structure. Shows students can write *something* if it's relatable.
*   **50% (King's Three Questions):** Factual recall from a specific story. High recall, low conceptual understanding needed. If they know the story, they know the questions.
*   **66% (Fundamental Rights - any two):** Very direct factual recall. Basic civics knowledge. If they learned it, they can state two.

**4. Brainstorm Potential Errors and Misconceptions for *This Specific Question*:**

*   **Knowledge Gaps:**
    *   Students might remember the Battle of Plassey but not its specific *consequences* for British power. They might just know it was a significant battle.
    *   They might confuse it with other battles or events.
    *   They might recall "British power increased" but fail to connect it to *political dominance in Bengal* or the puppet nawab.
*   **Language Barriers:**
    *   Difficulty articulating "political dominance," "control," "puppet nawab," "exploitation." They might use simpler, less precise terms.
    *   Struggling to form a coherent sentence or two that links cause and effect.
    *   Misunderstanding "contribute to the expansion." They might describe the battle itself rather than its *contribution* to expansion.
*   **Common Wrong Answers/Partial Answers:**
    *   "British won the battle." (Correct, but doesn't explain *how* it expanded power beyond the victory itself).
    *   "It helped British." (Too vague).
    *   "Mir Jafar became king." (Partial, but misses the "puppet" aspect and British control).
    *   "British started to rule India." (Overly broad, Plassey was a start, not the full establishment of rule over all India).
    *   Just stating facts about the battle (e.g., between Siraj-ud-Daulah and Robert Clive).
    *   Empty response due to lack of confidence or inability to form an answer in English.

*   **Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?** Given it's a major historical event, most would likely *attempt* it, even if their answer is incomplete or poorly worded. Few empty responses for this specific question, unlike the abstract poem theme.

**5. Compare to Calibration Anchors:**

*   This question requires more than simple factual recall (like the Fundamental Rights or King's questions). It asks for a *causal link* and a specific *consequence*.
*   It's less abstract than the "Poem Theme" but requires more specific historical context and analytical thinking than "Favorite Season."
*   It's more specific
