## Analysis of Question and Likely Errors:

**Question:** Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there.

**Rubric:** Mentions two correct natural resources (e.g., water, Marble, Copper, Sandstone, Gypsum, mica, limestone, zinc, salt, Sunlight for solar energy, Wind for wind energy). Max score: 1

**Likely Errors and Considerations:**

1.  **Recall of Natural Resources (Rajasthan Specific):**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might struggle to recall *specific* natural resources *unique to Rajasthan*. They might list general natural resources (trees, rivers, air, soil) without knowing if they are significant in Rajasthan.
    *   **Language:** The term "natural resources" might be understood generally, but "found in Rajasthan" requires specific geographical knowledge.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** Listing generic resources like "trees," "animals," "soil," "rivers" without linking them to Rajasthan's prominent resources. Some might even guess resources from other regions of India.
    *   **Attempt vs. Fail:** Many will attempt this part, but get it wrong due to lack of specific knowledge.

2.  **Explanation of Influence:**
    *   **Difficulty:** This is the harder part. Students need to link a resource to its impact on people's lives (e.g., water scarcity leading to specific agricultural practices, marble for crafts/architecture, minerals for mining jobs).
    *   **Misconception:** Students might state the resource but fail to explain the *influence*. They might just say "water is important" instead of "lack of water leads to people relying on wells and growing drought-resistant crops."
    *   **Language:** Explaining "how it influences" requires more complex sentence structure and vocabulary than simply listing.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:**
        *   Just listing the resources without explanation.
        *   Providing a very vague explanation (e.g., "water is useful for life").
        *   Confusing influence with mere presence (e.g., "marble is found in Rajasthan").
    *   **Attempt vs. Fail:** Many will attempt to list resources but fail to provide a coherent explanation of influence. Some might provide a very rudimentary and insufficient explanation.

3.  **Language Barrier (English):**
    *   Students might know the concepts in their native language but struggle to articulate them accurately in English.
    *   Vocabulary for specific minerals (marble, gypsum, mica, zinc) might be an issue.
    *   Forming a sentence explaining "influence" can be challenging.

4.  **Incomplete Answers:**
    *   Students might correctly identify one resource but not two.
    *   They might identify two resources but completely skip the explanation part.
    *   Given the "Max score: 1" and the expectation to mention *two* resources *and* explain *one*, a partial answer (e.g., only one resource listed) would likely result in 0.

5.  **Not Attempting:** Social Science questions often have higher attempt rates than abstract English questions. Most students will try to write something.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of poem):** This requires deep comprehension and abstract thought, very difficult for this group.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate sources):** Requires conceptual understanding and examples. More factual recall than the poem, but still requires structured thinking.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Favorite season paragraph):** This is a personal, narrative task. It allows for simpler language and personal experience, but requires forming coherent sentences and meeting a length requirement. The "Winter / Sweater / Baju" example shows how basic responses can score.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions king wanted):** This is pure recall of a specific detail from a story. If they read the story, it's straightforward.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is specific factual recall from Civics. If taught, it's a direct answer. Examples show correct answers are concise lists.

**This question (Rajasthan resources) is similar in difficulty to the "Fundamental Rights" (66%) and "King's questions" (50%) in terms of requiring factual recall, but it adds a layer of *explanation* which makes it harder. The specificity of Rajasthan's resources is also a hurdle. The explanation part pushes it closer to the 30% mark (paragraph writing) in terms of requiring more than just a list, but it's less subjective than "favorite season."**

*   Students are likely to recall *some* resources (water, sand, sunlight are common knowledge for Rajasthan
