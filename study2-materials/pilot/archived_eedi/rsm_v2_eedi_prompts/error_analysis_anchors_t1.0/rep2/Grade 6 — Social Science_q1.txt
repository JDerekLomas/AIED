I will break this down into a thinking process and then provide the estimated proportion.

**Thinking Process:**

1.  **Analyze the Question:**
    *   "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."
    *   Key terms: "two," "major mountain ranges," "located in India."
    *   This is a factual recall question.
    *   The rubric is generous: "Names one correct mountain range" gets 0.5 points. This means even if they only name one, they pass.

2.  **Analyze the Target Audience:**
    *   Class 6 students, Indian government schools.
    *   Economically weaker sections, limited English.
    *   Average pass rate (across *all* questions) is 29%. This is a crucial baseline.

3.  **Consult Calibration Anchors:**
    *   **5% pass rate (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and expression. Very hard.
    *   **15% pass rate (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires understanding concepts, comparison, and examples. Moderate difficulty, but often taught with specific definitions.
    *   **30% pass rate (Paragraph "My favorite season"):** Requires personal expression, some structure, and basic English writing. Many attempts, some success.
    *   **50% pass rate (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Factual recall from a story. If they read the story, it's straightforward.
    *   **66% pass rate (Two Fundamental Rights):** Factual recall, but these are *very* commonly taught and repeated in Civics. High salience.

4.  **Compare "Mountain Ranges" to Anchors:**
    *   **Difficulty:** This question is similar to "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%) and "Two Fundamental Rights" (66%) in that it's factual recall.
    *   **Salience:** Mountain ranges, especially the Himalayas, are *extremely* prominent in Indian geography curricula from a young age. Aravallis, Vindhyas, Satpuras, Ghats are also fundamental.
    *   **Specificity:** Naming *any two* is easier than specific details or interpretations.
    *   **English Requirement:** Only requires naming, not explanation or complex sentences. "Himalayas" is a single word.

5.  **Anticipate Errors and Misconceptions:**
    *   **No Attempt:** Some students might just leave it blank due to lack of knowledge or confidence in English.
    *   **One Correct, One Incorrect/Blank:** This is allowed by the rubric (score 0.5). Many might know "Himalayas" but struggle for a second.
    *   **Only One Correct:** This counts as a pass.
    *   **Incorrect Names (Geographical Misconceptions):**
        *   Naming states/cities instead of ranges (e.g., "Delhi," "Rajasthan"). Less likely for mountains, but possible for a very weak student.
        *   Naming rivers instead of mountains (e.g., "Ganga," "Yamuna"). Possible confusion.
        *   Naming foreign mountain ranges (e.g., "Andes," "Alps"). Less likely given the "located in India" constraint, but possible if they just remember "mountains" in general.
        *   Confusing plateaus or hills for major ranges (e.g., "Deccan Plateau" - not a mountain range).
    *   **Spelling Errors:** "Himalaya" might be misspelled (e.g., "Himalya," "Hemalaya"). The rubric typically allows for phonetic spelling if the intent is clear.
    *   **Language Barrier:** The words "major mountain ranges" are straightforward. "Located in India" is also clear. Minimal linguistic complexity.

6.  **Estimate Likelihood of Success:**
    *   **High Salience:** Himalayas are iconic. Even students with weak general knowledge often know this.
    *   **Low Cognitive Load:** Pure recall, not analysis or synthesis.
    *   **Generous Rubric:** Naming *one* gets a pass. This significantly boosts the pass rate.
    *   **Comparison to "Fundamental Rights" (66%):** Fundamental Rights are generally drilled more in Civics. However, basic geography like the Himalayas is introduced very early and reinforced. The concept of "mountain range" is also physically tangible, unlike abstract "rights."
    *   **Comparison to "King's questions" (50%):** That was recall from a specific story they might or might not have paid attention to. Mountain ranges are part of the core curriculum that is constantly revisited.

7.  **Refine the Estimate:**
