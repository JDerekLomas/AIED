I will analyze the question and the calibration anchors to estimate the pass rate for "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away."

**Analysis of the Question:**

*   **Concept:** Active to Passive Voice transformation. This is a grammatical concept taught in English language classes.
*   **Vocabulary:** "wind," "blew" (past tense of blow), "leaves," "away." All are common, relatively simple words.
*   **Structure:** SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) in active voice: "The wind (S) blew (V) the leaves (O) away."
*   **Transformation:** Requires understanding:
    *   The object ("the leaves") becomes the new subject.
    *   The verb ("blew") needs to be changed to the past participle ("blown") and combined with an appropriate form of "to be" (past tense, plural: "were").
    *   The original subject ("the wind") can be introduced with "by the wind" (optional but standard).
    *   The adverbial "away" remains.
    *   Result: "The leaves were blown away by the wind."

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Lack of Understanding of Voice:** Many students, especially at this level, might not even know what "active voice" or "passive voice" means. The terminology itself can be a barrier.
2.  **Verb Form Confusion (Past Participle):** "Blew" is an irregular verb. Students might struggle to recall "blown" and instead use "blowed" or keep "blew." This is a very common error in past participle usage.
3.  **Incorrect "to be" Verb:** They might use "is," "are," "was," "has been," "have been" incorrectly, not matching tense or number with the new subject.
4.  **Omitting "by the wind":** This is a minor error, but for a "correctly transforms" rubric, it might be scored as less than perfect, though likely still a pass if the core transformation is there. However, the rubric explicitly states "The leaves were blown away by the wind," suggesting the "by the wind" part is expected.
5.  **Subject/Object Confusion:** They might not correctly identify the object to make it the new subject.
6.  **Word Order Issues:** Even if they get the core components, they might jumble the word order (e.g., "The leaves blown away were by the wind").
7.  **No Attempt/Empty Response:** If they don't understand the question or the concept, they will leave it blank or simply rewrite the original sentence.
8.  **Rewriting in Present Tense:** They might change the tense instead of the voice, e.g., "The wind blows the leaves away."
9.  **Changing Meaning:** They might try to rephrase the sentence in a way that changes its original meaning.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of Poem):** Requires interpretive English, abstract thinking, and ability to articulate a complex idea concisely. This is very difficult for students with limited English.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate Archaeological/Literary Sources):** Requires specific historical knowledge and the ability to differentiate and provide examples. The terminology itself is academic. Some students got partial credit for listing types, showing some recall but not full understanding.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph "My Favorite Season"):** Requires sustained writing, creativity, and adherence to prompts (what to do, eat, wear). Many responses are fragmented or too short, showing a struggle with sentence construction and elaboration.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three Questions King Wanted to Answer):** This is a recall question from a specific text. If they remembered the story, it's straightforward. The challenge is memory and accurately phrasing the three questions. Many got it partially right.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is a direct recall of factual information, often memorized. While terminology can be complex, it's likely drilled. Even with some spelling errors, the core idea is likely accepted.

**Estimating the Pass Rate:**

The question about active/passive voice falls somewhere between the recall of specific facts (50-66%) and the more complex writing tasks (5-30%).

*   It's not pure recall like the Fundamental Rights, as it requires transformation, not just memory.
*   It's less abstract and interpretive than finding a poem's theme.
*   It's more constrained than writing a paragraph about a favorite season, as there's only one correct answer structure.
*   The primary
