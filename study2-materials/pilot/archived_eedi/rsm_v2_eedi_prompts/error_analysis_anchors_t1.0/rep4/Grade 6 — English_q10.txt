I will analyze the question and the provided calibration anchors to estimate the pass rate for "Choose the correct word. There are (some/any) apples in the basket."

**Analysis of the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question Type:** Multiple choice (implied, as they need to "choose the correct word"). It's a basic grammar question about the usage of "some" vs. "any."
*   **Target Audience:** Class 6 students in Indian government schools, mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English. Average pass rate ~29%.
*   **Correct Answer:** "some"
*   **Rubric:** Selects 'some' for 1 mark.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **"Some" vs. "Any" Misunderstanding:** This is the core challenge.
    *   Students might not fully grasp that "some" is generally used in affirmative sentences, while "any" is used in negative sentences and questions.
    *   They might have heard "any" used in a similar context (e.g., "Are there *any* apples?"), leading to confusion.
    *   Lack of formal grammar instruction or inconsistent exposure to natural English usage could be a major factor.
2.  **Guessing:** Given it's a two-option choice, a significant portion might guess correctly (50% chance if guessing randomly). However, if there's a strong leaning towards one word due to other misconceptions, this might skew.
3.  **No Attempt/Lack of Understanding:** While it's a simple choice, some students might not understand the question at all, or might simply pick one randomly without any linguistic reasoning. However, "there are apples in the basket" is a very common sentence structure.
4.  **Influence of Native Language:** While English grammar rules for "some/any" can be tricky, the concept of "some quantity" vs. "any quantity" exists in most languages. The difficulty lies in mapping it to the specific English words and their usage rules.

**Common Wrong Answer:**

*   The most common wrong answer would be "There are **any** apples in the basket." This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of "some" vs. "any" usage in affirmative sentences.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and good English writing skills. Very difficult. This question is much simpler.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires knowledge of history concepts, comparison skills, and ability to give examples. More complex than our question.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires creative writing, sentence construction, and adherence to specific prompts. This question is a single word choice.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Requires recall of specific information from a story. This is a memory-based task. Our question is a grammar rule. Students often perform better on recall than open-ended writing.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Requires recall of specific civic knowledge. This is direct factual recall. Our question is about applying a grammar rule.

**Estimating the Pass Rate:**

*   **Simplicity:** The question is a very simple multiple-choice grammar rule application. There are only two options.
*   **Common Phrase:** "There are some apples..." is a very common construction. Even with limited English, students might have encountered this phrase and instinctively recognize it.
*   **Lower English Proficiency:** The limited English and economically weaker background will definitely pull the score down. They might not have been explicitly taught the "some/any" rule, or might confuse it easily.
*   **Guessing Factor:** With a 50/50 chance, if students just guess, half would get it right. However, understanding influences the "guess."

Let's consider the difficulty:

*   It's harder than simply recalling two fundamental rights (66%) because it requires *application* of a rule, not just recall.
*   It's easier than writing a paragraph (30%) or differentiating concepts (15%) because it's a single word choice.
*   It's probably comparable to, or slightly easier than, recalling the three questions (50%), as "some" is a very high-frequency word in this context.

Many students might attempt, and many might get it wrong by picking "any." However, the sheer simplicity of the task (picking one word out of two for a very common sentence structure) means that a good portion, even those with limited English, might either know it from exposure or guess correctly.

Given that the average
