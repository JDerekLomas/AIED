Errors leading to incorrect answers:

*   **Misunderstanding "per hour"**: Students might misinterpret "per hour" as a one-time increase, or an increase per *two* hours, or simply add 2 degrees only once.
*   **Time Calculation Errors**: This is likely the biggest hurdle.
    *   **AM/PM confusion**: They might not correctly transition from AM to PM.
    *   **Simple subtraction**: They might try to do `4 - 10 = -6` or `10 - 4 = 6` without understanding the time elapsed.
    *   **Counting on fingers errors**: Even if they count, they might miscount. `10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4` gives 7 hours if starting count from 10, or 6 hours if counting *intervals*. This is a very common mistake. (10-11, 11-12, 12-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4 -> 6 intervals).
    *   **Not understanding the 12-hour clock**: Some might struggle with the transition from 12 pm to 1 pm.
*   **Arithmetic Errors**: Even if they get 6 hours, `30 + (6 * 2)` could lead to `30 + 12 = 42`. Basic multiplication or addition errors are possible, but less likely to be the primary cause of *failing the entire question* compared to time calculation.
*   **Language Barrier**: "At 10 am in the morning", "4:00 in the evening" and "increases by 2 degrees C per hour" are fairly straightforward. "Temperature" and "Jodhpur" are unlikely to cause issues. "per hour" is the only phrase that might cause some specific confusion.
*   **Not Attempting / Failing to understand the core problem**: Students might see numbers and try to add/subtract them randomly without understanding the story.

**Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **32°C**: If they only add 2 degrees once, assuming it's a single increase.
*   **44°C (if they calculate 7 hours)**: `30 + (7 * 2) = 30 + 14 = 44`. This is highly probable due to counting 10 am as the first hour.
*   **38°C (if they calculate 4 hours)**: `30 + (4 * 2) = 30 + 8 = 38`. This could happen if they only consider the "4" in "4:00 pm" as the number of hours.
*   **Answers involving subtraction**: Less likely given "increases".
*   **Random numbers**: If they just try to combine numbers without a clear strategy.

**Likely Pass Rate Analysis:**

*   **Calibration Anchors:**
    *   Pass rate 5% (theme of poem): Requires abstract thinking and expressing it in English. Very difficult.
    *   Pass rate 15% (differentiate archaeological/literary sources): Requires factual recall, comparison, and examples. More structured but still conceptual.
    *   Pass rate 30% (paragraph on favorite season): Requires creative writing, sentence construction, and adherence to prompts. Relatable but requires effort.
    *   Pass rate 50% (three questions the king wanted to answer): Direct recall of a specific detail from a story. Simpler if they remember the story.
    *   Pass rate 66% (two Fundamental Rights): Direct recall of specific facts. Easier if they have studied civics.

*   **This question combines:**
    *   **Basic Arithmetic (multiplication and addition):** Relatively easy for Class 6.
    *   **Time Calculation (elapsed time across AM/PM):** This is the tricky part. It's a common area of confusion even for students with decent math skills. It's not a direct recall question, but requires logical sequencing.

*   **Comparison:**
    *   It's harder than the 50% "King's questions" because it requires calculation and understanding time, not just recall.
    *   It's likely harder than the 66% "Fundamental Rights" for the same reason.
    *   It might be comparable to the 30% "Favorite Season" in terms of cognitive load, but with a more definitive "right" answer. The "Favorite Season" allows for some variability in quality, while this is right or wrong.
    *   The time calculation aspect makes it more challenging than just simple multiplication. The common error of getting 7 hours instead of 6
