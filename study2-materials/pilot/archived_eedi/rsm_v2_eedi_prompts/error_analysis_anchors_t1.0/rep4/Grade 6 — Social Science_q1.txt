Here's a breakdown of the likely errors and an estimated pass rate for the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

*   **Misconceptions about Social Science (Geography):**
    *   **Lack of Specific Knowledge:** Many students, especially those with limited exposure to geography outside of their immediate surroundings, might simply not know the names of major mountain ranges in India. Geography can often be rote memorization, and if it hasn't been emphasized, the knowledge won't be there.
    *   **Confusing Mountains with Hills/Plateaus/Rivers:** Students might confuse mountain ranges with other prominent geographical features like hills (e.g., Nilgiri Hills, though Western/Eastern Ghats are ranges), plateaus (Deccan Plateau), or even major rivers (Ganga, Yamuna). They might know *of* certain areas but not categorize them correctly as "mountain ranges."
    *   **Local vs. Major:** They might only know very localized hills or small ranges near their villages/towns rather than the "major" ones asked for.
    *   **Incomplete Recall:** They might remember one correct range but struggle to recall a second, leading to a partial answer or just one correct answer.

*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Major":** While "major" is a common word, some might not fully grasp its implication in a geographical context, leading them to list less significant local features if they are known.
    *   **"Mountain Ranges":** The term "mountain ranges" itself should be understood. While many students will understand "mountain," "range" (as a series of connected mountains) might be slightly more abstract than individual mountains.
    *   **"Located in India":** This is quite clear and unlikely to be a source of error unless they have extremely poor geographical context (e.g., naming a range outside India).

*   **Attempt Rate:**
    *   This question is relatively straightforward in its request for factual recall. Most students are likely to *attempt* an answer, even if it's just one name or an incorrect one. They won't leave it blank due to complexity.

*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   **Hills:** "Nilgiri Hills," "Aravali Hills" (even though Aravalli is a range, some might refer to it as hills).
    *   **Rivers:** "Ganga," "Yamuna."
    *   **Cities/States:** Random names of places they know.
    *   **Plateaus:** "Deccan Plateau."
    *   **Generic "Mountain":** Just writing "mountain" or "big mountain."
    *   **Only one correct answer:** Many might get one (e.g., Himalayas) but struggle for a second, thus getting only 0.5 score.

**Rubric Consideration:**
The rubric is quite generous: "Names one correct mountain range... Max score: 0.5." This means getting just one correct name (like Himalayas) will get them the pass. This significantly increases the pass rate compared to needing two correct answers.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and good language skills to articulate a theme. This question is far simpler.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires understanding two distinct concepts, comparing them, and providing examples. More complex than naming mountain ranges.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires personal expression, organizing thoughts into a paragraph, and adherence to specific prompts (what to do, eat, wear). While personal, it demands more structured writing and varied vocabulary.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is factual recall from a specific story. If they knew the story, it's easy. If not, impossible. The question here is similar in type (factual recall), but perhaps the *prominence* of mountain ranges in India's geography makes it more universally known than a specific story detail.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is also factual recall. Fundamental Rights are a very important part of Civics/Political Science education in India. The pass rate is high, suggesting that this knowledge is well-drilled. Mountain ranges, while important, might not receive the same level of dedicated memorization as fundamental rights.

**Estimation:**

The question asks for *two* major ranges, but the rubric gives 0.5 for *one* correct answer.
The Himalayas are almost universally known. Aravallis, Vindhyas, Satpuras, and the Ghats are also prominent in textbooks.
