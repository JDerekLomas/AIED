Here's an analysis of the question and likely student responses, leading to an estimated pass rate:

**Analysis of the Question and Rubric:**

*   **Question:** "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"
*   **Rubric (Max score: 1):** Explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab).

**Likely Errors and Student Behavior:**

1.  **Lack of Specific Historical Knowledge (Attempt but Fail):**
    *   Many students might know *of* the Battle of Plassey and that it was important for the British, but struggle to articulate *how* it contributed to their power.
    *   They might mention "British won," "Mir Jafar betrayed Siraj-ud-Daulah," or "British got rich" without connecting it to political dominance or control over Bengal.
    *   They might recall the year and name of the battle but not its direct consequences for British power expansion.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "The British won the Battle of Plassey and became powerful." (Too vague, doesn't explain *how*). "Mir Jafar helped the British." (True, but doesn't explain the *consequence* for British power).

2.  **Language Barriers (Attempt but Fail or Not Attempt):**
    *   "Contribute to the expansion" might be a slightly complex phrase. Students might understand "Plassey" and "British power" but struggle with the causal link required.
    *   Even if they know the facts, expressing them clearly and concisely in English, adhering to the rubric's expectation of linking victory to political dominance/control, can be challenging for students with limited English.
    *   The nuance of "political dominance/control" vs. simply "winning" or "getting money" might be lost.

3.  **Misconceptions / Partial Understanding (Attempt but Fail):**
    *   Students might focus on the economic aspects (e.g., British got revenue rights, increased trade) without explicitly stating the political control. While related, the rubric specifically asks about "political dominance/control."
    *   They might incorrectly identify *why* the British won (e.g., thinking it was a fair fight, not understanding the treachery). This doesn't directly answer *how* it expanded power, but shows a broader historical misunderstanding.

4.  **No Attempt:**
    *   Students who have no recollection of the Battle of Plassey or its significance will leave it blank or write something completely irrelevant, similar to the "Empty Response" examples in the anchors. Given the 29% average pass rate, a significant portion of students falls into this category for many questions.

**Connecting to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" (5% pass rate):** This requires abstract thinking and nuanced understanding of literature. Our question requires specific historical facts and their interpretation. The difficulty is likely higher than this for articulating a theme, but perhaps comparable for remembering *specific details* of the poem.
*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each." (15% pass rate):** This requires definitional understanding and examples. It's a more structured, potentially easier recall task. Our question requires a causal explanation of a specific event. The need to explain *how* rather than just *what* makes our question potentially harder.
*   **"Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'" (30% pass rate):** This is a personal, open-ended writing task where basic English and imagination are key. The bar for a 3/3 is quite low (see "Winter Sweater Baju..."). This is significantly easier than our history question.
*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50% pass rate):** This is a direct recall question from a specific text. If students read the text, they can find the answer. Our question requires more synthesis and understanding of cause-and-effect in history. This feels like a good benchmark for a specific fact recall. Our question is harder than just recalling three points.
*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India." (66% pass rate):** This is direct recall of well-known facts (at least in civics classes). It's a lower-cognitive-load task. Our question is significantly harder.

**Estimation Justification:**

The question requires specific historical knowledge (Battle of Plassey), understanding its *consequences* for British power, and articulating that consequence as "political
