Based on the calibration anchors and likely errors, here's an analysis and estimated pass rate:

**Analysis of Likely Errors for "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence: book/reading/a/is/he"**

1.  **Lack of understanding of basic English sentence structure (SVO - Subject-Verb-Object):** This is the most fundamental error. Many students might not grasp that "he" is the subject, "is reading" is the verb phrase, and "a book" is the object.
    *   **Misconception:** They might not explicitly know or apply SVO order.
    *   **Common Wrong Answers:**
        *   "Reading a book he is." (Putting the verb/object first)
        *   "A book he is reading." (Starting with the object)
        *   "Is he reading a book." (Forming a question, or confusion with auxiliary verb placement)
        *   "He a book is reading." (Incorrect verb placement)

2.  **Difficulty with present continuous tense structure:** While "is reading" is relatively simple, some might struggle with the auxiliary verb "is" combined with the -ing form of the main verb.
    *   **Misconception:** Not understanding that "is" and "reading" go together.
    *   **Common Wrong Answers:**
        *   "He reading is a book."
        *   "He is a book reading."

3.  **Simply listing words or incomplete attempts:** Some students, especially those with very limited English, might just write down the words in a random order, or only part of a sentence.
    *   **Common Wrong Answers:**
        *   "Book reading a is he."
        *   "He reading book."

4.  **Not attempting at all:** Given the limited English proficiency, some students might look at the jumbled words and simply not know where to start. The calibration anchors show a significant number of "Empty Response" or very minimal attempts, even for questions like "My favorite season."

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% ("Theme of poem"):** Requires abstract thinking and complex English expression. This rearrangement is far simpler.
*   **Pass rate 15% ("Differentiate archaeological/literary sources"):** Requires domain-specific knowledge and comparative analysis, plus some structured writing. This is much harder.
*   **Pass rate 30% ("My favorite season"):** Requires generating ideas and forming several simple sentences. While this rearrangement is just one sentence, it relies on a very basic and common grammatical structure. Students who can write "Rainy season is my favorite season" (from the 30% example) should ideally be able to do this.
*   **Pass rate 50% ("Three questions the king wanted to answer"):** Requires recalling specific information from a text. The example responses show students correctly extracting phrases, even if not perfectly formatted. This indicates a good ability to identify key elements.
*   **Pass rate 66% ("Two Fundamental Rights"):** Requires specific recall of two items. The correct answers are very short and direct. This is a knowledge recall task.

**Estimation:**

This question tests a very fundamental aspect of English grammar: basic sentence structure. While many students are from economically weaker sections with limited English, "He is reading a book" is a very common and basic sentence pattern taught early in English lessons.

*   Students who can form *any* coherent sentence (like the "My favorite season" examples) should be able to do this.
*   The "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%) required extracting information and forming slightly more complex phrases. This task is simpler because all the words are provided, and it's a very standard SVO construction.
*   The "Two Fundamental Rights" (66%) is primarily recall, but the language structure is similar in simplicity to what is required here.

The key challenge will be those who genuinely lack *any* grasp of SVO order or cannot identify the subject "he." However, this is such a foundational skill that a significant portion of Class 6 students would have encountered it. The format of "rearrange words" is also common in elementary English exercises.

I anticipate a pass rate higher than 50% but likely not as high as 66%, due to the persistent struggles with basic sentence formation evidenced in the 30% anchor. The 50% anchor involved direct recall of phrases, which is different from constructing a sentence.

I'll lean towards the higher end of the mid-range because it's a standard exercise with all words given.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **55%**
