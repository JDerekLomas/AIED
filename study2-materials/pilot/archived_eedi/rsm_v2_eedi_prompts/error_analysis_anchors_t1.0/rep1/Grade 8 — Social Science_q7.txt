Here's an analysis of the likely errors and an estimated pass rate for the question: "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

*   **Social Science Misconceptions/Lack of Knowledge (Primary Driver):**
    *   **Lack of Specific Historical Detail:** Many students might know "Battle of Plassey = British won" but not understand the *implications* of that victory beyond a general sense of British success. They might not recall details about Mir Jafar or the economic/political control gained.
    *   **Focus on Military Victory Only:** Students might simply state that the British won the battle, without connecting it to the *expansion of power*. They might see it as just "one battle" among many.
    *   **Confusing with other Battles/Events:** Indian history is vast, and students might mix up the Battle of Plassey with other battles (e.g., Buxar) or events leading to British expansion.
    *   **Understanding "Expansion of Power":** The rubric requires linking the battle to *political dominance/control*. Students might not explicitly make this connection, instead focusing on "British got stronger" or "British got more land" (which is true but less precise for the rubric).
    *   **Lack of Causal Reasoning:** The question asks "How did X contribute to Y?" This requires explaining a causal link, which can be challenging for students who tend to recall facts rather than analyze their consequences.

*   **Language Misunderstandings (Secondary, but significant):**
    *   **"Contribute to the expansion":** This phrase might be slightly complex. Students might understand "expansion" but struggle with "contribute to."
    *   **"Political dominance/control":** These are more abstract terms. Students might use simpler language like "ruled" or "became powerful" which might not fully meet the rubric's specificity.
    *   **Keywords:** While "Battle of Plassey" and "British power" are straightforward, the *connection* required is the challenge.

*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   Most students will likely attempt this question, as it's a prominent event in Indian history.
    *   However, many attempts will be incomplete, vague, or lack the specific causal link required by the rubric.

*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   "The British won the Battle of Plassey." (No explanation of contribution to expansion)
    *   "The British became powerful." (Too general)
    *   "The British took over India." (Oversimplified and historically inaccurate for this specific event)
    *   "Mir Jafar became the king." (True, but without explaining the *puppet* aspect and British control, it's incomplete for the rubric)
    *   Confusing it with economic gains without linking it to political control (e.g., "They got more money").

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking and interpretation, very difficult. This history question is more factual, though requires understanding consequences.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate sources):** Requires conceptual understanding and examples. Many students struggle with the differentiation, even if they know examples. The Plassey question is slightly less abstract than "differentiate" but requires a specific causal understanding.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Paragraph "My favorite season"):** This is a creative writing task requiring basic sentence construction and ideas. The Plassey question is much more content-specific and requires accurate historical understanding.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted):** This is a direct recall question of specific factual detail from a story. If students know the story, they can answer. The Plassey question requires recall *and* understanding of implications.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Direct recall of specific, well-taught facts.

**Conclusion:**

This question requires more than just recalling that the British won. It asks for the *consequence* of that victory in terms of *political expansion*. Given the general pass rate of 29% and the nature of the question (requiring specific historical understanding and causal linking, not just recall), it will be harder than simple recall but easier than abstract interpretation. The nuance of "political dominance/control" and the role of Mir Jafar as a "puppet" is key. Many students will get part of it right (British won, became powerful) but miss the precise link to political control over Bengal, or the specific mechanism (Mir Jafar).

I estimate it to be harder than the "My favorite season" (30%) but potentially similar to or slightly harder
