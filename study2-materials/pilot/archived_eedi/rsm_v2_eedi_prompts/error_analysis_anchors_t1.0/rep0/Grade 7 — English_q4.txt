Here's an analysis of likely errors and the estimated pass rate:

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

*   **Understanding "Important in real life":**
    *   **Misconception:** Some students might struggle to connect the abstract idea of "the king's questions" to their own tangible "real life." They might view the story as a fantasy disconnected from their everyday experiences.
    *   **Simpler interpretation:** Students might simplify "important in real life" to just "important" without delving into the practical implications.
    *   **Difficulty articulating:** Even if they understand the importance, articulating *why* it's important (the "reason") in English might be a significant hurdle. They might have the thought but lack the vocabulary or grammatical structure.

*   **Recalling/Understanding "the king's questions":**
    *   **Recall failure:** Even if they read the passage, some might not accurately remember the *specific* questions. This question builds upon a previous one (pass rate 50%) which asked *what* the questions were. If they struggled with that, they'll struggle here.
    *   **Partial recall:** They might remember one or two questions but not all three, or vaguely remember the theme (e.g., "about doing things right"). The rubric states "The king wanted to answer... (based on the reading passage) the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with." This implies they need to grasp the essence of *these* questions to connect them to "real life."
    *   **Misinterpretation:** They might misunderstand the nuance of "right time," "right people," "right thing."

*   **"Give one reason" - Articulation in English:**
    *   **Vocabulary limitations:** Students from economically weaker sections often have limited English vocabulary. Explaining abstract concepts like "importance," "success," "efficiency," "avoiding mistakes," "good outcomes" will be challenging.
    *   **Grammatical errors:** Even if they know some words, forming a coherent sentence to express a reason will be difficult. Simple phrases might be understood, but complex reasoning will likely fail.
    *   **Sentence structure:** Many might produce fragmented sentences or lists of words rather than a full reason.
    *   **Translating from local language:** They might think of the reason in their native language but struggle to translate it into intelligible English.
    *   **Lack of direct connection:** They might state the questions again, or state something vaguely positive without clearly linking it as a *reason* for their importance.

*   **Attempt vs. Failure:**
    *   Many students will attempt this question because it feels accessible (a "yes/no" part, then a "reason").
    *   However, the "reason" part is where most will fail. They might write "Yes," but provide no reason, or an irrelevant/incomprehensible reason.
    *   Some might write "Yes, it is important" and stop there, not providing a *reason*. The rubric requires "any valid reason."

*   **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   "Yes" (without a reason or a very vague, unelaborated reason).
    *   "Yes, it is good to know the right time." (Simply restating part of the question without explaining *why* it's important *in real life*).
    *   "Because it helps us." (Too generic).
    *   A jumbled, grammatically incorrect attempt at a reason that is difficult to decipher.
    *   Rehashing the story or the questions without answering the "importance" or "reason."
    *   No attempt at a reason after "Yes."

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Pass rate 30% ("My favorite season"):** This requires structured paragraph writing on a personal topic. Students can use simpler language. The "reason" question here is more abstract and requires a connection to a specific text, then an explanation. While it asks for only one sentence/reason, the cognitive load is higher.
*   **Pass rate 50% ("What were the three questions"):** This is pure recall. If students struggled with *what* the questions were, they will struggle to explain their *importance*. This question builds on that foundation.
*   **Pass rate 66% ("Name any two Fundamental Rights"):** This is also recall of specific facts, but the information is often memorized as part of civics education. The language requirement is minimal ("Right to equality," "Right to freedom").

The current question requires:
1.  Implicitly understanding/recalling the king's questions.
2.  Making a conceptual leap to "real-life importance."
3.  Articulating a valid *reason* in English
