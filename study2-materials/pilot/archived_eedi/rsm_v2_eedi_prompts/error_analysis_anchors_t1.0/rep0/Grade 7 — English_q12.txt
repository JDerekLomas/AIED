The pass rate for this question is likely to be lower than the average pass rate (29%) because it requires a specific grammatical transformation. Students from economically weaker sections with limited English often struggle with such nuanced grammatical rules.

Let's break down potential errors:

**Misconceptions about English/Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **Lack of understanding of "voice" (active/passive):** Many students, especially at this level, might not have been formally taught or fully grasped the concept of active and passive voice. They might not even recognize what the question is asking them to do.
*   **Incorrect tense transformation:** The original sentence is in simple past ("blew"). Students might incorrectly use present passive ("are blown") or future passive ("will be blown") or even present perfect passive ("have been blown").
*   **Incorrect verb form (past participle):** The past participle of "blow" is "blown." Students might struggle to recall this irregular verb form and might use "blowed" or "blew" again. This is a very common error with irregular verbs.
*   **Omitting the agent ("by the wind"):** While sometimes acceptable, for a clear transformation, including "by the wind" is expected. Students might omit it, leading to a less complete answer.
*   **Incorrect subject-object inversion:** They might try to rearrange words but fail to correctly identify the new subject ("the leaves") and integrate the "to be" verb + past participle structure.
*   **Direct word-for-word translation/reordering:** Instead of understanding the grammatical rule, they might simply try to reorder the words of the active sentence without applying the passive voice structure, leading to nonsensical phrases.

**Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**

*   **Many will attempt but fail:** Given it's a "change the sentence" question, most students will likely write something. They won't leave it completely blank unless they genuinely have no idea what "change... to Passive Voice" means or are completely intimidated.
*   **Common failure patterns:**
    *   **Incorrect verb form:** "The leaves were blowed away by the wind." (Very common)
    *   **Incorrect auxiliary verb/tense:** "The leaves are blown away by the wind." or "The leaves will be blown away by the wind."
    *   **Confused word order:** "The leaves the wind blew away." (Not passive)
    *   **Partial transformation:** "The leaves blown away by the wind." (Missing "were")
    *   **Attempting to simplify or rephrase without changing voice:** "The wind moved the leaves." (Changes meaning, not voice)

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain."** Requires abstract thinking and interpretation. This question is more concrete but requires specific grammatical knowledge.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate archaeological and literary sources.** Requires definition and examples. Similar to this question, it asks for specific knowledge application. However, "differentiation" might be slightly easier if they have some memory of the categories. The passive voice transformation requires a precise application of a grammatical rule.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Short paragraph on "My favorite season."** This is a creative writing task where even simple sentences can get points. Much more forgiving than a precise grammatical transformation.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer.** This is a recall question from a story, likely very common. If they read the story, they can get it.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name two Fundamental Rights.** This is a recall question of facts, potentially taught explicitly in civics.

The passive voice transformation is a specific grammatical rule that is often tricky for learners, especially those with limited exposure to formal English grammar. It's more complex than simple recall (50%, 66%) or basic paragraph writing (30%). It's closer to the "differentiate" question (15%) in terms of requiring specific knowledge application, but arguably *more* precise because there's only one correct answer structure for the transformation, whereas differentiation allows for some variability in explanation. The common error of irregular verbs will significantly pull down the score.

Considering the "average pass rate about 29%" and the difficulty of precise grammatical transformation for this demographic, it's unlikely to be above 29%. The irregular verb "blown" is a major hurdle. Many will try but make errors in the verb form or the auxiliary verb.

I'd place it somewhere between the 15% and 30% anchors, leaning closer to the lower end due to the specific grammatical rule and irregular verb.
