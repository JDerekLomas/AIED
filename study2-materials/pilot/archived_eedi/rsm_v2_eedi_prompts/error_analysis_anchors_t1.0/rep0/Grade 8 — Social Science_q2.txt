Here's an analysis of the likely errors and an estimated pass rate for the given question:

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the context of Class 8 students from economically weaker sections in Indian government schools with limited English, and an average pass rate of 29% for the exam:

*   **Social Science Misconceptions/Lack of Knowledge:**
    *   **Limited Exposure to Specific Topics:** Harappan Civilization might be covered in the curriculum, but the depth of understanding, especially regarding specific "key features" of urban planning, could be superficial. They might know *of* the Harappans but not specific details about their cities.
    *   **Focus on Rote Learning vs. Conceptual Understanding:** Many students in this demographic often rely on rote memorization of facts rather than a deeper understanding of concepts. If they haven't explicitly memorized "key features of urban planning," they might struggle to recall or articulate them.
    *   **Difficulty Identifying "Key Feature":** Even if they have some information about Harappan cities, distinguishing a "key feature" from a general characteristic might be challenging. They might list something generic like "they had houses" rather than "they had well-planned houses with baked bricks."

*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Describe one key feature":** "Key feature" might be the most challenging part. "Key" implies importance or distinctiveness. Students might struggle to understand this nuance and simply list *any* feature they remember.
    *   **"Urban planning":** While "urban" might be understood as related to cities, "planning" might be less clear in this specific context. They might not connect it to systematic design.
    *   **Vocabulary:** Words like "grid layout," "drainage system," "citadel," "lower town," "baked bricks" are specific terms. While some might be introduced, their consistent recall and correct usage in English would be a hurdle.
    *   **Expressing in English:** Even if they know the answer in their native language or have a vague idea, articulating it clearly and concisely in English to meet the rubric (correctly describes one key feature) will be a significant challenge. The examples from the calibration anchors show very basic English proficiency, with many students struggling to form coherent sentences.

*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **Attempt but Fail:** Many students would likely attempt this question, as it's a direct information recall type. However, their attempts would often be either too vague, incorrect, or demonstrate a poor understanding of the "key feature" aspect or the English language.
    *   **Not Attempt at All:** If they have absolutely no recall of Harappan urban planning, or if the English question is too daunting, they might leave it blank, as seen in the 15% and 50% pass rate examples.

*   **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   **Vague statements:** "They had good cities," "They lived in houses."
    *   **Incorrect facts:** Listing features of a different civilization, or completely unrelated information.
    *   **Partial or muddled information:** "They had drains," but without further context of it being *advanced* or part of a *system*. "They had big buildings," but not specifying "citadel" or "baked bricks."
    *   **Direct translation errors/poor grammar:** Making the answer incomprehensible despite having a kernel of truth.

**Likely Performance Based on Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking and articulation. This question is more factual, but requires specific vocabulary and understanding of "key feature."
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires understanding two concepts and providing examples. This is also conceptual. Students often struggled with differentiation and examples.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Allows for personal expression, but still requires sentence formation and meeting length criteria. Many struggled with coherence and basic structure.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is direct recall of specific facts from a story. This is the closest in *type* to the Harappan question (factual recall). However, the King story is often simpler and more engaging for younger students than historical specifics. Students still struggled to list all three clearly.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Direct factual recall from Civics, a subject generally considered more straightforward and relevant in India. This is likely a well-drilled topic.

**Considering the Harappan question:**

It requires specific factual recall *and* the ability to identify a "key feature" from potentially vague knowledge. The vocabulary can be challenging. It's less abstract than the poem
