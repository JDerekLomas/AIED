Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

The question: "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"
Rubric: Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Misunderstanding "which line from the poem":**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might not grasp that they need to *quote* a specific line from the poem. They might recall a general idea or character.
    *   **Language misunderstanding:** "Which line" could be interpreted broadly as "which part/idea."
    *   **Attempt/Fail/Not attempt:** They might attempt but fail to provide a direct quote, or try to paraphrase. Some might not attempt at all if they can't remember a specific line.
    *   **Common wrong answer:** "I like the part where..." or "I like when the person finds freedom." or even just naming a character "I like the child." (similar to the "The last bargin they about a child and labour" error).

2.  **Misunderstanding "do you like the most":**
    *   **Misconception:** While "like" is a relatively basic word, combining it with "most" and requiring an opinion might be challenging for students who primarily learn rote answers or factual recall. They might feel they don't *have* a "most" liked line or struggle to articulate an opinion in English.
    *   **Language misunderstanding:** Could be taken literally without the comparative "most" causing them to just pick *any* line without justification.
    *   **Attempt/Fail/Not attempt:** They might attempt to choose a line but struggle to express *why* it's "the most."
    *   **Common wrong answer:** Simply stating a line from the poem without any justification (only partially correct, as "why" is missing). Or stating "I like the poem."

3.  **Misunderstanding "and why":**
    *   **Misconception:** This is likely the biggest hurdle. Explaining *why* requires more complex thought and English sentence construction (cause and effect, justification, personal feeling). Given the previous examples of struggling with descriptive questions ("describes the poet's writing style"), articulating a "why" will be very difficult.
    *   **Language misunderstanding:** "Why" itself is understood, but forming the explanatory sentences (e.g., "because it makes me feel...", "because it shows...", "I like it because...") will be beyond many students' current proficiency.
    *   **Attempt/Fail/Not attempt:** Many will attempt the "which line" part but then fail to provide a coherent "why." Some might provide a one-word or very short, non-sensical explanation. A significant number might not attempt the "why" at all.
    *   **Common wrong answer:**
        *   "I like this line." (no 'why')
        *   "Because it is good." (too generic, doesn't meet the spirit of the 'why')
        *   "Empty Response" after stating a line.
        *   "I like the line from the poem, it is very good for me." (similar to "I am reading.")

4.  **Overall English Proficiency & Exam Anxiety:**
    *   **Limited vocabulary and grammar:** As seen in previous examples, basic sentence structures are often incorrect. Forming two linked clauses (line + why) will be very difficult.
    *   **Rote learning:** Students might be used to answering factual questions rather than opinion-based ones. They might try to recall a pre-taught "meaning" rather than formulate their own reason.
    *   **"Empty Response":** A common pattern across other questions, indicating a complete inability to respond or severe lack of confidence. This question is complex enough that many will resort to this for the "why" part, or even the whole question if they don't recall the poem.
    *   **Memory of the poem:** They need to actually remember specific lines to quote them. If the poem wasn't thoroughly memorized or understood, this foundational step fails.

**Comparing with previous questions:**

*   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%) - Very abstract, requires critical analysis and specialized vocabulary. *This question is simpler in concept but requires similar explanation skills for "why."*
*   "Write a theme or central idea..." (pass rate: 5%) - Requires synthesis and abstract thought, challenging for many. *Similar cognitive demand for "why," though here it's about a specific line.*
*   "Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby." (pass rate: 10%) - Requires personal expression and basic paragraph structure. Students often
