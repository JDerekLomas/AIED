Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

This question tests a very basic grammatical rule regarding the use of "some" and "any" in affirmative and negative/interrogative sentences. Given the context of Class 6 students in Indian government schools from economically weaker sections with limited English, here's what we can expect:

*   **Misconceptions about English/Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **Direct Translation Trap (Least Likely but Possible for a few):** While not a direct 1:1 issue with "some/any" for this specific structure, some students might struggle if they're attempting to directly translate from a native language where a similar distinction doesn't exist, or where the nuance is harder to grasp.
    *   **Lack of Explicit Grammar Instruction:** The biggest factor is likely the *lack of formal and explicit instruction* on the specific rules of "some" vs. "any." If they haven't been taught this distinction, or haven't had enough practice, they'll be guessing.
    *   **Confusion with Quantity/Specificity (Possible):** Some might think "any" is more general for "if there are *any at all*," while "some" implies a more specific, but unknown, quantity. This is a common early-learner confusion.
    *   **Sounds Right/Sounds Wrong (Most Common):** For many, it will come down to which word "feels" more natural based on what little exposure they've had. This is often an unreliable method for a specific grammar rule.
    *   **Focus on Keywords:** The sentence is very simple. There are no other complex words that would likely distract or confuse.

*   **Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**
    *   **Attempt and Fail:** This is highly likely. Unlike the open-ended "describe" or "write a theme" questions where students might write "Empty Response" because they genuinely don't know *what* to write, this is a forced-choice question. They *have* to pick one. An "Empty Response" would only happen if they genuinely missed seeing the question or just gave up on the entire exam (which is possible for a few, but less likely than a wrong guess here). Most will attempt to choose.

*   **What would the most common wrong answer look like?**
    *   **Choosing "any":** This is the only other option, so it would be the overwhelming wrong answer. Students would simply pick the incorrect alternative because they don't know the rule.

**Likely Thought Process for Students Who Get it Wrong:**

1.  "There are... apples in the basket."
2.  "Should it be 'some' or 'any'?"
3.  *Guessing/Feeling:* "Hmm, 'any' sounds okay too," or "I don't know the difference, so I'll just pick one."

**Comparing to Previous Questions:**

The pass rates for the examples provided ("Describes the poet's writing style," "Write a theme," "Write a short paragraph") are extremely low (4-10%). These questions are open-ended, require deeper comprehension, vocabulary, and sentence construction.

This question ("Choose the correct word...") is a multiple-choice-style grammar question. It's much more contained and does not require complex output. For these types of questions, even without explicit knowledge, a random guess would give a 50% chance of being correct. However, students *might* have some rudimentary exposure to "some" in this context from early lessons or daily interactions, even if they don't know the rule for "any."

Given the *average* pass rate is 29%, a basic grammar point like this, even if poorly taught, *might* perform slightly better than the extremely difficult open-ended questions cited, but not dramatically so if the grammar instruction is truly absent. The 50/50 nature is key.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**

Considering:
*   It's a two-option choice, giving a 50% chance if guessing randomly.
*   The concepts of "some" vs. "any" in simple affirmative sentences are fundamental and might have been minimally introduced, or students might have heard "some apples" in context.
*   The general low pass rates for open-ended, more complex questions (4-10%).
*   This question is a closed-response, direct grammar test.

I estimate that students, even with limited formal instruction, would lean slightly more towards "some" just from auditory familiarity, or at least perform better than on open-ended creative tasks. Many might still guess wrong.

If they were truly randomly guessing, it'd be 50%.
