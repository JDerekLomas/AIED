Let's break down the potential errors for this question.

**Target Students:** Class 6 students in Indian government schools, mostly economically weaker sections, limited English. Average pass rate ~29%.

**Question:** At `10` am in the morning, the temperature of Jodhpur was `30^0 C`. If the temperature increases by `2^0 C` per hour, then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?
**Rubric (for max score 1):** Calculates the time elapsed from `10:00` am to `4:00` pm as `6` hours.

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

**1. Misconceptions about Mathematics (Specifically Time & Basic Arithmetic):**

*   **Counting Hours:** This is the most crucial step for the rubric point.
    *   **"Counting on fingers" error:** Students might count `10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4` and get `7` hours if they count `10` am itself as the first hour *of increase*. Or, they might start counting from `11` (`11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4`) and get `6` hours, but struggle with the `12` pm to `1` pm transition.
    *   **Simple subtraction failure (4-10):** Students might just try to subtract 10 from 4, which makes no sense in a 12-hour clock context. They might get a negative number or get confused.
    *   **Ignoring AM/PM transition:** Many students might not intuitively understand that 4:00 in the "evening" means 4:00 PM and how it relates to 10:00 AM across noon.
    *   **Only calculating difference between hours, not elapsed time:** For example, calculating `10` (starting hour) and `4` (ending hour) directly, ignoring AM/PM.

*   **Basic Multiplication/Addition:**
    *   While not directly assessed by the rubric point (which is *only* about elapsed time), if they *do* get the hours correct, errors in `6 * 2 = 12` or `30 + 12 = 42` are common in this age group due to lack of fluency or simple arithmetic mistakes. These are secondary to the time calculation for *this specific rubric point*.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Morning" vs. "Evening":** While common terms, some might get confused if their primary language heavily distinguishes them and the direct translation isn't clear for time context. However, for "10 am" and "4 pm" it's relatively standard.
*   **"Increases by ... per hour":** "Increases" and "per hour" might be clear enough in context for the meaning, but linking the "per hour" to "how many hours" is the mathematical hurdle, not necessarily a language one.
*   **Vocabulary limitations:** "Temperature," "Jodhpur," "degree Celsius" might be known from science classes, but might also cause a minor barrier if unfamiliar.

**3. Attempt Status:**

*   **Will Attempt, But Fail:** A vast majority will likely attempt. It's a word problem with numbers and a clear question.
    *   The biggest struggle will be **calculating the elapsed time**. This requires a conceptual understanding of a 12-hour clock cycle.
    *   They might draw timelines, count on fingers, or try to do a mental calculation, often leading to errors.
*   **Not Attempt at all:** A small percentage might not attempt if they are completely lost on the time aspect, or if they struggle immensely with word problems in general. Given the relatively straightforward phrasing and common numerical context, this proportion will be lower than for abstract math problems.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer (for the *time elapsed* specifically):**

*   **7 hours:** This is highly probable from counting 10 am as the "first hour" of increase (`10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4`). If they get 7 hours, then `7 * 2 = 14`, and `30 + 14 = 44^0 C`.
*   **8 hours:** Less likely, but could happen if they count 10 to 4 in a simplistic "4-10+12" sort of way, making a mistake, or an overcount. If 8 hours, then `8 * 2 = 16`, and `30 + 16 =
