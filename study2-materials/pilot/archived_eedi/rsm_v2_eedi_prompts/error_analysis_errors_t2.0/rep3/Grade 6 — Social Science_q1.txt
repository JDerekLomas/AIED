Here's an analysis of the likely errors and an estimated pass rate for the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

1.  **Empty Response/No Attempt (Significant):**
    *   **Reasoning:** As seen in the provided common errors, "Empty Response" is a prevalent issue.
        *   **Lack of Knowledge:** Students simply might not know *any* major mountain ranges. Their curriculum might not have emphasized geographical features as much as historical events, or they may not have retained the information.
        *   **Difficulty with Retrieval:** Even if they've learned it, the ability to recall specific geographical names on the spot might be weak, especially if their understanding is rote rather than conceptual.
        *   **Intimidation/Giving Up:** Facing a blank, they might move on rather than risk a wrong answer, especially if they have limited confidence.
    *   **How it looks:** A completely blank answer space, or simply skipping the question.
    *   **Frequency:** Likely very high, potentially 40-50% or more.

2.  **Confusion with Other Geographical Features (Moderate):**
    *   **Reasoning:** Students might confuse mountain ranges with:
        *   **Rivers:** Ganges, Yamuna, etc. (They are major, but not mountains).
        *   **Plateaus:** Deccan Plateau (It's an elevated region, but not a linear mountain *range* in the same sense as the Himalayas).
        *   **Plains:** Indo-Gangetic Plain.
        *   **Deserts:** Thar Desert.
        *   **States/Cities:** Random place names from India.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** While "mountain ranges" seems straightforward, students might not have a precise, textbook definition and confuse it with any prominent geographical landmark.
    *   **How it looks:** "Ganga River," "Deccan Plateau," "Mumbai," "Rajasthan."
    *   **Frequency:** Moderately high, perhaps 20-25%.

3.  **Partially Correct/Incorrect Spelling/Incomplete Answers (Low to Moderate, but important for score):**
    *   **Reasoning:**
        *   **Single Correct Answer:** A student might know "Himalayas" but not a second one, or be unsure about the second. The rubric awards 0.5 for *one* correct, so this partial knowledge is relevant.
        *   **Spelling Errors:** Especially for less common ranges like "Aravalli" or "Vindhya," spelling could be an issue, though the rubric doesn't strictly penalize minor phonetic misspellings if the intent is clear. For "Himalayas," common variations like "Himmalaya" are expected.
        *   **Ambiguity:** "Ghats" might be written without specifying "Western" or "Eastern." Depending on strictness, this might be accepted as a common abbreviation or marked down.
    *   **How it looks:** "Himalaya," "Himalayas and Ganga," "Vindha."
    *   **Frequency:** Likely present among those who *do* attempt and have some knowledge.

4.  **Extraneous Information/Irrelevant Text (Low, but possible given previous examples):**
    *   **Reasoning:** The examples provided show students writing non-sensical or partially transcribed text from other sources. While less likely for a direct "name two" question, a student might jot down something they vaguely remember without it being an answer.
    *   **How it looks:** "Asher' stand," "Ashok."
    *   **Frequency:** Relatively low for this specific type of question, but cannot be completely ruled out for a small percentage.

**Pass Rate Estimation:**

Given the context (economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate 29% for Social Science, prevalence of "Empty Response"), this question, while seemingly direct, taps into specific recall which can be challenging.

*   **Those who know the Himalayas:** This is the most famous mountain range in India. Many would know this one.
*   **Those who know a second one:** This significantly drops the number. Ranges like Aravallis or Western Ghats might be known regionally or to more diligent students.

Let's break down the expected percentages:

*   **Empty Response / No Attempt:** 45%
*   **Completely Incorrect (confused with rivers, cities, etc.):** 25%
*   **Knows *at least one* correct mountain range (passing criteria for 0.5 score):** 30%
    *   Of this 30%:
        *   **Names only one correct (e.g., Himalayas):**
