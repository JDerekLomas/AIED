Let's break down the likely errors for the question: "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it."

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

*   **Understanding "Paragraph":** This is a significant hurdle. Many students, especially those not regularly exposed to English writing structure, may not grasp what constitutes a "paragraph" in the English sense. They might:
    *   List single words or very short phrases (e.g., "My hobby is cricket").
    *   Write a series of disconnected sentences (e.g., "I like cricket. I play on Sunday. It is fun."). While grammatically separate, they lack the cohesive flow and transition expected of a paragraph.
    *   Write sentences that are too short and not expanded (e.g., "I like drawing. I draw in the evening. It makes me happy."). This is closer but might still miss the *flow* for a full paragraph mark.
    *   Confuse a paragraph with a list of hobbies, or their favourite things in general.

*   **Understanding "4-5 Sentences":** While straightforward, students might:
    *   Write fewer than 4 sentences, possibly stopping after stating the hobby.
    *   Write many more than 5 sentences, demonstrating a lack of conciseness or inability to self-edit.
    *   Struggle to elaborate sufficiently to fill 4-5 *meaningful* sentences, leading to repetition or very simplistic statements.

*   **Addressing All Prompts ("what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it"):** This is a multi-part prompt, which is challenging. Students often:
    *   Only mention *what* their hobby is. (Most common)
    *   Mention *what* and *when*, but forget or struggle with *why*. ("Why you enjoy it" requires slightly more abstract thought and vocabulary than just naming an activity or time.)
    *   Provide very generic "why" answers that lack elaboration (e.g., "It is good," "I like it"). While technically answering, the quality might not meet a full paragraph expectation.

*   **Vocabulary and Sentence Structure:**
    *   Limited vocabulary to describe the "why" and to expand on the hobby itself.
    *   Struggle with complex sentence structures beyond simple subject-verb-object.
    *   Errors in tense (e.g., "I playing cricket" instead of "I play cricket").
    *   Misuse of prepositions (e.g., "I play on Sunday morning" vs. "I play in Sunday morning").
    *   Spelling errors making comprehension difficult, though usually, spelling isn't a *primary* scoring factor if the answer is comprehensible.

*   **Cognitive Load and "Filling Space":** Some students might recognize they need 4-5 sentences and fill them with irrelevant information or very basic, repetitive sentences just to meet the sentence count.

*   **Not Attempting / Empty Response:** Based on the provided examples for other questions (5% and 4% empty response), there will be a percentage of students who are overwhelmed by the open-ended nature and perceived complexity, leading to no attempt. However, "My Favourite Hobby" is a relatively relatable topic, so the non-attempt rate might be lower than for more abstract questions about poetry style or theme.

**Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**

Given the topic ("My Favourite Hobby"), most students who are capable of writing any English words are likely to *attempt* this question. It's personal and relatively straightforward to grasp the core request. However, a significant proportion will *fail* to meet the rubric due to the errors outlined above, particularly around paragraph structure and elaboration.

**What would the most common wrong answer look like?**

Based on the provided examples and common errors:

1.  **Too short, no paragraph structure, only identifying the hobby:**
    *   "My hobby is cricket. I play." (Fails on sentence count, paragraph, elaboration)
    *   "Cricket." (Similar to the "I am reading" example, very basic)
    *   "My hobby cricket. Play." (Grammatical errors, too short)

2.  **Listing disconnected sentences, missing "why," and/or below sentence count:**
    *   "My favourite hobby is playing cricket. I play on Sunday. With my friends." (Only 3 sentences, doesn't really address "why I enjoy it" with substance, not fully a paragraph.)
    *   "My favourite hobby is drawing. I draw pictures. It is good." (Close, but "It is good" might be too simplistic to fully
