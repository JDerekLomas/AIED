Let's break down the potential errors for the question: "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"

**Analyzing Potential Errors:**

1.  **"Which line from the poem..." - Misunderstanding "Line" or "Poem" or "From":**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might not grasp that "line" refers to a specific textual phrase from the given poem. They might interpret it as "story" or "part" of a poem in a very general sense, or even as just any sentence they like. They might also misinterpret "from the poem" to mean *about* the poem, rather than *a direct quote* from it.
    *   **Result:** They might describe the *plot* of the poem generally, or talk about *a general idea* the poem conveys, without quoting any specific line. Or they might make up a line entirely unrelated to the poem, simply stating a general preference.
    *   **Likely Wrong Answer:** "The poem is good." "I like the story." "I like the part about the boy."

2.  **"...do you like the most..." - Misunderstanding "Like" or "Most":**
    *   **Misconception:** This part is relatively straightforward, as "like" is a common verb. However, the concept of expressing a personal preference ("you like") about a *specific line* of text might be new or challenging. They might also confuse "like the most" with simply understanding the line best, or perhaps a moral lesson they took from it.
    *   **Result:** This isn't the primary source of error but could contribute to generic responses if they struggle with the "line" part. If they *do* pick a line, they might just say "I like it" without explanation.
    *   **Likely Wrong Answer:** (If a line is quoted) "I like this." or "This is good."

3.  **"...and why?" - Difficulty with Elaboration/Reasoning:**
    *   **Misconception:** This is a huge hurdle. "Why" requires articulating a reason, often involving abstract thought or connection. As seen in previous examples, complex explanations are very difficult. "Empty Response" for themes and styles highlights this inability to explain beyond superficial recognition.
    *   **Result:** Even if a student manages to identify a line, they are highly unlikely to provide a coherent "why." They might offer:
        *   A tautological answer: "Because it's good." "Because I like it."
        *   A single-word answer: "Happy." "Sad."
        *   A tangential answer: "It teaches a lesson." (Without specifying what lesson or how the line teaches it).
        *   No explanation at all (Empty Response after quoting).
    *   **Likely Wrong Answer:** "Because I like it." "This line makes me happy." "Empty Response" (after the first part).

**Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**

Given the "I am reading" or "My fauourite game is Badminton" type answers, it's clear students **attempt but often fail drastically** or misunderstand the scope of the question. An "Empty Response" rate is also high for questions requiring deeper analysis or specific textual recall (like theme or writing style).

**Most Common Wrong Answers:**

Combining the analysis, here's what the most common wrong answers would look like:

*   **Complete Misinterpretation/Generalization:** "I like the poem. It is a good story." (No line, no why)
*   **Attempted Line, No Why/Poor Why:**
    *   "The man called out. I like it."
    *   "I like this line because it is good."
    *   "('The day was done.' Quoted accurately) This line is about the day."
*   **Irrelevant Information/Tangential:** "My favourite part is about the flowers." (If flowers are not a core element or not explicitly mentioned in a distinct line)
*   **Empty Response/Partial Response:**
    *   Only quotes a line (but gets no score for "why").
    *   Empty response altogether (if they find "line" or "why" too hard).
*   **Making up a line/paraphrasing rather than quoting:** "The sun went down, I like this because it is beautiful." (Even if the poem mentioned a sunset, it's not a direct quote)

**Impact on Pass Rate:**

*   **"Denotes a line from the poem":** This is a significant hurdle. Quoting a line accurately is tough, especially if they haven't explicitly memorized lines or have limited reading comprehension to isolate one. Many will fail this
