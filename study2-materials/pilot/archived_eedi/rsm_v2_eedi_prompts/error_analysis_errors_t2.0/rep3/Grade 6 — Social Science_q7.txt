Given the context of Class 6 students from economically weaker sections in Indian government schools, with limited English, and an average pass rate of 29% for Social Science questions, let's analyze the likely errors for the question:

**Question:** Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there.
**Rubric:** Mentions two correct natural resources (e.g., water, Marble, Copper, Sandstone, Gypsum, mica, limestone, zinc, salt, Sunlight for solar energy, Wind for wind energy).
**Max score:** 1

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

1.  **Empty Response/No Attempt (Very High Probability):**
    *   **Reasoning:** Similar to the examples provided ("Empty Response" for other questions). Students might not understand the question well enough to even attempt it, or they might lack the specific knowledge. Fear of writing incorrect answers might also lead to blank responses. The question asks for specific regional knowledge, which might not be uniformly covered or retained.
    *   **Impact:** A significant portion of students will likely leave this blank.

2.  **Listing only one natural resource (Common Error):**
    *   **Reasoning:** Students might remember only one resource, or simply stop after the first one, perhaps due to limited knowledge, time pressure, or misunderstanding the "any two" part of the instruction.
    *   **Impact:** Incorrect answer as per the rubric (needs two *and* explanation).

3.  **Listing incorrect/non-natural resources or resources not found in Rajasthan (Moderate Probability):**
    *   **Reasoning:** General misconceptions about "natural resources" or a lack of specific geographical knowledge about Rajasthan. They might list common resources like "trees" or "animals" without context, or resources from other states they might be familiar with.
    *   **Impact:** Incorrect answer.

4.  **Difficulty with "explain how one of them influences the lives" (High Probability):**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a higher-order thinking skill compared to just listing. Students might list two resources correctly but struggle to articulate the influence.
        *   **Language Barrier:** The phrase "influences the lives" might be challenging to articulate in English. They might know *what* it influences (e.g., "water for drinking") but struggle to form a complete explanatory sentence.
        *   **Lack of Detailed Knowledge:** Even if they know water is a resource, understanding its *specific influence* (e.g., agriculture, daily life, industry) and articulating it concisely could be tough.
        *   **Simplicity of explanation:** Their explanation might be too brief or rudimentary ("Water is good").
    *   **Impact:** Even if resources are listed correctly, failure to provide an adequate explanation means a wrong answer.

5.  **Language Misunderstandings (Moderate Probability):**
    *   "Natural resources": While "प्राकृतिक संसाधन" (Prakritik Sansadhan) is a common term, understanding the nuance and *applying* it to Rajasthan could be an issue.
    *   "Influences": Might be misinterpreted as simply "is used for."

6.  **"Shotgun approach" / Listing multiple resources, hoping some are correct (Low to Moderate Probability):**
    *   **Reasoning:** Some students might try to write down everything they can recall. This might lead to correct resources mixed with incorrect ones, or just a jumble.
    *   **Impact:** If two correct ones are there *and* one is explained, they get the mark. But the explanation part is still the hurdle.

**Most Common Wrong Answer Looks Like:**

*   "Empty Response" (Highest frequency)
*   "Water." (Only one resource)
*   "Water, Trees." (One correct, one generic/less specific for Rajasthan)
*   "Marble." (Only one resource)
*   "Coal, Water." (Coal is found in Rajasthan but in very specific types/quantities, not as a primary *natural resource* typically associated for Class 6 understanding, unless they specify Lignite. Water is good. But if only these, it's not a full answer.)
*   "Water. People drink water." (Correct resource, but a very minimal explanation that might or might not meet the "explain influence" threshold, especially if there's no other resource listed).

**Why this question is tough despite seemingly simple:**

*   **Specific Geographical Knowledge:** Requires knowledge about *Rajasthan*. Many students may have general knowledge of resources but not state-specific.
*   **Two-Part Question:** "Two resources" *and* "explain influence." Missing either part leads to failure.
*   **Explanation Demands Higher Order Thinking:** Simply identifying is easier
