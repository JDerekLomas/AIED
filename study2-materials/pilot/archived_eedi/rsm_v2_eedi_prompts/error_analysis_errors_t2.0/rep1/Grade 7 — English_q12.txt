Let's break down the likely errors for the given active-to-passive voice transformation question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and common error patterns.

**Analysis of the Question and Difficulty:**

The question tests a fundamental grammatical transformation: Active to Passive Voice. While a core concept, it involves several steps and requires specific knowledge:

1.  **Identifying Subject, Verb, Object:** "The wind" (subject), "blew" (verb), "the leaves" (object).
2.  **Changing Object to New Subject:** "The leaves" becomes the new subject.
3.  **Using a form of "to be" + Past Participle:** "were blown" (plural, past tense). This is often a significant hurdle.
4.  **Adding "by" + Original Subject:** "by the wind" (optional, but often expected in this kind of exercise).
5.  **Maintaining Tense:** "blew" is past simple, so "were blown" maintains that.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Lack of Understanding of "Active/Passive Voice":** This is a primary barrier. Many students may not even grasp what "active voice" or "passive voice" means. The term "voice" itself can be confusing. They might treat it as a task to simply rephrase or find synonyms, rather than a grammatical transformation.
    *   *Result:* Completely wrong answers, attempts to rewrite the sentence without changing voice, or not attempting at all.

2.  **Confusion with Tenses, Especially Past Participles (V3 Form):**
    *   The irregular past participle of "blow" ("blown") is a common point of failure. Students might use "blew" (V2) or simply "blow" (V1).
    *   Incorrect auxiliary verb: "is blown," "has blown," "had blown," "was blow," "were blow." They might struggle with subject-verb agreement for "be" (e.g., "The leaves was blown").
    *   *Result:* "The leaves blew away by the wind," "The leaves is blown away by the wind," "The leaves was blown away by the wind."

3.  **Inability to Identify Subject/Object/Verb:**
    *   Some might mix up the roles, attempting to make "the wind" the object of the "by" phrase but struggling with the rest.
    *   *Result:* Incoherent sentences, or simply rearranging words randomly.

4.  **Incorrect Sentence Structure/Word Order:**
    *   Even if they get some elements right, the sequence might be off.
    *   *Result:* "Blown away the leaves were by the wind," "By the wind the leaves were blown away." (While grammatically permissible, it's less direct and might indicate a lack of clear understanding of the standard structure).

5.  **Omission of Key Elements:**
    *   Omitting "by the wind": While technically correct passive without it, if the instruction implies a complete transformation, this might be seen as incomplete by some markers. However, considering the overall difficulty, it might be overlooked if the rest is perfect.
    *   Omitting "were" or the participle.
    *   *Result:* "The leaves blown away by the wind," "The leaves by the wind."

6.  **"Empty Response" or "Empty Attempt":** Given the extremely low pass rates for complex grammar concepts like "writing style" and "theme," a significant portion will not attempt it or will simply re-copy the original sentence if prompted.

**What the Most Common Wrong Answers Would Look Like:**

1.  **Direct Recopy/Slightly Altered Active:** "The wind blew the leaves away." or "Wind blew the leaves away." (No attempt at transformation).
2.  **Incomplete or Incorrect Past Participle:** "The leaves blew away by the wind." (Using V2 instead of V3).
3.  **Incorrect Auxiliary Verb:** "The leaves is blown away by the wind." (Wrong tense/subject-verb agreement).
4.  **Mixed-Up Elements/Garbled English:** "Away the leaves blown wind by the." or "The leaves did blown by the wind." (Trying to use auxiliary 'do').
5.  **Omitting Auxiliary/Incomplete Passive:** "The leaves blown away by the wind." (Missing "were").
6.  **Confused "by" Phrase:** "The leaves were blown the wind away." (Misplacement).

**Connection to Previous Error Patterns:**

*   **"Empty Response":** Given the difficulty of grammatical transformations, this will be high. Students facing concepts they don't understand often leave it blank.
