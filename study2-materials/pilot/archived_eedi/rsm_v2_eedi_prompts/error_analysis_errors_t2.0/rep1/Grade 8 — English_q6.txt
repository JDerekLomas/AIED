Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate for "Define fable."

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Direct Vocabulary Unknown/Partial Knowledge:**
    *   Many students, especially from economically weaker sections, might not have encountered the word "fable" or "moral" frequently in their curriculum or daily lives. English vocabulary can be a major hurdle.
    *   Even if they've heard stories like "The Tortoise and the Hare," they might not know the *term* "fable."
    *   They might know "story" but miss "short," "animals," or "moral."

2.  **Confusion with Similar English Words/Concepts:**
    *   **"Table":** This is a very common word, and the visual/aural similarity could lead to a mix-up, especially for students with limited exposure to diverse vocabulary. They might try to define "table."
    *   **"Story" / "Tale" / "Myth":** Students might correctly identify that a fable is a *kind* of story, but fail to provide the distinguishing characteristics (animals, moral). They might offer a generic definition of a story.
    *   **"Fantasy":** Some might associate animals speaking with fantasy stories but again miss the moral element.
    *   **"Fable" vs. "Legend":** Less likely in this demographic, but possible if they have some exposure.

3.  **Syntactic/Grammatical Issues (Attempt but Fail):**
    *   Even if they have a *partial* understanding of what a fable is, forming a coherent, grammatically correct sentence or two in English to *define* it will be challenging. This is evident from the "Describes the poet's writing style" example, where students struggle to produce any meaningful response.
    *   "My hobby is cricket play" shows an inability to form even simple sentences correctly.
    *   They might list features without defining the term ("animals story, moral good").

4.  **Misinterpreting "Define":**
    *   They might understand "define" but lack the vocabulary to execute it.
    *   They might simply list an example of a fable without actually defining the term itself. E.g., "The crow and the pitcher." (This shows understanding of the concept but fails to meet the rubric for *defining*).

5.  **Not Attempting at All / Empty Response:**
    *   As seen in previous examples ("Empty Response" for "writing style" and "theme"), a significant portion of students will likely leave it blank if they have no idea or feel they cannot articulate an answer. This is a common and predictable outcome given their background.

6.  **Guessing/Random Words:**
    *   Similar to the "I am reading" for "writing style," they might throw out a seemingly English word that makes no sense in context, out of a desire to put something down.

**Common Wrong Answer Look-alikes:**

*   "Fable is story." (Too generic)
*   "Story of animal." (Missing "short" and "moral")
*   "Teach good things." (Too generic, misses "story," "animals")
*   "Fable means a table." (Confusion with "table")
*   "The story of rabbit." (Example, not a definition)
*   "Empty Response" (Very high likelihood)
*   "Fable animal story lesson" (Fragmented, showing partial understanding but poor sentence construction)
*   "Fable is a tale for a story to a people that learns to have a lesson" (Attempt, but grammatically poor and convoluted).
*   "A short story" (Missing key elements)

**Analysis Against Given Examples:**

*   "Describes the poet's writing style." (Pass rate 4%): This is abstract and requires interpretation *and* descriptive English. "Define fable" is a concrete vocabulary question, which *should* be easier if they know the word. However, the *low* base English proficiency suggests difficulty.
*   "Write a theme..." (Pass rate 5%): This requires comprehension and abstract thought about a poem. Again, potentially harder than a vocabulary definition if they know the word.
*   "Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'" (Pass rate 10%): This is a personal response, but requires sustained writing. Even here, sentence construction is very poor. "Define fable" requires less output but precise vocabulary.

Given these considerations, "Define fable" is a specific vocabulary definition. If they don't know the word, they can't define it. Even if they have a vague idea, forming a grammatically correct sentence will be tough.

*   Many will likely provide "Empty Response
