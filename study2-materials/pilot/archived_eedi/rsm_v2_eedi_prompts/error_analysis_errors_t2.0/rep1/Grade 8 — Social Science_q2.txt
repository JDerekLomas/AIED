Let's break down the likely errors for the question "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **"Empty Response" / Not Attempting at All:**
    *   **Reasoning:** Given the very low pass rates on complex questions like "Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi" (9%) and "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign..." (12%), a significant portion of students will likely not attempt this question. This could be due to:
        *   Lack of knowledge about Harappan Civilization.
        *   Difficulty comprehending the question ("urban planning" might be too technical).
        *   Feeling overwhelmed and simply leaving it blank, a common coping mechanism in high-stakes exams for difficult questions.
        *   Limited exposure to these topics in schools or focus on other areas.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "Empty Response" (as seen in examples).

2.  **Misconceptions / Lack of Specific Knowledge about Harappan Civilization:**
    *   **Reasoning:** While students might have *heard* of the Harappan Civilization, they may not recall *specific features* of its urban planning. Their knowledge might be superficial or fragmented.
    *   **Likely Errors:**
        *   **Vague answers:** "They built cities." or "They were ancient." (Doesn't address urban planning).
        *   **Generic historical facts:** "Indus Valley Civilization was old." "They traded." (Not about urban planning).
        *   **Confusion with other civilizations:** Mentioning pyramids (Egypt) or Roman baths (Rome), which might arise from a general understanding of "ancient cities" but a lack of specific knowledge about Harappan features. This is less likely than "empty response" but possible for students attempting to guess.
        *   **Focusing on non-urban planning features:** "They had seals." "They knew agriculture." (These are true but don't answer the question).
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "They lived near a river." or "It was an old civilization."

3.  **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Urban planning":** This term might be challenging for students with limited English, especially if they haven't encountered it specifically in their textbooks or classroom discussions in a structured way. They might understand "urban" (city) but not "planning" in this context (systematic design and layout).
    *   **"Key feature":** They might struggle to identify *one specific and important* characteristic, instead giving general statements.
    *   **Impact:** This contributes to either empty responses or vague/irrelevant answers.

4.  **Attempt but Fail (Partial Knowledge/Poor Expression):**
    *   **Reasoning:** Some students might recall *fragments* of information (e.g., "they had good drainage," "their cities were planned") but struggle to articulate it clearly and concisely enough to meet the rubric.
    *   **Likely Errors:**
        *   "Good drainage" without mentioning *why* it was good or *how* it's a feature of planning.
        *   "Cities were like squares" (attempting to describe grid layout but poorly expressed).
        *   Using terms like "well-built houses" without connecting it to "planning."
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "They made strong houses." or "Their city was clean."

**Estimating Pass Rate:**

*   **Average Pass Rate:** 29% for Social Science questions.
*   **Difficulty:** "Describe one key feature of Harappan Civilization's urban planning" is **less conceptually complex** than explaining the effects of colonial rule on tribals or the significance of Ashoka's reign. It requires recalling a specific fact rather than complex analysis.
*   **Specificity of "Urban Planning":** This is a defining characteristic of Harappa and usually covered well. A key feature like the drainage system or grid pattern is often highlighted in textbooks.
*   **English Difficulty:** "Urban planning" is a specific term that could trip students up.
*   **Common Errors Observed:** The previous examples show a very high rate of "Empty Response" or utterly nonsensical answers for more complex or abstract questions. For a factual recall question like this, the "Empty Response" rate might be slightly lower, and attempts (even if poor) might be higher.

Given the typical emphasis on the Harappan civilization's urban features in NCERT textbooks (even basic Class 6 history), there's a higher chance some students will have come across and remembered at least one feature. However, the consistent "Empty Response" for even seemingly accessible questions like "Ashoka" and "Lions" is concerning.

I anticipate the
