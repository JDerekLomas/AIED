Let's break down the likely errors for the question:

**Question:** Choose the correct word. There are (some/any) apples in the basket.
**Rubric:** Selects 'some' as the correct word for the sentence.
**Max score:** 1

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

*   **Misconceptions about "some" vs. "any":**
    *   **Common misconception:** Students often learn that "any" is used with negatives and questions, while "some" is used with positive statements. This is a foundational rule, but it can be a stumbling block if not fully internalized or if the sentence structure seems tricky to them.
    *   **"Any" sounds simpler/shorter:** For a struggling student, "any" might feel like a more direct or simpler word to pick, especially if they are just scanning for something that 'fits'.
    *   **Confusion with *number* vs. *existence*:** While the concept here is about positive vs. negative/interrogative statements, some students might incorrectly try to associate "any" with an *absence* of something, even in a positive statement like this one, if their understanding is very weak.

*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Choose the correct word"**: This instruction is straightforward enough that it probably won't be a primary cause of error, unlike more complex instructions seen in the example errors.
    *   **"There are apples in the basket"**: The base sentence is simple. The issue isn't likely with understanding the objects or action, but with the quantifier.

*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **Attempt and fail:** This type of question, being multiple-choice (or two options), is highly likely to be attempted by almost all students, even if they guess. It's a low-effort question.
    *   **Not attempt at all:** Unlikely for this specific format.

*   **What would the most common wrong answer look like?**
    *   **Selecting "any"**: This would be the overwhelming majority of incorrect answers. It's the only other option.
    *   **Empty Response**: Less likely than guessing, but still possible from students who give up entirely or genuinely don't know the difference.
    *   **Writing both "some" and "any"**: Possible from very confused students who don't understand "choose the correct word" properly, but less common than just picking the wrong one.

**Factors Influencing the Pass Rate:**

1.  **Direct Choice:** It's a simple binary choice. Even a 50/50 guess has a chance.
2.  **Basic Grammar:** The "some/any" distinction is fundamental but also frequently practiced in early English learning.
3.  **Positive Statement:** The sentence "There are apples in the basket" is a clear positive statement, which directly maps to using "some" according to the rule. This is less ambiguous than a more complex sentence structure.
4.  **No complex vocabulary/context:** Unlike "poet's writing style" or "theme," there are no difficult concepts to grasp beyond the grammar rule itself.
5.  **Previous performance examples:**
    *   The given common errors for "describes poet's writing style," "theme," and "short paragraph" show severe gaps in comprehension, abstract thinking, and paragraph construction.
    *   "Describes the poet's writing style" (4% pass rate) involves abstract concepts and requires complex output.
    *   "Write a theme..." (5% pass rate) requires abstract interpretation and sustained writing.
    *   "Write a short paragraph..." (10% pass rate) requires creative thinking, topic understanding, and multi-sentence construction.
    *   **This "some/any" question is *much simpler* than those examples.** It's a closed-ended, rule-based question requiring a single word choice.

Considering the examples of common errors, even though the overall pass rate for English is 29%, this specific question tests a much more basic and frequently taught grammatical concept. While many will guess, and some will struggle with "any" seeming simpler, the direct application of a foundational rule should yield a higher success rate than the examples given. Students are more likely to have encountered and practiced "some/any" in simpler contexts.

I would expect the guessing element, plus a reasonable number of students who *have* internalised this basic rule, to push the score up significantly from the example questions, but not to an extremely high level due to the general "limited English" context.

**Estimated Proportion Correct:** 60%
