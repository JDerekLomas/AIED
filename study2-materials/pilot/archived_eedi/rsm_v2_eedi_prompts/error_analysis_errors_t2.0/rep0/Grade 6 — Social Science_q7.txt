This question is likely to have a higher pass rate than the examples given, but still below average for a simple recall/application question in other contexts due to the general academic challenges of this student group.

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

*   **Social Science Misconceptions/Gaps:**
    *   **Lack of Specific Geographic Knowledge:** While Rajasthan is a well-known state, some students might struggle to recall *specific* natural resources unique to it. They might mention generic resources found anywhere (e.g., "trees," "soil") which may or may not be correct in a significant context for Rajasthan.
    *   **Difficulty Connecting Resource to Influence:** The second part of the question ("explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there") requires a slight step beyond simple recall. Students need to draw a causal link. This is where many might falter, even if they correctly name a resource. For instance, they might name "water" but then struggle to articulate *how* it influences lives beyond "it's important."
    *   **Focus on 'Development' instead of 'Influence':** Some might provide general statements about resource use for development rather than specific influences on daily life.
    *   **Overthinking/Underthinking:** Some might overthink and try to come up with obscure resources, while others might underthink and list incredibly generic ones without thinking about relevance to Rajasthan.

*   **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Natural Resources":** This term should generally be understood at this level, but some students might confuse it with agricultural products or man-made resources.
    *   **"Influences":** This word implies a cause-and-effect relationship, which some might struggle to articulate clearly in English, leading to vague explanations.
    *   **"Explain":** As seen in the example errors, the command "Explain" is frequently met with empty or irrelevant responses, indicating a difficulty in constructing a coherent explanatory answer.

*   **Attempt Rate:**
    *   **High Attempt Rate for the First Part:** Naming two natural resources is a relatively low-effort task. Most students will attempt this part, even if their answers are incorrect or too generic.
    *   **Lower Attempt/Success Rate for the Second Part:** The explanation aspect will likely be the stumbling block. Many might list resources correctly but then provide a vague or incomplete explanation, or no explanation at all.

*   **Most Common Wrong Answer Looks Like:**
    *   **"Water, trees. Water is important for life."** (Correct resources but insufficient explanation for full marks on the second part).
    *   **"Farming, desert."** (Incorrect natural resources, showing misunderstanding of the term).
    *   **"Marble, coal. Marble is used for houses."** (This might get some credit depending on the nuance of "influences lives," but could be seen as superficial rather than deeply influencing daily life like water scarcity).
    *   **"Empty Response" / "No answer."** For students who are entirely unfamiliar with Rajasthan's resources or struggle with any English writing.

**Comparison with Provided Errors:**

*   This question is less abstract and doesn't require deep historical analysis or interpretation of symbols like the Ashokan pillars/lions. It's more factual recall and a simple application.
*   The concepts are generally simpler than "colonial rule affecting tribal communities."
*   It asks for *any two*, offering flexibility.

However, the "explain how... influences" part does present a similar challenge to "Explain how colonial rule affected..." or "Why are lions shown... Explain," where a constructed explanation is required, not just a factual recall. Given the very low pass rates on the *explanation* parts of other Social Science questions, this second part is critical.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%) and Common Errors:**

*   **Easier First Part:** Many will correctly name at least one resource (e.g., "water," "sand/desert," "solar"). Getting two might be harder.
*   **Challenging Second Part:** The explanation part will be difficult. Even if they name correct resources, many will fail to provide a satisfactory explanation of influence. Many will offer generic statements rather than specific impacts relevant to Rajasthan.

Let's break down scoring likelihood:

*   **0 Marks:** No correct resources or explanation, or empty response. (High probability, similar to example errors).
*   **0.5 Marks (if fractional scoring was allowed for resources only):** One correct resource, no explanation. (Significant probability).
*   **0.75 Marks (if fractional for resources):** Two correct resources, weak/generic explanation. (Moderate probability).
*   **1 Mark (Full Credit):** Two correct resources AND a good explanation of influence. (This is where most will
