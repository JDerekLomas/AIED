Let's break down the question "Define fable" for Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Direct Translation Failure/Lack of Vocabulary:**
    *   Many students simply won't know the word "fable." Unlike words like "poet," "style," "hobby," or common verbs, "fable" isn't a high-frequency word they encounter daily, even if they know stories that *are* fables.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "Empty Response" will be extremely high. They might not even recognize the word and thus cannot attempt a definition.

2.  **Confusion with Similar-Sounding or Related Words:**
    *   **"Table":** This is a very common word. A student with limited English proficiency and phonetic-based recognition might confuse "fable" with "table" and try to define a "table." This is a stretch but possible in extreme cases.
    *   **"Story/Tale":** They might grasp that it's a *kind* of story, but not be able to articulate the specific characteristics.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "It is a table." (Low probability, but possible). "It is a story." (More likely, partial credit if the rubric allowed it, but the rubric demands more detail).

3.  **Inability to Articulate a Formal Definition:**
    *   Even if a student somewhat understands what a fable is (e.g., they know "The Hare and the Tortoise" is a fable), constructing a precise, academic definition in English is a higher-order language skill. Their sentence structure and vocabulary for formal definitions will be limited.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:**
        *   "Fable is a story animal." (Attempting to define, but very basic and incomplete).
        *   "Fable has a moral." (Another partial but incomplete definition).
        *   "Fable like the fox and the grapes." (Giving an example instead of a definition, a common issue when students lack definitional vocabulary).
        *   "It's when animals talk and teach something." (Closer, but likely still too informal or fragmented for a full point).

4.  **"Empty Response" or "I don't know" in English/Hindi:**
    *   Similar to the examples provided ("Describes the poet's writing style," "Write a theme"), "Empty Response" will be a dominant category, showing students recognize they don't know the answer. They're more likely to simply leave it blank or write "Empty Response" than to attempt a completely unrelated definition if they have no idea.

**Analysis of Difficulty:**

*   **Vocabulary:** "Define" itself requires knowing the function. "Fable" is the core vocabulary challenge.
*   **Concept:** Understanding what differentiates a fable from a general story (animals, moral) is a specific conceptual understanding.
*   **English Production:** Articulating a formal, multi-part definition in fluent English is difficult for this demographic.

Given the existing pass rates for other questions, particularly those involving more abstract concepts or precise vocabulary:
*   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass rate) - This involves abstract description and specific literary vocabulary.
*   "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate) - Requires identifying an abstract concept and articulating it.
*   "Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby." (10% pass rate) - Though about a personal topic, still struggles with sentence structure and coherence.

"Define fable" sits somewhere in the middle. It's not as abstract as "writing style" or "theme," but the core word "fable" might be completely unknown to a very high percentage. The students may be familiar with specific stories that are fables (like Panchatantra stories), but *naming* them as "fables" and then *defining* the term is the challenge.

**Most Common Wrong Answer:**
1.  "Empty Response" or left blank. (Likely highest)
2.  "Fable is a story." (Partial understanding, but not enough for full credit).
3.  "Fable like animals talk." (Another partial attempt).
4.  "It has a moral." (Partial).
5.  Providing an example (e.g., "The Hare and the Tortoise") instead of a definition.

**Estimating the Pass Rate:**

Considering the severe vocabulary limitations, difficulty in forming a structured definition, and the high rate of "Empty Response" on even seemingly simpler questions:

*   A significant number (50-60%) will leave it blank or give an empty response because they don't know the word.
*   Another
