Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Subject Matter Knowledge - Harappan Civilization:**
    *   **Lack of Knowledge/Recall:** This is the biggest hurdle. The Harappan Civilization is covered in Class 6/7 Social Science, and by Class 8, without strong reinforcement, many students might have forgotten details or even the name itself. They might vaguely recall "Indus Valley," but not specific features.
    *   **Confusion with other civilizations/periods:** Students might mix up Harappan features with characteristics of later periods (e.g., Mauryan, Gupta) or even general ideas about "old cities." For instance, they might describe "forts" or "palaces" which aren't the defining features of Harappan urban planning.
    *   **Focus on irrelevant details:** Even if they remember *something* about Harappa, they might focus on pottery, seals, or the "dancing girl" statue, rather than urban planning specifically.
    *   **"Empty Response":** Given the other examples provided, this will be extremely common for those who have no clue or cannot recall.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings (English Medium):**
    *   **"Key Feature":** While "key feature" is straightforward, students with limited English might not grasp the nuance of needing to select *one important* aspect, rather than just any fact they recall.
    *   **"Urban Planning":** This phrase might be problematic. While "urban" generally means city, and "planning" means designing, combining them might be complex for students with low proficiency. They might interpret it more broadly as "how cities were," rather than specifically about *design principles*. They might simply list what they remember about Harappan cities without focusing on the *planning* aspect.
    *   **Vocabulary for Features:** Even if they know the concepts, articulating them in English could be challenging. Words like "grid layout," "drainage system," "baked bricks," "citadel," "lower town" might not be readily available in their productive vocabulary. They might resort to simpler, less precise terms.

3.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   Given the high rate of "Empty Response" in other Social Science questions, a significant number will not attempt this question if they don't have immediate recall or understanding.
    *   Those who attempt might try to connect something they remember about "old cities" or "early India" even if it's incorrect.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answer Look:**
    *   **Empty Response:** This will likely be the most frequent.
    *   **Vague/Incorrect historical details:** "They had many people," "It was an old city," "They had good buildings" – these are too general or don't specify planning features.
    *   **Confusion with other periods:** Describing Mauryan capitals, or generic "ancient Indian cities" with temples/palaces not relevant to Harappan planning.
    *   **Listing other Harappan facts:** "They had seals," "They had statues." (Ignoring "urban planning").
    *   **Partial or Poorly Articulated Attempt:** Students might try to say "like roads were straight" (grid layout), or "water was clean" (drainage), but without sufficient clarity or specific terminology to meet the rubric. For example, "They used good bricks" (not specifying "baked bricks" as a *planning* feature of durability/standardization).

**Revisiting Pass Rate Context:**
*   Average pass rate for Class 8 in Indian government schools is 29%.
*   Common errors like "Empty Response" and basic confusion are rampant.
*   The Social Science examples show pass rates of 9-12%, suggesting high difficulty and limited knowledge retention.
*   Harappan Civilization, while important, is an older topic for Class 8 students.
*   The question requires specific recall and understanding of "urban planning," which is slightly more specialized than a general historical event or personality.

**Estimation of Proportion Correct:**

This question combines the need for specific historical recall with accurate application to a concept ("urban planning") and articulation in English. The examples suggest Social Science topics often lead to very low pass rates, especially for descriptive or explanatory questions.

While "Harappan Civilization" is a core topic, its specific *urban planning* features might be less well-recalled than broader historical narratives or more recent history. The precise vocabulary needed for the correct answer is also a barrier.

Considering the examples (9-12% pass rates for comparable Social Science questions) and the reasons above, a *slightly* higher pass rate might occur if some students *do* recall the distinctness of Harappan cities (e.g., straight roads, good drains
