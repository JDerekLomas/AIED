Let's break down the likely errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Potential Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Fundamental Lack of Knowledge of Voice:**
    *   Many students, given the overall low English proficiency, might simply not understand what "active voice" or "passive voice" means. This isn't a vocabulary issue, but a grammatical concept unknown to them.
    *   **Result:** Complete inability to transform.

2.  **Verb Form Confusion (Participle Form - "blown"):**
    *   The biggest hurdle will be the irregular past participle of "blow." Students are likely familiar with "blow" and "blew" but might struggle with "blown."
    *   **Common Mistakes:**
        *   "The leaves *was blowed* away by the wind." (Invented regular past participle)
        *   "The leaves *were blew* away by the wind." (Using past simple instead of past participle)
        *   "The leaves *were blow* away by the wind." (Using base form)

3.  **Subject/Object Inversion and Auxiliary Verb ("were"):**
    *   While they might grasp that the object becomes the subject, they may struggle with the auxiliary verb.
    *   **Common Mistakes:**
        *   "The leaves *blew* away by the wind." (Missing auxiliary verb)
        *   "The leaves *was blew* away by the wind." (Incorrect auxiliary verb for plural subject)
        *   "The leaves *are blown* away by the wind." (Incorrect tense - active is past simple, passive needs past simple auxiliary)
        *   "The leaves *were blown* away from the wind." (Misuse of preposition "from" instead of "by")

4.  **Omitting "by the wind":**
    *   Some students might correctly identify the new subject and use the past participle but omit the agent. While often grammatically acceptable in passive voice, for this type of transformation exercise, it's a "failure" by the rubric.
    *   **Common Mistake:** "The leaves were blown away."

5.  **Direct Object vs. Prepositional Phrase ("away"):**
    *   The "away" is an adverb here, not part of the direct object itself, but related to the verb phrase "blew away." Students might struggle to correctly position it.
    *   **Common Mistakes:** Unlikely to be a primary error, as it generally follows the verb correctly even in a garbled passive attempt.

6.  **"Empty Response" / Not Attempting:**
    *   Given the other low pass rates, many students will simply leave it blank if they have no idea, or write something completely unrelated (like "The wind is good"). This would fall under "Empty Response."

**Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   "The leaves was blowed away by the wind." (Incorrect verb form, incorrect auxiliary)
*   "The leaves were blew away by the wind." (Incorrect verb form)
*   "The leaves are blown away by the wind." (Incorrect tense of auxiliary)
*   "The leaves blew away by the wind." (Missing auxiliary verb)
*   "Empty Response" (High likelihood)
*   "The wind has blown the leaves away." (Attempts to change voice, but misunderstands the mechanics or tense)
*   "The leaves were blowing away by the wind." (Progressive tense confusion)

**Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**

Given the specific instruction ("Change... from Active Voice to Passive Voice"), it's likely many students will *attempt* a change if they recognize the term "voice" at all, even if their understanding is rudimentary. However, the conceptual gap for some will be too wide, leading to "Empty Response." The prompt *implies* a transformation, which encourages an attempt.

**Estimating the Pass Rate:**

Considering the general English proficiency, the pass rates for other complex questions (4-10%), and the specific hurdles:

*   **Understanding "Active/Passive Voice":** Many will fail here directly.
*   **Irregular Verb "blow" -> "blown":** A very significant obstacle.
*   **Correct Auxiliary Verb (tense and number):** Another common mistake point.
*   **Syntactic restructuring:** Placing "by the wind" correctly.

The pass rates for the other questions suggest a very low baseline for complex grammatical transformations. This question requires multiple precise changes:
1.  Identify subject/object.
2.  Invert them.
3.  Choose correct auxiliary verb (were, not was/are).
4.  Use correct past participle (blown, not blowed/blew).
5.  Maintain "
