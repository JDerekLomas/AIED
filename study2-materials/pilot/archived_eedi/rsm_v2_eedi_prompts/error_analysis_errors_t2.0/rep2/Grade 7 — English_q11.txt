Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the context of Class 7 students from economically weaker sections with limited English, and the previous examples of low pass rates and common errors, here's what we can expect:

*   **Misconception about "Phrase" vs. "Word":** This is likely the most significant hurdle.
    *   Students might correctly identify "tiny" as an adjective if they have a basic understanding of word types. However, the instruction asks for an "adjective phrase."
    *   Many will likely pick *only* "tiny" because it's the obvious adjective. They might not understand that a "phrase" implies multiple words working together (even though in this specific case, the "adjective phrase" is just "tiny" if one strictly follows a simple definition where a single adjective can constitute an adjective phrase when modifying a noun). However, students are often taught "phrases" as groups of words.
    *   Conversely, some might try to identify a group of words that modifies a noun but pick the wrong group (e.g., "in our balcony" – thinking it describes *where* the bird built, without connecting it to "tiny").
*   **Misconception about "Adjective":**
    *   Some students might not know what an adjective is at all. They might guess randomly or leave it blank.
    *   They might confuse it with a noun or verb. For example, they might pick "bird" (the subject of the sentence) or "built" (the verb).
*   **Language Misunderstanding ("Identify"):**
    *   The word "identify" itself might be slightly challenging, but given the previous questions asking to "describe," "write," etc., "identify" is relatively straightforward. The primary misunderstanding will be *what* they are identifying.
*   **Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**
    *   Based on the previous examples where many "Empty Response" answers appeared for writing tasks, there's a good chance some students will not attempt it if they feel completely lost.
    *   However, for a multiple-choice or single-word/short phrase answer, they might be more inclined to guess rather than leave it blank, especially if they recognize familiar words. This question, requiring identification from a given sentence, encourages an attempt more than a generative writing task.
*   **Most Common Wrong Answer Looks Like:**
    1.  **"Tiny" (but missing the "phrase" concept):** This will be a *very* common partially correct (but rubrically incorrect for a strict interpretation of "adjective phrase") answer, indicating they know what an adjective is. If the rubric is *only* looking for "tiny," this would be correct. But "adjective phrase" usually implies more than one word in academic settings. *However, the given rubric specifies "identifies 'tiny' as an adjective." This dramatically changes things. It suggests the rubric considers "tiny" to be the correct answer, implying that a single word *can* be an adjective phrase for the purpose of this question or that they are really just looking for the adjective.* Let's proceed with the understanding that the rubric makes "tiny" the correct answer.
    2.  **"Bird":** Confusing the adjective with the noun it modifies.
    3.  **"Built":** Confusing the adjective with the verb.
    4.  **"Its nest":** Thinking this phrase describes the bird, but not understanding adjective function.
    5.  **"In our balcony":** Confusing an adjective phrase with a prepositional phrase (describes *where*, but not directly an adjective).
    6.  **"A tiny bird":** This would be an adjective *noun phrase*, not an adjective phrase on its own.
    7.  **Empty/No Response:** Still likely for a portion of students who feel overwhelmed.

**Re-evaluating based on the *explicit rubric*:**

"The student correctly identifies "tiny" as an adjective."
"Max score: 1"

This rubric is key. It directly equates "identifying the adjective phrase" in this sentence with "identifying 'tiny' as an adjective." This implies that either:
a) For the purpose of this question, "tiny" itself is considered the adjective phrase, or
b) The question intends to test understanding of *adjectives* despite the wording "adjective phrase," and the most prominent adjective is "tiny."

Given the low pass rates on previous questions, if the students only need to identify the *word* "tiny," the task becomes considerably easier than if they had to truly understand the complex grammatical concept of an adjective *phrase* in cases like "very tiny" or "blue-eyed."

Many students would at
