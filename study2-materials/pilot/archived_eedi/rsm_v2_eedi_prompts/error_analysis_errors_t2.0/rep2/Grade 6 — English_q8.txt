Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the context of Class 6 students from economically weaker sections with limited English, and the observed error patterns in other questions:

*   **Core Understanding:** The concept of rearranging words to form a coherent sentence is fundamental. They likely understand what a "sentence" is in their native language, but the specific English structure might be a hurdle.

*   **Vocabulary/Word Recognition:**
    *   `book`: Very common word, likely recognized.
    *   `reading`: Also very common, part of their daily English lessons.
    *   `a`: Indefinite article, usually well-known.
    *   `is`: Common "to be" verb, likely recognized.
    *   `he`: Common pronoun, usually well-known.
    *   *Conclusion:* Word recognition is unlikely to be the primary blocker for individual words.

*   **Syntactic Misconceptions/Language Misunderstandings:** This is where the core errors will lie.
    *   **Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) Order:** This is the most crucial concept. Students might be tempted to arrange words based on what "sounds right" to them in their native language, or simply by the order they encounter them, rather than following SVO.
    *   **Ignoring Grammatical Roles:** They might not distinguish between subject, verb, and object, treating all words as interchangeable units.
    *   **Missing Punctuation/Capitalization:** While not explicitly mentioned in the rubric for a "meaningful sentence," a *correct* sentence would start with a capital letter and end with a period. However, the question focuses purely on word order. Many might forget the capital H. The rubric allows for this.
    *   **Inversion Tendency:** In some Indian languages, verb-final or other structures are common. This might lead to inversions like "Reading a book he is" or "A book is he reading."
    *   **Prepositional Phrase Misplacement (Less likely here):** In questions with prepositions, they often get misplaced, but "a book" isn't a complex prepositional phrase.

*   **Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**
    *   **Attempt Rate:** This question is short, straightforward in its prompt (rearrange words), and uses very common words. Unlike open-ended writing tasks where "Empty Response" is common, students are highly likely to *attempt* this question because they see the words and know they need to put them in an order. The "Empty Response" rates for the more complex questions confirm that students tend to avoid harder, more abstract tasks, but for concrete tasks, they attempt.
    *   **Failure:** The failure would come from incorrect word order.

*   **What would the most common wrong answer look like?**
    *   **Near Misses:**
        *   "He reading a book is." (Incorrect verb placement, but subject and object are somewhat correct).
        *   "Reading a book he is." (Incorrect subject placement).
        *   "A book is he reading." (Object-verb-subject, likely trying to imitate an interrogative without the correct intonation/purpose).
        *   "He is book a reading." (Adjective-noun order incorrect).
        *   "He is a book reading." (Correct initial S-V-a, but object and main verb reversed).
    *   **Random Order/Partial Correctness:**
        *   "Reading a book is he."
        *   "Is he reading a book." (Forming a question inadvertently).
    *   **Missing Words (Less likely for a rearrange task, but possible due to oversight):** Though the words are provided.

**Revisiting Previous Common Errors in Context:**

The other errors listed indicate a significant struggle with:
*   **Abstract Concepts:** "Describes the poet's writing style," "theme or central idea." This task is concrete.
*   **Extended Writing/Coherence:** "Short paragraph," "4-5 sentences." This task is a single sentence.
*   **Specific Grammar Rules:** While not directly assessed by the rubric here, the inability to apply specific grammatical structures is evident. The "My favourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy" error shows an inability to form coherent sentences beyond listing.

**Conclusion for Rearrangement Task:**

This task is *significantly less abstract and demanding* than the examples provided. It's a direct test of fundamental English syntax (SVO). While they struggle with advanced concepts, rearranging words is a common exercise for teaching basic sentence structure. Students will attempt it. Their errors will mostly be variations of incorrect S
