Let's break down the question and anticipated errors to estimate the pass rate.

**The Question:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"

**Rubric:** Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why.

**Analysis of the Question and Likely Comprehension:**

*   **"Which line from the poem..."**: This requires recall of a line from a *specific* poem, implying the poem was presented or discussed earlier. Students who struggle with reading comprehension or memory will face a barrier here.
*   **"...do you like the most..."**: This asks for a personal opinion. This is relatively straightforward to understand, but linking it to "why" is the key.
*   **"...and why?"**: This requires an explanation or justification. This is often the hardest part for students with limited language proficiency. It demands not just identification but also elaboration.

**Common Errors & Misconceptions:**

1.  **"Empty Response" / Non-Attempt:** Given the difficulty of the other questions (4-10% pass rate), a significant portion of students will likely leave this blank or write very little, indicating a complete lack of understanding or confidence.
2.  **No Line Mentioned, Only "Why" (or "Like"):** Students might understand "like" and "why" but fail to link it to a specific "line from the poem." They might just write: "I like the poem" or "I like this poem because it is good." This doesn't meet the "denotes a line" part of the rubric.
3.  **Mentions a Line, No "Why" or Inadequate "Why":**
    *   **Direct Translation of "Why":** Some might attempt a "why" but provide very rudimentary answers, possibly direct translations from their native language that don't make full sense in English, e.g., "I like this line. It is beautiful." (Not specific enough to score)
    *   **Repetition of the line itself as the "why":** "I like 'The birds sang in the morning' because the birds sang in the morning." (Does not demonstrate understanding of "why")
    *   **Extraneous Information/Irrelevant Reason:** "I like this line because my friend also likes it." or "I like this line because the poem is about flowers." (Even if the poem *is* about flowers, this doesn't explain *why* that specific line is liked.)
4.  **Misidentifying a Line/Incorrect Recall:** Students might remember a general idea or phrase from the poem but not an exact line. They might paraphrase poorly or pick a phrase that isn't a direct "line." (e.g., if the poem has "sun's golden rays," they might write "the sun's rays")
5.  **Focus on Plot/Summary Instead of "Like":** Similar to "The last bargin they about a child and labour..." from the theme question, students might interpret this as asking for a general description or summary of a part of the poem related to a line, rather than their personal *preference* and its reason. "I like when the child works" instead of "I like the line 'The child worked hard' because it shows determination."
6.  **Basic Sentence Structure Errors:** Even if they try to formulate an answer, basic grammar (subject-verb agreement, tenses, prepositions) will be very challenging, potentially rendering their "why" incomprehensible or partially comprehensible.

**What the Most Common Wrong Answer Would Look Like:**

Based on the patterns observed:

*   **"Empty Response" / "I don't know."** (Extremely common, probably the most common)
*   **"I like the poem." / "This poem is good."** (Common, indicates some comprehension of "like" but fails to mention a line or explain "why" adequately)
*   **"I like 'the tree is green'. Because it is good."** (Attempts both parts, but "why" is too generic and doesn't score)
*   **"I like this line. Very nice."** (Fails to state the line, generic "why")

**Factors affecting the pass rate upwards:**

*   **Personal Opinion is Easier:** The "do you like the most" part is inherently less demanding than objective analysis (like "theme" or "writing style").
*   **Open-ended "Why":** Unlike a very specific question, any reasonable justification of preference *could* score if clearly articulated.
*   **Lower Bar for Partial Credit (potentially):** If "denotes a line" is fulfilled and the "why" is very basic but *connected*, a sympathetic grader might give partial credit, though the rubric is clear ("mentions why"). However, given the
