Let's break down the likely errors for the question: "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it."

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Direct Translation/Literal Interpretation (Major Error Source):**
    *   Students might not understand "paragraph" as a cohesive unit. They might just list things, much like "My favourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy" from the example.
    *   They might translate word-for-word, resulting in grammatically awkward or nonsensical sentences.

2.  **Lack of Sentence Structure Knowledge (High Impact):**
    *   Difficulty forming complete sentences beyond simple subject-verb-object.
    *   Inability to connect ideas with conjunctions or appropriate transitions to form a coherent "paragraph."
    *   Reliance on very short, declarative sentences without expansion, making it difficult to meet the "4-5 sentences" requirement in a meaningful way.
    *   Example: "My hobby is cricket play" is a prime example of fragmented thinking.

3.  **Vocabulary Limitations (Moderate Impact):**
    *   Struggling to articulate *why* they enjoy a hobby due to limited vocabulary for emotions, activities, or benefits. This directly targets a rubric requirement ("why you enjoy it").
    *   Repeating simple words excessively.

4.  **Misunderstanding "Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it" (High Impact):**
    *   Students might *only* state what the hobby is, completely omitting "when" and "why." This is a common simplification seen in their short-answer attempts.
    *   They might attempt "when" but fail to connect it grammatically ("I do evening everyday" instead of "I do it every evening").
    *   "Why you enjoy it" is often the most challenging part due to abstract reasoning and vocabulary. They might say "I like it" without further explanation, or struggle to elaborate on feelings.

5.  **Difficulty with "Short Paragraph (4-5 sentences)" (High Impact):**
    *   **Under-length:** Many will write 1-2 sentences only, struggling to elaborate. This is common when understanding "paragraph" is weak.
    *   **Over-length (Less common for this group, but possible):** Some might write a collection of disconnected sentences that technically add up to 4-5, but don't form a cohesive paragraph.
    *   **Lack of Cohesion:** Even if they write 4-5 sentences, they might not flow logically, failing the "paragraph" aspect of the rubric.

6.  **"Empty Response" or "Not Attempted":**
    *   Given the complexity (multiple requirements, paragraph format), a significant portion of students will likely not attempt it at all, or only write a few words and then stop. This is a common occurrence as seen in the examples provided ("Empty Response").
    *   Fear of making errors, lack of confidence, or simply not knowing how to start.

**Most Common Wrong Answer Patterns:**

*   **List-like:** "My hobby is playing cricket. I play cricket. I like cricket." (Fails to form a paragraph, doesn't detail *when* or sufficiently *why*.)
*   **Too Short:** "My favourite hobby is reading books." (Missing 'when', 'why', and paragraph structure).
*   **Fragmented Sentences/Grammar Issues:** "My hobby is cricket play. Every day I play. It is very good." (Fails cohesion, poor grammar).
*   **Incomplete Address of Prompts:** Mentions hobby, perhaps when, but completely skips "why." Or just names the hobby.
*   **Similar to given example:** "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho" – A list without full sentences, likely confused by the question or unable to produce connected thought.
*   **"Empty Response":** As indicated in the given examples, this is a strong possibility when the task feels overwhelming.

**Connecting to the Rubric:**

*   **"Student writes a complete paragraph"**: This will be a major stumbling block due to the cohesion, length, and flow issues discussed.
*   **"clearly mentions the hobby, when it is done, and why it is enjoyable"**: Each of these sub-requirements will be missed or poorly executed by a substantial number of students, especially the "why enjoyable" part.

**Estimating the Pass Rate:**

Given the examples and the observed common errors, the requirements for this question (paragraph, specific details, coherence) are quite high for students struggling with basic sentence formation and understanding
