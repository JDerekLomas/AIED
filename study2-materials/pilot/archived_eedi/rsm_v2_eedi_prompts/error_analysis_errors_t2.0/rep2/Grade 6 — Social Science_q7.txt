Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

## Analysis of Potential Errors for "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science:**

*   **Lack of Specific Geographical Knowledge:** While students might generally know about "resources," many may not have specific geographical knowledge of what resources are found in *Rajasthan*. They might list general resources (trees, rivers) that are common but not necessarily prominent or specifically defining for Rajasthan.
*   **Difficulty Linking Resource to Influence:** Even if they identify a correct resource, explaining its "influence on people's lives" requires a higher level of analytical thinking. This is where many answers fail, even for students who get the first part right. They might simply state "people use it" rather than elaborating on how it shapes economy, lifestyle, housing, or migration patterns.
*   **Understanding "Natural Resource":** Some might confuse man-made things or infrastructure with natural resources (e.g., listing a factory or a dam as a natural resource).

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Natural Resources":** The term itself might be somewhat complex for students with limited English. They might understand "natural" and "resource" individually but struggle to connect them or grasp the scope of what falls under "natural resources."
*   **"Influences the lives":** This phrase requires understanding causality and description, which can be challenging. They might give very superficial explanations.
*   **Regional Names:** "Rajasthan" itself could be misremembered or misspelled, leading to a loss of focus.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **Attempt Likely, but Incomplete/Vague:** This question isn't overtly difficult to *attempt*. Students can usually list *something* they think is a resource. However, completing the second part (explaining influence) is harder, making incomplete answers very common.
*   **"Empty Response" less likely for the first part:** Compared to the abstract "explain significance of Ashoka" or "how colonial rule affected," this question is more concrete. Most students will try to list *some* resource.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **Listing only one correct resource, or two incorrect/vague resources:**
    *   "Trees and animals." (Too general, not specific to Rajasthan's defining resources)
    *   "Rivers and mountains." (True but also general, doesn't get to key *natural resources* of economic significance for Rajasthan as a resource-rich state in some specific areas).
    *   "Water." (Correct but often listed alone)
*   **Correct resources, but no explanation of influence, or a very poor explanation:**
    *   "Marble, water. People use water for drinking." (Correct resources, but insufficient explanation for full marks on influence, or the influence explanation is too basic.)
    *   "Sand and sun. People use sand for building." (Partial explanation)
*   **Mix of correct and incorrect resources:** "Coal and Sand." (Coal is present, but less prominent or characteristic for Rajasthan compared to other listed options; sand is very generic. Rubric expects *more significant* resources.)
*   **Confusing with tourist attractions:** "Palaces and deserts." (Misunderstanding "natural resource")
*   **Repetition of general phrases:** "People use resources for their life."
*   **Poorly structured answers, even if some elements are correct:** Grammatical errors, jumbled sentences.

**Based on these likely errors:**

Given the average pass rate of 29% for general questions and the typical common errors for Social Science, this question, while seemingly straightforward, still presents significant hurdles.

*   The first part (listing two resources) is moderately accessible. Many might get one right (water is a common guess), but two *specific and relevant* ones for Rajasthan might be challenging for students who lack specific geography knowledge.
*   The second part (explaining influence) is where a majority will struggle, as it requires basic analytical thinking beyond simple recall. They might provide very superficial answers ("people drink water," "farmers grow crops with water") which don't demonstrate a deeper understanding of its "influence."

Comparing it to the other difficult questions (9-12% pass rates), this is more concrete and should fare better. However, it's not a pure recall question and demands an explanation.

I expect a significant drop-off from students who get part 1 (listing resources) correct, to those who get both part 1 and a sufficient part 2 explanation for full marks.

My estimate leans towards the lower end of a "moderately easy" question in this context, given the detailed rubric. Students might get half-correct (e.
