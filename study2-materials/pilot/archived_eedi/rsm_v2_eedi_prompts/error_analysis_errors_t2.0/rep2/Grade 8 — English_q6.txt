Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors for "Define Fable":**

Given the context of Class 8 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections with limited English, and the example pass rates for other questions, we can anticipate several types of errors:

1.  **"Empty Response" / Non-Attempt:** This is a very significant issue, as seen in the examples. Students might not understand the word "Define" or "fable," or lack the confidence to attempt, leading to blank answers.
    *   **Misconception:** Lack of vocabulary for "define" or "fable."
    *   **Attempt:** Not attempted.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** Blank.

2.  **Partial Understanding of "Define" but not "Fable":**
    *   Students might grasp that they need to *explain something*, but not what "fable" means. They might offer a definition of a related but incorrect concept.
    *   **Misconception:** Misunderstanding of "fable."
    *   **Attempt:** Attempted but wrong content.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:**
        *   "It is a story." (Too general, misses key elements.)
        *   "It is like a poem." (Confusion with other literary forms.)
        *   "Fable means speaking." (Possible confusion with "able" or a very loose interpretation.)

3.  **Partial Understanding of "Fable" but Poor English Expression:**
    *   A student might have a basic idea (e.g., "story with animals"), but struggle to articulate it cohesively in English, similar to the "My Favourite Hobby" examples. They might use fragments, incorrect grammar, or a very limited vocabulary.
    *   **Misconception:** Language barrier, not conceptual.
    *   **Attempt:** Attempted, showing some knowledge, but failed to meet rubric.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:**
        *   "Fable animals story."
        *   "It is a animal short story." (Missing moral lesson, poor grammar)
        *   "A story from long time." (Confusing with folk tale or myth)
        *   "Teach lesson by story." (Missing animal characters)

4.  **Literal Interpretation of "Fable" if related to Hindi:** While less likely to create *specific* wrong answers given the question "Define fable" (rather than translate), if "fable" is a sound-alike or partially understood word in a regional dialect with a different meaning, it could lead to unrelated answers. (Less common than vocabulary gap).

5.  **Confusing "Fable" with a specific story they know:** Instead of defining, they might *name a fable* or tell a very brief story.
    *   **Misconception:** Misunderstanding of "define" (instead of defining the term, they provide an example or narrative).
    *   **Attempt:** Attempted, showing some relevant knowledge but misinterpreting the task.
    *   **Common Wrong Answer:** "The thirsty crow." / "The rabbit and tortoise story."

**Comparison to Example Questions:**

*   "Describes the poet's writing style" (4%): Requires understanding abstract literary analysis terms. "Define fable" is more concrete but still requires specific vocabulary. The very low pass rate here suggests "Define fable" won't be high.
*   "Write a theme or central idea..." (5%): Also abstract. Similar high rates of "Empty Response."
*   "Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby" (10%): This is a more familiar, personal topic. Even here, sentence construction and proper paragraphing are major hurdles, leading to fragmented, grammatically incorrect responses. This indicates that even with a clearer understanding, expression is tough. "Define fable" requires more specific, formal language.

**Conclusion for "Define Fable":**

*   The biggest hurdle will be understanding "fable" and "define" and then having the English vocabulary to construct a grammatically correct definition with the key components (short story, animals, moral lesson).
*   Many will likely leave it blank ("Empty Response") or give very generic answers like "It is a story."
*   Others will attempt partial definitions with significant grammatical errors, missing elements of the rubric (e.g., only mentioning animals, but not the moral, or vice versa).
*   The exact definition of "fable" (animals + moral) is a specific piece of knowledge. While they might encounter fables, they may not have been explicitly taught the *definition* of the literary term.

Given the extreme difficulty of the other questions, even relatively concrete tasks prove challenging. "Fable" is not an everyday word, and "
