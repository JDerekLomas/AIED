## Contrastive Analysis of the Temperature Question:

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
* **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition, multiplication.
* **Time Calculation:** Understanding hours within a day (12-hour clock, AM/PM). This is a common real-world concept.
* **Temperature:** Basic understanding of degrees Celsius and temperature increase.

**Language Demands:**
* **Simple English:** The language used is straightforward and uses common vocabulary ("morning," "evening," "increases by," "per hour").
* **Keywords:** "temperature," "increases by," "per hour," "at 4:00 in the evening." These are relatively transparent.
* **No complex grammatical structures.**

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
* **Application:** This question primarily requires application of basic arithmetic and time calculation skills to a given scenario. It's not rote recall of a definition, nor does it involve complex multi-step reasoning. Students need to apply their understanding of "per hour" and calculate the duration.

**Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
* **Moderate Difficulty:** This is a classic word problem often found in elementary math textbooks. It's a step up from simple direct calculations but not as complex as multi-variable problems or those requiring algebraic thinking.
* **Real-world Context:** The temperature scenario makes it relatable, which can sometimes aid comprehension for students.
* **Similar to "rate" problems:** Many Class 6 math curricula introduce concepts like distance, speed, and time, or unit rates. This question fits that pattern.

**How this question compares to the calibration anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Far easier. That item requires abstract interpretation, understanding literary concepts, and expressing them coherently in English, which is a very high bar for this demographic.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Easier. That item requires recall of specific social studies definitions, understanding nuanced differences, and providing examples, also in English. It's content-specific and likely less familiar than basic time/temperature.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Similar, possibly slightly easier. While that item is about writing a paragraph (which has its own challenges for English proficiency), the topic is personal and doesn't require complex calculations. However, the structure and length requirement can be daunting. The temperature problem is more objective.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Likely similar difficulty. This is a recall question from a specific text. If students remember the story, it's easy. If not, it's impossible. The temperature question requires calculation, not direct recall, making it more universally solvable if the underlying math skills are present. The language of the temperature question is also arguably simpler to process than extracting specific details from a story.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Harder. This is pure recall of specific social studies content. If they know the rights, it's easy. If not, it's a zero. The temperature question allows for step-by-step calculation and partial understanding, even if the final answer isn't perfect. It's less dependent on memorization of specific facts.

**Overall Assessment:**

The question is a standard word problem involving time and simple arithmetic. The language is very accessible, and the concepts (time, temperature increase) are concrete. The main hurdle for students would be:
1.  **Correctly calculating the time duration:** 10 am to 4 pm. This involves understanding that 12 pm (noon) is a transition point.
2.  **Performing the multiplication and addition correctly.**

Given the average pass rate of 29% and the nature of the calibration anchors, this question falls into the category of problems that a significant portion of students should be able to approach, even with limited English, because the core task is mathematical and the language is minimal. The main stumbling block will be the time calculation (6 hours).

It's more accessible than abstract literary interpretation or detailed historical differentiation. It's less reliant on pure memorization than the Fundamental Rights question. It's a very common type of problem, suggesting it would have been practiced.
