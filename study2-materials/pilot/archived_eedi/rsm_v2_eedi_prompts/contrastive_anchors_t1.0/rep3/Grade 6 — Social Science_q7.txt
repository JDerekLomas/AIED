Let's break down the question and compare it to the calibration anchors.

**Question Analysis:**
"Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."

*   **Prior Knowledge:** Requires specific geographical knowledge about Rajasthan and its natural resources. Students need to know *what* a natural resource is and then recall specific examples from a particular Indian state. The second part requires understanding the *impact* of a resource on human life, which is a conceptual application.
*   **Language Demands:**
    *   "Mention any two natural resources": Relatively straightforward. "Natural resources" is a key concept in Social Science, likely taught in English.
    *   "found in Rajasthan": Specific geographical knowledge.
    *   "explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there": This is the more demanding part. "Explain" requires more than just listing. "Influences the lives" is a common phrase but might be challenging for students with limited English to articulate fully and coherently.
*   **Cognitive Demand:**
    *   Part 1 (mention two resources): Recall.
    *   Part 2 (explain influence): Application/Reasoning. It asks for a causal link and description, which is more complex than simple recall.
*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:** Listing resources might be common. Explaining their influence is a slightly higher-order thinking skill, moving beyond rote memorization. Textbooks might provide examples, but students would need to synthesize that information or apply it to a specific context.

**Contrastive Analysis with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **vs. 5% (Theme of a poem):** This question is *much easier*. Identifying a theme is highly abstract, requires strong comprehension and interpretive skills, and formulating it in English is tough. "Natural resources" is a concrete concept, and recalling two is far simpler. Explaining influence is still easier than theme.
*   **vs. 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** This question is *easier*. Differentiation requires understanding two distinct concepts and their nuances. While "natural resources" and "influence" are also concepts, the specific examples and the nature of the explanation (causal link, not a definition/difference) are more accessible. Also, the 15% item asks for *two* examples for *each* and differentiation, which is quite a lot.
*   **vs. 30% (Short paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This question is *comparable or slightly easier*. The paragraph question is open-ended and asks for personal expression, but it requires sustained writing (6-8 lines) and addressing multiple prompts (what you like to do, eat/wear). The natural resources question is more structured. Recalling two resources is very easy. Explaining the influence is shorter than a full paragraph and more factual than personal. The 30% item showed very short, fragmented answers.
*   **vs. 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This question is *harder*. The 50% item is pure recall of specific plot points from a story. If a student remembers the story, it's a direct copy. The natural resources question requires both recall (resources) and a degree of synthesis/explanation (influence). While the recall part is easier, the explanation elevates the difficulty.
*   **vs. 66% (Name any two Fundamental Rights):** This question is *harder*. Naming two Fundamental Rights is pure, direct recall of a fundamental civic concept. These are often memorized. "Natural resources of Rajasthan" is also recall, but "explaining influence" adds a layer of complexity that the Fundamental Rights question lacks. The 66% item is like the 50% item in terms of pure recall, just for a highly emphasized topic.

**Synthesis:**

The question combines recall with a basic explanation.
*   **Recall (two resources):** Very likely high accuracy for this part if they've studied Rajasthan geography. Many common resources (water, minerals, sand, sun) are well-known.
*   **Explanation (influence):** This is the trickier part. Students might list a resource but struggle to articulate *how* it influences lives, especially with limited English. They might give very brief, fragmented answers or just state a consequence without a clear explanation. For example, "Rajasthan has water, so people drink it" might not be considered a full "explanation" of influence. However, given the context of partial scoring (even for a "1" score item on the rubric), partial explanations might be accepted.

The difficulty lies between the pure recall items (50%, 66%) and the more abstract/differentiating items (5%, 15%). The "favorite season" item (30%) is
