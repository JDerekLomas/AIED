## Contrastive Analysis of "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India"

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
* **Geographical Literacy:** Basic knowledge of India's physical geography, specifically the location and names of prominent mountain ranges. This is fundamental Class 6 Social Science content (Geography).
* **Recall of Names:** Students need to recall at least one correct name from memory.

**Language Demands:**
* **Simple, Direct Question:** "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India." The language is extremely straightforward, with no complex vocabulary or grammatical structures. "Major mountain ranges" is easily understood.
* **Minimal English Proficiency Required:** Students only need to understand "name," "two," "major," "mountain ranges," and "India." Even with limited English, these core words are likely to be familiar or inferable from context within a geography exam. The answer itself only requires writing a proper noun.
* **No Sentence Construction:** Unlike the "theme of a poem" or "differentiate" questions, students do not need to construct complex sentences or explain concepts. They just need to list names.

**Type of Cognitive Task:**
* **Recall:** This is a pure recall question. Students either know the names or they don't. There's no application of concepts or complex reasoning involved.

**Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
* **Very Common:** This is a very common type of question found in Class 6 geography textbooks and exercises. "Name the following," "List two examples of," "Identify the..." are standard formats. Students would have encountered similar questions frequently.
* **Directly from Curriculum:** The major mountain ranges of India are a core topic covered in the geography section of Class 6 Social Science.

**Difficulty Compared to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."**
    *   **Much Harder:** This requires comprehension of a poem, abstract thinking to identify a theme, and the ability to articulate it in English. The language demands are high, and it's a higher-order thinking skill. Our target question is just recall.

*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each.**
    *   **Harder:** This requires understanding two distinct concepts, identifying their differences, and providing relevant examples. It involves conceptual understanding and the ability to explain, which is more complex than simple recall. The language "differentiate" is also more demanding.

*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season." Talk about what you like to do, what you eat or wear, and w**
    *   **Comparable/Slightly Harder:** While "My favorite season" is a common creative writing topic, it requires constructing multiple sentences, organizing thoughts, and expressing personal preferences. It tests written expression and fluency in English. Our question is much simpler in terms of output and language demand. However, the *content* of "favorite season" is very familiar and personal, making it accessible even with weak English. The difficulty of writing 6-8 lines, even simply, pushes it higher.

*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?**
    *   **Slightly Harder:** This is also a recall question, but it requires recalling specific details from a story. While likely a well-known story ("The Three Questions"), retrieving specific textual details can be harder than recalling a general geographical fact. It assumes the student has read and retained specific plot points. Our question asks for general geographical facts which are often reinforced through maps and multiple contexts.

*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India.**
    *   **Very Similar Difficulty / Possibly Slightly Harder:** This is almost identical in format and cognitive demand (recall two specific items from a list). The key difference lies in the content:
        *   **Fundamental Rights:** While taught in Class 6 Civics, the *names* of the rights can sometimes be a bit more abstract or have longer phrasing (e.g., "Right to Freedom of Religion") than mountain ranges. Students might also confuse the *number* of rights or struggle with precise wording.
        *   **Mountain Ranges:** These are concrete geographical features often studied visually (maps) and through simpler, more memorable names (Himalayas, Aravalli). The visual aid of maps in textbooks might make them slightly more ingrained.

**Conclusion on Difficulty:**

The question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" is a **low-language-demand, pure recall question** on a core Class 6 Geography topic. It is
