The question "Who lived inside the book?" requires recall of a specific detail from a text that students would have presumably read. Let's break down its difficulty compared to the calibration anchors and other factors:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge:** The primary prior knowledge assumed is having read the specific text from which this question is drawn. Without having read the story, it's impossible to answer. Assuming the story was taught/assigned, the challenge then shifts to memory and comprehension.
*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Lived inside" is very common and accessible Class 6 English. There are no complex words or idioms.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The question is a simple interrogative sentence ("Who X Y?"). This is a basic structure.
    *   **Response:** The expected answer is a short phrase, "a magical fairy" or "fairy." This is a minimal English output demand.
*   **Cognitive Demand (Recall, Application, Reasoning):** This is a pure **recall** question. Students simply need to remember a specific character from the story. There's no application of concepts or complex reasoning required.
*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:** This is a very common type of comprehension question found in Class 6 English textbooks (e.g., "Who is the main character?", "Where did X live?"). It's foundational.

**Comparison to Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."** This is much harder. It requires understanding abstract concepts (theme/central idea), synthesizing information from an entire poem, and articulating a complex idea in English. "Who lived inside the book?" is a single factual recall.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources...** This is also significantly harder. It requires understanding two distinct concepts, comparing and contrasting them, and providing examples – all requiring more sophisticated conceptual understanding and English expression.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season."** This is harder because it requires sustained writing, organization of thoughts, and a broader vocabulary. While the topic is relatable, the execution demands are higher. "Who lived inside the book?" requires only a few words.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is a strong comparison point. It's also a recall question, asking for specific details. The difficulty here is recalling *three* distinct pieces of information, which might be slightly harder than recalling *one* character. However, the language required to answer is similar. The 50% anchor asks for a list, while "Who lived inside the book?" asks for a single entity.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India.** This is another good comparison. It's also a recall question, asking for specific factual information. Like the king's questions, it requires recalling *two* distinct items. The terms "Fundamental Rights" and "Constitution of India" are specific social science vocabulary, potentially adding a slight layer of difficulty, but the overall structure is similar.

**Analysis of "Who lived inside the book?":**

*   **Simplicity:** The question is very direct and uses simple English.
*   **Minimal Output:** The correct answer is extremely concise ("a fairy").
*   **Recall:** It relies purely on memory of a specific detail from a text.
*   **Context:** Assuming the story was covered in class and the character was prominent, this should be a relatively easy piece of information to recall. It's often one of the first things students learn about a story's characters.

Given the calibration anchors, especially the 50% and 66% items which are also recall-based but require slightly more complex recall (multiple items or specific terminology), "Who lived inside the book?" feels easier. It's a single, simple recall of a central character. Even with limited English, students should be able to identify "fairy" if they remember the story. The average pass rate is 29%, indicating that many questions are quite challenging. This question, however, is on the easier end of the spectrum for comprehension questions.

I would expect a higher pass rate than the "king's questions" (50%) or "fundamental rights" (66%) because it asks for a single, often central, character, and the vocabulary is extremely simple.
