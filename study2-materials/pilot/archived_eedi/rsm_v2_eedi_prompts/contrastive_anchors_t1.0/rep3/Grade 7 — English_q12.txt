## Contrastive Analysis: Active to Passive Voice Transformation

Let's break down the difficulty of "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice:\nThe wind blew the leaves away." for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering their specific context.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Understanding of basic sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object):** Students need to implicitly identify "the wind" as the subject, "blew" as the verb, and "the leaves" as the object.
*   **Concept of active and passive voice:** This is a grammatical concept. While it might be introduced in Class 7 English textbooks, active mastery, especially for students with limited English exposure, is not guaranteed. They need to understand *what* active and passive voice are and *why* they are used.
*   **Knowledge of verb tenses and their passive forms:** The original sentence is in simple past tense ("blew"). To transform it, students need to know that the passive form for simple past uses "was/were" + past participle. This requires knowing the past participle of "blow" (blown). This is a significant hurdle.
*   **Prepositional phrase "by the wind":** They need to know to reintroduce the original subject using "by."

**Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**

*   **Grammatical Terminology:** "Active Voice," "Passive Voice," "Sentence" – these are technical terms. While they might be exposed to them, their comprehension and ability to apply them are often weak.
*   **Sentence Comprehension:** The sentence "The wind blew the leaves away" is relatively straightforward English, but understanding "blew...away" as a phrasal verb might be a minor point of confusion, though "blew" itself should be comprehensible.
*   **Producing Grammatically Correct English:** The core task is to *produce* a correct sentence in English. This demands not just conceptual understanding but also accurate recall of grammar rules (auxiliary verb, past participle, "by" phrase) and correct spelling.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   This is primarily an **application** task, but it heavily relies on **recall** of specific grammatical rules and verb forms.
    *   Recall: What is passive voice? How do you form it for simple past tense? What is the past participle of "blow"?
    *   Application: Applying these recalled rules to the given sentence.
*   There's minimal higher-order reasoning involved beyond the mechanical transformation.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Typical textbook exercises:** Often present examples, then provide sentences for practice. The difficulty here lies in whether they have sufficiently practiced this *specific* transformation (simple past tense, irregular verb) to an extent that it's internalized.
*   **The specific sentence:** "The wind blew the leaves away" is a very common and standard example for active-to-passive transformation, making it somewhat "textbook-like." However, the irregular verb "blow-blew-blown" adds a layer of complexity compared to a regular verb like "The boy kicked the ball."

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."** This requires high-level comprehension, abstract thinking, and articulate expression. Far more complex than our target question.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each.** This requires conceptual understanding, comparative analysis, and factual recall from history, with some English expression. Harder than our target, as it's more conceptual and requires two distinct examples and a differentiation.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season."** This is a free-response writing task, requiring creativity, vocabulary, and sentence construction over multiple sentences. While it might seem easy, generating coherent paragraphs is often hard for these students, as seen by the quality of the 30% responses. This is a good anchor for *productive* English tasks.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is a direct recall question from a specific text ("The Three Questions"). If students remember the story, it's a direct information retrieval. No complex grammar or interpretation. The difficulty here is largely memory and identifying key information.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India.** This is direct factual recall from civics. If they know the names, they can answer. Limited English required beyond naming the rights.
