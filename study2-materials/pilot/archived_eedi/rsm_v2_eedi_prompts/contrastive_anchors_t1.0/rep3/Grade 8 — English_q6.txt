Here's a breakdown of the analysis for "Define fable":

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Direct:** The student needs to know what a "fable" is. This is a common literary term, often introduced in primary school. Many Indian students would have encountered fables (like Panchatantra stories) in their native languages, even if the English term "fable" isn't immediately familiar.
    *   **Implicit:** Understanding of "story," "characters," "moral lesson."

*   **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Define," "fable," "typically," "imparts," "moral lesson." "Imparts" might be a stretch for some, but "moral lesson" is fairly common.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Students need to construct a coherent sentence or two to define it. This is simpler than writing a paragraph or differentiating between two concepts.
    *   **Simplicity:** The definition itself is relatively straightforward. There aren't complex grammatical structures required to express the core idea.

*   **Type of Cognitive Task:**
    *   **Recall:** Primarily recall of a definition. There's no application or reasoning involved beyond remembering the key characteristics.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Defining terms is a very common textbook exercise, especially for literary devices. It's often one of the first questions in a chapter or a glossary entry.
    *   It's less demanding than:
        *   Writing a theme/central idea (pass rate 5%): Requires deeper comprehension and analytical thinking, plus ability to articulate an abstract concept.
        *   Differentiating between two concepts (pass rate 15%): Requires understanding *both* concepts and their distinctions, often with examples.
        *   Writing a short paragraph (pass rate 30%): Requires sustained writing, idea generation, and grammatical coherence over several lines.
    *   It's more demanding than:
        *   Naming two fundamental rights (pass rate 66%): Pure recall of specific, well-drilled facts.
        *   Identifying three questions the king wanted to answer (pass rate 50%): Pure recall of specific details from a story, likely just copying from the text if available. The nuance here is that "fable" isn't something you can usually find verbatim in the text.

**Why it's likely easier than the 5%, 15%, and 30% items, but harder than the 50% and 66% items:**

*   **Easier than 5%, 15%, 30%:** Requires less higher-order thinking (no analysis, comparison, or extended writing). The definition is a fairly discrete piece of information.
*   **Harder than 50%, 66%:** While it's recall, it's not a simple copy-paste from a passage (like the king's questions might be). It's also not as fundamental or frequently drilled as "Fundamental Rights." Many students might know what a fable *is* in their regional language but struggle with the precise English vocabulary for its definition. However, the core elements (animals, moral) are very distinctive and commonly associated with the term.

The key discriminating factor will be whether students have explicitly learned and remembered the English definition, or can infer/translate the concept they know from their native language. Given the average pass rate is 29%, this item feels like it sits slightly above that, as it's a foundational literary term.

**Revised Estimate Reasoning:**

Considering the above, a significant portion of students will have encountered fables and possibly even the term "fable" in their English curriculum. While "imparts a moral lesson" might be challenging to phrase perfectly, many might get close with "teaches a lesson" or "has a moral." The "animals as characters" part is very distinctive and easily recalled.

I'd place it higher than "Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" (15%) because "fable" is a more common and conceptually simpler literary term for Class 8 than the specific terminology of historical sources. It's also less demanding than the paragraph writing (30%). It's harder than simply naming specific rights or questions from a text, but the concept is widely known.

Let's look for a sweet spot. The jump from 30% to 50% is about complexity of recall. "Define fable" requires accurate recall of 2-3 key characteristics. This is often taught with simple sentence structures.
