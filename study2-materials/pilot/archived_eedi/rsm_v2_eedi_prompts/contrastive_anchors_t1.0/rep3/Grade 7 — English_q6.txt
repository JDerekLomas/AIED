Here's an analysis of the question "Describes the poet’s writing style" for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, followed by an estimate of the proportion correct.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Poem Comprehension:** Students need to have read and understood "The Last Bargain" (or whichever poem this question refers to, though the anchors imply "The Last Bargain" is a common text). This is a foundational assumption.
    *   **Literary Terminology (Basic):** They need to understand the concept of "writing style" and be able to identify descriptive words for it (e.g., simple, descriptive, informal, direct). This is a higher-order skill than simple recall.
    *   **Vocabulary:** They need sufficient English vocabulary to articulate a suitable descriptive word.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Abstract Concept:** "Writing style" is an abstract concept. It's not a concrete noun or a direct action. Understanding and expressing abstract ideas is challenging for learners with limited English.
    *   **Vocabulary for Style:** Even if they grasp the concept, finding the *right* English word to describe it (e.g., "simple," "descriptive," "evocative") will be difficult. They might think of a style but lack the English word for it.
    *   **Lack of Specifics:** The question is open-ended. Unlike "Name two fundamental rights" or "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" which have specific answers, "describe the style" requires interpretation and generation of appropriate vocabulary.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** While the answer can be just one word, the cognitive process of arriving at that word involves complex thought in English.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **Application and Reasoning**. It's not recall (unless they were explicitly taught "The Last Bargain" has a 'simple' style and memorized it, which is unlikely for such a question).
    *   Students must read the poem, analyze its language, structure, and tone, and then apply their understanding of "writing style" to characterize it. This is a higher-order thinking skill.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question is generally *more difficult* than typical textbook exercises for this demographic.
    *   Typical exercises often focus on:
        *   Direct comprehension (e.g., "Who said this?", "What happened next?").
        *   Vocabulary (e.g., "Find synonyms for...").
        *   Grammar (e.g., "Fill in the blanks").
        *   Simple recall (e.g., "Name the poet").
    *   Analyzing "writing style" requires a deeper level of engagement with the text and a more sophisticated English vocabulary to express the analysis. Many Class 7 students might struggle to move beyond simply understanding the plot or characters to critically evaluating the author's technique.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme/Central Idea):** This question is similar in its abstract nature to finding a theme. Both require synthesis and articulation of an overarching concept. "Writing style" might be slightly less abstract than "theme" for some, but the English vocabulary demand remains high. The example "Happiness is find in innocence" shows students can attempt to articulate an abstract idea, but often with grammatical errors.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate Archaeological/Literary Sources):** This involves specific knowledge and differentiation, but the examples show students can use domain-specific terms. Our question is more interpretative.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (My Favorite Season - Paragraph):** This allows for personal expression, which can be easier as students use familiar vocabulary. The prompt is also highly structured. Our question is much less structured.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three Questions the King Wanted):** This is direct recall from a story. Much easier as the information is explicitly stated in the text.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is direct recall of specific civic knowledge, often rote memorized. Much easier.

**Conclusion on Difficulty:**

This question requires a relatively high level of comprehension, analytical skills, and English vocabulary for abstract concepts. It is well beyond simple recall and is more demanding than questions asking for direct facts or personal descriptions. The struggle with articulating abstract concepts and finding appropriate English vocabulary will significantly depress the success rate. It's likely to perform closer to the lower end of the anchors, similar to "theme" or "differentiate," but perhaps slightly above the very hardest as "style" might be perceived as marginally more concrete than "theme."
