Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimate:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Understanding what "area," "triangle," "base," and "height" mean in a geometric context.
    *   Knowing the formula for the area of a triangle: `Area = 1/2 × base × height`. This is a fundamental concept typically taught in Class 6 or 7.
    *   Basic multiplication and division (multiplying 8 by 6, then dividing by 2 or multiplying by 1/2).
    *   Understanding units (cm, cm²).

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   The language is very straightforward and concise: "Find the area of a triangle whose base is 8 cm and height is 6 cm."
    *   There are no complex sentence structures or abstract vocabulary. "Find," "area," "triangle," "base," and "height" are all standard mathematical terms that students would likely encounter frequently in their textbooks, even if they are Hindi-medium. The numbers and units are also clearly presented.
    *   Compared to the "The Last Bargain" theme question (5% pass rate) or even "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources" (15% pass rate), the English here is exceptionally low-demand.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily an **application** question, but it leans heavily on **recall** of the formula. Once the formula is recalled, the application involves simple substitution and calculation.
    *   There's very little "reasoning" beyond understanding that the given numbers correspond to the base and height in the formula.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very standard, entry-level problem for finding the area of a triangle. It's often one of the first few exercises after introducing the formula. There are no complications like needing to find the height or base from other information, or unit conversions. It's a direct application of the formula.
    *   The absence of multiple steps, complex shapes, or word problem elements makes it significantly easier than more advanced geometry problems.

**Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"My favorite season" (30% pass rate):** This question requires more creative writing, sustained thought, and a greater command of English vocabulary and sentence structure. "Area of triangle" is much more formulaic and requires less linguistic output.
*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50% pass rate):** This tests recall of a specific detail from a story. While direct recall, it requires remembering a narrative point, which can be harder than remembering a mathematical formula, especially given potential literacy challenges. The language here is also slightly more complex, and students might struggle to extract the *exact* three questions.
*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66% pass rate):** This is direct recall of civics content. Fundamental Rights are a key topic in Indian civics, and students likely encounter them repeatedly. The question is also very direct and allows for short, specific answers. The difficulty here seems comparable. Both require specific factual recall (formula vs. rights) and then simple application/listing.
*   **Average pass rate across items (29%):** This "area of triangle" question is clearly *above* the average difficulty due to its directness, common mathematical concept, and minimal language demand.

**Factors for Estimate:**

*   **High Familiarity:** The formula for the area of a triangle is very common and would be drilled in Class 7 math.
*   **Low Language Barrier:** The English is extremely simple and direct.
*   **Direct Application:** No complex reasoning or multi-step problem-solving.
*   **Numerical Data:** Math problems, especially simple ones, often perform better than abstract or linguistic tasks for students with lower literacy but some numerical fluency.
*   **Potential Errors:** The most likely errors would be forgetting the `1/2` in the formula, or a simple multiplication/division error. However, even if they forget `1/2` and just do `8 x 6 = 48`, they might still get partial credit if the rubric allowed it (though this rubric is strict: "States or uses the correct formula"). For a full score, the formula must be correct.

Given the strong calibration anchors, particularly the 50% (recall from story) and 66% (recall of fundamental rights), this question falls comfortably in the upper half. It's a core mathematical skill that is heavily practiced. The language is less demanding than the 50% item, and the mathematical concept is likely as well-rehearsed as the civics concept for
