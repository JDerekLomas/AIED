Here's a breakdown of the analysis for "Define fable," followed by the estimate:

## Contrastive Analysis for "Define Fable"

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Literary Terminology:** Students are expected to know what a "fable" is as a literary genre. This isn't just about understanding the individual words "define" and "fable," but having encountered and understood the concept itself.
*   **General Reading Comprehension:** Basic understanding of stories, characters, and moral lessons is assumed, though this is less specific to the term "fable."
*   **Exposure to Fables:** Crucially, students who have read fables (even in their native language) and discussed their characteristics will have an advantage. Many Indian textbooks introduce fables (often Aesop's Fables) early on.

**2. Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
*   **"Define":** This is a fairly common instructional verb. Students should generally understand it means to explain what something is.
*   **"Fable":** This is a specific literary term. While it might be a cognate in some Indian languages or have been directly taught in English class, it's not an everyday word. Students might struggle if they only know the concept in their local language but not the English term.
*   **Formulating a Definition:** The most significant language demand is articulating a clear, concise definition in English that captures the key elements (short story, animals, moral). This requires not just knowing the concept but having the vocabulary and grammatical structure to express it.
    *   Keywords needed: "short story," "animals" (or "animal characters"), "moral," "lesson."
    *   Syntactic complexity: Joining these concepts into a coherent sentence or two.

**3. Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
*   **Recall:** Primarily recall. Students need to remember the definition of "fable" as taught in their English or literature classes.
*   **Minimal Application/Reasoning:** There's no application of the definition to a new text, nor any complex reasoning required beyond recalling the core attributes.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   **Similar to Vocabulary/Glossary Questions:** This is a very common type of question found in textbook end-of-chapter exercises or glossaries: "Define X."
*   **Easier than complex comprehension:** It's less demanding than summarizing a story, analyzing character motivation, or writing a paragraph on a given topic, which require more synthesis and original thought.
*   **Harder than simple factual recall:** It's harder than "Who wrote 'The Last Bargain'?" (if Rabindranath Tagore was directly mentioned) because it requires constructing a multi-part definition rather than just retrieving a single piece of information.
*   **Crucial Factor:** The extent to which "fable" (and its definition) is explicitly taught and reinforced in Class 8 English textbooks is key. If it's a standard vocabulary item, it will be easier. If it's only briefly mentioned, it will be harder. Given the typical curriculum, it's a relatively common term.

## Comparison to Calibration Anchors:

*   **Pass Rate 5% (Theme of "The Last Bargain"):** This required deep comprehension of a poem, abstract reasoning, and advanced English articulation. "Define fable" is much easier as it's a direct recall of a taught definition.
*   **Pass Rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** This required recalling two distinct concepts, providing an example for each, and demonstrating comparative understanding. It's multi-part and slightly more complex in its conceptual demand. "Define fable" is a single concept.
*   **Pass Rate 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This requires sustained writing, organization of thoughts, and a broader range of vocabulary to express personal preferences. While a definition is shorter, it demands precision of specific academic terms. Many students who struggle with free composition might still be able to recall a definition. The 30% item is also quite open-ended, allowing for partial credit on "what I like to do, eat, wear." A definition of fable is more 'all or nothing' in terms of capturing the key attributes for a score of 1.
*   **Pass Rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is direct recall from a story. If students remember the story, they can often list the points. This is similar in its recall nature to "Define fable," but listing specific items might be slightly easier than constructing a formal definition from scratch, especially if the items are short phrases. However, the definition of fable is typically a taught fact.
*   **Pass Rate 66% (Two Fundamental
