Here's a breakdown of the analysis for the target question: "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Poem Comprehension:** Students must have read and understood "The Last Bargain" (the poem in the 5% anchor item). Without understanding the poem's content, choosing a line and explaining *why* they like it is impossible. This is a significant hurdle, as the 5% pass rate for "Write a theme or central idea" suggests many struggle with deep comprehension.
    *   **Subjective Preference:** The question asks for a personal opinion, which is generally less about recall and more about interpretation and feeling. This can be challenging for students unaccustomed to expressing personal views in academic settings, especially in a foreign language.
    *   **Basic Vocabulary:** "line," "poem," "most," "why." These are common words, but "most" and "why" require understanding the nuance of expressing preference and providing justification.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Identifying a Line:** This is relatively straightforward – copying or paraphrasing a specific sentence from the poem.
    *   **Expressing Preference ("like the most"):** Simple enough.
    *   **Providing Justification ("and why"):** This is the crucial part that significantly raises the language demand. Students need to formulate a coherent reason, which could involve abstract concepts (e.g., "it shows kindness," "it talks about freedom," "it makes me feel happy"). This goes beyond simple factual recall and requires more complex sentence structures and vocabulary.
    *   **Translation/Code-switching:** Students might understand the poem's meaning in their native language but struggle to articulate their reasons in English. They might default to very simple, repetitive explanations (e.g., "I like it because it is good").
    *   **Grammar and Syntax:** Even if they have a reason, expressing it grammatically correctly in English can be a challenge. The rubric is likely to be lenient on grammar for a 1.5-mark question, but severe errors could still impede understanding.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Partial recall (recalling lines from the poem).
    *   **Application:** Application of understanding of the poem to form a personal opinion.
    *   **Reasoning:** Primarily **reasoning** to justify their choice. This is where the difficulty lies. It requires students to connect a specific line to an emotional response or a perceived meaning, and then articulate that connection.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 6 textbook exercises often focus on factual recall ("Who said what?", "What happened next?").
    *   Questions asking for personal opinions and justifications are less common, especially in a second language, unless the curriculum specifically emphasizes critical thinking and personal response to literature. This makes it more demanding than a simple "find the answer in the text" question.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'"**
    *   This question requires deep comprehension and the ability to synthesize meaning into an abstract theme. The target question is *related* to understanding the poem but focuses on a personal response to a *specific line*, not the overarching theme. However, the inability to identify a theme suggests many won't comprehend the poem well enough to articulate *why* they like a line.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..."**
    *   This is a factual recall/definition question requiring precise terminology. Much higher language demand for specific academic terms. The target question is less about technical vocabulary and more about general expression.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'"**
    *   This is a strong comparison. It's also a personal response, requiring justification ("what you like to do, eat, wear"). The 30% pass rate suggests that even with a relatively simple and familiar topic (favorite season), sustained writing and explanation in English is challenging.
    *   The target question is *simpler in length* (justifying one line, not 6-8 lines) but *more complex in topic* (explaining preference for a poem line vs. activities in a season).
    *   Crucially, for "My favorite season," students don't need to *comprehend an external text* first. They just draw on their own experience. For the target question, comprehension of the poem is a prerequisite.
*   **Item (pass rate
