Here's an analysis of the "My Favourite Hobby" question, comparing it to the calibration anchors and then providing an estimate:

## Contrastive Analysis of "My Favourite Hobby"

**Question:** Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it.
**Rubric:** Student writes a complete paragraph that clearly mentions the hobby, when it is done, and why it is enjoyable.
**Max score:** 1

**Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Compared to "The Last Bargain" theme (5% pass rate):** This question is significantly easier. "The Last Bargain" requires deep comprehension of poetry, abstract thought to identify a theme, and the ability to articulate it concisely. "My Favourite Hobby" is personal and concrete, requiring less abstract reasoning or complex literary analysis.
*   **Compared to "Differentiate archaeological and literary sources" (15% pass rate):** This question is easier. Differentiating sources requires specific historical knowledge, understanding of definitions, and the ability to provide distinct examples for each. "My Favourite Hobby" draws on personal experience, not specific academic knowledge.
*   **Compared to "My favorite season" (30% pass rate):** This is the most similar anchor. Both require writing a short paragraph about a personal preference, listing associated activities/reasons.
    *   **Similarities:** Both are personal narrative, open-ended, and require basic paragraph construction. Both explicitly list elements to include (what you like to do, eat/wear vs. what it is, when you do it, why you enjoy it).
    *   **Differences that might make "My Favourite Hobby" slightly easier:**
        *   **Lexical availability:** Students might have more readily accessible vocabulary for their hobbies than for a "season," which might involve more descriptive adjectives for weather, food, or specific clothing. Hobbies are often more action-oriented.
        *   **Concreteness:** "My Favourite Hobby" might feel more specific and actionable for some students (e.g., "I play cricket," "I draw pictures") compared to "My favourite season," which could be broader and require more nuanced description.
        *   **Rubric:** The "My favorite season" rubric had a max score of 3, implying more detail was expected, even if the pass threshold was lower. The "My Favourite Hobby" rubric is a simple 1 or 0 for a complete paragraph with the three requested elements. This simplicity of the rubric might make it easier to achieve the passing score for "My Favourite Hobby."
*   **Compared to "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50% pass rate):** This question is harder. While "Three questions" is recall, it's specific recall from a text, and students only needed to list the points. "My Favourite Hobby" requires original sentence construction and paragraph formation, even if the content is personal.
*   **Compared to "Two Fundamental Rights" (66% pass rate):** This question is harder. "Fundamental Rights" is specific recall of memorized civic knowledge, and students only needed to list two. "My Favourite Hobby" demands original composition, even if simple.

**Analysis of Specific Question Difficulties:**

*   **Prior knowledge assumed:** Very little academic prior knowledge. Assumes students have a concept of "hobby" and can identify one for themselves. Assumes basic understanding of paragraph structure.
*   **Language demands:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** Requires common vocabulary related to hobbies (e.g., "play," "draw," "read," "sing," "cricket," "books"). The target vocabulary is likely to be high-frequency.
    *   **Sentence structure:** Requires basic subject-verb-object structures, conjunctions for connecting ideas (e.g., "and," "because"), and temporal markers (e.g., "in the evening," "after school").
    *   **Paragraph coherence:** Demands putting 4-5 sentences together in a logical flow, addressing the three prompts (what, when, why). This is a foundational writing skill but can be challenging for students with limited English.
    *   **"Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it":** This explicit scaffolding helps guide students and reduces ambiguity, making it easier than a completely open-ended prompt.
*   **Recall, application, or reasoning:** Primarily application (applying basic writing skills to a personal topic). It involves a minimal amount of personal recall (what *is* my hobby, *when* do I do it) and simple reasoning (why *do* I enjoy it).
*   **Difficulty compared to typical textbook exercises:** This aligns well with a common Class 7 English writing exercise. "Write about yourself," "Describe your favourite..."
