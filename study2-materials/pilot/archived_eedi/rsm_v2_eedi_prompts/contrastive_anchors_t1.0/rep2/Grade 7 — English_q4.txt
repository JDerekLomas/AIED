Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis of "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **The King's Questions:** Crucially, students need to recall or identify the three questions the king wanted to answer. This question *does not* provide them. This links to the difficulty of the 50% pass rate item: "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" If a student couldn't recall those for that item, they'll struggle here.
*   **Concept of "Importance" and "Real Life":** These are relatively straightforward concepts for Class 7 students.
*   **Formulating a "Reason":** Students need to be able to articulate a simple justification.

**2. Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
*   **"Do you think...":** Simple interrogative.
*   **"...king's questions are important...":** "Important" is a common word, likely known.
*   **"...in real life?":** Common phrase, understandable context.
*   **"Give one reason":** Clear instruction.
*   **Constructing the Answer:** The main linguistic challenge will be forming a coherent sentence or two to express their opinion and a reason. This requires basic sentence structure and vocabulary. Compared to the "theme" question (5% pass rate), which requires abstract understanding and precise language, this is much simpler. Compared to "differentiate" (15% pass rate), which requires specific vocabulary and comparative structures, this is also easier.

**3. Type of Cognitive Task:**
*   **Recall/Application (Implicit):** Students first need to recall (or have understood from the passage, which is likely part of the context of the exam) the king's three questions.
*   **Opinion/Reasoning:** The core of the question is asking for an opinion ("Do you think...") and a simple justification. This is a lower-level reasoning task, more about personal reflection than complex logical deduction or application of learned facts. It's less demanding than synthesizing a "theme" or differentiating concepts.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   This type of question ("Do you agree?", "Why do you think...?") is common in English and moral science textbooks, often used to encourage critical thinking and personal response after reading a story.
*   It's generally easier than factual recall questions if the "fact" (the king's questions) is readily available or recently covered. However, as noted, the king's questions are *not* provided in *this* prompt, increasing the reliance on memory from the story.
*   The "short paragraph" (30% pass rate) item requires sustained writing and adherence to a topic, which is harder. Naming fundamental rights (66% pass rate) is pure recall, but specific and often memorized.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **vs. 5% (Theme):** Much easier. This question is concrete, requires opinion and a simple reason, not abstract interpretation or sophisticated vocabulary.
*   **vs. 15% (Differentiate):** Easier. No specific historical terms or comparative structures required.
*   **vs. 30% (Paragraph "My favorite season"):** Potentially comparable in terms of sentence construction, but this question has a more specific prompt and a simpler "reason" expectation. The "paragraph" asks for more length and detail.
*   **vs. 50% (What were the three questions...):** *Crucial comparison.* If students struggled with *recalling* the questions (50% pass rate), they will struggle to answer *this* question meaningfully, as it builds directly on that recall. However, this question only asks for *one reason* and their *opinion*, making the *output* required simpler than listing three distinct questions accurately. A student might vaguely remember the *gist* of the questions and still be able to formulate a reason.
*   **vs. 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Harder. While 66% is high, it's specific factual recall. This question requires *both* a prior recall (the king's questions) *and* generating an opinion/reason.

**Refinement of Difficulty:**

The key challenge here is the implicit expectation of recalling the king's questions. If a student completely forgets them, they cannot answer. However, the *type* of answer required (opinion + simple reason) is very accessible for those who remember the premise. The rubric implies a valid reason would be accepted, not necessarily a deeply philosophical one. "Yes, because it helps you make good decisions" would likely suffice.
