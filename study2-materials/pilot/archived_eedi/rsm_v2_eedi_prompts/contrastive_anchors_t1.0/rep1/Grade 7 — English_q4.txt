Here's an analysis of the question and my estimate:

## Contrastive Analysis of "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Reading Comprehension:** Students need to have understood the preceding story (likely Leo Tolstoy's "Three Questions") to recall what the king's questions were. This is a direct follow-up.
*   **Basic Life Experience/Critical Thinking:** The question asks for an opinion and a reason, drawing on students' understanding of real-world applicability. This doesn't require specific academic knowledge beyond understanding the prompt.

**2. Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
*   **Simple Sentence Structure:** "Do you think...?" and "Give one reason" are straightforward.
*   **Vocabulary:** "Important," "real life," and "reason" are common words even for students with limited English, likely encountered in everyday conversation or basic textbooks.
*   **Expressing Opinion:** Formulating an opinion and a reason in English can be challenging. While the required output is minimal (one reason), students need to be able to construct a simple explanatory sentence.
*   **Rubric Note:** The rubric is lenient, accepting "any valid reason." This lowers the bar for complex English expression.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
*   **Recall (Implicit):** Students need to recall the *content* of the king's questions from the passage, even if not explicitly restating them.
*   **Application/Reasoning (Primary):** The core of the question is to *apply* the king's questions to real life and *reason* why they are important. It's not just about recalling facts but about forming an opinion and justifying it.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
*   **Textbook Standard:** This type of question (opinion, justification based on a text) is very common in English language arts textbooks, especially after reading a story. It assesses comprehension beyond simple factual recall and encourages critical thinking.
*   **Easier than complex analysis:** It doesn't require theme identification (like the 5% anchor), differentiation (15% anchor), or a multi-sentence paragraph (30% anchor). It's a single thought, simply expressed.
*   **Similar to "Three Questions" recall (50% anchor):** The 50% anchor ("What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?") directly asks for the content. This question builds on that, assuming the content is known, and asks for an opinion *about* that content. Students who could recall the questions are likely to have a foundational understanding to answer this.

**Comparison with Anchors:**

*   **vs. 5% (Theme):** Much easier. "Theme" is abstract and requires deeper analytical skills and sophisticated English to articulate. This question is concrete ("important in real life") and asks for a simple reason.
*   **vs. 15% (Differentiate):** Easier. Differentiation requires understanding two distinct concepts and comparing/contrasting them, plus examples. This is a single, personal opinion.
*   **vs. 30% (Paragraph):** Easier. Writing a 6-8 line paragraph on "My Favorite Season" demands more sustained writing, vocabulary, and sentence variety than a single reason.
*   **vs. 50% (Recall King's questions):** Likely similar difficulty, perhaps slightly harder due to the "give one reason" part. However, the reasons can be very simple and still score. Many students who could recall the questions would intuitively grasp their real-life relevance.
*   **vs. 66% (Fundamental Rights):** This question is harder than simply recalling two named rights, as it requires forming an opinion and providing a justification, even if simple. However, the conceptual understanding is very accessible.

**Factors making it easier:**

*   **Low language barrier for "reason":** Many simple answers like "it helps you make good decisions" or "it makes life better" would suffice.
*   **Relatability:** The king's questions (right time, right people, right thing) are universally applicable and easy to connect to personal experiences.
*   **Single point:** Only one reason is required, minimizing output demands.
*   **Opinion-based:** Reduces the pressure for a "correct" factual answer, making it feel less daunting.

**Factors making it harder:**

*   **Requires opinion generation:** Some students might struggle to articulate *why* they think something is important, even if they intuitively understand it.
*   **Assumes passage comprehension:** If a student didn't understand the original story or the king's questions, they won't be able
