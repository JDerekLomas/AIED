Here's an analysis of the "My Favourite Hobby" question, comparing it to the calibration anchors and then providing an estimate:

## Contrastive Analysis of "My Favourite Hobby"

**Question:** Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it.
**Rubric:** Student writes a complete paragraph that clearly mentions the hobby, when it is done, and why it is enjoyable.
**Max score:** 1

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Minimal content knowledge:** This question requires no specific academic prior knowledge. Students simply need to reflect on their own lives and experiences. This is a significant advantage compared to items like "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources" or "Fundamental Rights."
*   **Concept of 'hobby':** Most Class 7 students, even from economically weaker sections, would understand the concept of a hobby or a leisure activity they enjoy.
*   **Basic paragraph structure:** Students are expected to know what a paragraph is and how to construct sentences that flow together. This is a common expectation by Class 7.

**2. Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
*   **Simple vocabulary:** The core concepts ("favourite," "hobby," "when," "why," "enjoy") are relatively basic English terms that would likely be introduced early in English language learning.
*   **Sentence construction:** Students need to form simple declarative sentences. The prompt explicitly gives them the structure ("what it is," "when you do it," "why you enjoy it"), which acts as a scaffold.
*   **Paragraph length:** "4-5 sentences" is a manageable length, preventing students from feeling overwhelmed by the writing task.
*   **Self-referential:** Writing about oneself often reduces cognitive load compared to writing about abstract concepts or historical facts. Students can draw on personal vocabulary and experiences directly.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
*   **Application/Personal expression:** This is primarily an application of language skills for personal expression. It's not recall (like "Fundamental Rights") or complex reasoning (like analyzing a poem's theme). Students apply their vocabulary and grammar to describe their own experiences.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
*   **Easier than many:** This type of personal essay prompt is a common, foundational exercise in English language learning. It's often used early to build confidence and fluency.
*   **More structured than some:** Compared to an open-ended "write a story," the specific prompts ("what, when, why") make it easier to structure the response.
*   **Similar to "My favorite season" (30% pass rate) but potentially easier:**
    *   **"My favorite season" (30%):** Prompt was "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season." Talk about what you like to do, what you eat or wear, and w".
    *   **Comparison:**
        *   **Length:** "My Favourite Hobby" is 4-5 sentences, while "My favorite season" was 6-8 lines. Shorter length for "Hobby" reduces writing burden.
        *   **Content specificity:** Both give specific content prompts.
        *   **Vocabulary:** 'Hobby' might be slightly more abstract than 'season' for some, but the core concepts are similar in difficulty.
        *   **Personal relevance:** Both are highly personal.
        *   **Rubric:** The rubric for "Hobby" is just "complete paragraph that clearly mentions..." (Max score 1). The example for "My favorite season" that scored 3 (full marks) was "Rainy season is my favorite season. I am so enjoy the Rainy season. fastly Growing plants and ". This suggests that even partial/imperfect English was accepted for full credit if the core elements were present. This implies a fairly lenient rubric for both.

**Conclusion based on comparison:**

*   **No external knowledge required:** Huge advantage over academic items.
*   **Simple language, personal topic:** Reduces cognitive load and language barrier issues.
*   **Explicit scaffolding:** The "what, when, why" prompts guide the student directly.
*   **Manageable length:** 4-5 sentences is less daunting than longer paragraphs.
*   **Likely lenient rubric:** Similar to the "My favorite season" example, basic ideas conveyed in simple English would likely be sufficient for a passing score.

Given the average pass rate of 29% and the calibration anchors:
*   The 5% and 15% items require specific knowledge and/or higher-order thinking (theme, differentiation).
*   The 30% item ("My favorite season")
