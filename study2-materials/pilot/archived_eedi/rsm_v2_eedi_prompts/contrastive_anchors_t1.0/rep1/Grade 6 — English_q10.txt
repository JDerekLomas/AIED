## Contrastive Analysis of "Some/Any" Question

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   Basic understanding of countable nouns (apples).
*   Rudimentary grasp of positive vs. negative/interrogative sentence structures, even if not explicitly knowing the grammatical terms.
*   Exposure to "some" and "any" in common English phrases, either through textbooks or spoken English, even if limited.

**Language Demands:**
*   **Vocabulary:** "Apples," "basket" are very common and likely known. "There are" is also a common phrase.
*   **Grammar:** The core demand is distinguishing between "some" and "any" in a positive declarative sentence. This is a fundamental concept in English grammar.
*   **Reading:** The sentence is short, simple, and uses high-frequency words. The choices are also short.
*   **Writing/Production:** Students only need to *choose* the correct word, not produce a sentence or explain their reasoning. This is a multiple-choice-like task, which is less demanding than open-ended responses.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
*   This is primarily an **application** task. Students need to apply a grammatical rule (or learned pattern) to a new sentence. It's not pure recall (like naming Fundamental Rights) nor complex reasoning (like differentiating historical sources). It leans heavily on learned usage patterns.

**Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   This is a very common type of fill-in-the-blanks exercise found in early English language learning materials. It's a foundational point often taught early on when introducing quantities and basic sentence structures. It's likely simpler than writing short paragraphs or explaining themes.

**Difficulty Compared to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Compared to 5% (Theme of poem):** Much, much easier. That requires abstract comprehension, inference, and complex English expression. This is a simple grammar rule application.
*   **Compared to 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Considerably easier. That requires specialized vocabulary, definition recall, comparison, and examples, all in longer written form. This is a single word choice.
*   **Compared to 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Much easier. That requires sentence construction, organization of ideas, adherence to length constraints, and more varied vocabulary. This is a minimal choice.
*   **Compared to 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** Likely easier. While that is recall, it requires remembering specific details from a story and accurately listing them. This question tests a grammatical pattern that might be more frequently practiced. However, the 50% item is also quite straightforward if the story was known.
*   **Compared to 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is where the comparison gets interesting. Naming two Fundamental Rights is pure recall of specific information, which if memorized, is very easy. If not memorized, it's impossible. The "some/any" question relies on a learned pattern that can be intuitively grasped even without formal grammatical terms. For students with limited English, grammatical rules can be tricky. However, "some" in positive sentences and "any" in negative/questions is a very basic and frequently encountered pattern.

**Estimated Proportion Correct Rationale:**

The question is grammatically fundamental, uses very common vocabulary, and requires only a single word choice. It's a standard exercise for elementary English learners. While the students have limited English proficiency, "some/any" is introduced very early and is often drilled. The average pass rate is 29%, indicating many struggles. However, the format is simple, and the concept of "some" in a positive statement is likely one of the first quantifiers they learn. Many might answer based on what "sounds right" from limited exposure rather than explicit rule knowledge.

Given that even abstract poem themes get 5% and complex definitions get 15%, a basic grammar point in a simple sentence should score significantly higher. Compared to the 50% item (recall of specific story details), this is arguably more accessible because grammar patterns can be internalized through exposure, whereas specific plot points need to be actively remembered. The 66% item is pure memorization, which can be very high if taught well. This question is an application of a very common pattern.

I anticipate a good proportion of students will recognize "some" as the correct fit for a positive statement about existing items, even if their overall English is weak. This is a core building block.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **58%**
