Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimate:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic understanding of English word order (Subject-Verb-Object).
    *   Recognition of common words: "he," "is," "reading," "a," "book."
    *   Implicit understanding of capitalization for the start of a sentence and a period at the end (though the rubric only asks for rearrangement, not perfect punctuation).
*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** All words are extremely common and likely part of a Class 6 English curriculum, even for students with limited proficiency. "Reading" and "book" are high-frequency words.
    *   **Grammar/Syntax:** This is the core challenge. Students need to apply basic SVO structure. However, the words provided inherently hint at this structure, as "he" is clearly a subject, "is reading" is a verb phrase, and "a book" is an object. There are no distractors or ambiguous words.
    *   **Sentence Complexity:** The target sentence "He is reading a book" is a very simple, declarative sentence.
*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of learned grammatical rules (SVO word order). It's not pure recall (like remembering facts) or complex reasoning.
*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very common type of exercise found in early English language learning textbooks, especially for students learning basic sentence construction. It's often one of the first grammatical structures taught. It's less complex than differentiating historical sources (15%) or writing a paragraph (30%). It's also less abstract than finding a theme (5%). It's comparable in conceptual simplicity to naming Fundamental Rights (66%) or the King's questions (50%), but those rely on content knowledge, whereas this relies on foundational English structure.

**Why it's relatively easy for this demographic (but not 100%):**

*   **Ubiquitous Grammar:** SVO is foundational. Even with limited English, students who have had *any* exposure to English sentence formation would likely have encountered this.
*   **Common Vocabulary:** No challenging words.
*   **Limited Options:** With only five words, the number of truly "meaningful" permutations is very small. "He is reading a book" is the most natural and grammatically correct option. "A book is reading he" or "Reading he is a book" are clearly nonsensical.
*   **Hindi Medium Context:** While English proficiency is limited, basic sentence structure is often drilled. The words "he," "is," "reading," "a," "book" are very basic building blocks taught early on.

**Why it won't be 100%:**

*   **Low Overall Pass Rate (29% average):** This indicates significant challenges across the board. Some students will have extremely minimal English exposure.
*   **Lack of Practice/Engagement:** Even if taught, without consistent practice, the application might fail.
*   **Test Anxiety/Carelessness:** Some might rush or get confused by the format.
*   **Alternative, Less Common, but Technically Grammatical Answers:** While "He is reading a book" is the clearest, very few other arrangements would even be remotely plausible. The rubric is strict on SVO.

**Calibration against Anchors:**

*   **5% "Theme of poem":** Requires abstract understanding and articulation. Much harder.
*   **15% "Differentiate sources":** Requires conceptual understanding, recall of examples, and comparative language. Harder.
*   **30% "My favorite season" paragraph:** Requires sustained writing, idea generation, and grammatical coherence over multiple sentences. Significantly harder.
*   **50% "Three questions the king wanted to answer":** Requires recall of specific story details. This is content recall. This question is harder than "Rearrange" because it relies on memory of a specific text, whereas "Rearrange" relies on general grammatical rule application.
*   **66% "Two Fundamental Rights":** Requires recall of specific civic education content. This is also content recall, and again, slightly harder than "Rearrange" because it needs specific memorized facts, whereas "Rearrange" only needs basic structure application.

The "Rearrange" question is simpler than all the recall/application anchors. It's a very basic grammar task with simple vocabulary. It should perform better than the 50% and 66% anchors because it relies on fundamental English structure rather than specific memorized content (which can be forgotten).

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:** 75%
