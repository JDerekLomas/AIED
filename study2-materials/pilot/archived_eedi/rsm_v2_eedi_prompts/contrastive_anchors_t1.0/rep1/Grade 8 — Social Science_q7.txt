Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimate:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **High:** Students need to know about the Battle of Plassey (date and significance). This is a core topic in Indian history (modern period) for Class 8.
    *   **Moderate:** They need to understand the concept of "expansion of British power" and how a battle can contribute to it beyond just military victory (i.e., political control, puppet rulers).
    *   **Low:** Basic understanding of "India" and "British power" is assumed.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Moderate to High:** The question uses somewhat formal English ("contribute to," "expansion of British power"). While "Battle of Plassey" is a proper noun, "contribute to the expansion" requires a nuanced understanding of causality and consequences. Students with limited English proficiency might struggle to articulate the *how* even if they know *what* happened.
    *   The rubric's expectation ("establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal") further increases the language demand to explain a sophisticated historical concept, not just recall a fact.

*   **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   **Primarily Recall with elements of Reasoning/Explanation:** Students need to recall the outcome of the Battle of Plassey. However, the "how did it contribute" part moves it beyond simple factual recall to requiring an explanation of the *consequence* or *impact*. It's not just "What was the Battle of Plassey?" but "How did it *lead* to something?" This requires connecting the event to its historical significance.

*   **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Moderate to Harder than typical recall:** Many textbook exercises for Class 8 history might ask: "When was the Battle of Plassey fought?" or "Who fought in the Battle of Plassey?" This question goes a step further by asking for the *consequences* and *contribution* to a broader historical trend. It's a common type of question found in end-of-chapter summaries or higher-order thinking sections, but it's not the simplest recall question.
    *   The expected answer (political dominance/control over Bengal, puppet nawab) is a key takeaway from studying Plassey, but articulating it clearly in English is the challenge.

**Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Easier than "Theme of The Last Bargain" (5%):** That item requires abstract interpretation and expression of a theme, which is very difficult. This question is about historical facts and consequences, which is more concrete.
*   **Similar to slightly harder than "Differentiate archaeological/literary sources" (15%):** That item requires differentiation and examples, which is a conceptual understanding. This question requires explaining a historical impact. Both require more than simple recall. The historical content for Plassey might be more commonly taught and recalled than the distinction between sources, but the *explanation* aspect in English for Plassey levels up the difficulty.
*   **Harder than "My favorite season" (30%):** That's a personal narrative, allowing for creative, less rigid answers and drawing on personal experience. This question is objective history with specific expected outcomes.
*   **Harder than "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%):** That item is pure recall of specific details from a story, likely from a prose passage that students would have read recently. This question requires connecting an event to its historical impact, which is more complex than recalling details from a narrative.
*   **Harder than "Two Fundamental Rights" (66%):** That's direct recall of specific, well-taught constitutional facts. The language is straightforward. The Battle of Plassey question requires a more elaborate explanation of cause and effect.

**Synthesis:**

The Battle of Plassey is a crucial event, so many students will have *some* knowledge. The challenge lies in articulating the *contribution* to British power, specifically mentioning political control over Bengal or the puppet nawab, in sufficient English. Given the average pass rate of 29% and the language barriers, even for a core history topic, articulating a consequence like this is tough. It's more complex than recalling simple facts but less abstract than identifying a poem's theme.

The difficulty lies in the need to explain a political consequence, not just state a fact. "Establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal" is a specific historical interpretation that might not be easily formulated by students with limited English, even if they know that the British won and became more powerful.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20-25%**
