## Contrastive Analysis: "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away."

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**

*   **Grammar:** Students need to understand the basic concepts of subject, verb, object. Crucially, they must have been formally taught Active and Passive Voice, including the structural changes involved (e.g., auxiliary verb "to be," past participle, "by" phrase).
*   **Vocabulary:** The words "wind," "blew" (past tense of blow), "leaves," and "away" are relatively common and likely known.
*   **Sentence Structure:** Basic English sentence structure (SVO).

**Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**

*   **Instructions:** The instruction "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice" is a technical grammatical instruction. Students with limited English might struggle to fully comprehend this instruction, even if they recognize the individual words. "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" are abstract grammatical terms that are often challenging even for native speakers if not explicitly taught and reinforced.
*   **Sentence Complexity:** The source sentence "The wind blew the leaves away" is relatively simple. However, the transformation requires understanding past tense, forming the past participle ("blown"), and knowing to use "were" (plural past tense of "to be") and the "by the wind" phrase.
*   **Conceptual Understanding vs. Memorization:** This isn't just a vocabulary recall task. It requires applying a grammatical rule, which is more demanding than simply understanding the meaning of a sentence.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**

*   **Application:** This is a direct application of a grammatical rule. Students are not being asked to recall facts but to apply a learned transformation process. It requires understanding the underlying structure of both active and passive voice.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Difficulty:** This is a **moderate to high difficulty** exercise within the context of Class 7 English grammar in Indian government schools, especially considering limited English proficiency.
    *   **Easier aspects:** The vocabulary in the sentence itself is simple. The sentence structure is straightforward.
    *   **Harder aspects:** The instruction itself ("Active Voice to Passive Voice") is a significant hurdle. Many students, even if they have encountered these terms, may not fully grasp their meaning or the process they imply. The transformation requires multiple steps: identifying the object, making it the new subject, choosing the correct form of "to be" (were), using the past participle (blown), and optionally adding the "by" phrase. Getting all these elements correct is challenging.
    *   **Likely taught, but not mastered:** Active/Passive voice is typically introduced in Class 6 or 7. However, mastery often requires significant practice, which may be lacking. Students often struggle with the correct auxiliary verb and the past participle forms, especially with irregular verbs like "blow."

**Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **vs. 5% (Theme of poem):** This question is significantly easier. It doesn't require deep comprehension of abstract literary concepts or creative expression. It's a rule-based transformation.
*   **vs. 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** This question is likely easier. While both require specific knowledge, the grammar transformation is a more contained skill than defining and exemplifying two distinct historical concepts. The "differentiation" aspect adds complexity to the 15% item.
*   **vs. 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This question is likely comparable or slightly harder. The paragraph writing allows for more flexibility and a lower bar for partial credit (as seen with simple word lists scoring 3). The voice transformation is more binary – either they get the structure right, or they don't. Students might write something vaguely related but grammatically incorrect and score 0. However, the paragraph task requires sustained writing and idea generation, which can also be difficult.
*   **vs. 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This question is likely harder. The 50% item is pure recall from a familiar story, often taught in Class 7 ("Three Questions" by Tolstoy). If they know the story, recalling the questions is relatively straightforward. The voice transformation requires active application of a grammatical rule, not just memorization.
*   **vs. 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This question is likely harder. The 66% item is direct recall of civics knowledge. If students have learned the Fundamental Rights, listing two is a relatively simple task. The voice transformation, as discussed, requires more active grammatical processing.

Considering the above, the main hurdles are the technical grammatical instruction and the multi-step application of the rule, especially with the correct form of "to be" and the past participle
