Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   This question assumes students have been taught about the Harappan Civilization in their Social Science curriculum. This is standard content for Class 8 in India, so the exposure should be there.
    *   It assumes knowledge of the term "urban planning" and specific features related to it within the context of the Harappan Civilization.
    *   It doesn't require deep conceptual understanding beyond recall of specific features.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   The question itself is straightforward: "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning." The vocabulary ("describe," "key feature," "urban planning") is fairly common within academic contexts and should be accessible even for students with limited English, especially if these terms have been introduced in class.
    *   The answer requires a *description*, not just a one-word answer. This means students need to formulate a simple sentence or phrase in English.
    *   Compared to "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate), "Describe one key feature..." is simpler in its language demand. "Theme or central idea" is more abstract and open to interpretation, requiring more nuanced English.
    *   Compared to "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15% pass rate), this question is less demanding. "Differentiate" is a higher-order thinking skill and requires comparing two concepts, often leading to more complex sentence structures.
    *   Compared to "Write a short paragraph..." (30% pass rate), this question requires much less output (one feature vs. 6-8 lines).
    *   Compared to "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50% pass rate), this question is similar in structure (recall a specific detail). However, the king's questions are often explicitly memorized from a story, making them easier to recall verbatim or near-verbatim. Harappan features might require a slightly more descriptive formulation.
    *   Compared to "Name any two Fundamental Rights..." (66% pass rate), this is slightly more demanding. "Name any two" requires less descriptive effort than "describe one key feature."

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily a **recall** question. Students need to remember specific facts about Harappan urban planning.
    *   It's not application (like solving a math problem) or reasoning (like justifying a viewpoint).

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very common type of question found in textbooks and exams for Social Science chapters on ancient civilizations. It tests basic factual recall.
    *   It's comparable to "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" in terms of being a direct recall of specific information. The difference lies in the *type* of information – historical features vs. story plot points.
    *   The content (Harappan Civilization) is foundational for Indian history education at this level.

**Synthesis and Estimate:**

The question tests recall of standard Class 8 Social Science content. The language demands are moderate – requiring a simple descriptive sentence rather than just a name or a more complex analytical response. Many students will have been exposed to this material.

*   The 5% and 15% items involve more abstract thinking ("theme," "differentiate") or require comparing concepts.
*   The 30% item requires significant sustained writing.
*   The 50% item is also recall, but about a story plot which might be more engaging and memorable.
*   The 66% item is pure naming, which is the easiest form of recall.

This question sits somewhere between the 30% and 50% anchors. It's harder than simply "naming" something (like Fundamental Rights) because it requires a *description*. However, it's easier than "differentiating" or writing a full "paragraph." It's also less abstract than finding a "theme."

Students are likely to have studied Harappan features. Common answers would be "grid pattern," "drainage system," or "use of baked bricks." The challenge is translating that knowledge into a simple English sentence. Given the average pass rate is 29%, and this question is factual recall, it should perform better than average. However, the descriptive requirement and potential for language struggles will pull it down from the highest pass rates.

A correct answer could be as simple as "The cities had a well-planned grid layout of streets." or "They had an advanced drainage system."

I'd place it slightly above the 30% anchor, but not as high as the 50% anchor, which might benefit from memorization of specific phrases from a story.
