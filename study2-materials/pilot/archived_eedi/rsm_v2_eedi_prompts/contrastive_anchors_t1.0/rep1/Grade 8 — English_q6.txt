Here's a breakdown of the analysis for "Define fable" compared to the calibration anchors:

**Contrastive Analysis of "Define fable":**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Low:** The definition of "fable" is a relatively basic literary term, usually introduced in earlier grades (Class 5-7) in English or even through stories in vernacular languages. Students would likely have encountered fables (like "The Tortoise and the Hare") even if they don't know the formal English term.
    *   **Compared to anchors:**
        *   "Theme of a poem": Requires analytical reading and abstract thinking. Harder.
        *   "Archaeological vs. literary sources": Requires understanding of historical terminology and categorisation. Harder.
        *   "My favorite season": Relies on personal experience, but requires paragraph construction. Similar, but "fable" is a single definition.
        *   "Three questions the king wanted to answer": Pure recall from a specific story. Very direct. Easier.
        *   "Fundamental Rights": Specific civic knowledge, but often rote-learned. Similar to "fable" in terms of a definitional recall.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Moderate:**
        *   The question itself ("Define fable") is simple and direct. "Define" is a common instructional verb.
        *   The expected answer requires specific vocabulary ("short story," "animals," "moral lesson"). Students with limited English might struggle to articulate these specific terms concisely and correctly, even if they grasp the concept. They might describe a fable without using the key terms.
    *   **Compared to anchors:**
        *   "Theme of a poem": High language demand for nuanced expression. Harder.
        *   "Archaeological vs. literary sources": High language demand for precise academic vocabulary and comparison. Harder.
        *   "My favorite season": Moderate language demand for descriptive writing, allowing for simpler vocabulary. Similar/Slightly harder due to length.
        *   "Three questions the king wanted to answer": Low language demand, just recalling phrases. Easier.
        *   "Fundamental Rights": Low language demand if just naming them. Similar.

*   **Type of Task (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   **Recall:** This is a direct recall task. Students either know the definition or they don't.
    *   **Compared to anchors:**
        *   "Theme of a poem": Reasoning/Application. Harder.
        *   "Archaeological vs. literary sources": Recall/Application (applying definitions to examples). Harder.
        *   "My favorite season": Application (of descriptive writing). Similar.
        *   "Three questions the king wanted to answer": Recall. Similar.
        *   "Fundamental Rights": Recall. Similar.

*   **Difficulty vs. Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Defining a term like "fable" is a very common type of exercise found at the end of chapters or in vocabulary sections of textbooks. It's a foundational concept. The difficulty comes from recalling the precise English terms for the definition, rather than the underlying concept itself.

**Synthesis and Comparison with Anchors:**

*   **Easier than:** "Theme of a poem" (5%), "Archaeological vs. literary sources" (15%). These require deeper analytical or comparative skills and more complex language.
*   **More difficult than:** "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%). This is pure recall of specific phrases from a text, often requiring less conceptual understanding or precise vocabulary.
*   **Similar to/Slightly easier than:** "My favorite season" (30%). While "My favorite season" allows for simpler English, it demands constructing a paragraph, which can be challenging for students with limited writing fluency. "Define fable" is shorter but requires specific, accurate vocabulary.
*   **Similar to/Slightly more difficult than:** "Fundamental Rights" (66%). Naming two rights is often rote memorization and might require less specific phraseology than defining "fable." However, both are recall-based.

The main hurdle for "Define fable" will be the students' ability to translate their conceptual understanding (which they likely have from stories) into precise English vocabulary for the definition. Many might describe *what a fable does* or *what it has* without using the exact definitional components. For example, they might say "It's a story with animals" but miss "moral lesson" or "short." Given the average pass rate is 29%, and this item requires a relatively precise, specific English definition of a concept they likely know in a general sense, it falls somewhere in the middle. The "My favorite season" at 30% is a good comparison,
