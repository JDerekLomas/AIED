Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic arithmetic: addition and multiplication.
    *   Understanding of "temperature increase."
    *   Time calculation: converting between AM/PM and calculating elapsed hours. This is the trickiest part, as it requires understanding how time progresses beyond 12:00 PM (noon). Students need to know that 1:00 PM is 13:00, 2:00 PM is 14:00, etc., or be able to count hours manually.
    *   Units: degrees Celsius.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "temperature," "increases by," "per hour," "morning," "evening." These are relatively common terms, but "increases by per hour" requires understanding the rate of change.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The question is a straightforward word problem. It's not overly complex.
    *   **Context:** "Jodhpur" is a place name, irrelevant to the math but familiar to Indian students.
    *   **Numerical format:** `30^0 C`, `2^0 C`, `10` am, `4:00` in the evening. This is standard.
    *   Compared to the "theme of the poem" item (5% pass rate), this is significantly less reliant on abstract English comprehension. Compared to "differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" (15% pass rate), it avoids specific academic vocabulary and complex comparative structures. It's closer in language demand to the "three questions the king wanted to answer" (50% pass rate) as both are factual recall/simple application from a given text/scenario.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   This is primarily **application** of basic arithmetic in a word problem context.
    *   It involves a small amount of **reasoning** to calculate the elapsed time correctly (10 am to 4 pm). This is the key "trap" or point of error.
    *   No complex reasoning or higher-order analytical skills are required beyond understanding the problem.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises (Class 6 Mathematics):**
    *   **Time Calculation:** Class 6 math curricula in India typically cover time, including calculating elapsed time. However, going from AM to PM across noon can be a common point of error for some students.
    *   **Word Problems with Rates:** Simple rate problems (e.g., speed-time-distance, or in this case, temperature-time-rate) are standard in Class 6.
    *   **Multi-step Problem:** This is a two-step problem: 1) calculate elapsed time, 2) calculate total temperature increase, 3) add to initial temperature. This is a typical complexity level for Class 6 word problems.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **5% (Theme of poem):** Much harder due to abstract comprehension and subjective interpretation, heavy English demand. This question is vastly easier.
*   **15% (Differentiate sources):** Harder due to specific academic vocabulary, definition recall, and comparative structure. This question is easier.
*   **30% (My favorite season - short paragraph):** This is writing, which requires language fluency and structured thought. The math question is more objective. While students might struggle with English *writing*, the math question requires English *comprehension* and basic arithmetic. The 30% item is also often scored on effort even with limited English, which might inflate its pass rate. The math question is right/wrong.
*   **50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is essentially recall from a text, directly found. The math question requires calculation. The "three questions" item is easy if you read the text. The math question requires an *extra step* of calculation. The core difficulty for the 50% item is reading comprehension and identifying the correct parts of the text. The math problem is similar in the sense that the numbers are given, but the calculation of time is a small hurdle.
*   **66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is direct recall of civics facts. If a student knows the facts, it's easy. If they don't, it's impossible. Language demand is low. The math problem involves steps, making it slightly more complex than pure recall.

**Key Difficulty Points for this Specific Question:**

1.  **Time Calculation (10 am to 4 pm):** This is where errors are most likely. Some might incorrectly calculate 4-10 = -6 or 14-10 = 4, or miscount. The correct calculation is 10 am to
