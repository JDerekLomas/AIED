Here's a detailed analysis of the question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason." and an estimate of the proportion of Class 7 students who would answer it correctly.

## Contrastive Analysis of the Question:

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Minimal specific content knowledge:** The question itself doesn't require deep historical or political knowledge. It assumes students have read or are familiar with the story "Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy, from which the king's questions originate.
*   **General understanding of "importance" and "real life":** Students need to grasp these common concepts.
*   **Basic reasoning skills:** The question asks for an opinion ("Do you think...") and a justification ("Give one reason.").

**2. Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
*   **Relatively simple vocabulary:** "Important," "real life," "reason" are common words even for students with limited English exposure, especially at the Class 7 level where they encounter English texts.
*   **Direct question structure:** "Do you think...?" is a straightforward interrogative.
*   **Low writing demand:** Only a single reason is required, making the output less demanding than a paragraph or a detailed differentiation. Students can likely use simple sentences.
*   **Potential ambiguity of "the king's questions":** While the context of the exam implies the "Three Questions" story, students might struggle if they haven't explicitly studied it or if their recall of the specific questions is weak. However, the previous item (pass rate 50%) directly asks "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?", suggesting this item is likely *following* that one or assumes that knowledge is already present. If the student got the previous item correct, the recall burden here is minimal.

**3. Type of Cognitive Demand:**
*   **Application/Reasoning (Opinion and Justification):** This is not a recall question of facts from the text. It asks students to apply the *concept* of the king's questions to their own understanding of "real life" and then provide a simple justification. This is a higher-order thinking skill than pure recall but is still quite accessible.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   **Moderate Difficulty:**
    *   **Easier than:** Complex analysis, differentiation (like the 15% item), writing a multi-line paragraph (like the 30% item), or identifying a poem's theme (like the 5% item). These demand more specific knowledge, more complex language, or more extensive writing.
    *   **Comparable to/Slightly harder than:** Simple recall questions (like the 50% item, "What were the three questions..."), but introduces an opinion and justification element.
    *   **Harder than:** Naming two fundamental rights (66% item), which is pure recall and requires only two short phrases.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Compared to 5% (Poem Theme):** Much easier. This question is not abstract, does not require deep literary analysis, and the output is minimal.
*   **Compared to 15% (Differentiate sources):** Significantly easier. No complex definitions or comparative analysis needed.
*   **Compared to 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Easier. While that item allows for personal expression, it requires sustained writing (6-8 lines) and organization, which is a higher hurdle for these students than giving one simple reason.
*   **Compared to 50% (What were the three questions...):** This question builds on that knowledge. If a student correctly answered the 50% item, then this question becomes much easier, requiring only a simple "yes" or "no" and a basic justification. The language is simpler for expressing an opinion than accurately recalling three specific questions.
*   **Compared to 66% (Name two Fundamental Rights):** Slightly harder because it requires an opinion and a reason, rather than just two memorized facts. However, the reason can be very basic.

**Key Factors Influencing Difficulty:**

*   **Reliance on previous question:** If students struggled to recall the king's questions in the previous item, this item becomes harder as they lack the foundation. Assuming average performance across items (29%), a good portion *will* have gotten the 50% item wrong.
*   **Simplicity of "real life" concept:** Most students, even with limited English, can understand the concept of something being "important in real life" (e.g., "to do good things," "to be a good person," "to make good decisions").
*   **Low bar for "one reason":** The rubric likely accepts very basic and intuitive
