Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   Assumes knowledge of basic geometric shapes, specifically triangles.
    *   Assumes knowledge of the formula for the area of a triangle: `Area = 1/2 × base × height`. This is a standard formula taught in Class 6 or 7.
    *   Assumes basic multiplication and division (specifically by 2).
    *   Assumes understanding of units (cm, cm²).

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   The question uses relatively simple English: "Find the area," "triangle," "base," "height." These are common mathematical terms.
    *   "Whose" might be a slight grammatical challenge, but the context makes the meaning clear (base *of* the triangle, height *of* the triangle).
    *   Compared to the "The Last Bargain" theme question (5% pass rate) or even the history differentiation question (15% pass rate), the language here is significantly less demanding. It's much closer to the "three questions the king wanted to answer" (50% pass rate) in terms of directness, but the content is mathematical, not literary recall.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   This is primarily an **application** question, but it heavily relies on **recall** of the formula.
    *   Once the formula is recalled, applying it to the given numbers (8 and 6) is a straightforward calculation.
    *   There is very little reasoning beyond selecting the correct formula and performing the arithmetic.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very standard, entry-level problem for finding the area of a triangle. It's often one of the first few exercises after the formula is introduced.
    *   It doesn't involve unit conversions, finding a missing dimension given the area, or composite shapes, which would make it harder.
    *   The numbers (8 and 6) are simple and lead to an integer answer, avoiding fractional or decimal calculations that might increase difficulty.

**Comparison with Anchors:**

*   **5% Pass Rate (Poem Theme):** Much harder due to abstract reasoning, subjective interpretation, and high language demands. This triangle question is vastly easier.
*   **15% Pass Rate (History Differentiation):** Harder due to requiring conceptual understanding of two distinct categories and providing examples, plus more complex language. The triangle question is a direct application of a formula.
*   **30% Pass Rate ("My Favorite Season"):** This is a creative writing task. While it's about personal experience, it requires structuring a paragraph and generating ideas, which can be hard for students with limited writing practice. The triangle question is more concrete and formulaic.
*   **50% Pass Rate (King's Three Questions):** This is a direct recall question from a specific text. If students know the story, it's easy. If not, impossible. The triangle question requires formula recall and application, which is a different skill set. The language demand is similar. Given that math formulas are often drilled, this might be *slightly* easier than pure text recall if the formula is well-taught.
*   **66% Pass Rate (Fundamental Rights):** This is a factual recall question from civics. Many students might know some fundamental rights, making it relatively high. The triangle area formula is also a key piece of factual knowledge in math.

**Synthesizing the Difficulty:**

The question is a direct application of a fundamental formula in geometry. The language is simple, and the calculation is basic. The biggest hurdle is recalling the formula `1/2 × base × height`. Given that this is a core concept taught in Class 7, and the numbers are simple, a significant portion of students who have attended math classes regularly and have a basic grasp of arithmetic should be able to solve this. It's more straightforward than conceptual differentiation or creative writing. It's comparable to recalling facts, but with a simple calculation added.

Considering the average pass rate across items is 29%, and this item is a very fundamental mathematical application, it should be well above that average. The 50% anchor ("three questions") is pure recall; this is recall + simple application. The 66% anchor (Fundamental Rights) is also recall. Many students struggle with *understanding* mathematical concepts, but this is quite a mechanical problem.

If students *know* the formula, solving it is trivial. The challenge lies in that "if." However, area formulas are heavily emphasized.
