Here's a breakdown of the analysis for the question "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Direct:** Students need to have studied the Harappan Civilization in their Social Science curriculum. This is a standard topic for Class 8 history in India.
    *   **Indirect:** Basic understanding of terms like "civilization," "urban planning," and "feature."
*   **Language Demands (English):**
    *   The question is a direct "Describe one key feature." The vocabulary ("describe," "key feature," "urban planning") is relatively straightforward for Social Science, though "urban planning" might be slightly more complex than everyday vocabulary for some students.
    *   The expected answer requires a descriptive phrase or sentence. This is less demanding than writing a paragraph (like "My Favorite Season") or differentiating between two concepts (like "archaeological vs. literary sources").
    *   The rubric offers several distinct, easily expressible features (grid layout, drainage, baked bricks, citadel/lower town). This means students don't need highly sophisticated English to convey the correct answer.
*   **Cognitive Demand (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   This is primarily a **recall** question. Students are expected to remember specific facts about the Harappan Civilization's characteristics.
    *   It requires less application or reasoning compared to differentiating concepts or interpreting a poem's theme.
*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very common type of short-answer question found at the end of chapters or in review sections for the Harappan Civilization. Textbooks often list features of Harappan cities.
    *   It's a foundational piece of information about the civilization, often highlighted.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" (5%):** Much harder. Requires interpretation, abstract thinking, and articulating a theme, which is complex even for native English speakers.
*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15%):** Harder. Requires understanding two distinct concepts and drawing a comparison/contrast, plus providing examples. It's also two distinct pieces of information.
*   **"Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'" (30%):** Similar to slightly easier. While "My favorite season" topic is relatable, the paragraph length requirement and specified details ("what you like to do, what you eat or wear") add complexity in terms of English expression and structuring. "Harappan" is a recall of a specific fact, but only *one* feature is needed.
*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%):** This is a recall question, similar in type. It requires remembering *three* specific items. The question about Harappan planning only asks for *one* feature. This implies the Harappan question should be easier or at least comparable, as fewer pieces of information are required for a full score.
*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights..." (66%):** This is a direct recall question, similar in type. It requires naming *two* items. The Harappan question requires describing *one* item. "Describing" might be slightly more demanding than just "naming," but the "one item" vs. "two items" balances it. Fundamental Rights are also highly emphasized in Civics, making them very high-frequency recall items.

**Overall Assessment:**

The question about Harappan urban planning is a straightforward recall question on a core Social Science topic. The language demand is moderate, and only one feature is required. Given that "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (three items) was 50% and "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (two items, but highly emphasized) was 66%, asking for *one* feature of Harappan planning should land somewhere in this range, if not higher, especially since the features are distinct and often taught with visuals. The "describe" aspect might slightly lower it from a pure "name," but only marginally for a single, well-known feature.

The average pass rate is 29%, indicating that many students struggle. However, core historical facts like this are often learned by rote.

I'd place it slightly above the 50% mark, as it requires less information recall than "three questions" and the "description" for one feature isn't excessively complex. It's a fundamental piece of knowledge.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%
