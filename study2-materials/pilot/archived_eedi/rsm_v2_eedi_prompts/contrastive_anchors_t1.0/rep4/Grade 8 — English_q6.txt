Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Concept of "fable":** Students need to have encountered the concept of a fable before, either in their local language or in English. Given that fables (like Panchatantra stories) are culturally ubiquitous in India, the core concept should be familiar.
    *   **Literary terms:** They need to understand what a "short story" or "moral lesson" means.
    *   **Characteristics of fables:** They should know that fables often feature animals and teach a lesson.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **"Define":** This is a standard command word, likely understood.
    *   **"Fable":** This specific English word might be unfamiliar to some students, even if they know the concept in Hindi (e.g., "नीतिकथा" - neetikatha).
    *   **Vocabulary for definition:** Students need words like "short story," "animals," "characters," "moral," "lesson," "imparts." These are relatively common English words for describing stories, but stringing them together grammatically and accurately to form a definition could be challenging.
    *   **Sentence structure:** Formulating a coherent definition requires a certain level of sentence construction ability in English.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   This is primarily **recall** of a definition. There's no application of the concept or complex reasoning required, just stating what a fable is.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Textbook definitions:** Textbooks often include definitions of literary terms like "fable." If taught, it would be a direct recall question from the textbook.
    *   **Complexity:** It's more complex than simply naming two fundamental rights (66% item) but less complex than differentiating between archaeological and literary sources (15% item), which requires two distinct definitions and examples.
    *   **English writing demand:** The quality of the English needed for a full definition is higher than just listing items (like the "My favorite season" item which allowed very fragmented answers for a high score, or the "three questions" item which could be answered with phrases).
    *   **Specific term:** The specific term "fable" might not be universally taught or recalled perfectly in English, even if the concept is known.

**Comparison with Anchors:**

*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights..." (66% pass rate):** This is pure recall of two specific, well-defined items. The English demand is low. "Define fable" requires a more elaborate, descriptive answer in English.
*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50% pass rate):** This is recall of specific phrases from a known story. The English demand is relatively low, and fragmented answers were accepted. "Define fable" requires constructing a definition, not just recalling phrases.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... on 'My favorite season.'" (30% pass rate):** This involves generating original content and requires more sustained writing. However, the rubric for this item was very lenient, accepting simple words and fragmented thoughts for a good score. "Define fable" requires accuracy and specific vocabulary, which might be harder than simply listing things about a season.
*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15% pass rate):** This requires two definitions AND examples, showing comparative understanding. This is significantly harder than defining a single term.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" (5% pass rate):** This requires higher-order thinking (interpreting a poem) and expressing an abstract idea. This is much harder.

**Conclusion:**

The core concept of a fable is likely familiar. However, the challenge lies in:
1.  Knowing the specific English word "fable."
2.  Recalling its precise definition in English.
3.  Articulating that definition coherently and accurately in English, using appropriate vocabulary ("short story," "animals as characters," "moral lesson").

It's harder than simple recall of lists or phrases (66%, 50% anchors) because it demands more specific vocabulary and sentence construction. It's easier than tasks requiring differentiation or interpretation (15%, 5% anchors). It's probably more demanding than the "My favorite season" item in terms of specific content, even if that required more lines.

Many students might know what a fable is in their vernacular but struggle with the specific English term or formulating a complete English definition. They might provide partial answers (e.g., "story with animals," or "story with a lesson") but miss one of the key components or struggle with the
