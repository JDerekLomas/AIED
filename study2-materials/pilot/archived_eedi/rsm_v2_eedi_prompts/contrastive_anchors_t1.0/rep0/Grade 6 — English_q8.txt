Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis of "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence: book/reading/a/is/he"

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Basic English Sentence Structure:** Students need to implicitly understand the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order common in English. This is fundamental.
*   **Vocabulary:** All words ('book', 'reading', 'a', 'is', 'he') are very basic and likely within a Class 6 student's vocabulary, even with limited English. 'Reading' might be slightly less common than the others, but context often helps.
*   **Parts of Speech (implicit):** While not explicitly required to identify them, students need to understand that 'he' is a pronoun (subject), 'is reading' is the verb phrase, 'a' is an article, and 'book' is a noun (object).

**2. Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
*   **Minimal:** This question is designed to test grammatical structure rather than complex vocabulary or comprehension of abstract ideas. The words are simple, monosyllabic or disyllabic, and highly frequent.
*   **No new concepts:** It doesn't introduce any new vocabulary or grammatical rules; it tests the application of a very common sentence pattern.
*   **Focus on syntax:** The primary challenge is arranging the words correctly, which is a syntactic task.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
*   **Application:** It's an application of learned or implicitly understood sentence structure. Students aren't recalling facts, but applying a rule to construct a new sentence. It's not complex reasoning, but a basic form of linguistic problem-solving.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
*   **Very Common/Basic:** This type of sentence rearrangement exercise is a staple in early English language learning textbooks (Class 3-5 often, and certainly reinforced in Class 6). It's usually one of the first grammar exercises encountered after learning basic SVO sentences.
*   **Lower-Intermediate Difficulty for English learners:** For students who have had *any* exposure to English sentence construction, this should be relatively straightforward. It's much easier than writing a paragraph (30%) or differentiating concepts (15%).
*   **Easier than many anchors:**
    *   **Easier than 5% (theme of poem):** That requires deep comprehension, inference, and abstract thought, plus the ability to articulate a complex idea in English.
    *   **Easier than 15% (differentiate sources):** Requires conceptual understanding, specific examples, and comparative analysis, plus accurate English expression.
    *   **Easier than 30% (favorite season paragraph):** Requires sustained writing, idea generation, and a wider range of vocabulary and grammatical structures.
    *   **Comparable to or slightly easier than 50% (king's questions):** That item tests recall of specific details from a story. This item tests a fundamental grammatical rule. Both are relatively straightforward if the prerequisite knowledge/exposure is there.
    *   **Comparable to 66% (Fundamental Rights):** That item tests direct recall of specific names. This tests direct application of a basic grammar rule. The words are provided, reducing the cognitive load compared to recalling terms from memory.

**Factors influencing the estimate:**

*   **Economically weaker sections / Hindi-medium:** This is the primary downward pressure. Students might have very limited formal English exposure, or their exposure might focus heavily on rote memorization rather than productive grammar application. They might struggle even with basic word order if their native language's structure is very different (though Hindi also uses SVO, it has nuances).
*   **"Average pass rate across items on this exam is about 29%":** This suggests the overall difficulty of the exam is moderate to hard for this population. However, this particular item is much more fundamental than many other types of questions.
*   **Simple vocabulary:** The words themselves pose almost no barrier.
*   **Provided words:** No need to generate words, only arrange them. This significantly reduces the cognitive load.
*   **Single correct answer, short:** It's not open-ended.

Given that even with limited English, students in Class 6 would have had *some* exposure to simple English sentences, and this structure (Subject-Verb-Object) is fundamental and frequently drilled, I expect a relatively high success rate for this item compared to the overall exam average. The words are common, and the sentence pattern is basic. While some will struggle due to very minimal exposure or interference from their native language's nuances, many will recognize the pattern.
