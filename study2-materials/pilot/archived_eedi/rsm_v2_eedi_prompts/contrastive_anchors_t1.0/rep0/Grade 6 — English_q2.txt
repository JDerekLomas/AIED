Here's an analysis of the question "Who lived inside the book?" and an estimate of the proportion of Class 6 students who would answer it correctly, using the provided calibration anchors.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Text Comprehension:** Students need to have read and understood the preceding text from which this question is drawn. The question explicitly refers to "the book," implying a specific book mentioned in the text.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Lived inside" is relatively common vocabulary, but understanding "fairy" might depend on their exposure to stories. Given their age, "fairy" is likely a known concept, even if the English word is new, they might recognize it from their native language stories.
    *   **Inference/Recall:** This is a direct recall question, assuming the information was explicitly stated in the text. There's no complex application or reasoning required beyond remembering a specific detail.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Simple Sentence Structure:** "Who lived inside the book?" is a very simple, direct question. The 'Wh-word' "Who" is common.
    *   **Concrete Noun:** "Book" is a very common and concrete noun, likely known even to students with limited English.
    *   **Verb:** "Lived" is a basic past tense verb.
    *   **Expected Answer:** The expected answer "a magical fairy" involves slightly more complex vocabulary ("magical," "fairy"), but "fairy" alone is acceptable. The core concept is likely familiar.
    *   **Writing vs. Speaking:** Students need to *write* the answer. This adds a layer of difficulty for those with limited written English skills, even if they understand the concept orally. However, the rubric accepts just "fairy," which is a single word.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?** This is a **direct recall** question. The answer should be explicitly stated or very easily inferred from the text. It doesn't require application of concepts or complex reasoning.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:** This is a very common type of comprehension question found in Class 6 English textbooks after a story or passage. It's on the easier end of comprehension questions, often used to check basic understanding of characters or settings.

**Difficulty Compared to Anchors:**

*   **Easier than 5% (Theme of poem):** That requires abstract thinking and synthesizing information, then articulating a theme concisely, which is very difficult for students with limited English and abstract reasoning skills. "Who lived inside the book?" is concrete recall.
*   **Easier than 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** That requires understanding two abstract concepts, their differences, and providing examples – a complex task involving both conceptual understanding and recall/application.
*   **Easier than 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** While simple in concept, writing a 6-8 line paragraph with specified details (what you like to do, eat/wear) requires sustained written output, grammatical accuracy, and organizing thoughts, which is challenging for students with limited English. "Who lived inside the book?" requires only a few words.
*   **Comparable to 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is also a direct recall question about specific details from a story. The main difference is the quantity of information (three distinct questions) and potentially the length/complexity of those answers. "Who lived inside the book?" is a single, concise detail. If the story passage for "Who lived inside the book?" is straightforward, it could be slightly easier than recalling three separate questions.
*   **Slightly harder than 66% (Name two Fundamental Rights):** That's also recall, but "Fundamental Rights" are specific, often memorized civic facts. The language of rights can be a bit more formal, but the concept is usually covered directly. "Who lived inside the book?" relies on story comprehension from a specific passage, which could be less universally accessible if the passage itself was dense or unfamiliar. However, the simplicity of the expected answer "fairy" makes it quite accessible.

**Factors Leaning Towards Higher Success:**
*   Direct recall, not inference or application.
*   Simple question structure.
*   Common vocabulary ("book," "lived").
*   Acceptable answer ("fairy") is a single, relatively common noun.
*   The concept of a "fairy" is likely universally familiar through stories, even if the English word is new.

**Factors Leaning Towards Lower Success:**
*   Reliance on having read and understood the *specific* preceding text, which we don't have. If the text was complex or long, or the "fairy" was not explicitly stated, it could be harder
