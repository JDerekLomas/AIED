Here's a breakdown of the analysis for the question `y + 9 = 4`:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior knowledge assumed:**
    *   Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction).
    *   Understanding of algebraic equations (what an equals sign means, what a variable represents).
    *   Concept of negative numbers. This is a crucial point, as introductory algebra problems often stick to positive results first. Class 8 students should be familiar with negative integers, but applying them in this context might still be a hurdle for some.
    *   Inverse operations (subtracting 9 from both sides to isolate 'y').

*   **Language demands:**
    *   Extremely low. The question uses simple mathematical symbols and one common English word ("Find"). Students with limited English proficiency will not struggle with understanding the question itself. The primary challenge is the mathematical concept.

*   **Recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of learned algebraic principles. Students need to apply the inverse operation (subtraction) to solve for the variable. There's a small element of **reasoning** if they don't immediately recall the inverse operation rule and have to figure it out by trial and error or by thinking "what number plus 9 gives me 4?".

*   **Difficulty compared to typical textbook exercises:**
    *   This is a very **basic** linear equation, often among the first types introduced in algebra chapters. The main "trick" or point of difficulty for some would be arriving at a negative number as the answer. Typical textbook exercises would definitely include this type of problem, and often more complex ones involving multiplication, division, and variables on both sides.

**Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"My favorite season" (30% pass rate):** This requires paragraph writing, vocabulary, sentence structure, and personal expression. The math problem is much simpler in terms of language and cognitive load.
*   **"Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources" (15% pass rate):** This requires factual recall, definition, and comparative analysis, along with the ability to articulate these ideas in writing. The math problem is purely computational.
*   **"Theme of 'The Last Bargain'" (5% pass rate):** This is a complex literary analysis task, requiring deep comprehension, abstract thinking, and sophisticated writing. The math problem is on a completely different level of difficulty.
*   **"Three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50% pass rate):** This is a direct recall question from a story, likely testing reading comprehension. It's relatively straightforward if the student remembers the story. The math problem requires computation, but it's arguably more direct and less reliant on external context.
*   **"Two Fundamental Rights" (66% pass rate):** This is a direct recall of factual information from civics. It's straightforward if the student has memorized them.

**Conclusion on Difficulty:**

The question `y + 9 = 4` is fundamentally a very basic algebra problem. The only potential hurdle beyond understanding basic equations is dealing with negative numbers. Given that Class 8 students are expected to have covered integers and introductory algebra, the conceptual barrier should be relatively low for most who have engaged with the curriculum. The extremely low language demand makes it accessible even for students with limited English.

It is significantly easier than any of the writing/comprehension tasks (5%, 15%, 30%). It's also likely easier than the "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%) if the story was long or complex. It's comparable to or slightly easier than "Two Fundamental Rights" (66%) because while both require recall/application, the math problem has only one correct numerical answer that can be derived, whereas remembering specific rights might be more prone to error or partial recall.

The average pass rate is 29%. This problem is definitely above average difficulty for this exam.
