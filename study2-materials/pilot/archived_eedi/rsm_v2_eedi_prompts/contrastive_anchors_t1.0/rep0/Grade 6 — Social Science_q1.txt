Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimate:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Low:** Students are expected to have a basic understanding of Indian geography, specifically major physical features like mountain ranges. This is typically covered in Class 5 or Class 6 social studies/EVS (Environmental Studies) textbooks. They don't need detailed knowledge of peaks or specific locations, just the names of two prominent ranges.
    *   **Comparison to anchors:**
        *   *Much lower than "Theme of the poem" (5%):* Requires no abstract thinking or interpretation.
        *   *Lower than "Differentiate archaeological/literary sources" (15%):* Requires recall of specific terms and examples, but not a comparative analysis.
        *   *Comparable to "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%)*: Both are recall questions based on specific content. The mountain range question is arguably slightly easier because there are multiple correct answers, reducing the chance of complete failure.
        *   *Comparable to "Two Fundamental Rights" (66%):* Both are recall questions, but Fundamental Rights are a more abstract and potentially politically charged topic, which *might* make them harder to remember for some students compared to geographic features.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Low:** The question uses very simple, direct English: "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."
    *   "Major" and "located in" are common terms.
    *   "Mountain ranges" is a core geographical term.
    *   **Comparison to anchors:**
        *   *Significantly lower than "Theme or central idea" (5%):* Requires understanding abstract concepts and expressing them in coherent English.
        *   *Lower than "Differentiate" (15%):* Requires understanding a more complex verb and a technical distinction.
        *   *Similar to "My favorite season" (30%):* While that asks for a paragraph, the *prompt* language is simple. This question is just a short answer.
        *   *Similar to "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%) and "Two Fundamental Rights" (66%):* Both are very direct, simple English questions.

*   **Type of Task (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   **Pure Recall:** This is a straightforward recall question. Students either know the names of two major Indian mountain ranges or they don't. There's no application of knowledge or reasoning involved.
    *   **Comparison to anchors:**
        *   *Pure recall, unlike "Theme" (5%) which is interpretation/reasoning.*
        *   *Pure recall, unlike "Differentiate" (15%) which is recall + application of comparison.*
        *   *Pure recall, like "Three questions" (50%) and "Two Fundamental Rights" (66%).*

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very common type of question found in end-of-chapter exercises or review sections in Class 6 Social Science textbooks. It's a fundamental knowledge check for the geography unit.
    *   The fact that there are many correct answers (Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats) increases the probability of students getting at least one, if not two, correct. Himalayas is almost universally known.

**Why it's easier than some anchors and harder than others:**

*   **Easier than 5% & 15%:** No complex English, abstract thought, or analytical skills needed. Just basic factual recall.
*   **Easier than 30% ("My favorite season"):** Doesn't require sentence construction or paragraph writing, which is a significant barrier for students with limited English. Just two noun phrases.
*   **Comparable to 50% & 66%:** These are also recall questions with simple language. The 50% item is from a story, which might be more engaging, but requires remembering *specific* details from that story. The 66% item is specific to civics. Geography of physical features like mountains is often quite foundational and visually reinforced in classrooms (maps). The existence of multiple correct answers (6 major ranges) makes it potentially slightly easier than needing to recall specific Fundamental Rights (though those are also multiple). Most students would likely remember "Himalayas" readily.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% and the calibration anchors, this question sits squarely in the "easy recall" category. Students from Class 6, even with limited English, would have been exposed to this fundamental geography. The simple prompt and multiple correct answers increase the chances of success.
