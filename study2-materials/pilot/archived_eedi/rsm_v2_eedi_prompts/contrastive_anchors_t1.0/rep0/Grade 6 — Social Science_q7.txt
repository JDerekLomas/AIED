Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimate:

## Contrastive Analysis of the Question:

**Question:** Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there.

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geography:** Basic understanding of what Rajasthan is and its general geographical characteristics. This is a foundational topic taught in Class 6 Social Science.
    *   **Natural Resources:** Definition and examples of natural resources. This is also a core concept.
    *   **Specific Resources of Rajasthan:** Students are expected to know *at least two* specific natural resources associated with Rajasthan. This requires recall of specific facts often covered in regional geography sections of textbooks.
    *   **Cause and Effect/Influence:** The second part of the question requires understanding how a resource impacts human life, which is an application of basic geographical/economic reasoning.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   "Mention": Straightforward, equivalent to "name" or "list."
    *   "Natural resources": A common Social Science term. Students would likely have encountered this in English or their native language (e.g., प्राकृतिक संसाधन).
    *   "Found in Rajasthan": Clear.
    *   "Explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there": This is the most complex part linguistically. "Influences" might be a slightly higher-level vocabulary word. "Explain how... influences" requires constructing a short explanatory sentence or two, which is harder than simple recall. However, the connection is often quite direct (e.g., water -> agriculture/drinking, minerals -> mining/industry).

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan" is pure recall.
    *   **Application/Basic Reasoning:** "explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there" is application of knowledge and basic reasoning. Students need to link a resource to a human activity or lifestyle aspect.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Listing resources:** Very common. "List natural resources of [state]" is a standard textbook exercise.
    *   **Explaining influence:** Also fairly common, but often presented in a more guided way (e.g., "How does water scarcity affect life in Rajasthan?"). The open-ended "explain how one of them influences" requires students to make the connection themselves, which is slightly more challenging than simply reciting a pre-learned impact.
    *   The two-part structure (list + explain) adds a layer of complexity.

**Difficulty vs. Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Easier than "Theme of poem" (5%):** That required abstract literary interpretation and expression, which is very hard for this demographic. This question is factual and applied.
*   **Comparable to "Differentiate archaeological/literary" (15%) for the first part, harder for the second:** The differentiation required two distinct definitions and examples. Listing two resources is simpler. However, explaining the influence is harder than just listing examples for the differentiation question.
*   **Harder than "My favorite season" (30%) if it required full explanation:** The favorite season prompt required personal expression, which is often easier if the student has a basic grasp of English vocabulary. However, the quality of explanation here is key. "My favorite season" often gets points even for very broken English. This question requires specific geographical knowledge.
*   **Harder than "Three questions king wanted to answer" (50%):** That was pure recall of specific details from a story, likely freshly read. This requires broader geographical knowledge that might not be as immediately salient.
*   **Harder than "Two Fundamental Rights" (66%):** Fundamental Rights are a very high-salience topic in civics, often memorized directly. Rajasthan's specific resources, while important, might be less universally emphasized than fundamental rights.

**Key Factors Influencing the Estimate:**

1.  **Specific Factual Recall:** Knowing *two specific* resources for Rajasthan is the primary hurdle for the first part. Many students might know one (e.g., water/desert sand), but two might be a stretch for some.
2.  **English Language for Explanation:** "Explain how one of them influences" requires a coherent sentence or two. While the connection might be simple, expressing it correctly in English will be a challenge for students with limited proficiency. Partial credit might be given for simple associations (e.g., "Water for farming"), but a full explanation will be harder.
3.  **Rubric:** "Max score: 1". This implies either full credit for both parts or no credit. If it's all or nothing, the pass rate will be lower
