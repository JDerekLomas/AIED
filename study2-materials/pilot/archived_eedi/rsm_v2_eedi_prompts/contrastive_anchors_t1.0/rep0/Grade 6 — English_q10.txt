Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic understanding of singular/plural nouns.
    *   Implicit understanding of countable nouns (apples).
    *   Knowledge of the usage of "some" vs. "any" in affirmative sentences. This is a grammatical rule often taught in early English language learning.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "apples," "basket" are very common, basic nouns. "There are" is also a fundamental phrase.
    *   **Grammar:** The core challenge is the distinction between "some" and "any." "Some" is used in affirmative sentences for unspecified quantities, while "any" is typically used in negative or interrogative sentences. This is a relatively advanced grammatical point for very limited English speakers, but it's often introduced early in simple contexts.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The sentence "There are ____ apples in the basket" is a straightforward, common structure.
    *   **Task:** "Choose the correct word" is a simple instruction.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   This is primarily **application** of a grammatical rule. Students need to recall the rule for "some" vs. "any" and apply it to an affirmative sentence. It doesn't require complex reasoning or deep textual understanding.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This type of fill-in-the-blank question is extremely common in beginner to intermediate English grammar textbooks and worksheets. It's a standard exercise for practicing quantifiers.
    *   It is significantly simpler than:
        *   "Writing a theme/central idea of a poem" (pass rate 5%) - requires deep comprehension, inference, and complex written expression.
        *   "Differentiating between archaeological and literary sources" (pass rate 15%) - requires specific domain knowledge, analytical thinking, and comparative explanation.
        *   "Writing a short paragraph on 'My favorite season'" (pass rate 30%) - requires sustained written output, organization, and idea generation.
        *   "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (pass rate 50%) - requires specific recall from a text, but the output is minimal.
        *   "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (pass rate 66%) - requires specific recall of factual information, but again, the output is minimal and direct.

    *   This question is *grammatically focused* and *single-point*, unlike most of the anchors which require more extensive knowledge recall or creative output. The "Fundamental Rights" question is similar in its direct factual recall, but this question requires a specific grammatical application.

Considering the anchors:
*   The 66% anchor involves recalling specific facts ("Fundamental Rights"). Many students would have been exposed to this civics content.
*   The 50% anchor involves recalling specific details from a story. This is also relatively straightforward if they've read the story.
*   This "some/any" question is a fundamental grammar point. While students from economically weaker sections in Hindi-medium schools might have limited English, basic grammar like this is often covered in textbooks from early classes (Class 3-5 onward). The target vocabulary ("apples," "basket") is extremely simple. The instruction is unambiguous.

The main barrier would be if they haven't been taught this specific grammatical distinction at all, or if their English exposure is so minimal that even common words like "apples" are challenging (which is unlikely for Class 6). However, given the context of government schools, structured English lessons, even basic ones, would include such grammar points. The simplicity of the sentence and the commonality of the words make it quite accessible *if* the rule has been presented.

It's easier than paragraph writing or thematic analysis, and arguably easier than differentiating complex historical sources. It's more aligned with the direct recall of facts or rules. The low average pass rate (29%) across the *entire exam* means many items are much harder, but this particular item is on the easier end for English grammar.

I'd expect a good chunk of students to get this right, even with limited English, because it's a very basic grammar point and the vocabulary is simple. It's likely one of the easier English items on the exam.
