This question asks students to arrange four numbers in ascending order. The numbers are 3367, 5492, 736, and 4799. The rubric specifies that a score of 0.5 is given for correctly identifying the smallest number (736) and placing it first.

Here's a contrastive analysis:

*   **Prior knowledge assumed:**
    *   **Number recognition:** Students need to be able to read and understand four-digit and three-digit numbers.
    *   **Place value:** This is crucial. Students need to understand that a number with fewer digits is smaller than a number with more digits (e.g., 736 vs. 3367). For numbers with the same number of digits, they need to compare digits from left to right (thousands place, then hundreds, tens, etc.).
    *   **Concept of "ascending order":** This means from smallest to largest.
    *   **Comparison of numbers:** The ability to determine which number is greater or smaller.

*   **Language demands:**
    *   The phrase "Arrange in ascending order" is the primary language demand. While "ascending order" is a specific mathematical term, it's generally introduced early in math curriculum. Given the English proficiency levels, some students might struggle with this exact phrasing. However, number ordering is a fundamental skill, and they might have encountered it in Hindi as "badhte kram mein" (increasing order).
    *   The numbers themselves are universal symbols, so reading them isn't an English language issue.

*   **Type of cognitive skill:**
    *   This is primarily an **application** of learned mathematical rules (place value comparison) and the **recall** of the definition of "ascending order." There's no complex reasoning involved beyond applying the rules systematically.

*   **Difficulty compared to typical textbook exercises:**
    *   This is a very **standard and common Class 6 (or even Class 4/5) mathematics exercise**. Ordering numbers, especially up to four digits, is a foundational skill. It's usually one of the first topics taught in a chapter on "Numbers" or "Comparing Numbers."
    *   The numbers chosen are straightforward; there aren't tricky cases like `3001` vs `3010` that require very fine-grained comparison if the student misses the initial digit comparison. The presence of a three-digit number (`736`) among four-digit numbers makes it slightly easier, as `736` is immediately identifiable as the smallest for most students who grasp basic place value.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Poem Theme):** This requires deep comprehension, abstract thinking, and English writing skills. Much harder.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Archaeological vs. Literary Sources):** Requires definition recall, understanding of two distinct concepts, and providing examples, often in written English. Harder.
*   **Pass rate 30% ("My favorite season" paragraph):** Requires creative writing, sentence construction, vocabulary, and adherence to length constraints. While it's a personal topic, the English writing demand is significant. Likely harder, or at least comparable, if the math question was full 1 point.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is direct recall from a story. If they remember the story, it's easy. If not, impossible. The language is less of a barrier if they recall the content. This math question is arguably *easier* than recalling specific plot points from a story, as the underlying math concept is more universally applicable and less dependent on memorizing a particular text.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Similar to the king's questions, this is direct recall of specific facts. If they know the rights, it's easy. If they don't, it's impossible. The phrasing "Name any two" is simple. This math question feels comparable, if not slightly easier, than recalling specific social science facts, especially considering the partial credit.

**Conclusion:**

This math question is a basic skill application. The language demand is low. The presence of a three-digit number simplifies identifying the smallest. The rubric asks for only the *first* number for 0.5 points, which significantly lowers the bar for success. Many students, even with limited English, will have practiced ordering numbers extensively in their local language. The main potential hurdle is misunderstanding "ascending order" if they haven't learned the English term, but even then, the concept of "smallest to largest" is fundamental.

Given that recalling two Fundamental Rights (which are more specific factual knowledge) has a 66% pass rate, and recalling
