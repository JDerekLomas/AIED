## Contrastive Analysis of "Describes the poet’s writing style."

This question asks students to describe the poet's writing style. Let's break down its difficulty compared to the calibration anchors:

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Understanding of "writing style":** This requires an abstract understanding of literary analysis, beyond simply comprehending the plot or characters. Students need to grasp that writing has characteristics like "simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct," etc. This is a more sophisticated concept than basic recall or factual differentiation.
*   **Exposure to diverse writing styles:** To be able to identify a specific style, students need some exposure to different ways authors write, even if not explicitly taught literary terms.
*   **Reading comprehension of the *specific poem* ("The Last Bargain"):** While not provided, it's assumed students have read and understood the poem for which they are describing the style. Without this, the question is impossible.

**Language Demands:**
*   **Abstract Vocabulary:** "Describes," "poet's," "writing style" are all relatively abstract terms. "Style" itself can be tricky.
*   **Producing descriptive adjectives:** Students need to retrieve or generate appropriate adjectives to describe the style (e.g., "simple," "descriptive," "informal"). This requires a solid English vocabulary.
*   **Open-ended response:** Unlike multiple-choice or questions with very specific answers, this requires students to formulate their own response, which is harder for limited English speakers.
*   **The rubric itself contains abstract English terms:** "suitable," "relevant," "descriptive," "informal," "direct" – these words define what a correct answer *is*, and students need to understand what they mean to produce a correct answer.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
*   **Application/Reasoning:** This is not pure recall. Students must *apply* their understanding of literary concepts (writing style) to a specific text (the poem) and *reason* about what words best fit that style. It involves analysis, which is a higher-order thinking skill than simple recall.
*   **Less direct than factual recall:** Questions like "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50% pass rate) are direct recall from the text. This question requires interpretation.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   **More analytical:** Typical Class 7 exercises might focus on comprehension questions (who, what, when, where), identifying themes (like the 5% pass rate item, which is very hard for them), or factual recall. Describing "writing style" is often introduced at a later stage or in more advanced literary analysis sections.
*   **Likely beyond basic comprehension checks:** While they might be asked to identify the main idea, analyzing the *how* an author writes is generally more challenging.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'"** This is also highly analytical and abstract, requiring deep understanding and synthesis. Describing "writing style" is arguably *slightly* less abstract than articulating a "theme," as "style" can sometimes be more concrete (e.g., "simple words"). However, both require similar levels of analytical thinking and strong English vocabulary.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..."** This requires factual knowledge and the ability to differentiate. It's an application of learned concepts but less subjective and abstract than "writing style."
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): "Write a short paragraph... 'My favorite season.'"** This is creative writing, allowing for personal expression, and is relatively accessible, even with limited English, as students can use simple sentences to describe familiar concepts.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"** Direct recall, very straightforward if they read the text. Much easier.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): "Name any two Fundamental Rights..."** Pure factual recall of civics knowledge. The easiest, as it's a specific, memorized list.

**Conclusion:**

This question ("Describes the poet’s writing style") sits at the higher end of the difficulty spectrum. It demands:
1.  **Abstract conceptual understanding:** What "writing style" means.
2.  **Analytical skills:** Applying this concept to the poem.
3.  **Specific vocabulary:** Generating appropriate descriptive adjectives in English.

It is more challenging than factual recall or simple comprehension and shares some of the abstract difficulty of identifying a "theme," though perhaps a hair less so, as "style" can sometimes be observed more directly (e.g
