Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, multiplication.
    *   Concept of temperature increasing.
    *   Understanding of time, specifically elapsed time (from 10 am to 4 pm). This involves understanding the 12-hour clock cycle or simply counting hours.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   The question uses relatively straightforward English for a word problem: "At... in the morning," "temperature... was," "If the temperature increases by... per hour," "then what will be the temperature... at... in the evening?"
    *   Key terms: "temperature," "increases," "per hour," "morning," "evening." These are common terms that even students with limited English exposure might have encountered in a math context or daily life.
    *   The structure is a direct word problem, requiring identification of given values and the question being asked. There are no complex sentence structures or idiomatic expressions.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily an **application** problem. Students need to apply their understanding of time calculation and basic arithmetic (multiplication and addition) to a real-world scenario.
    *   It involves a small amount of **reasoning** to determine the elapsed time (from 10 am to 4 pm), which isn't explicitly given as a number of hours. They need to count (10-11, 11-12, 12-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4 = 6 hours).

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This problem is a very common type of word problem found in Class 5/6 mathematics textbooks. Temperature problems, time elapsed problems, and rate-of-change problems (even simple linear ones like this) are standard.
    *   It's less abstract than problems involving fractions or decimals (other than the 2-degree increment being an integer).
    *   The numbers are small and easy to work with (30, 2, 6).
    *   The main "trap" or point of error would be miscalculating the elapsed time (e.g., counting 10 and 4 as inclusive or exclusive, or struggling with the transition from 12 pm to 1 pm in a 12-hour format). However, this specific type of time calculation is also standard.

**Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Poem Theme):** This requires abstract thinking, literary interpretation, and expressing a complex idea in English. Much harder than the current question.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Archaeological vs. Literary Sources):** Requires definitional recall, conceptual understanding, and providing examples. The language is more academic, and the concepts are from history, which might be less universally understood than basic math. The current question is more concrete.
*   **Pass rate 30% ("My favorite season" paragraph):** Requires creative writing, sustained English production (6-8 lines), and personal expression. While the topic is relatable, the linguistic demand is much higher than simply calculating. The current question only requires a numerical answer.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is a direct recall question from a story, likely from their English textbook. If they read and remembered the story, it's easy. If not, it's impossible. The language demand is low, primarily just listing. The current question requires calculation, not just recall.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is direct recall from a Civics/Social Science lesson. If taught and remembered, it's easy. The language demand is low, just listing two points. The specific terms might be slightly complex (e.g., "constitutional remedies"), but the core task is recall.

**Conclusion:**

The current math problem is a very standard application question. The language is simple. The core challenge is correctly calculating the elapsed time (10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours) and then performing a simple multiplication and addition. This is a fundamental skill taught by Class 6.

Compared to the anchors:
*   It's significantly easier than the poem theme (5%) and historical sources (15%) due to lower language and conceptual demands.
*   It's easier than the "favorite season" (30%) due to lower writing and linguistic demands.
*   It's comparable to or slightly easier than the "king's questions" (50%) and "fundamental rights" (66%) because while those are pure recall, the current problem's calculation steps are very straightforward and
