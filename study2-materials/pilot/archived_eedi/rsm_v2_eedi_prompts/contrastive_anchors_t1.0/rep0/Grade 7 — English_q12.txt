Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimate:

## Contrastive Analysis: "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away."

**What prior knowledge is assumed?**

*   **Understanding of basic sentence structure:** Students need to identify the subject, verb, and object in the active voice sentence.
*   **Concept of active and passive voice:** This is a specific grammatical concept that needs to have been explicitly taught. It's not intuitive for all students, especially those learning English as a second language.
*   **Knowledge of past tense verbs and past participles:** "blew" needs to be transformed into "were blown." This requires knowing the past participle form of "blow" (blown) and the correct auxiliary verb for the past tense passive voice ("were").
*   **Prepositional phrase "by the wind":** Students need to know how to reintroduce the original agent in the passive voice.

**What language demands does it place on students with limited English?**

*   **Understanding of instructions:** "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice" is clear English, but "active voice" and "passive voice" are technical grammatical terms that might be new or challenging.
*   **Vocabulary:** The words in the sentence itself ("wind," "blew," "leaves," "away") are fairly common and should be accessible to Class 7 students.
*   **Grammatical transformation:** This is the core challenge. It requires manipulating sentence structure, verb forms, and adding prepositions, which is a high linguistic demand for students with limited English proficiency. They are not just recalling a word, but applying a rule to transform a sentence.

**Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**

*   **Application:** This is a clear application task. Students aren't just recalling definitions of active/passive voice; they have to *apply* the rules of transformation to a specific sentence. This is generally harder than pure recall.

**How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

*   **Medium-High difficulty for its type:** Changing voice is a standard grammar exercise found in textbooks. However, for students with limited English proficiency and potentially less exposure to complex grammatical structures, it can be quite challenging.
    *   **Easier than:** Open-ended writing tasks (like "My favorite season" or "Theme of the poem") that require original thought, extensive vocabulary, and complex sentence construction.
    *   **Similar to/Slightly harder than:** Differentiating between historical sources (requires specific knowledge and ability to articulate differences).
    *   **Harder than:** Simple recall questions (like "Name two fundamental rights" or "What were the king's three questions?") where the answer is more direct and less transformational.

## Calibration Anchor Comparison:

*   **5% Pass Rate (Theme of "The Last Bargain"):** This requires deep comprehension, abstract thinking, and sophisticated English expression, making it much harder.
*   **15% Pass Rate (Differentiate historical sources):** This requires specific factual knowledge and the ability to articulate differences, which involves some analytical thinking. The voice change is similar in that it requires specific grammatical knowledge and application, but perhaps slightly less abstract than "differentiating."
*   **30% Pass Rate (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** While requiring more words, this is a more open-ended and personal topic. Students can often get some credit even with broken English. The voice change is more binary – either they get the transformation mostly right, or they don't. The examples given for the 30% item show that basic lists or very short sentences can get credit, implying a lower bar for correctness than a precise grammatical transformation.
*   **50% Pass Rate (King's three questions):** This is a direct recall question. If students know the story, they can get the answer. This is significantly easier than applying a grammatical rule.
*   **66% Pass Rate (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is a specific recall question, often memorized. This is considerably easier than a grammatical transformation.

**Key considerations for this question:**

*   **Mastery of a specific grammatical rule:** Unlike general comprehension or writing, this assesses a very particular skill.
*   **Verb conjugation:** The "blew" to "were blown" is a common sticking point.
*   **"By the wind":** Reintroducing the agent is another potential error source.
*   **Limited English proficiency:** The technical terms "active voice" and "passive voice" themselves might be barriers if not thoroughly taught and understood.

Given the average pass rate of 29% and the nature of the task, which is more complex than simple recall but less abstract than deep literary analysis, I believe it falls somewhere above the
