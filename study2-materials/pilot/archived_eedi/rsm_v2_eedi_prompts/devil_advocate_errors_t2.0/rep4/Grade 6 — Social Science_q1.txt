Let's break down the estimation for the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India." with a rubric of 0.5 points for naming *one* correct range.

**Initial Intuition & Why it's Likely Wrong:**

My first instinct might be something like: "Mountains are a core geography topic. The Himalayas are very famous. Many students would know at least one. Maybe 60-70% would get this."

**Challenging the Intuition based on Provided Context:**

1.  **Limited English:** The prompt explicitly states "limited English." "Mountain ranges" might be understood, but if their grasp of English is weak, even common geographical terms can be an obstacle.
2.  **Economically Weaker Sections/Limited Exposure:** Students from economically weaker sections might have less exposure to geography outside of textbooks. While "Himalayas" is a very common name, rote memorization might not always translate to easy recall under pressure, especially if the topic wasn't deeply grasped or reviewed.
3.  **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is a crucial data point. It indicates that the general difficulty of the exam and the students' overall performance is quite low. A single geography question, even if seemingly simple, isn't likely to dramatically outperform this average, unless it's exceptionally straightforward and well-drilled.
4.  **Common Errors Analysis:**
    *   **Empty Response:** This is a *major* takeaway from the examples. For other Social Science questions, "Empty Response" is a predominant wrong answer. This points to either not knowing the answer at all, not understanding the question, or exam anxiety leading to blanks.
    *   **Lack of Comprehension:** The "Asher' stand" or "Ashok seamb" answers show students attempting to answer but clearly misunderstanding the question or grasping at straws.
    *   **Teachers Overestimating:** This is the most direct warning. Teachers would *definitely* think students know the Himalayas. But the context demands we adjust for the reality of the students.
5.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** Knowing "major mountain ranges" might feel basic to someone with a strong general knowledge, but for a struggling learner in Class 6 with limited English, it might not be.
6.  **Exam Anxiety:** The presence of "Empty Response" reinforces the idea that anxiety causes blanks, even if a student *might* have had some knowledge.
7.  **"One correct mountain range" for 0.5 points:** This softens the blow. Students don't need two, just one. This makes it slightly easier than needing both, but doesn't erase the other hurdles.

**Recalibration:**

Considering all the negative factors: low overall pass rates, pervasive "Empty Responses" for other questions (which are arguably harder but still reveal comprehension issues), limited English, and the explicit warning about teachers overestimating, I need to significantly reduce my initial estimate.

*   Himalayas are extremely prominent, so a fair number of students *might* recall this.
*   But "recall" is different from "recall under exam conditions with limited English and general low performance."
*   If ~10-12% are blanking or giving gibberish on questions about Ashoka or currency, what about geography? Geography is usually slightly better retained than historical explanations, but not by a massive margin in this context.
*   Let's think of it this way: How many will be able to read "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India," correctly understand "mountain ranges," recall one from memory, and write it down without succumbing to blanking or misunderstanding?

Given the *low* average pass rate of 29% for the exam generally, and the poor performance on similar Social Science explanation questions, a factual recall question like this might do *slightly* better, but not dramatically.

If 9-12% are completely blank for explanatory answers, I imagine a similar portion would blank here due to not knowing, anxiety, or misunderstanding. The question requires less synthesis than an explanation, which is an advantage. However, if their English vocabulary for geography terms is weak, it becomes hard.

I'd expect it to be one of the *better* performing Social Science questions *relative to other questions provided*, but still well below what one might assume.

I think a realistic range, keeping all warnings in mind, would be **25-35%**. The fact that only *one* needs to be named for points makes it somewhat accessible. "Himalayas" is a national constant.

Final decision needs to be a specific number. Let's aim slightly below the general average of 29% for Social Science explanatory questions because this is just recalling names, not explaining, which reduces cognitive load somewhat. However, I still
