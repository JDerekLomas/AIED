This question "Define fable" has several characteristics that suggest a low pass rate, even for a simple definition:

*   **Reliance on Memorization/Specific Terminology:** "Fable" is a specific literary term. If students haven't explicitly been taught or haven't retained the definition, they'll struggle. Many Class 8 students in government schools may have a general understanding of a story with animals and a moral, but might not recall the specific term "fable."
*   **English Language Barrier for Technical Terms:** While "story" and "animal" might be understood, words like "imparts" or "moral lesson" (especially in combination) could be tricky. Simply articulating the *concept* of a moral lesson in English is a challenge, as evidenced by the "describes the poet's writing style" example.
*   **Previous Performance on English Questions:** The provided examples show incredibly low pass rates (4-10%) on seemingly straightforward English tasks like describing writing style, finding a theme, or writing about a hobby. These are generally *applied* tasks, but even writing short sentences about a hobby is very poorly done. A definition is still a form of recall and articulation.
*   **"Empty Response" is a Major Issue:** A significant portion of answers for other questions were "Empty Response." This suggests either a complete lack of understanding/recall or high anxiety leading to non-attempt.
*   **"Basic Concepts Not Basic":** What seems like a "basic" definition to an expert is likely not for students with limited English exposure and inconsistent educational backgrounds.
*   **Analogies to Other Questions:**
    *   The "poet's writing style" question (4% pass rate) involves defining or describing something literary. "Define fable" is a literary definition. This is a very strong analogue for difficulty.
    *   The "theme or central idea" question (5% pass rate) requires abstract comprehension and articulation. Defining "fable" requires concrete recall, but expressing it requires articulation.

**Challenging Initial Instinct:** My initial instinct might be that a simple definition like this should be 20-30%. However, remembering the "Empty Response" issue, the "limited English" barrier for specific literary terms, and the truly abysmal performance on other seemingly "basic" English questions, my estimate must be much lower. Many students may know of *Panchatantra* stories or Aesop's Fables but not be able to connect them to the term "fable" and then articulate a definition in English. Even if they recall "short story," "animals," and "lesson," combining these into a coherent English sentence that fits the rubric is a high bar.
