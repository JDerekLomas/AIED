Here's my calibrated estimate, with reasoning:

**Challenging Initial Instinct:** My first instinct might be that a question about natural resources in Rajasthan is quite basic for an Indian student, and they would likely know some common ones like water, marble, or sand. However, the provided context *strongly* points against this.

**Applying the Contextual Factors:**

*   **Limited English:** The second part of the question ("explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there") requires not just recalling facts but constructing a coherent sentence or two in English. Even simple explanations can be challenging for students with limited English.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:** While natural resources are fundamental, specifically naming *two* for Rajasthan *and then explaining their influence* is a multi-step task. Students from economically weaker sections might have less exposure to geography outside textbooks, and the ability to articulate these influences could be underdeveloped.
*   **Exam Anxiety / Blank Responses:** The recurring "Empty Response" error for Social Science questions is a huge red flag. Even if a student knows a resource or two, the pressure of explaining it might lead them to leave it blank, or give a very minimal, incorrect, or uninterpretable response.
*   **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** The examples of wrong answers (e.g., "Ashok seamb" for the Lion question) suggest a struggle with question comprehension and structuring answers, even if they have some keyword recognition.
*   **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is crucial. This question isn't isolated. It's part of an exam where the overall performance is very low. This suggests a systemic struggle with both content and expression.
*   **Misjudgment of Item Difficulty:** Teachers and experts consistently overestimate. I need to apply this to myself. While I might see "water" and "marble" as obvious, for many students, accurately linking them to "Rajasthan" and then formulating an explanation is a significantly harder cognitive load than it appears.

**Breaking Down the Question Difficulty:**

1.  **Recall Two Resources:** This is the "easiest" part. Many might remember *one* if it's iconic (e.g., desert/sand, water scarcity). Remembering *two* specifically for Rajasthan increases difficulty.
2.  **Explain Influence:** This requires conceptual understanding and English expression. Even "Water influences farming" might be beyond some, or they might write something unintelligible. The examples provided (e.g., "Asher' stand") show severe disfluency.

**Re-evaluating with a Critical Lens:**

*   A student might know "sand" or "desert." Can they name a second? Perhaps "water" due to scarcity issues being highlighted.
*   Can they explain how "water influences lives"? A very basic explanation might be: "Water important for drink. No water, no crop." Is that considered correct under the rubric's "explain"? Likely yes, if coherent enough.
*   Given the other low pass rates (9-12% for much simpler-seeming tasks), achieving two correct resources *and* a plausible explanation in English is a tall order. The explanation component is a huge barrier. Many will fail to provide the explanation even if they correctly name two resources, making their response incorrect.
*   "Empty Response" is likely to feature heavily here too.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Considering the severe English limitations, the overall low pass rates, the frequent "Empty Response" issue, and the challenge of both recall *and* explanation, I think the vast majority will fail to meet the full rubric. A significant number will leave it blank. Another large portion will only provide one resource, or provide two but fail to explain adequately. Some will give irrelevant or incoherent answers.

I'm aiming significantly lower than an initial thought of, say, 40-50%.

*   **10%** for just listing two correct resources without explanation (but that doesn't meet the rubric's implicit "Max score: 1" for correct answers implying a complete response).
*   **15%** could *potentially* recall two and provide a *minimal but comprehensible* explanation for one.
*   The overall pass rate of 29% gives me a ceiling. Questions that require both factual recall and written explanation tend to be at the lower end of that spectrum.

Therefore, after heavily factoring in the specific challenges:

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 18%**
