Here's my calibrated estimate, with reasoning:

**Story context for the question:** Without knowing the full story, it's highly likely this question is a recall question based on a specific text provided to the students, probably a short story or poem about a magical fairy and a book.

**Initial instinct vs. Calibration:**
*   **Initial instinct:** "This is a simple recall question. If they read the story, they should get it. Maybe 25-35%."
*   **Challenging the instinct:**
    *   **Limited English:** "Who lived inside the book?" is fairly straightforward English, but understanding "lived inside" can still be tricky for very weak readers. They might interpret "inside the book" as *part of the story*, but not necessarily *dwelling there*.
    *   **"Magical fairy":** If the text specifically says "a magical fairy," then getting both "magical" and "fairy" is harder. If the rubric accepts "fairy," that's significantly easier. Let's assume the rubric *does* accept "fairy" given the example.
    *   **Recall vs. Interpretation:** This is pure recall. Students either know it or they don't from the text.
    *   **Common Errors:**
        *   "Describes the poet's writing style" had a 4% pass rate. This required understanding "describes," "poet's," and "writing style," which are abstract concepts. "Who lived inside the book?" is concrete.
        *   "Write a theme or central idea" had a 5% pass rate. This is high-level analytical thinking.
        *   "Write a short paragraph about 'My Favourite Hobby'" had a 10% pass rate, despite being a personal topic. The "4-5 sentences" and "mention what" aspect clearly threw students off with sentence structure and elaborating ideas in English.
    *   **Anxiety/Blank Responses:** This is a consistent issue. Some students will simply leave it blank even if they *could* guess or vaguely recall.
    *   **Never practiced this exact question type:** While "who lived" is a common question format, the *topic* itself and specific phrasing within a text might be new.
    *   **"Basic" concepts:** Recalling a character name/type *is* a basic concept. However, if they struggled to understand the story itself due to vocabulary or comprehension, then recalling details becomes impossible.

**Comparing to provided pass rates:**
The provided pass rates are alarmingly low for even seemingly "harder" tasks. However, those tasks (describing style, writing a theme, a paragraph with structure requirements) are all *much* higher-order thinking and require more complex English output than simply identifying a noun/noun phrase.

This question requires minimal English production: just "fairy" or "magical fairy." The primary challenge is *comprehension of the original story*.

Given that "Who lived inside the book?" is a very direct, literal recall from a potentially short and simple story (which is often what Class 6 curriculum provides), it should be higher than the single-digit rates for analytical/production tasks. It's more akin to "What color was the apple?" if the apple's color was clearly stated.

**Final Adjustment:**
While low English proficiency is a huge factor, the directness of the question, the concrete nature of the answer, and the low production requirement make this *significantly* easier than the examples provided. It tests basic literal comprehension.
However, it won't be as high as an adult might assume. A 29% average pass rate indicates systemic difficulty. Many will struggle with even basic story comprehension or simply miss the detail, or panic.

If they were given a story like: "One day, a young boy found an old book. Inside the book lived a tiny, sparkling magical fairy who could grant wishes." and then asked "Who lived inside the book?", many would catch it if they read the sentence.

I'm placing it higher than the listed examples, but well below 50% due to the overall context of low pass rates and English difficulties.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 18%**
