Okay, let's break this down, keeping in mind the common errors, limited English proficiency, and teacher overestimation.

**First Instinct & Self-Challenge:**

*   **First Instinct:** My immediate thought is that "rural occupations in Rajasthan" feels like a fairly fundamental geography/social studies topic, especially for Class 7 in India. Agriculture and animal husbandry are practically universal knowledge for rural India. So, maybe 40-50%?
*   **Challenging this Instinct:**
    *   **Limited English:** "Main occupations," "rural areas," "Rajasthan," "describe in brief." While these words are common, a student struggling with English might stumble. Could they understand "occupations" in context? "Rajasthan" is a proper noun, but some might misinterpret or fail to recall.
    *   **"Basic" Concepts:** While agriculture is basic, the *explicit labeling* of it as a "main occupation" for a *specific state* and then needing to *describe* one *in brief* adds layers. A student who wasn't actively paying attention, or whose English comprehension for the lesson was poor, might just draw a blank.
    *   **Common Errors (Empty Response, Gibberish):** The examples clearly show that many students just leave things blank or write nonsense when they don't know the answer or understand the question. This question, while seemingly straightforward, still requires recall *and* concise articulation.
    *   **Exam Anxiety:** Even if they know it, pressure can lead to blanking or misunderstanding the "describe in brief" part.
    *   **Never Practiced This Exact Type:** While they might have learned about occupations or Rajasthan, this specific phrasing ("main occupations... describe one") might be novel or require synthesizing information they haven't explicitly linked this way before.
    *   **Specifics of Rajasthan:** While agriculture and animal husbandry are general, they are very prominent in Rajasthan. However, "handicrafts" as another common occupation might be less universally recalled or precisely defined in students' minds. The rubric asks for "at least two," meaning they need more than just one, *or* one correct plus a brief description.

**Refined Analysis:**

1.  **Recall of Occupations:** Many students would likely think of farming. Animal husbandry is also very common in Rajasthan. Handicrafts might be a stretch for some.
2.  **Naming Two Correctly:** This is the first hurdle. Can they consistently name two *and spell them comprehensibly*? "Agriculture" can be tricky to spell. "Farming" is easier. "Animal husbandry" is a longer phrase.
3.  **Understanding "Describe in Brief":** This requires some minimal output beyond just listing. For farming, something like "growing crops" would suffice. For animal husbandry, "raising animals for milk/wool."
4.  **Overall Difficulty vs. Examples:**
    *   "Colonial rule... tribal communi" (9%) - Very complex language, deep historical understanding needed. This question is simpler.
    *   "Lions on currency" (10%) - Requires specific historical/symbolic knowledge. This question is more direct factual recall + basic description.
    *   "Ashoka's reign" (12%) - Also specific historical knowledge and significance. Again, this question is more directly about common current aspects.

Our question sits somewhere above these very difficult history questions. The topic is more "visible" and contemporary. However, the *low average pass rate of 29% across the board* for students *mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English* is crucial.

Given the prevalence of blank responses and low English proficiency, many students will simply not produce two occupations, or will not be able to describe one clearly. Even if they know "farming," naming a second and describing one in good enough English to satisfy the rubric is a significant challenge for this demographic.

Considering the common error pattern (blank responses) and the consistently observed overestimation by experts, I need to bring my initial instinct down significantly from the 40-50% range. While this question *feels* easier than the examples provided, it's still challenging for the target student population, especially when measured against a rubric for *correctness* in English.

*   Students might just list one.
*   Students might misspell badly.
*   Students might leave it blank if they can't think of two or how to describe one.

If the *average* pass rate is 29%, a question that requires recall of specific concepts and articulation in English for a specific region is likely to be *at or slightly above average*, but certainly not high.

Final calibration: The general topic (rural occupations) is common, which pushes it up. But the need for *two* specific occupations *and* a *brief description* in
