Let's break down this question and apply the observed error patterns and expert warnings.

**Understanding the Question:** "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."

**Key Challenges for Students:**

1.  **Reading Comprehension (of the question itself):**
    *   "important in real life": Requires understanding a slightly abstract concept beyond direct recall.
    *   "Give one reason": Explicitly asks for an explanation, not just a yes/no. This often trips up students, leading to one-word answers or "empty responses."

2.  **Connecting to the Passage (Implicit but Necessary):** Students need to recall what the king's questions *were* from the passage. This isn't just "important" in a general sense; it's about the *specific questions* from the story. If they can't recall them, they can't formulate a relevant reason.
    *   King's questions: "What is the right time to begin everything?", "Who are the right people to listen to?", and "What is the most important thing to do?"

3.  **Formulating a Reason in English:**
    *   This requires productive writing. Looking at "Q: 'Describes the poet’s writing style.' (pass rate: 4%) Wrong answer: 'I am reading.'" This suggests difficulty with even simple descriptive sentences.
    *   "Q: 'Write a theme or central idea...' (pass rate: 5%)" and "Q: 'Write a short paragraph...' (pass rate: 10%)" highlight that *explaining* or *justifying* in 1-2 sentences is a significant hurdle.
    *   Expected correct answers might be: "Yes, because it helps you make good decisions" or "Yes, because if you know the right time, you won't fail." This is a higher bar than just recalling a fact.

**Applying Common Errors and Warnings:**

*   **Limited English:** Many will struggle to articulate *any* reason clearly. They might understand the *concept* in their native language but fail to express it in English.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** The idea of "importance in real life" and linking abstract questions to practical benefits might not be self-evident to struggling learners.
*   **Exam Anxiety:** Could lead to blank responses even if they have some idea.
*   **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** While they might have answered "why" questions, specifically linking *fictional character's questions* to *real-life importance* with a reason might be novel.

**Challenging My First Instinct:**

My initial thought might be "Yes, these are fairly simple questions to understand the importance of making good decisions." However, then I remember:
*   **The average pass rate is 29% overall.** This question is *more demanding* than simple recall.
*   The writing task ("give one reason") is a known stumbling block. The sample errors show extreme difficulty with *producing* coherent sentences, even short ones.
*   A "yes/no" answer alone won't score, and formulating a *valid reason* in limited English is hard.
*   Many might give a reason totally unrelated to the passage, e.g., "Yes, because kings are important." or "No, because kings are cruel." or just a simple "yes."

Considering the low pass rates on tasks requiring even basic explanation or description (4%, 5%, 10%), asking for a *reason* related to abstract concepts for a Class 7 student from an EWS background in a government school is a very high bar. They need to connect the king's questions, understand their implication for "real life," and express it in a complete, grammatically sound sentence that constitutes a valid reason.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Given the difficulty in articulating reasons (evident from the very low pass rates on similar tasks) and the need to connect to passage content *and* "real life," I believe a significant proportion of students will either leave it blank, write "yes" without a reason, write "yes" with a non-valid or garbled reason, or misunderstand the "real life" component.

I would expect the proportion correct to be closer to the writing-intensive low-performing questions, rather than the average 29%. It's even more abstract than describing a poet's style or a simple hobby.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **8%**
