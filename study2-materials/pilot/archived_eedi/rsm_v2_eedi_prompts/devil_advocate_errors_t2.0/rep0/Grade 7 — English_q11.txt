Here's my analysis and calibrated estimate:

**Initial Instinct vs. Reality Check:**

My *initial* instinct, looking at the question and knowing it's Class 7, would be perhaps 40-50%. I might think, "Adjectives are pretty basic; they learn about them early."

**Challenging Assumptions with Provided Context:**

1.  **Limited English, Economically Weaker Sections:** This is paramount. The average pass rate of 29% for other questions, with even lower rates (4-10%) for more descriptive tasks, tells me their foundational English grammar is weak.
2.  **Common Errors & "Empty Response":** The prevalence of "Empty Response" on other questions indicates either total lack of understanding, inability to formulate a response, or exam anxiety leading to paralysis.
3.  **"Describes the poet’s writing style." (pass rate: 4%) Wrong answer: "I am reading."** This is a huge red flag. It shows students either *don't understand what "describes"* means in that context, or don't know the vocabulary.
4.  **"Write a theme or central idea..." (pass rate: 5%) Wrong answer: "The last bargin they about a child and labour. many people tried to force the la"** This response, while trying to address the prompt, is riddled with grammatical errors and poor sentence structure. This student likely knows some keywords but struggles immensely with forming coherent English sentences.
5.  **"My Favourite Hobby" (pass rate: 10%) Wrong answer: "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy"** This shows students grabbing for familiar words/concepts but completely missing the *structure* (paragraph, full sentences, specific prompts like "mention what...") and struggling even with basic spelling ("fauourite").
6.  **"Adjective *phrase*" vs. "Adjective":** The question specifically asks for an "adjective phrase," but the rubric says "identifies 'tiny' as an adjective." This is a critical mismatch.
    *   If students are *actually* taught adjective *phrases*, they might be looking for something longer than a single word (e.g., "a tiny bird," or a prepositional phrase acting as an adjective).
    *   If they are only familiar with identifying single-word adjectives, then "tiny" would be the obvious choice *if they know what an adjective is*.
    *   The prompt specifically asks for a *phrase*. Even if "tiny" is accepted by the rubric, students who are *only* looking for a phrase might not even consider "tiny" alone. This could trip up students who *do* understand grammar.

7.  **Teachers and experts misjudge difficulty:** This reinforces the idea that what seems "easy" to us is genuinely difficult for these students. "Adjective" might be a familiar word, but applying it correctly, especially in an exam setting, is a different challenge.

**Applying the Realities to "Identify the adjective phrase...":**

*   **Understanding "Adjective":** Many might not remember the definition of an adjective or how to identify one. Given the poor performance on even simpler English tasks, recalling a specific grammatical term and applying it is a hurdle.
*   **Understanding "Phrase":** This adds another layer of complexity. If they just write "tiny," technically they haven't identified a "phrase." While the rubric accepts it, students aiming for a "phrase" might hesitate or try to encompass "a tiny bird," which isn't the adjective phrase here (it's a noun phrase modified by an adjective).
*   **Context of Sentence:** While the sentence is simple, processing the instructions and then applying the knowledge to the sentence in limited English can be overwhelming.
*   **Exam Anxiety / Blank Responses:** Given the high rate of "Empty Response" elsewhere, a significant portion will simply leave this blank due to lack of confidence or knowledge.

**Conclusion:**

Considering the extremely low pass rates on other questions requiring similar levels of English comprehension and grammar application, combined with the general weaknesses described, I have to drastically lower my initial estimate. Even "tiny" as a single-word identification will be a struggle for many, and the "phrase" instruction could add confusion for some.
