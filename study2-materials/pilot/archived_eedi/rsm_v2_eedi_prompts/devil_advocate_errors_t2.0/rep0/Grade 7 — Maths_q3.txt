Let's break down the thinking for this question, challenging initial assumptions as instructed.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong for this population):**
My first thought as someone familiar with the concept might be, "This is a very basic geometry question. Most Class 7 students should know this formula." I'd probably lean towards 50-60%.

**Challenging the Initial Instinct (Applying the Given Context):**

1.  **Limited English:** "Find the area... base is 8 cm and height is 6 cm."
    *   "Find" is generally understood.
    *   "Area" - is this word universally recognized and differentiated from "perimeter" or "volume" by students with limited English exposure, even in a math context? It might be confusing.
    *   "Base" and "height" - These are crucial vocabulary words. Have they been sufficiently drilled and understood, or could a student with weak English just see numbers and not fully grasp the context? They might not associate these words with the specific parts of a triangle needed for the formula.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   The formula `Area = 1/2 × base × height` involves a fraction (1/2), multiplication, and understanding what "base" and "height" *represent* in a triangle.
    *   Many students, especially those struggling, might know individual operations (like multiplication) but fail to recall or correctly apply a multi-step formula like this.
    *   Concept of "area" itself – is it truly solidified for students who might have a fragmented learning experience? They might confuse it with perimeter or simply guess a formula if they only half-remember it.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/No Practice:**
    *   Anxiety can cause students to forget even known formulas.
    *   "Never practiced this exact question type" – This is huge. If they've only seen diagrams and haven't frequently practiced *word problems* where they need to extract "base" and "height" from text, they might stumble even if they know the formula.
    *   Recalling the formula `Area = 1/2 × base × height` specifically is the hurdle. They might remember `l × w` from rectangles but confuse or omit the `1/2` for triangles.

4.  **Absenteeism/Weak Foundation:**
    *   "A student who was absent for this topic" will definitely not get this.
    *   "A student who barely reads English" might just look at the numbers and try to multiply them (8x6) or add them, without recalling the specific formula involving `1/2`.
    *   The prompt specifies they are from economically weaker sections. This often implies larger class sizes, less individual attention, and potential gaps in foundational knowledge.

**Re-evaluating based on challenges:**

*   The average pass rate is 29%, indicating a very challenging environment for learning. This specific question is fundamental to Class 7 geometry, so one might expect it to be slightly *above* the average if students are getting through the curriculum.
*   However, the rubric *only* requires stating or using the correct formula. It doesn't require calculation. This might slightly *increase* the percentage compared to a question requiring full calculation, as they just need to recall the setup.
*   The primary barriers are:
    *   Recalling the exact formula (`1/2 bh` vs `bh` or other variations).
    *   Understanding "base" and "height" from the text in English.
    *   The mental leap from numbers to a specific geometric formula.

Given the emphasis on struggling learners, limited English, anxiety, and potential lack of exact practice, I suspect a significant number of students will either:
*   Write `8 * 6` (forgetting `1/2`)
*   Write an incorrect formula or no formula.
*   Be blank.

While it's a "basic" formula, the conditions listed make it very hard to recall and apply consistently. The `1/2` is often the missing part for students who remember `base * height`.

Let's imagine:
*   A small group truly understands and remembers (~15%).
*   Another small group remembers `base * height` but forgets `1/2` (so they wouldn't get credit for the formula, only calculation if allowed, which it isn't here) (~10-15%).
*   The rest are confused, don't know, or can't recall (`~70%`).

Considering it's *just* the formula recall for credit, this *might* push it a little higher than the raw calculation, but the "1
