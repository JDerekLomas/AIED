Let's break down this question based on the provided context.

**Understanding the Question:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"

**Analyzing the Rubric:** "Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why." (Max score: 1.5, implying a correct answer)

**Considering the Students (Class 6, Indian Gov't Schools, EWS, limited English):**

1.  **"Which line from the poem..."**:
    *   **Vocabulary:** "line," "poem" might be understood. "Most" (superlative) can be tricky.
    *   **Concept:** Identifying a *specific line* from a poem implies:
        *   Understanding what a "line" is in a poetic context (not just any sentence).
        *   Ability to recall or find a specific line from the poem (which assumes they've read and processed the poem, a big assumption given the pass rates).
        *   Ability to accurately transcribe or refer to that line.

2.  **"...do you like..."**:
    *   **Subjectivity:** This requires personal preference, which some students might find easier or harder to articulate. However, the core issue will be expressing that preference *in English*.

3.  **"...and why?"**:
    *   **Causality/Reasoning:** This is the biggest hurdle. Explaining "why" something is liked requires:
        *   Accessing vocabulary for expressing feelings, ideas, or reasons.
        *   Forming a coherent sentence (or two) to link the chosen line with a reason.
        *   Understanding abstract concepts that might explain "liking" something (e.g., "it's beautiful," "it makes me feel happy," "it reminds me of X," "it has a good message").

**Referencing Common Errors & Expert Blindness:**

*   **"Describes the poet's writing style." (4% pass):** This question is conceptually similar in that it requires identification and then elaboration. If students struggled to describe a "style," explaining "why you like" a line will be incredibly difficult. The "I am reading" answer suggests a complete misunderstanding of the task, focusing on their *activity* rather than the poem itself.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass):** Again, a conceptual question requiring summary and analysis. The wrong answer "The last bargin they about a child and labour. many people tried to force the la" shows they can *extract some words* and attempt a sentence, but it's not a clear theme. For "why you like," they'd need more complex reasoning than just recalling facts.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... 'My Favourite Hobby'..." (10% pass):** This is a *personal* question, much like "do you like." Even for something as basic as their hobby, answers were disjointed ("My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho my fauourite food is noodles") or extremely basic ("My hobby is cricket play"). This indicates severe limitations in forming even simple explanatory sentences about personal preferences.
*   **"Empty Response":** A common and worrying trend. Anxiety and lack of understanding often lead to this.
*   **Expert Misjudgment:** Teachers would think, "Oh, they just need to pick a line and say 'I like it because it's nice' or 'it sounds good.'" But for these students, even "it's nice" can be a lexical and grammatical challenge. Many might not be able to identify a line they "like" in an abstract sense, or struggle to put it into words even if they do.

**Challenging the First Instinct:**

My first instinct might be "15-20% because it's a personal opinion question, which can be easier."

*   **Re-challenge:**
    *   **Limited English:** Can they accurately name the line? Can they form *any* coherent sentence for "why"? "I like this line because nice." Is that enough for "denotes a line and mentions why"? Maybe barely.
    *   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** Articulating a personal preference and backing it up with a reason, even a simple one, is not basic for these students, especially when coupled with finding a specific line in a poem.
    *   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** The prevalence of "Empty Response" in similar conceptual/analytical questions suggests many won't even try.
    *   **Lack of Practice:** Have they practiced this exact question type, identifying and justifying preferences in English? Probably not adequately.

Given the *very low* pass rates on questions that require **conceptual understanding** and **sentence construction based on analysis/opinion** (4%,
