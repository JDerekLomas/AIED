Let's break down the question and the context carefully.

**Question:** "How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"

**Rubric:** Explaining that victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab).

**Factors Working Against Correct Answers:**

1.  **English Language Barrier:** This is the *biggest* hurdle.
    *   "Contribute to the expansion" - A multi-word verb phrase that might be hard for struggling English readers. "Expansion" itself might be difficult.
    *   "Establishment of political dominance/control over Bengal" - These are high-level vocabulary and abstract concepts.
    *   "Puppet nawab" - If not explicitly taught in that exact phrasing, it could be missed. Even "nawab" might be an issue for some.

2.  **Specific Historical Detail:** While the Battle of Plassey is fundamental, connecting it precisely to *how* it contributed to *expansion* requires more than just knowing it happened. Students need to grasp the cause-and-effect of political control in Bengal leading to broader power.

3.  **Abstract Thinking:** "Political dominance" is not a concrete item. It requires understanding of power structures, which is harder for struggling learners.

4.  **"Basic Concepts Aren't Basic":** While Plassey is foundational in the curriculum, the *specific mechanism* of how it expanded power (puppet rule, control over resources, beginning of political subjugation) might be a step beyond what many can articulate clearly, especially if only rote memorization was employed.

5.  **Curriculum Recall:**
    *   Class 8 Social Science covers Modern Indian History. Plassey would be a key topic.
    *   However, knowing the *event* is different from understanding its *consequences* in the nuanced way required by the rubric. They might know "British won," but not "British gained political control by installing a puppet."

6.  **Common Errors/Expert Bias:**
    *   **Empty Response:** Given the very low pass rates on similar analytical questions, a significant number of students will leave it blank or write "Ans" (which counts as empty).
    *   **Partial Answers:** Some might vaguely say "British became powerful" but miss the specific "control over Bengal" or "political dominance." This would likely score 0 as per the strict rubric (need to explain *how* it contributed, not just *that* it did).
    *   **Misinterpretations:** The examples provided ("Asher' stand", "Ashok seamb") show how poorly some students engage with questions, possibly due to a complete lack of understanding or misreading key terms.

7.  **Exam Anxiety:** Can easily lead to blank responses, even from students who have a vague idea.

**Challenging the Instinct:**

My first instinct might be "Plassey is an important event, students should know this." But then I have to filter it through:

*   **"Barely reads English":** Such a student will struggle with "contribute to the expansion," "political dominance," and potentially "puppet nawab." They might identify "Plassey" and "British" but little else meaningful.
*   **"Absent for this topic":** Impossible to answer.
*   **"Never practiced this exact question type":** Many government school students learn through rote memorization of facts rather than analytical reasoning. Connecting an event to a *type of consequence* (political dominance, rather than just "more land" or "more money") requires a specific understanding.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Given the extreme difficulty students have with even seemingly simpler Social Science questions requiring explanation or interpretation (9-12% pass rates on "Explain how colonial rule affected tribals," "Why lions on currency," "Significance of Ashoka"), this question presents similar, if not greater, linguistic and conceptual barriers.

*   "Political dominance" is an abstract concept.
*   "Contribute to the expansion" requires understanding causation beyond a simple win/loss.
*   The examples of wrong answers demonstrate a profound disconnect for a large segment of students.

I anticipate a large number of empty responses, partially correct answers that don't meet the rubric's specific demand for explaining "how" it contributed to *political dominance/control over Bengal*, and outright incorrect/irrelevant answers due to language issues or lack of comprehension.

Even though it's a key historical event, the demand for a specific, articulable mechanism of power expansion, coupled with the known linguistic and conceptual struggles, makes this very difficult.

My estimate would be much closer to the lower end of the provided pass rates, perhaps even slightly below due to the nuanced vocabulary required by
