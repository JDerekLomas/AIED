My first instinct would be around 10-15%, primarily because "writing style" is a common literary term. However, after considering the provided context and the common errors, I need to adjust this downwards significantly.

Here's why:

*   **"Describes the poet’s writing style."** This exact question had a 4% pass rate previously, with common errors being "I am reading" or "Empty Response." This is a strong indicator of fundamental misunderstanding of the prompt itself.
*   **Limited English:** "Describes" and "writing style" are abstract concepts that require a decent grasp of English vocabulary and analytical thought. A student who struggles with basic sentence formation is highly unlikely to parse this.
*   **Common Errors Data:** The examples provided demonstrate a deep lack of understanding. Students are either giving completely irrelevant answers, incomplete sentences, or leaving it blank. This isn't just a lack of sophisticated vocabulary; it's a failure to comprehend the request itself.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** For a student with limited English proficiency, "writing style" isn't basic. They might interpret "style" literally (e.g., penmanship) or fail to link it to literary analysis.
*   **Anxiety:** Exam anxiety often leads to blank responses, further lowering scores.
*   **Lack of Practice:** The note about students not having practiced this *exact* question type is crucial. While they might have discussed poems, being asked to articulate "writing style" with precision, in English, under exam conditions, is a different challenge.

Given that an *identical* question had a 4% pass rate, and factoring in the broader context of economically weaker sections and limited English, I expect this specific question to perform similarly, if not slightly worse due to its abstract nature. The rubric requires identifying a "suitable and relevant word," which implies more than just identifying *something* related to the poem; it demands a literary-critical term.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 3%
