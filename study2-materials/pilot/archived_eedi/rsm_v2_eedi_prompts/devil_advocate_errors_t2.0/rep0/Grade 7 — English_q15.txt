Given the information, especially the common errors and the advice to challenge first instincts, I need to recalibrate.

My first instinct might be around 20-30% because "My Favourite Hobby" seems like a common topic, and the paragraph length is short.

However, the examples of common errors on seemingly similar "write a paragraph/description" questions (e.g., "Describes the poet’s writing style," "Write a theme or central idea," and even the *very similar* "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what") have alarmingly low pass rates of 4%, 5%, and 10% respectively.

The errors show:
*   **Literal comprehension issues:** "My favourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy" indicates they are listing things they like, not describing a hobby or forming sentences.
*   **Inability to form coherent sentences/paragraphs:** "My hobby is cricket play" is a phrase, not a paragraph.
*   **Difficulty with task specifics:** The provided prompt requires *what*, *when*, and *why*. Even if they identify a hobby, connecting the "when" and "why" into grammatically sound sentences within a 4-5 sentence structure will be a major hurdle.
*   **General English fluency:** The example "My Favowrife Hobby cbaking\nMy Favowrife" suggests severe spelling and grammar issues.
*   **Anxiety/Lack of exposure:** "Empty Response" is frequent even on seemingly basic questions.
*   **Low baseline pass rate:** The average pass rate is about 29% for all questions, implying individual questions often fall well below this, especially those requiring extended writing.

While the prompt "My Favourite Hobby" might seem relatable, the *expectation to write a 4-5 sentence paragraph* meeting specific criteria (what, when, why) is likely beyond most students in this demographic with their observed English proficiency. The rubric requires a *complete paragraph* that *clearly mentions* all three aspects.

Comparing to the example prompt with a 10% pass rate that *started the same way* ("Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what"), it seems unlikely this iteration will be significantly different unless there's a critical unstated difference in the continuation of that original 10% pass rate prompt. Assuming the prompt given in this problem is a full representation, it mirrors the 10% example quite closely.

I have to adjust downwards, substantially. The pass rates of the similar tasks are compelling evidence of extreme difficulty. If students struggled to even name a hobby in a coherent sentence (as seen in the 10% pass rate example), forming 4-5 sentences *with specific details* is a major leap.

The only slight improvement might come if "when" and "why" are marginally easier than what the previous example *implied* it would ask for (which it didn't fully reveal beyond "Mention what"). However, I should err on the side of caution and consider the evidence of poor writing ability.

Given that similar paragraph-writing tasks, even on very accessible topics, resulted in 10% or lower, and considering the limited English proficiency and common errors, this task will also be very challenging.

Calibrated Estimate: My first instinct was too high. The direct example of a very similar question achieving a 10% pass rate, coupled with the reasons for low performance (limited English, anxiety, lack of specific question practice), forces a very low estimate. Even 10% might be generous if students falter on incorporating the "when" and "why" parts.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 7%**
