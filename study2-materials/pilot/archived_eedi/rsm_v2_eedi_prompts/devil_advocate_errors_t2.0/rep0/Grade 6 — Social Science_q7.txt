Here's a breakdown of how I'd arrive at the estimate, considering all the provided information:

**Initial Instinct vs. Calibrated Assessment:**

My first instinct, based purely on the subject matter, might be to think this question is relatively easy. Rajasthan is famous for its desert, minerals, and now renewable energy. Most students, even if not highly academic, likely hear about things like marble, copper, salt, or sand in their daily lives or general knowledge.

However, applying the provided filters:

1.  **Limited English (Critical):** "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."
    *   "Mention any two natural resources": This part is straightforward enough. Students could list words.
    *   "explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there": This is the tougher part. "Explain," "influences," and "lives" all require some level of comprehension and the ability to formulate a coherent thought in English. Many of the example incorrect answers show very poor English proficiency.

2.  **Economically Weaker Sections:** While this doesn't directly relate to *this specific* content as much as a question about agriculture or livelihoods might, it hints at generally lower educational attainment, potentially less exposure to diverse information, and potentially less focus on academic learning at home.

3.  **Average Pass Rate (29%) & Common Errors:** The fact that other social science questions with even simpler prompt structures ("Explain how...", "Why are...", "Explain the significance...") have such low pass rates (9-12%) is a massive red flag. The prevalence of "Empty Response" or barely legible, off-topic answers demonstrates:
    *   Lack of comprehension of the question.
    *   Inability to form a correct answer in English, even if they know the concept in their mother tongue.
    *   Exam anxiety leading to blanks.
    *   Simply not knowing the content in an retrievable format.

4.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While Rajasthan is known for these things, putting it into a structured explanation, even a simple one, isn't basic for a struggling learner. Many students might know "marble" but struggle to articulate "Marble is quarried for construction, providing jobs and used to build homes and temples."

5.  **Teachers Overestimate Difficulty:** This instruction is key. My initial "easy" feeling is exactly what experts tend to do.

**Breaking Down the Rubric and Student Performance:**

*   **Part 1: Mentions two correct natural resources.**
    *   This is the *easier* part. I expect a higher percentage of students to get at least *one* correct, and maybe a decent number get two. Think about common, tangible resources: Water (especially its scarcity and importance in Rajasthan), Marble, Sand, Salt (Sambhar Lake). Copper and Zinc might be known to some due to mining.
    *   Even if they know the resources in their local language, writing them in English (e.g., "patthar" -> "stone" or "marble") is an hurdle.
    *   Given the prevalence of blank or unintelligible answers in the other examples, even this first part won't be universally achieved.

*   **Part 2: Explains how one influences lives.**
    *   This is where performance will plummet dramatically, aligning with the low pass rates of similar "explain" questions.
    *   Students need to pick one resource, then think about *influence*, and then express it in English.
    *   Example: If they pick "Water," they might need to say something like, "Water is very important for drinking and farming because Rajasthan is a desert area and water is scarce." Even this simple sentence requires proper structure.
    *   Many will likely just list the resources, or attempt a very poor explanation. The "Ashok seamb" and "Asher' stand" examples show how garbled responses can be, failing to meet *any* part of the rubric effectively.

**Recalibrated Estimate:**

Given the high percentage of blank or irrelevant responses on other "explain" questions (around 88-91% wrong, leaving 9-12% correct), this question, with its two-part demand, will likely perform similarly. The first part (listing resources) is slightly simpler than explaining abstract concepts like "colonial rule" or "Ashoka's reign," but the "explain influence" part is highly demanding for this demographic.

I'd expect a noticeable number of students to list two resources, but very few to articulate the "how it influences lives" part with enough clarity in English to get credit. The "Empty Response" type of error will still be extremely high.

Considering the *average* pass rate is 29%,
