Let's break down the thinking process for estimating the pass rate for "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

**Initial Gut Reaction (and why it's probably too high):**

My first thought might be: "Harappan Civilization is a pretty standard topic for Indian history. Urban planning, drainage, grid layout – these are foundational concepts. Maybe 40-50%."

**Now, let's challenge those assumptions using the provided information:**

1.  **Limited English Proficiency:** This is a *huge* factor. "Describe one key feature" is simple enough, but can students correctly articulate concepts like "grid layout," "drainage system," or "baked bricks" accurately in English? Many might know the *idea* in their regional language but struggle to translate it into a concise, correct English sentence.
2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:** While Harappan civ is standard, not every student grasps all its aspects, especially "urban planning" as a specific feature. Some might remember "they built cities" but struggle with *what made those cities special*.
3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** The example errors are rife with "Empty Response." Even if a student vaguely remembers something, anxiety can lead to a blank page.
4.  **No Practice with *This Exact Question Type*:** While they might have learned about Harappa, have they specifically practiced *describing a key feature of its urban planning* in a one-sentence answer? The examples of wrong answers for other questions suggest students often provide irrelevant, fragmented, or poorly constructed answers. "Asher' stand" for lions, or just "ashok a second" are classic examples of students trying to retrieve *some* keyword and failing to form a coherent answer.
5.  **Average Pass Rate 29% (Contextual Anchor):** The overall average is low. This means a significant number of students are struggling across the board.
6.  **Example Error Patterns from Social Science:**
    *   **"Explain how colonial rule under the British affected the lives of tribal communi" (pass rate: 9%)**: This is a *complex explanatory* question. Students struggled to formulate any answer, leading to many "Empty Responses." Our question is *simpler* in terms of asking for a *description* of *one feature*. This suggests it should be higher than 9%, but not drastically so given the other constraints.
    *   **"Why are lions shown on Indian currency notes? Explain" (pass rate: 10%)**: This asks for historical/symbolic reasoning. Students couldn't even accurately name the Ashoka Pillar or its connection, instead giving phonetic guesses or unrelated phrases. This is a very similar cognitive task – retrieving a specific factual detail and articulating it. If they can't even get "Ashoka" right consistently, how will they get "well-planned drainage system" or "grid layout" right?
    *   **"Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign in Indian history, mentioning at leas" (pass rate: 12%)**: Again, requiring explanation and detail. The responses show fundamental failure to produce relevant text.

**Re-calibrating the Estimate:**

*   **Positive factors:** It's a foundational topic. The question is fairly direct ("one key feature").
*   **Negative factors:**
    *   *Formulating* a correct answer in English for a specific historical concept like "urban planning" will be challenging for students with limited English. They might know "cities good" but not "grid layout."
    *   The extremely low pass rates on *other seemingly basic Social Science questions* (9-12%) are very concerning. Students aren't just missing nuances; they're failing to provide *any relevant information* in many cases.
    *   The "lion on currency" question is probably the most comparable: retrieving a specific piece of historical information (Ashoka's reign, the Sarnath lions) and explaining its significance/feature. That had a 10% pass rate, and the answers were extremely fragmented and often phonetically guessed.
    *   Even if they remember "drainage," can they phrase it as "advanced drainage system"? Or will it be "water pipe"?
    *   "Citadel and lower town" requires understanding two distinct parts of a city structure, which might be too complex for a single "key feature" if they struggle with the terminology.
    *   "Baked bricks" might be too generic. Is it a *key feature of urban planning*, or just a construction material? (It is, as it implies permanence and advanced building techniques, but students might not make that connection.)

Considering all this, an initial thought of 40-50% is clearly wildly optimistic. Even
