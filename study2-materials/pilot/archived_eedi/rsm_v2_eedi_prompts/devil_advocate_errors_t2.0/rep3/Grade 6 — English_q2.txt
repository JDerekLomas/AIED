Here's my calibrated estimate for the question "Who lived inside the book?", considering the provided context and common student difficulties:

**Text Analysis of the Question:**

*   **Key terms:** "Who lived inside the book?"
    *   "Who": Pronoun for person/being.
    *   "Lived": Past tense of to live, simple verb.
    *   "Inside": Preposition of place.
    *   "The book": Simple noun phrase.
*   **Implied poem context:** The question likely refers to a specific poem or story taught to Class 6 students. The rubric mentions "a magical fairy lived inside the book," implying the correct answer is quite specific and directly stated in the source text.

**Revisiting Common Errors & Context:**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   The question itself is grammatically simple. However, "lived inside" might be a tiny hurdle for students struggling with past tense or prepositions if they don't explicitly connect it to "a fairy."
    *   The answer requires extracting a specific piece of information from a *reading*. The "Describes the poet’s writing style" example shows extreme difficulty with analytical/interpretive questions. This "Who lived inside" question is *retrieval* and should be easier, *if the information is readily available and understood*.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   Understanding "who," "lived," "inside," "book" individually is basic.
    *   Retrieving a specific fact from a story *can be* basic, but it assumes the student comprehended the story well enough to remember that fact.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:**
    *   The "Empty Response" common error is critical. Even if they know it, anxiety or simply not immediately recalling it could lead to a blank.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   While "who/what/where" questions are fundamental, the low pass rates on other questions suggest general inexperience with formal assessment and structured recall.

5.  **Teachers Overestimating Difficulty:** This is the most crucial warning. My initial thought might be "this is simple recall, 40-50%." However, the evidence pushes *down* this instinct.

**Challenging My First Instinct (40-50%):**

*   **Analogy to other questions:**
    *   "Describes the poet's writing style" (4%) - Requires high-level analytical understanding and vocabulary. "Who lived inside the book?" is much simpler.
    *   "Write a theme or central idea..." (5%) - Requires synthesis and summarization, often abstract. "Who lived inside the book?" is concrete.
    *   "Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby" (10%) - Requires sentence construction, coherent ideas, and a grasp of the prompt's requirements (4-5 sentences). Even then, responses are disjointed or single-phrase answers.
*   **The *specificity* of the answer ("magical fairy"):** Students might struggle if the poem introduced several characters, or if "fairy" wasn't emphasized. They might recall *a* character, but not *the* character or its descriptor. If they write "girl" or "somebody," it's wrong based on the rubric.
*   **Impact of limited English on *comprehension* of the source text:** The primary obstacle won't be understanding the *question* but understanding *the story from which the answer comes*. If they didn't fully grasp the poem/story in the first place, or if the fairy was mentioned only once subtly, retrieval becomes impossible, regardless of question simplicity.
*   **High rates of "Empty Response"**: This shows a significant proportion simply gives up or has no idea. Even for a seemingly easy question, if they don't *immediately* know the answer, they might leave it blank rather than guess.

**Revised Thinking:**

Given that 10% can't even write a coherent few sentences about their hobby (a personal topic), and that 5% can't identify a theme (which requires reading the poem), an isolated fact retrieval *should* be easier.

However, the "magical fairy" requires not just recall of "fairy" but also "magical." The rubric implies both "magical fairy" and just "fairy" are acceptable, which helps.

The overall average pass rate is 29%. This specific question is a direct factual recall. It's likely easier than the average exam question but not drastically so for the *struggling* students. It demands foundational story comprehension, not just basic English vocabulary in the question.

If 10% struggled with a personal "My Hobby" paragraph due to
