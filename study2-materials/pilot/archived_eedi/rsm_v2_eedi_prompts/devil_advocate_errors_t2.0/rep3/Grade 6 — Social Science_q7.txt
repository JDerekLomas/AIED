Here's my calibrated estimate for the proportion of Class 6 students in Indian government schools who would answer the given question correctly, along with my reasoning:

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 8%**

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning, addressing the key challenges and common errors:

1.  **Limited English Comprehension (Primary Factor):**
    *   **"Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan..."**: While "natural resources" might be a commonly taught term, many students will struggle to understand "mention" or formulate a response. Even if they know some resources, expressing them accurately in English is a barrier. Rajasthan is a specific region, and while *some* resources (like sand/water) are universally associated, others (like copper, gypsum) are more specific.
    *   **"...and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."**: This part significantly raises the cognitive and linguistic load.
        *   "Explain" is a known difficulty (as seen in the error analysis).
        *   "Influences the lives" is an abstract concept. Students might struggle to connect a resource directly to how it *influences* rather than just *is present*. They'd need to describe the *impact* or *use* in a meaningful way.
        *   The complexity of constructing a coherent sentence explaining this relationship is very high for students with limited English.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   **Identifying resources**: While some students might vaguely know sand or water are natural resources, listing two *specific* ones for *Rajasthan* and then linking one to daily life requires recall, application, and synthesis, which are challenging for this demographic.
    *   **Geographic Specificity**: Knowing resources *specifically* for Rajasthan requires focused learning, which not all students will have received or retained, especially if they were absent or disengaged during that topic.

3.  **Exam Anxiety / Empty Responses:** The example error analysis ("Empty Response") is rampant for abstract "explain" questions. Even if a student *might* know an answer, the pressure and the linguistic barrier can lead to a complete blank.

4.  **No Practice with this Exact Question Type:** "Mention two X and explain how one affects Y" is a multi-part, higher-order thinking question that is unlikely to be practiced thoroughly with emphasis on structured English responses.

5.  **Teachers Overestimating Difficulty:** Teachers likely assume students know about basic geography and resources of their own country, and that they can articulate simple connections. They forget the step-by-step cognitive hurdles and linguistic demands for a Class 6 student in this context.

**Breaking Down Potential Success Points:**

*   **Chance of knowing two resources (e.g., Water, Sand):** Moderate, especially if the teacher focused on Rajasthan. Maybe 30-40% could *list* two in their local language, but translating them correctly to English for *both* is harder. Let's assume perhaps 15-20% could accurately write down two *correct* resources in English.
*   **Chance of explaining influence (even poorly):** This is where it crashes. "Explain" itself has a 9-12% pass rate in the examples, and those examples don't require geographical specificity or connection to daily life. For this question, connecting a resource like water to daily life (e.g., "People use water for drinking and farming") might be simple *conceptually*, but expressing it clearly and linking it back as an "influence" is tough. Even if they write "Water for drinking," that doesn't fully explain the *influence*.

**Why 8% is not lower (and why it's not higher):**

*   It's not 0-1% because some students *will* have grasped the concept, paid attention in class, and be decent at basic English, possibly aided by memorized phrases. They might be able to identify "water" and "sand" (or "marble") and say something very simple like "Water used for drinking" or "People build houses with marble." Even if minimal, it might barely clear the rubric's implied leniency for "explain how...influences."
*   It's not higher than 10-12% (similar to the given example pass rates for other explanation questions) because:
    *   It requires **two** specific pieces of information (two resources).
    *   It requires **regional specificity** (Rajasthan).
    *   It requires **"explanation" of influence**, which is an added layer of difficulty compared to just explaining "why lions are on notes."
    *   The multi-part nature significantly increases the chance of error or partial credit (which wouldn't be "correct" for the
