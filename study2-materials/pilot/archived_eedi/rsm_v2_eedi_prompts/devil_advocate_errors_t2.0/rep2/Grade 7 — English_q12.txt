I am estimating what proportion of Class 7 students in Indian government schools would answer the following question correctly.

**Question:** Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice:
The wind blew the leaves away.

**Rubric:** The student correctly transforms the sentence into passive voice: "The leaves were blown away by the wind."

Let's break down the difficulties based on the provided information about student abilities and common errors:

*   **Limited English Proficiency:** The examples show extremely basic English struggles ("I am reading," "My hobby is cricket play"). Transforming active to passive voice requires a foundational understanding of sentence structure, verbs, and subject/object relationships, which is a leap beyond their current demonstrated grasp. They need to recognize the object, use the correct form of "to be" (past tense for "blew"), use the past participle of the main verb ("blown"), and potentially add "by the wind." Each step is a potential point of failure.

*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** Active/passive voice is taught, but the pass rates for other questions (4-10%) strongly suggest that even if it's "taught," it's not "learned" by a large proportion of these students, especially those struggling. The conceptual understanding of voice is complex for L2 learners with limited exposure.

*   **Exam Anxiety / Blank Responses:** Given the high proportion of "Empty Response" for other questions, a question like active/passive voice, which demands transformation and precise grammatical knowledge, is very likely to result in blank answers if students don't immediately know how to approach it or feel overwhelmed.

*   **Lack of Practice:** The note about students not having practiced this "exact question type" is crucial. Even if the *concept* of active/passive is touched upon, a specific transformation task requires confidence and recall that many may lack.

*   **Verb Irregularities:** The verb "blow" is irregular (blow, blew, blown). Many students, even those who attempt the transformation, might struggle with the correct past participle form, potentially writing "blowed" or "blow" instead of "blown."

*   **Structural Complexity:** Even if they identify "the leaves" as the new subject, placing "were blown away by the wind" correctly is a multi-part process. Many might struggle with word order or omitting parts. For example, some might write "The leaves blown away wind" or "The leaves blew away."

**Challenging my first instinct:** My initial thought might be "it's a core grammar topic, maybe 20-25%." However, looking at the *demonstrated* English proficiency in the common errors and the *extremely low pass rates* (4-10%) on seemingly simpler (though also difficult for them) tasks, 20-25% is far too high. The example "My fauourite game is Badminton Cricket Kho-Kho\nmy fauourite food is noodles\nmy" for a "short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'" highlights how difficult it is for them to structure a coherent response, even on a personal topic. Transforming a sentence with specific grammatical rules is a higher-order task.

Considering the common errors, the difficulty of forming even simple sentences, the likelihood of empty responses, and the specific challenge of verb conjugation and grammatical transformation for students with limited English:

**My calibrated estimate:** I would expect a significant proportion of blank responses, and many incorrect attempts due to struggles with verb forms, auxiliary verbs ("were"), and overall sentence structure. This is a highly demanding question for this cohort.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 5%
