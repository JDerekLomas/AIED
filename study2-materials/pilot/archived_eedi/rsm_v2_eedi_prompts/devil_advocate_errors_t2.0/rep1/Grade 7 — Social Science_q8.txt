Here's my thought process for estimating the proportion correct:

1.  **Analyze the Question:**
    *   "What are the main occupations of people in the rural areas of Rajasthan?" - This requires factual recall.
    *   "Describe any one in brief." - This requires a minimal level of descriptive English and understanding of a chosen occupation.

2.  **Consider the Target Students (Class 7, Indian government schools, economically weaker, limited English):**
    *   **Content Knowledge:** Rajasthan is a prominent state in India. Basic geography and economic activities of different regions are usually covered in Social Science. Agriculture and animal husbandry are fundamental to rural India. Students should *theoretically* know these.
    *   **English Proficiency:** "Main occupations," "rural areas," "describe any one in brief." These are relatively common vocabulary words. The structure isn't overly complex.
    *   **Common Errors (from examples):**
        *   "Empty Response" is very high (9-12% pass rate examples show many blanks). This is a *major* concern.
        *   Misunderstanding or providing irrelevant/fragmented answers (e.g., "Asher' stand").
        *   Lack of conceptual understanding despite basic English.

3.  **Evaluate the Rubric:**
    *   "Names at least two main occupations correctly (e.g., Agriculture/farming, Animal Husbandry/pastoralism, handicrafts)."
    *   This is *very lenient*. They don't even need to *describe* one to get points for naming two. *However, the question itself asks for a description, so students might attempt it.* The prompt doesn't state they get 1 mark for just naming. The max score of 1 implies the naming + brief description would combine for the point. Let's assume to score 1, they must satisfy both parts.

4.  **Challenging Initial Instincts:**
    *   **First Instinct:** "Agriculture and animal husbandry are so basic for rural India, especially Rajasthan. Most students should get this." -> This is the "expert overestimation" trap.
    *   **Re-challenge:**
        *   *Limited English:* While the words are relatively common, framing a coherent answer, even briefly, might be difficult. Will "Farming" count? Yes, probably. What if they just write "Kheti" (Hindi for farming) and leave it at that? The prompt implies English.
        *   *Absenteeism/Lack of Practice:* What if they missed the specific topic covering Rajasthan's economy? Or they learned it, but haven't seen a question exactly like this before?
        *   *Anxiety/Blank Responses:* The examples show a high rate of empty responses even for questions that might seem simple. This is a critical factor. Many students will simply write nothing.
        *   *Defining "Main":* Some might think of mining, tourism (common in Rajasthan) but fail to list two *main rural* occupations, or confuse them.

5.  **Re-evaluating based on challenges:**
    *   A significant portion will leave it blank due to anxiety, English difficulty, or simply not knowing. This *could* be 30-50% right there.
    *   Another portion might name one correct occupation, but not two, or struggle with the description part.
    *   Some might attempt the description but have very poor English making it unintelligible, even for simple concepts.
    *   *However*, Agriculture is extremely fundamental. It's almost guaranteed to be known. Animal husbandry is also very typical for Rajasthan. Naming these two isn't a high bar *if they know the terms in English and can recall them under pressure.*

6.  **Considering the low pass rates for similar-difficulty questions:**
    *   9-12% for explaining concepts ("Explain how colonial rule...", "Significance of Ashoka..."). These require deeper explanation and vocabulary.
    *   10% for "Why are lions shown...?" which is factual but requires some interpretation beyond simple naming.
    *   Our question is factual recall (names of occupations) + brief description. It's arguably *slightly easier* than "explaining significance" but potentially harder than simple one-word recall due to the "describe in brief" part.

7.  **Final Synthesis:**
    *   The "empty response" rate is a huge driver downwards.
    *   The difficulty of articulating a brief description in poor English is another factor.
    *   *However*, naming *two* common rural occupations in India (Agriculture, Animal Husbandry) is quite fundamental. Many students, even with limited English, might be able to recall these terms. The rubic allows "farming" and doesn't require "past
