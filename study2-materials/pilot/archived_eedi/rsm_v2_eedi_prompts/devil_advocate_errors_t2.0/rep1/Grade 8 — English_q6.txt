This is a very insightful prompt, highlighting the critical difference between what experts *think* students should know and what struggling students *actually* know, especially in a low-resource, English-as-a-second-language context.

Let's break down the potential difficulties for a Class 8 student in an Indian government school, with limited English and an average pass rate of 29%.

1.  **Vocabulary:** "Define" itself might be an issue for some. While common, in this context, even basic verbs can be stumbling blocks. "Fable" is a specific literary term. While it might have been introduced in a chapter, its definition isn't something they likely practice *writing* frequently.
2.  **Abstract vs. Concrete:** Defining an abstract literary term is harder than, say, writing about a hobby, even if that also proves challenging for them.
3.  **Specific Components of the Definition:**
    *   "Short story": They might understand "story" but adding "short" makes it more precise.
    *   "Typically uses animals as characters": This is a key element. Some fables don't *only* use animals (sometimes plants or inanimate objects with human qualities), but animals are dominant. They need to recall this.
    *   "Imparts a moral lesson": This is arguably the most crucial part. Do they understand "imparts" (unlikely) or "moral lesson"? "Moral" itself can be tricky.
4.  **Recall and Articulation:** Even if they *know* what a fable is when they hear it, articulating a clear, multi-part definition in English is a significant step up. The "Empty Response" common error from other questions is very relevant here. Exam anxiety and lack of practice with "definition" questions will play a role.
5.  **Curriculum Coverage:** Was "fable" taught explicitly, and was its definition memorized or practiced in writing? Given the low pass rates on questions requiring descriptions of writing styles or central ideas, this suggests that the deeper understanding of literary terms, beyond perhaps recognition, is weak.

Let's look at the "Common Errors" again:
*   "Describes the poet’s writing style." (4% pass rate) - Requires understanding abstract literary analysis and using descriptive language. "Define fable" is a simpler task *in terms of output*, but the *input knowledge* needed (a precise, multi-part definition) is similar in complexity.
*   "Write a theme or central idea..." (5% pass rate) - Again, identifying and articulating an abstract concept. This is very close to what's required for "moral lesson."
*   "Write a short paragraph... My Favourite Hobby." (10% pass rate) - This is a more personal, concrete topic, yet still gets very low scores, indicating basic English sentence construction issues and failure to follow instructions.

If students struggle with paragraph structure, basic vocabulary, and even writing about their hobbies, recalling and articulating a formal literary definition in full, correct English is an exceptionally difficult task. They might get one part, but the rubric requires "typically uses animals as characters *and* imparts a moral lesson."

My first instinct, based purely on the concept, might have been around 20-30%, thinking "fable is common enough." But *challenging that assumption* with the provided data:

*   The pass rate for *writing style* and *theme* is abysmally low (4-5%). Defining a literary term like "fable" requires similar cognitive and linguistic abilities to these questions, even if it's ostensibly "simpler" than analyzing style.
*   Even writing about a personal hobby only gets a 10% pass rate. This suggests a fundamental weakness in writing coherent sentences, which would severely impact the ability to produce a correct definition.
*   "Empty Response" is a significant error mode, suggesting students simply don't know or cannot articulate an answer under pressure.

Therefore, expecting them to articulate a precise definition encompassing *both* character type *and* purpose, in grammatically sound English, when they struggle with simpler tasks and even knowing what to say for complex ones, is highly optimistic. Many will get one part but miss the other, or offer a vague, incorrect response.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Given the incredibly low pass rates for comparable analytical and descriptive questions, the difficulty in articulating a precise multi-part definition in English, and the prevalence of "empty responses," I estimate this question to be extremely challenging for these students. It's likely only the very top students who are strong in English and have explicitly studied and memorized this definition would succeed.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 7%**
