Here's my analysis of why students would struggle with this question, even if it seems straightforward:

1.  **Language Barrier (English Comprehension):**
    *   "Gardener has collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit." - Fairly understandable.
    *   "Does gardener notice any change after some days?" - Also reasonably clear.
    *   "Give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health." - This is where it gets difficult.
        *   "Give reasons" - Requires not just an observation but an *explanation*. Many students struggle to articulate scientific reasons in English, especially those whose primary language of instruction isn't English.
        *   "Evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health" - "Evaluate" is a higher-order thinking verb. It requires students to make a judgment *and* justify it, connecting the process to a specific outcome ("soil health"). This abstraction is tough.
        *   "Beneficial for soil health" - Understanding "beneficial" and "soil health" in this specific scientific context (nutrients, organic matter) might be challenging. They might just know "good for plants."

2.  **Conceptual Gaps (Decomposition):**
    *   While "waste rots" is a general concept, understanding *why* it rots (microbes, decomposition) and the *result* (manure, humus, nutrients) is more specific.
    *   The sample errors provided earlier (e.g., "gobaer," "letrad") show a very basic, often misspelled or incorrectly understood concept related to waste or plant products, but not necessarily a scientific explanation of decomposition or its benefits.
    *   "Manure" might be known, but connecting it scientifically to soil health and articulating it in English is another hurdle.

3.  **Anxiety and Question Type:**
    *   This isn't a simple recall question. It demands observation, reasoning, and evaluation. This multi-part nature is difficult for students under exam pressure.
    *   Many students might offer a one-word answer like "Yes," but fail on "Give reasons" or "evaluate." The rubric specifically looks for "significant changes," implying a level of detail many won't reach.

4.  **Prior Exposure/Instruction:**
    *   Even if taught, was it taught in a way that allows them to articulate it *in English* with proper scientific terminology? Often, rote memorization or local language explanation doesn't translate well to spontaneous English writing.
    *   The examples show very confused and incomplete responses even for concepts that *might* have been covered.

**Challenging the Instinct:**
My first instinct might be "decomposition is basic science, students should know this." However, when I factor in:
*   Limited English proficiency ("evaluate," "beneficial for soil health")
*   Requirement for *reasoning* and *evaluation*, not just observation.
*   The documented difficulty with *all* similar Science questions (6-11% pass rates).
*   The quality of typical incorrect answers (mangled English, fundamental misunderstandings, empty responses).
*   The fact that the rubric asks for "significant changes" and not just "yes."

This question, demanding reasoned evaluation in English, will likely stump a vast majority. It requires synthesis of knowledge and expression beyond what most students at the 29% average pass rate for Class 8 in these schools can manage for *this type* of question.

**My calibrated estimate, considering the examples and caveats provided:**
