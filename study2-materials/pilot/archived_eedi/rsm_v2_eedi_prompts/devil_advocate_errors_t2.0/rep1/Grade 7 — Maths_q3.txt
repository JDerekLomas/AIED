Let's break this down.

**Initial Gut Reaction (and why it's likely wrong):**
My first instinct, based on having taken geometry, is "This is a super basic formula. Most Class 7 students would know it." Then I have to stop myself.

**Applying the 'Challenge Your Assumption' Criteria:**

*   **Limited English:** The question is straightforward in English ("Find the area... base is... height is..."). This specific wording might be familiar from textbooks or classwork. However, if a student is struggling with the concept of "area" itself, or "base" and "height" in English, they might falter. "Find the area" is a common command, though.

*   **"Basic" Concepts aren't basic for struggling learners:**
    *   **What *is* area?** Do all students conceptually understand what area represents? Some might just memorize a formula without grasping it.
    *   **Why 1/2?** Do they understand why it's half of base x height? Or is it just another part of a memorized string of symbols?
    *   **Remembering the formula:** This is the crux. While simple for many, it's one of *many* formulas students are expected to learn. For students struggling in math, formula recall can be a major issue, especially under exam pressure. Some might confuse it with the perimeter of a rectangle, or area of a rectangle.
    *   **Symbols vs. words:** "1/2 × base × height" is typically presented symbolically (A = 1/2 * b * h). Recognizing it from words and translating might be an extra step for some.

*   **Exam anxiety:** Always a factor. Even if they know it, panic can make a formula vanish.

*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** This question is very direct ("Find the area... whose base is X and height is Y"). This is a common drill question. However, if they *haven't* practiced it recently or repeatedly, or if their class just briefly covered it, recall will be poor. *The key here is whether the formula itself is easily recalled, not necessarily the exact setup of the word problem.*

*   **Average pass rate ~29%:** This is a huge piece of data. If the *overall* pass rate is this low, then "most students could do this" is highly improbable for any question that requires specific knowledge recall and application, especially when that knowledge might be weak. If students are struggling to pass exams overall, then remembering *one specific formula out of many* will be a significant challenge for a large portion of them.

**Re-evaluating based on the challenges:**

The rubric specifically asks about stating or using the *correct formula*.
*   **Students who get it wrong might:**
    *   Write `base x height` (area of a rectangle).
    *   Write `2 * (base + height)` (perimeter).
    *   Recall `1/2 * something * something` but not remember `base` and `height`.
    *   Write nothing at all.
    *   Recall the numbers but can't link them to a formula.

Given the overall pass rate, the high likelihood of poor English comprehension impacting understanding of "base" and "height" conceptually if not just as words, and the general difficulty many struggling students have with recalling precise formulas, a significant portion will not accurately reproduce this formula. It's often one of the first few geometry formulas learned, so maybe more familiar than others, but "familiar" doesn't mean "recallable" for a struggling learner.

I'm thinking if the average pass rate is 29%, a direct formula recall question for one of the *more common* geometry formulas might fare slightly better, but not dramatically.

If 29% pass the entire exam, how many will specifically remember one geometry formula without making an error?
*   Perhaps a core group that *does* pass (let's say 29%) would get this.
*   But within that group, some might fail *this specific question* for other reasons (anxiety, temporary lapse).
*   And outside that group, maybe 5-10% of those who *fail the exam overall* might *just barely* remember this particular formula, perhaps because it's been drilled more, or by pure luck.

I have to resist thinking "This is easy math" and focus on "Class 7, Indian government schools, economically weaker, limited English, 29% average pass rate." For many of these students, just memorizing things verbatim is tough, let alone understanding why it's a specific formula.

Let's imagine the top 30-40% of the class can access this. Maybe some near the middle too, but
