ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 7%

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

1.  **Complexity of the Question:** The question asks for a *causal link* ("how did it contribute"), not just a recall of facts. Students need to understand that the Battle of Plassey wasn't just a military victory but had direct *political consequences* (establishment of British dominance, puppet nawab). This level of understanding goes beyond simple memorization.

2.  **English Language Barrier:** "Contribute to the expansion" and "political dominance" are not simple terms for students with limited English. While "Battle of Plassey" and "British power in India" might be recognized, linking them in a coherent explanation is difficult.

3.  **Prior Performance on Similar Questions:** The provided examples of low pass rates for other Social Science questions ("Explain how colonial rule...", "Why are lions...", "Explain the significance of Ashoka's reign") are very telling. These also require explanation, historical understanding, and abstract concepts, similar to the Plassey question. The pass rates (9%, 10%, 12%) suggest a general difficulty with explanatory questions, especially for core historical events.

4.  **Common Errors in Social Science:** The common errors listed ("Empty Response," incoherent answers, simple fact recall without explanation) are highly likely to occur here. A student might remember "Battle of Plassey 1757" or "Robert Clive," but fail to connect it to the "expansion of British power" in a meaningful way according to the rubric.

5.  **Curriculum Coverage and Depth:** While the Battle of Plassey is a standard topic, the *depth* of understanding required to articulate its *contribution to political dominance* might not be thoroughly grasped by all students, especially those struggling or who missed specific lessons. They might learn *that* it happened and *who* won, but not fully *why* it was significant in establishing political control as per the rubric.

6.  **"Basic Concepts Aren't Basic":** The idea of a "puppet nawab" or "political dominance" being a direct consequence of a battle is not as self-evident as experts might assume, particularly for students who might view history more as a collection of events rather than interconnected causes and effects.

7.  **Teacher Overestimation Tendency:** A teacher might assume this is a fundamental concept well-covered. However, given the students' profile and the evidence of poor performance on *explanatory* questions, this assumption is likely optimistic.

Considering these factors, particularly the high percentage of "Empty Responses" and incoherent answers for similar explanation-based history questions, an estimate in the single digits seems more realistic than even the 29% average pass rate. The need to explain the *how* and relate it to "political dominance/control" specifically (as per the rubric) elevates its difficulty.
