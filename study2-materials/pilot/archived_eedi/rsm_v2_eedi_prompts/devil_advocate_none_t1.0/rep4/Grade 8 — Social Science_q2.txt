Let's break down the question and the target demographic:

**The Question:** "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

**Key Concepts/Vocabulary:**
*   "Describe" - requires more than just naming, implies a brief explanation.
*   "Key feature" - implies importance, not just any detail.
*   "Harappan Civilization" - specific historical period/culture.
*   "Urban planning" - specific concept (how cities are designed).

**Target Students (Class 8, Indian Government Schools, Economically Weaker Sections, Limited English, 29% average pass rate):**

1.  **English Proficiency:** This is a major hurdle.
    *   "Describe" might be understood, but "key feature" and especially "urban planning" are academic terms. "Urban planning" might be completely unknown or misinterpreted. They might understand "city design" but the formal term is difficult.
    *   Many might struggle to formulate a coherent sentence in English, even if they know the answer.

2.  **Subject Knowledge (Harappan Civilization):**
    *   Harappan Civilization is part of the Class 8 history curriculum. They *should* have been taught this.
    *   However, "taught" doesn't always equal "learned" or "retained," especially given the low pass rate.
    *   Topics like "drainage system," "grid layout," "baked bricks," "citadel" are all specific facts. They might remember one or two, or none.

3.  **"Basic" Concepts vs. Struggling Learners:**
    *   While "urban planning" might seem basic to an adult, for a student with limited background knowledge and English, it's abstract. They might just remember facts about Harappa (e.g., they made pots) but not categorize them under "urban planning."
    *   The features themselves (grid layout, drainage) are factual, but articulating them concisely and correctly under the "urban planning" umbrella is the challenge.

4.  **Exam Anxiety/Question Type:**
    *   A "describe" question requires more than recall; it needs expression.
    *   If they haven't practiced this exact phrasing, they might get flustered.

**Challenging My First Instinct:**

My first instinct might be "History is taught, they should know this." But then I force myself to think about:
*   **The student who barely reads English:** Can they decipher "urban planning"? Can they form a sentence like "The streets were laid out in a grid pattern"? This is a complex sentence structure for a struggling English learner.
*   **The student absent for this topic:** No chance.
*   **The student who remembers facts but not the *context*:** They might remember "drainage" but fail to connect it to "urban planning." They might just write "Drainage system" which might get partial credit but not full if it doesn't "describe."
*   **The "describe" verb:** Many might just list "Grid layout" or "Drainage system" without describing it. The rubric says "correctly describes." Simply listing might not be enough.

**Considering the Rubric:** "Correctly describes one key feature, such as the well-planned grid layout of streets, the advanced drainage system, the use of baked bricks, or the division of the city into a citadel and a lower town."

*   This is fairly lenient, allowing for multiple correct answers.
*   The "describes" part is still key. "Grid layout of streets" is a description. "Advanced drainage system" is a description. Just "Drainage" might be too short.

Given the average pass rate of 29% for *all subjects*, and the specific challenges of this question (academic English, abstract concept of "urban planning," need for descriptive answer), I anticipate a significant drop from general subject knowledge. Many might know a fact about Harappa but fail to articulate it correctly *in English* and *in the context of urban planning*.

My initial thought might have been 25-30%. But considering the English barrier and the need to *describe* a *specific type of feature* (urban planning), many will either misunderstand the question, struggle with English formulation, or simply recall an unrelated fact about Harappa.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

I'm going to go significantly lower than the general pass rate for this specific item. I think only a small segment will be able to handle the English, recall the specific information, and formulate a descriptive answer under the correct conceptual umbrella.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 15%**
