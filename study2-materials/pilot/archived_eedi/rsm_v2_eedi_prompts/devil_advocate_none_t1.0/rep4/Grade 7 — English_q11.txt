After challenging my assumptions, I estimate the proportion correct to be **15%**.

Here's my reasoning, specifically addressing the common pitfalls:

*   **"Adjective phrase" vs. "Adjective":** This is the biggest trap. Many students, even if they recognize "tiny" as an adjective, will be stumped by "adjective *phrase*." For a student with limited English and struggling with foundational grammar, the distinction between a word and a phrase is a significant hurdle. They might correctly identify "tiny" but fail to grasp why it's not a "phrase" in this context (as it's a single word). They might also incorrectly identify "a tiny bird" or "in our balcony" as the phrase.
*   **Limited English:** "Identify," "adjective," and "phrase" are all academic English terms. A student who "barely reads English" might understand "bird" and "nest" but struggle with the instructions themselves. They might simply point to a random word or leave it blank.
*   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic:** While adjectives are taught, the nuanced concept of an "adjective phrase" (especially when the "phrase" is just a single adjective) is often not deeply ingrained, especially for struggling learners. Many might only be familiar with simple identification of single adjectives.
*   **Lack of practice with exact question type:** Identifying a *phrase* versus a single *word* that functions as a phrase is a subtle distinction. If students have mostly practiced "identify the adjective," this slight variation will throw them off.
*   **Anxiety:** The complexity of the terminology and the subtle distinction required will undoubtedly trigger anxiety, leading to blank responses or random guesses.

My initial instinct might have been closer to 30-40% if I only focused on "Can they find the adjective?" But the inclusion of "phrase" and the specific context of economically weaker sections, limited English, and high anxiety dramatically lowers the probability of correctly navigating this specific grammatical nuance. Many might identify "tiny" but fail to understand why it doesn't fit the "phrase" instruction. And importantly, the rubric itself is problematic: "The student correctly identifies 'tiny' as an adjective." This implies that merely finding the adjective is enough, but the question explicitly asks for an "adjective *phrase*." This discrepancy further complicates things for the student. If the rubric *demanded* they explain why "tiny" acts as an adjective phrase (which it doesn't), the score would be even lower. Even with the forgiving rubric, the "phrase" part of the question is a major distractor and source of confusion.
