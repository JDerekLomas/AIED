Let's break down the question and the likely student experience.

**Understanding the Students:**
*   **Class 8, Indian Government Schools:** This means students are typically 13-14 years old.
*   **Economically Weaker Sections:** Limited access to supplementary materials, potentially less focus on academics at home, maybe first-generation learners.
*   **Limited English:** This is a *huge* factor. "How did... contribute to the expansion of..." is not simple English. "Political dominance" is a complex phrase.
*   **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is a critical baseline. It indicates that the system struggles to impart even "basic" knowledge effectively.
*   **Anxiety/Lack of Practice:** As noted, these are significant inhibitors.

**Analyzing the Question & Rubric:**

*   **"How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"**
    *   **"Battle of Plassey in 1757":** Many *might* recognize the name and year. It's a key historical event.
    *   **"contribute to the expansion of British power":** This is the tricky part. It requires understanding cause-and-effect, and the *nature* of that "contribution." Not just *what happened*, but *why it mattered*.
    *   **"in India":** Fairly straightforward.

*   **Rubric: "For explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)."**
    *   **"victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal":** This is the core concept. "Political dominance/control" is abstract. "Establishment" is a slightly advanced word. "Bengal" is specific.
    *   **"(e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)":** This is a very specific detail. If students remember this, they likely understand the political implications.

**Challenging My First Instincts:**

My immediate thought might be: "This is a fundamental topic in Indian history. They must have covered it."

But then, the self-correction:

1.  **English Barrier:**
    *   "Contribute to the expansion" -> Many might interpret this as just "What happened after Plassey?" rather than "How did Plassey *cause* power expansion?"
    *   "Political dominance/control" -> This is a high-level concept. A student with limited English might struggle to articulate it or even fully grasp its nuances beyond "British won."
    *   "Establishment" -> Could be missed.
    *   "Puppet nawab" -> While specific, if the surrounding context isn't clear in their mind due to English, they might write it without understanding its significance as *political control*.

2.  **Conceptual Difficulty:** Even if taught in their native language, "political dominance" is an abstract concept for a Class 8 student, especially one who struggles academically. Many might know *that* the British became powerful after Plassey, but struggle to articulate *how* or *why* in terms of political control, rather than just military victory. They might say "British became strong" or "British ruled India," which is too general to score.

3.  **Absenteeism/Teaching Quality:** Given the demographic, inconsistent attendance and varying quality of instruction are realities. A student absent on the day this "contribution" aspect was discussed, or taught by a teacher who also struggles with higher-order thinking explanations, would be at a severe disadvantage.

4.  **Exam Anxiety:** Even if they know it, putting it into coherent English under pressure is tough.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

*   **High achievers (rare in this group):** Yes, they'd get this.
*   **Average students (the "29% pass rate" group):** Many might remember "Plassey" and "1757" and "British won," but fail to articulate the *political dominance over Bengal* aspect. They might give a generic answer like "British became powerful" or "British started ruling India." These wouldn't get full marks according to the specific rubric.
*   **Struggling students:** Will likely not understand the question or the required depth of answer.

Considering the *average pass rate of 29% for the whole exam*, this particular question requires:
*   Recall of a specific historical event (Plassey, 1757).
*   Understanding its *consequences* (cause and effect).
*   Grasping the abstract concept of "political dominance/control over Bengal."
*   Articulating it in
