Let's break down the difficulty for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, considering the given factors:

*   **Economically weaker sections, limited English:** This is the biggest hurdle. "Blew" is an irregular verb, and "blown" is the past participle, which is a significant vocabulary leap for students with limited English. They might know "blow" but not its past participle, especially in this context.
*   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic:** Active/Passive voice is a fundamental grammar concept, but for students struggling with basic sentence structure and vocabulary, the transformation itself can be complex. Identifying the subject, verb, and object, then reorganizing them, and finally applying the correct form of "to be" and the past participle is a multi-step process.
*   **Irregular verb "blew" -> "blown":** This is a critical point. Many students, even if they grasp the concept of passive voice, will likely struggle with the past participle of "blow." They might use "blowed" or simply repeat "blew."
*   **"by the wind":** While essential for full credit, many might omit this or struggle with its placement.
*   **Exam anxiety:** Can cause students to rush, make simple errors, or simply freeze, especially if they are unsure about the past participle.
*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** Even if they've learned active/passive voice, this specific sentence with "blow" and the specific object "leaves" might be new.

My first instinct might be around 40-50% because it's a "basic" grammar rule. However, after applying the challenges:

*   The irregular verb "blew" to "blown" is a major trap.
*   Limited English proficiency means many won't know "blown."
*   The multi-step process of transformation is cognitively demanding for struggling learners.

Given an average pass rate of 29% for *all* questions, and this question requiring specific grammatical knowledge (passive voice structure) *and* knowledge of an irregular past participle (blown), it's likely to be harder than average for these students.
