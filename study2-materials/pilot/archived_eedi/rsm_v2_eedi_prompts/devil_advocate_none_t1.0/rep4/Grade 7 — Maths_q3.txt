Here's my thought process for calibrating the estimate:

1.  **Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):** My first thought, as someone with a good education, is "This is a basic formula. Most students *should* know this." This is exactly the kind of expert overestimation the prompt warns against. I'm forgetting the context.

2.  **Deconstructing the Prompt's Warnings:**
    *   **"Economically weaker sections with limited English."** The question is in English. While "base" and "height" might be somewhat familiar from math class, the overall sentence structure and the word "area" could be a hurdle for those with very low English proficiency. They might recognize the numbers `8` and `6` and "triangle," but struggle with the prompt itself.
    *   **"Average pass rate is about 29%."** This is a critical baseline. If the overall pass rate is so low, this question, even if "basic," isn't going to be dramatically higher unless it's exceptionally simple.
    *   **"Basic concepts aren't basic for struggling learners."** The formula `Area = 1/2 × base × height` requires understanding the concept of area, recognizing a triangle, and remembering a specific formula. It's not just "2 + 2."
    *   **"Exam anxiety causes blank responses."** Even if a student *might* know it, anxiety can shut them down.
    *   **"Many students have never practiced this exact question type."** While they might have learned the formula, seeing it presented *exactly* like this, with these specific words, might be unfamiliar. Or, they might have practiced it using diagrams, but not purely text.
    *   **"Absent for this topic?"** A significant portion of students will have missed instruction on this specific topic due to absenteeism, which is common in these settings.

3.  **Applying the Rubric:** The rubric is very specific: "States or uses the correct formula for the area of a triangle: `Area = 1/2 × base × height`." This means they don't even have to get the final numerical answer correct, *just recall the formula*. This is a slight positive, as it removes calculation errors from the "correct" criteria.

4.  **Considering the "Barely Reads English" Student:**
    *   They might recognize "triangle," "base," "height," "8," "6."
    *   The word "find" is probably accessible.
    *   "Area" is the key conceptual term they need to connect with the formula. If they don't understand "area," they won't trigger the right formula.
    *   They might just multiply `8 x 6 = 48`, or `8 + 6 = 14`, or even divide `8/6` or `6/8` because they see numbers and feel pressure to do *something*. Many students who don't know the exact formula will default to multiplying the given numbers in geometry problems.

5.  **Revisiting the "Absent for topic" student:** If they were absent, they simply won't know the formula. This alone pulls the percentage down significantly.

6.  **Estimating the Proportion:**
    *   If the average pass rate is 29%, this question is *probably* slightly easier than the average question that includes calculation and full understanding.
    *   However, the English barrier, the abstractness of "area" for struggling learners, and the memory recall of a specific formula are significant hurdles.
    *   The "1/2" part of the formula is often the most forgotten or incorrectly applied element. Students might remember `base x height` but forget the `1/2`. The rubric *requires* the `1/2`.
    *   Let's assume a portion of students will simply multiply `8 x 6`. They wouldn't get credit.
    *   A portion will be completely blank due to anxiety or not understanding the question.
    *   A portion will truly know the formula.

    Considering all these factors, I have to be very conservative. If 29% is the *average* pass rate for questions that might involve multiple steps, this single-step formula recall question might be slightly above average, but not by much due to the foundational issues.

    *   Maybe 10-15% will completely misunderstand or leave blank.
    *   Another 10-15% will try `base x height` but forget `1/2`.
    *   Another 5-10% might have other incorrect operations.
    *   Only a segment truly remembers the *full* formula and understands the question.

    If the average is
