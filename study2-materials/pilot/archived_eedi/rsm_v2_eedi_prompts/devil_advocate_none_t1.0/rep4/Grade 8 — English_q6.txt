Let's break down the question and the student profile.

**Question:** Define fable.
**Rubric:** Defines fable as a short story that typically uses animals as characters and imparts a moral lesson.

**Student Profile:**
*   Class 8 students in Indian government schools.
*   Mostly from economically weaker sections.
*   Limited English proficiency.
*   Average pass rate around 29% (overall, not just for English or this specific type of question).
*   High likelihood of forgetting, anxiety, and lack of exposure to exact question types.

**Challenging First Instincts:**

My first instinct might be: "Fable is a fairly common word. They've probably heard it. Many students will know it."

Now, let's apply the constraints:

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "Define" might be understood, but producing a coherent English definition is hard.
    *   Do they know "short story," "typically," "uses animals as characters," "imparts," "moral lesson"? These are several distinct concepts, each requiring a specific vocabulary.
    *   Many students might know "story with animals" or "story with a lesson," but struggle to combine them or use the correct formal language.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   While fables are introduced early, formal definitions are often not emphasized. Understanding a concept in a story is different from *defining* it.
    *   They might recognize a fable when they hear one, but articulate its key features in English? Much harder.
    *   Was this topic explicitly covered in English, or primarily in their local language literature class? If the latter, they'd struggle to translate the concepts into English.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** Even if they vaguely know, the pressure of an exam might lead to a blank or an incomplete/inaccurate response.

4.  **Lack of Practice:** Have they practiced *defining literary terms* in English? Likely not extensively. Their English curriculum might focus more on comprehension, grammar, or simple sentence construction, not formal definitions.

**Re-evaluating based on constraints:**

*   For full credit, they need to mention *short story*, *animals as characters*, and *moral lesson*. Missing one of these key components, or expressing it poorly in English, would result in 0.
*   The word "fable" itself might be familiar, but the nuances of its definition, especially articulated in English, will be challenging.
*   Many might give partial answers like "a story with animals" or "a story with a lesson," which wouldn't meet the full rubric for "define."
*   Considering the low overall pass rate (29%), this question is likely *more* difficult than average for these students due to its reliance on precise English vocabulary and conceptual recall in a formal definition format.

My initial thought might have been 20-30%, but after considering the language barrier, the need for *three specific components*, and the lack of practice with formal definitions, it's likely much lower. They might know *what a fable is* in their heads, but fail to articulate it correctly in English, to the standard of the rubric.

I'm going to lean towards a very conservative estimate. The combination of limited English, the demand for a precise multi-part definition, and the context of the school environment makes this a high-difficulty item.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **9%**
