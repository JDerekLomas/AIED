Let's break down the question and the student profile.

**Student Profile:**
*   **Class 6, Indian government schools:** This implies a wide range of academic abilities, with many struggling.
*   **Economically weaker sections:** Limited access to supplementary learning resources, potentially less exposure to English outside school.
*   **Limited English:** This is the *most critical factor*. "Some/any" distinction is grammatical, not conceptual. It relies on specific English usage.
*   **Average pass rate ~29%:** This is a very low baseline, indicating significant academic challenges across the board.
*   **Impact of teachers/experts overestimating:** This explicitly tells me to be conservative.

**The Question:**
"Choose the correct word. There are (some/any) apples in the basket."

**Analysis of Difficulty:**

1.  **Reading Comprehension:** The sentence structure is simple. "There are... apples in the basket." is understandable even with limited English.
2.  **Vocabulary:** "Apples," "basket" are basic.
3.  **Grammar - Some/Any:** This is where the difficulty lies for these students.
    *   **"Some"** is used for affirmative sentences and offers/requests.
    *   **"Any"** is primarily used for negative sentences and questions.
    *   This distinction is often taught explicitly but requires practice and exposure to solidify. For students with limited English, this subtle grammatical rule is often confused or forgotten, especially if their primary language doesn't have a direct equivalent or similar distinction.
    *   Many students might simply choose one based on sound or random guessing if they haven't internalized the rule.
    *   It's a common point of confusion even for slightly more advanced learners.

**Challenging My First Instinct:**

My first instinct *might* be to think, "This is basic English grammar, most Class 6 students should know this." However, applying the caveats:

*   **"Limited English"**: This rule is precisely what limited English speakers struggle with. They might know "some" and "any" as words, but not the specific grammatical context for their use.
*   **"Basic concepts aren't basic for struggling learners"**: This is a classic example. The "some/any" rule *is* basic, but it's often poorly understood or applied by those who aren't fluent.
*   **"Absent for this topic"**: If a student missed the specific lesson on "some/any" or didn't grasp it the first time, they'd likely get it wrong. Given the low pass rate, many likely fall into this category.
*   **"Never practiced this exact question type"**: While they might have seen "some/any" in lessons, if they haven't practiced multiple-choice selection in this specific grammatical context, it adds a layer of difficulty.

**Calibration:**

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for *all* questions, and the specific difficulty of "some/any" for ESL learners from economically weaker sections, I need to be conservative.

*   A significant portion will guess, giving a 50% chance if it's a true binary choice without prior knowledge. However, guessing isn't *knowing*.
*   I expect a segment of students to have learned and retained this rule.
*   I expect an even larger segment to be confused or to have forgotten it.

If the overall pass rate is 29%, a question that specifically tests a nuanced grammatical rule, even a "basic" one, for limited English speakers, is likely to be below or around the average. I don't see it as exceptionally difficult (like a complex reading passage or multi-step math problem), but it's not a trivial recognition task either.

I'd estimate that perhaps half of the students who might normally pass other questions could struggle with this specific grammatical nuance, or that many who *should* know it, will forget under exam conditions.

Let's think of it this way:
*   Perhaps 15-20% truly understand and apply the rule correctly.
*   Another 10-15% might get it right by chance (guessing 'some').
*   The remaining 60-70% will either guess incorrectly ('any') or genuinely not know.

Given the strong emphasis on "challenging first instinct" and "overestimation," I need to err on the lower side.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **35%**
