Let's break down the question and the likely student experience.

**Student Profile:**
*   Class 6, Indian government schools.
*   Mostly from economically weaker sections.
*   Limited English.
*   Average pass rate ~29%.
*   Exam anxiety, missed topics, never seen exact question type.

**Question Analysis:**

1.  **Reading Comprehension (English):**
    *   "At 10 am in the morning": Fairly straightforward.
    *   "temperature of Jodhpur was 30^0 C": Understandable.
    *   "If the temperature increases by 2^0 C per hour": "Increases by" and "per hour" are key. "Per hour" might be a stumbling block for some.
    *   "then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?": Again, fairly clear.

2.  **Mathematical Concepts:**
    *   **Time Calculation:** From 10 am to 4 pm. This involves understanding the difference between AM/PM and counting hours. This is the *specific rubric point* we're estimating for: "Calculates the time elapsed from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm as 6 hours."
    *   **Multiplication:** (hours * rate of increase)
    *   **Addition:** (initial temperature + total increase)

**Challenging Initial Instincts:**

My first instinct *might* be to think, "Calculating hours from 10 am to 4 pm is pretty basic for Class 6."

However, considering the constraints:

*   **Limited English:** While the numbers are clear, "per hour" might be interpreted as "each hour" but some might miss its significance. The main challenge for the *rubric point* is not so much English, but the time concept.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** Converting between AM/PM and understanding the elapsed time over the noon boundary (12 pm) can be surprisingly tricky for struggling learners.
    *   10 am -> 11 am (1 hr)
    *   11 am -> 12 pm (2 hr)
    *   12 pm -> 1 pm (3 hr)
    *   1 pm -> 2 pm (4 hr)
    *   2 pm -> 3 pm (5 hr)
    *   3 pm -> 4 pm (6 hr)
    Many students might count 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 and get 7 hours or struggle to count inclusively/exclusively. Some might just subtract 10 from 4 (mentally) and get a wrong answer or be confused by 4 being smaller than 10.
*   **Exam Anxiety:** Even if they know how to do it, anxiety can cause simple counting errors or prevent them from accessing this knowledge.
*   **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** They might have practiced "what time is it 3 hours after 10 am?" but not "how many hours between X and Y across noon?".

**Refined Estimate for *this specific rubric point* (calculating 6 hours):**

This is not asking for the final answer, just the time calculation.
Students who correctly identify the 6 hours have overcome a significant hurdle. They might still make errors in multiplication or addition, but this specific step requires understanding time.

*   A good number will get it wrong due to miscounting or AM/PM confusion.
*   Some will get it right by rote or simple counting.
*   The overall pass rate is 29%, and this is a foundational step.

I think a significant portion of students will struggle with the 10 am to 4 pm calculation, particularly crossing the 12 pm mark. They might get 5 hours, 7 hours, or be totally confused.

If the average pass rate is 29% for the *entire question*, then this *step* needs to be considered as part of that difficulty. This step is easier than the entire question, but still challenging.

Let's imagine the student tries to count:
10 to 11 (1)
11 to 12 (2)
12 to 1 (3)
1 to 2 (4)
2 to 3 (5)
3 to 4 (6) - This requires a structured approach.

Alternatively, subtracting from 12 and then adding:
12 - 10 = 2 hours (up to noon)
4 - 12 (pm) = 4 hours (after noon)
2 + 4 = 6 hours. This is
