Let's break this down, keeping the given constraints in mind.

**Initial instinct (and why it's probably wrong):** My first thought might be, "It's just asking for *a* word. Many students could probably find *one* word if they understood what 'writing style' means." This is the expert bias at play.

**Challenging the assumptions:**

1.  **"Describes the poet’s writing style."**
    *   **English Comprehension:** "Describes" is a common verb. "Poet's" and "writing" are common nouns. "Style" might be the sticking point. Do students understand "writing style" as a concept? Or will they interpret "style" literally (like "fashion style") or vaguely? Given limited English, "style" could be a very abstract concept for them in this context. They might understand "what the poet wrote about" rather than "how the poet wrote it."
    *   **Abstract Concept:** "Writing style" is an abstract concept. It requires analyzing *how* something is written, not just *what* is written. This is a higher-order thinking skill than simple recall.
    *   **Prior Exposure:** Have they been explicitly taught about "writing style" for poetry? Even if it's in the curriculum, remember the "absent for this topic" caveat. And even if taught, was it truly understood or just rote-learned definitions?

2.  **"Identifies a suitable and relevant word..."**
    *   **Vocabulary:** Even if they grasp "writing style," do they have the *vocabulary* to articulate it? Words like "descriptive," "informal," "direct," "simple" are relatively common, but not universally known, especially for those with limited English.
    *   **"Suitable and relevant":** This implies judgment. They can't just throw out *any* word. They need to select one that fits the poem (which isn't provided here, but would be in the actual test). This adds another layer of difficulty.
    *   **Context:** Without the poem itself, it's impossible to judge, but for the students, they would have to read a poem, *then* understand "writing style," *then* find an appropriate descriptive word.

3.  **Economically weaker sections, limited English, 29% average pass rate:**
    *   This is crucial. Many will struggle just to decode the question.
    *   The 29% average pass rate is a strong indicator that "basic" concepts are not basic. If the overall pass rate is so low, a question requiring abstract conceptual understanding *and* specific vocabulary *and* analysis of text is likely to be significantly below that average.
    *   Exam anxiety can lead to completely blank responses even if they have a vague idea.
    *   "Never practiced this exact question type" is important. They might have been asked "What is the poem about?" but not "Describe the poet's writing style."

**Re-evaluating based on challenges:**

*   Many students will misunderstand "writing style." They might describe the *content* of the poem (e.g., "sad," "happy," "about nature") instead of the *method*.
*   Even if they understand "style," they may lack the specific vocabulary to describe it effectively (e.g., they might know "good" or "bad" but not "descriptive" or "simple").
*   The abstract nature of the concept makes it harder than simple recall.
*   The overall low pass rate suggests that only a small segment of the students truly grasp these more nuanced English literature concepts.

Considering all this, it's highly unlikely that a large proportion would get this correct. I expect a significant drop from the average pass rate for this question type.

**My calibrated estimate:** I would place this significantly below the 29% average. Perhaps a quarter of those who pass the overall test might get this, or even fewer.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **12%**
