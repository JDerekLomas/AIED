Let's break down the thought process to arrive at a calibrated estimate.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):**

My first thought might be: "Harappan Civilization is a core topic in Indian history for Class 8. Urban planning is a major feature. Most students should know *something* about it." I might recall things like grid patterns, drainage, baked bricks from my own education. If I didn't challenge this, I might estimate 50-60%.

**Applying the "Challenge Your Assumptions" Filters:**

1.  **Limited English:** "Describe one key feature."
    *   "Describe" is a common verb, but "key feature" might be tricky for students with very limited English. They might know facts but struggle to articulate them in a descriptive sentence.
    *   "Harappan Civilization" is a proper noun, so that's likely okay, but the spelling itself can be a barrier if they are trying to write it out.
    *   What if they know about it in their local language but can't translate it into English?

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   While Harappan Civilization *is* a core topic, its depth of coverage varies widely. Some teachers might rush through it, or focus more on kings/dates than abstract concepts like "urban planning."
    *   A student who struggles with abstract thought might have difficulty distinguishing "features" of a civilization from general historical facts.
    *   Even if they learned "grid pattern," can they recall *why* it's a feature of urban planning?

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:**
    *   If a student sees "Describe" and "key feature" and doesn't immediately have a perfect English sentence in mind, they might just leave it blank rather than attempting a half-correct answer. This is a huge factor.
    *   The pressure of an exam, especially for low-performing students, can make them forget even things they vaguely knew.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   Many government school exams emphasize rote memorization and direct recall (e.g., "What was the capital of the Harappan Civilization?").
    *   "Describe one key feature" requires more synthesis and articulation. They might have memorized a list of facts but not practiced *describing* them in a coherent sentence.
    *   Even if they know "grid pattern" and "drainage system," constructing a grammatically correct, descriptive sentence in English is a different skill.

5.  **Absent for the Topic/Poor Teaching:**
    *   Given an average pass rate of 29%, it's highly probable that a significant number of students were absent when this topic was taught, or the teaching was ineffective/unengaging.
    *   A student who was absent for this topic, or whose teacher merely read from the textbook, will have no idea how to answer.

**Re-evaluating based on the challenges:**

*   **Low English Proficiency:** This is a major hurdle. Even if they know "grid," can they write "The streets were laid out in a grid pattern"? Or "They had a good drainage system"? Many will struggle with the sentence structure and vocabulary.
*   **Conceptual Understanding:** Knowing "Harappa" and "drainage" doesn't automatically mean they grasp "urban planning" or "key feature."
*   **Production vs. Recognition:** They might recognize a correct answer if given options, but producing it from memory, in English, is much harder.
*   **Pass Rate Context:** If the average pass rate is 29%, this means the *majority* of students struggle significantly across the board. This question isn't exceptionally easy within that context.

Considering all these factors, the number of students who can confidently, correctly, and articulately *describe* a key feature in English, within an exam setting, is likely much lower than initially thought. Many will have partial knowledge, poor English expression, or simply leave it blank.

A correct answer needs a clear description in English, like "They had a well-planned drainage system" or "Their cities had a grid-like street layout." "Drainage" on its own might be considered too vague without "system" or "advanced."

Given the 29% average pass rate, this question, while fundamental, is challenging due to the *delivery requirements* (English description) and the general academic struggles. I would expect a significant drop from what a well-prepared student could do.

If 29% is the *average* for passing, meaning some questions are easier and some harder, this question sits probably in the middle-to-hard range for the population *given the English and articulation requirements*.
