Let's break down the question and the context for Class 6 students in Indian government schools.

**Question:** "Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."

**Breakdown of difficulty:**

1.  **"Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan"**:
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Natural resources" might be a familiar term if taught recently, but for struggling learners, it might be vague. "Rajasthan" is a place name, generally known.
    *   **Recall:** Students need to recall specific resources *and* connect them to Rajasthan. Common ones like water are easy, but others like Marble, Copper, Gypsum might require more specific knowledge.
    *   **Number:** "Any two" is straightforward.

2.  **"and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."**:
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Explain" and "influences" are higher-order thinking verbs. "Lives of the people there" requires connecting the resource to human activity.
    *   **Conceptual understanding:** This is the trickiest part. It's not just naming; it's showing understanding of impact.
    *   **Articulation:** Even if a student understands, can they articulate it in basic English? For example, for "water," they might think "no water, people die" but struggle to phrase it as "Water scarcity affects agriculture, leading to migration and economic hardship." They might only manage "Less water, farming hard."

**Considering the constraints:**

*   **Limited English:** This is a major hurdle. Even simple explanations become difficult.
*   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic:** While "natural resources" is a fundamental topic, linking it specifically to a region and then explaining its *influence* requires deeper processing than just defining it.
*   **Exam anxiety:** The multi-part nature of the question (name two, then explain one) can increase anxiety.
*   **Lack of practice:** Have they specifically practiced questions like "explain how X influences Y in Z region"? Often, questions are more direct recall.
*   **Absent for topic:** Geography topics specific to states might be covered quickly.

**Challenging the first instinct:**

My first instinct might be "Most students would know water and maybe one other, and can say water is for drinking/farming."

*   **But:** "Explain how one of them influences the lives" is where the biggest drop-off will occur.
    *   Knowing "water" and "Rajasthan" is one thing.
    *   Knowing "water is for drinking" is another.
    *   Explaining *how* it *influences* (e.g., "Scarcity leads to difficult farming, so people move away, affecting income") is a much higher bar. Many will just state a use rather than an influence.

*   **Rubric:** "Mentions two correct natural resources." This is the only part that scores. The explanation part is essentially for understanding the cognitive load but doesn't contribute to the score of 1.

Given the rubric (Max score: 1 if *two correct natural resources* are mentioned), the difficulty lies only in the *recall and connection to Rajasthan* part. The explanation, while part of the prompt, doesn't contribute to the score based on the rubric provided. This significantly changes the estimate.

If the score was dependent on the explanation, the percentage would be much lower. But the rubric specifically states: "Mentions two correct natural resources (e.g., water, Marble, Copper, Sandstone, Gypsum, mica, limestone, zinc, salt, Sunlight for solar energy, Wind for wind energy). Max score: 1". This implies that *only* the naming of two resources is required to get the point.

Let's re-evaluate based *only* on the rubric: Can students name two natural resources found in Rajasthan?

*   **Water:** Highly probable for many students. Rajasthan = desert = water issues = water is a resource.
*   **Salt:** Sambhar Lake is famous. Likely known.
*   **Marble/Sandstone:** Very prominent in Rajasthan's architecture and economy.
*   **Solar/Wind energy:** If recent curriculum has covered renewable energy.
*   **Copper/Zinc:** These are major mining resources.

Even with limited English, "water" is often a known word. Connecting it to Rajasthan is also likely. For a second, "salt" or a common mineral like "marble" or "copper" could be recalled. The *explanation* part of the question might confuse some and make them overthink, but if they just list two resources, they get the point.

The *average pass rate of 29%* gives a baseline. This question, *if only
