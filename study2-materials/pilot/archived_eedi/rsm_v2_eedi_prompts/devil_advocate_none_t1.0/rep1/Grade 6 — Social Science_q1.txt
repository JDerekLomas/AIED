Let's break this down using the provided insights to calibrate the estimate.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**
My first thought might be, "Himalayas is so famous, almost everyone would know it. Maybe Aravalli too." This would lead to a high estimate, perhaps 60-70%.

**Challenging Assumptions based on Instructions:**

1.  **Limited English:** "Name any two..." is simple enough, but some students might struggle even with "major mountain ranges" if their English vocabulary is extremely limited. However, "Himalayas" is often learned as a proper noun, almost like a separate concept, even with limited English.
2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   **Himalayas:** This is likely the *most* known geographical feature of India. It's almost certainly taught early and repeatedly in social studies/EVS. Even students who miss a lot might pick this up through osmosis.
    *   **Other Ranges (Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Ghats):** These become progressively less "basic" for struggling learners. While taught, a student absent for a few classes or with poor retention might easily forget them. For someone barely reading English, distinguishing between these names and recalling them on the spot is a challenge.
3.  **Exam Anxiety:** Forgetting names, even somewhat familiar ones, is common under pressure.
4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** While naming geographical features is common, specifically "any two major mountain ranges" might not have been rehearsed verbatim.

**Re-evaluating with Calibration:**

*   **Himalayas:** A very high percentage of students (perhaps 50-60% or even more) should be able to recall "Himalayas." It's almost a given.
*   **A Second Range (for the 0.5 score):** This is where the difficulty spikes significantly.
    *   To get *any* score, they just need one. So, students who only know Himalayas will get the 0.5.
    *   The question asks for "any two," but the rubric says "Names one correct mountain range." This is crucial. It means if they only list "Himalayas," they get the 0.5.
    *   The "average pass rate is about 29%" is a strong indicator. If this question were the *only* question, and it was binary (0 or 1), a 29% pass rate would suggest that only 29% *would attempt and get the full score on a question of average difficulty*. Here, the question is quite specific.

*   **Focus on the Rubric:** "Names one correct mountain range." This significantly lowers the bar for getting *some* credit. If the question required *two* correct answers to get *any* credit, the percentage would be much lower.

Considering that the average pass rate is 29% for a whole exam, and this is a relatively straightforward recall question for *one* name:

*   Many students will know "Himalayas." Let's say 45-50% will confidently recall "Himalayas."
*   Fewer will recall a second name if pushed for it, but for *this rubric*, knowing just Himalayas is enough.
*   The "barely reads English," "absent for topic," and "exam anxiety" factors will pull down even the "Himalayas" recall for a segment of the student population.

Let's imagine the student pool:
*   **Strong Learners (20%):** Will easily recall Himalayas and likely a second (Aravalli/Ghats). Score 0.5.
*   **Mid-level Learners (30%):** Will likely recall Himalayas. Might struggle for a second, but since only one is needed for 0.5, they get it. Score 0.5.
*   **Struggling Learners (30%):** Might recall Himalayas with some effort, or might just have heard it. Some will forget due to anxiety or lack of retention. Some won't know it at all. Let's say 1/3 of this group recalls Himalayas. Score 0.5.
*   **Very Weak/Absent (20%):** Unlikely to recall anything. Score 0.

So,
*   Strong: 20%
*   Mid-level: 30%
*   Struggling (1/3 of them): 10%
Total: 20 + 30 + 10 = 60% *if* the bar was just "knowing the Himalayas."

However, we must calibrate against the 29% average pass rate
