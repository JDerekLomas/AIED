ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **40%**

Here's my reasoning, challenging initial instincts:

1.  **Initial Instinct:** My first thought was "This is quite simple, maybe 60-70%."
2.  **Challenging "Simple":**
    *   **Limited English:** While the words themselves are common, sentence structure is a leap. "He is reading a book" seems natural to a native speaker or someone with consistent English exposure. For someone with "limited English," they might understand each word ("he," "book," "reading") but struggle to assemble them into a grammatically correct sentence, especially if their regional language structure is different.
    *   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** Subject-verb-object (SVO) is fundamental in English, but it's *taught*. If a student was absent when this was explicitly taught, or if the teaching wasn't effective (e.g., rote memorization without understanding), they might struggle. "Is" can be particularly tricky for non-native speakers to place correctly as a linking verb/auxiliary.
    *   **Anxiety:** A student who feels pressure and isn't confident in English might just put words down randomly or stare blankly.
    *   **Lack of Practice:** "Never practiced this exact question type" is crucial. They might have learned SVO, but if they haven't explicitly practiced *rearranging scrambled words*, it's a new challenge that tests their application of the rule, not just memorization. They might try to construct a sentence that makes *some* sense, but not necessarily the *grammatically correct* one.
    *   **Common Errors:** I can imagine students putting: "He reading is a book" or "Book is he reading a" if they're just trying to group related words or following a different internal logic.

3.  **Calibrating Down:**
    *   The "average pass rate of 29%" for these students is a strong anchor. While this question isn't a full comprehension passage, it does require application of learned English grammar.
    *   It's *not* a "fill in the blank" or "choose the correct word," which might be easier. It requires constructive thinking and recall of sentence structure rules.
    *   Even for seemingly simple grammar, a significant portion of struggling learners will falter. If they consistently struggle with comprehension (implied by the 29% pass rate), constructing a sentence is a higher-order skill for them.

Therefore, while it's a very common sentence structure, the unique challenges of this student demographic, coupled with the nature of the task (rearranging, not just recognizing), leads me to estimate 40%. It's above the average pass rate, indicating it's somewhat accessible, but far from universally mastered.
