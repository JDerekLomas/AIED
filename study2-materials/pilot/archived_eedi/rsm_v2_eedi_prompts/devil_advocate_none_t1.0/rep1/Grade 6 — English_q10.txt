After careful consideration and challenging my initial assumptions, I'm adjusting my estimate significantly downwards.

My initial thought, as a native English speaker, was that this is a very basic concept, and most students would get it right. However, applying the provided context and warnings:

*   **Limited English:** While "some" and "any" are common words, understanding their nuanced usage in affirmative vs. interrogative/negative sentences is a higher-level grammatical concept than just knowing individual word meanings. Many students will struggle with the *rule*, even if they know the words.
*   **"Basic" isn't basic:** This isn't just about identifying a noun or verb. It's about a specific grammatical structure. If this topic wasn't explicitly taught and practiced, or if the student was absent, it's not intuitive.
*   **Exam Anxiety:** Even if they've seen it, anxiety can make them second-guess or freeze.
*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** This is crucial. They might have been exposed to sentences with "some" or "any," but filling in the blank with a choice between the two requires analytical application, not just recognition.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for this demographic, and knowing that teachers/experts *overestimate*, this question, while seemingly simple, hits several common pitfalls. Many students will guess, and some will pick "any" because they've heard it used in other contexts. The lack of exposure to varied sentence structures and the precise rules for "some" vs. "any" will be a significant barrier.

My revised estimate is that this question is harder than it appears for this specific group.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **35%**
