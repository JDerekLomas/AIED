After challenging my assumptions and considering the context:

*   **Limited English:** "Blew" and "blown" are irregular verbs. While "blow" is common, "blown" in its past participle form might not be universally recognized or readily produced, especially with the nuance of passive voice. The overall sentence structure change requires understanding grammatical roles.
*   **"Basic" Concepts aren't Basic:** Active/Passive voice transformation is a specific grammatical concept. While taught, retention can be low, especially for students who struggle with foundational English. Many might not have fully grasped the concept or seen enough practice to internalize it.
*   **Exam Anxiety:** For a student already struggling, seeing a grammar transformation question can be intimidating, leading to guessing or leaving it blank, even if they have a vague idea.
*   **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** While active/passive voice is taught, the *specific* sentence or the exact wording of the question (e.g., "change from active to passive voice") might be unfamiliar or less practiced than other types of questions. The phrase "by the wind" at the end is crucial for a complete transformation, and some students might omit it.
*   **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is a strong indicator of overall academic struggle. If the average pass rate across all subjects is low, it suggests a significant portion of students are not consistently mastering concepts.

My initial instinct might be higher, assuming this is a fairly standard grammar topic. However, remembering the "barely reads English" and "struggling learner" perspectives brings the estimate down significantly. Students might attempt it, but getting all components (subject-object inversion, correct auxiliary verb, correct past participle, and retaining the agent "by the wind") perfectly correct is a multi-step challenge.

A common error would be "The leaves blown away by the wind" (missing "were") or "The leaves was blown away by the wind" (subject-verb agreement error with "was" instead of "were"). Some might struggle with "blown" and put "blewed" or another incorrect form. Others might simply rewrite the active sentence or make a minor change.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **15%**
