Let's break down the thinking process, challenging assumptions:

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**
* "Fable is a pretty common word, taught early."
* "Most students would have encountered Aesop's Fables."
* "The definition isn't complicated."
* *Initial estimate might be 40-50%*

**Challenging Assumptions - The Reality Check:**

1.  **"Fable is a common word":**
    *   **Reality:** Common in *English-speaking households/schools*. For students with limited English from non-English speaking homes, it might be a *school-only* word. Even then, the *definition* in English might be forgotten or never fully internalized. They might recognize the sound but not be able to articulate the meaning.
    *   **Analogy:** Imagine asking me to define a complex term in a language I've only studied for a few years. I might recognize it, but defining it precisely is hard.

2.  **"Most students would have encountered Aesop's Fables":**
    *   **Reality:** They might have heard the *stories* (e.g., The Thirsty Crow, The Lion and the Mouse) in their native language or even simple English. But were they explicitly taught, "This *type* of story is called a 'fable' and here is its definition"? And were they asked to *define* it? Often, the focus is on the story and the moral, not the literary term itself.

3.  **"The definition isn't complicated":**
    *   **Reality:** Look at the rubric: "short story," "typically uses animals as characters," "imparts a moral lesson."
        *   "Short story": Okay, relatively simple.
        *   "Typically uses animals as characters": This is a key distinguishing feature. Will all students remember "typically" or just "animals"? Will they articulate "characters"?
        *   "Imparts a moral lesson": "Imparts" is a slightly more formal verb. "Moral lesson" is a common phrase, but articulating it clearly and connecting it to the story type is the challenge.
    *   To get full marks, they need *all three* core components. Many might get one or two, but miss the third, or struggle with the precise phrasing.

4.  **Limited English Proficiency:**
    *   Even if they understand the *concept* of a fable in their mind (a story with animals and a lesson), can they translate that into a clear, concise English definition? This is a huge barrier. They might use fragments, incorrect grammar, or simpler words that don't fully capture the rubric's requirements.

5.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   This is a literary term. For students struggling with basic reading comprehension, remembering and defining specific literary terms is a higher-order skill. If their foundation is shaky, this will be difficult.

6.  **Exam Anxiety/Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   Many students learn by rote. If they haven't specifically memorized the definition of "fable" or practiced *defining* literary terms, they will struggle. Anxiety can make them forget even what they vaguely know.

**Calibrated Re-evaluation:**

*   Considering the average pass rate is 29% for *all* questions, this specific question is asking for a precise definition in English.
*   The "animals" and "moral" parts are crucial. Many might get "animals" but miss the moral, or vice-versa, or struggle to link them both precisely.
*   The English language demand is high for a precise definition.
*   Even if they vaguely know what a fable is, articulating it according to the rubric's standard is tough.

Given all these factors, my initial instinct was too high. This question requires a specific, multi-part definition in good English from students who are generally struggling with English and foundational concepts.

**Final Estimate:** I would expect a significant drop from the average pass rate, as this is a specific definition question rather than a multiple-choice or simpler recall task.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 15%**
