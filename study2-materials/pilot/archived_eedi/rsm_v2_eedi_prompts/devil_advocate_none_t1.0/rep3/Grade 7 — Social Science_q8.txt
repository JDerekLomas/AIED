Let's break down the question and the student profile.

**Student Profile:**
*   Class 7, Indian government schools.
*   Mostly from economically weaker sections.
*   Limited English proficiency.
*   Average pass rate for similar students: ~29%.
*   Prone to exam anxiety.
*   May not have practiced this exact question type.
*   Could have missed relevant lessons.
*   "Basic" concepts are not basic for them.

**Question Analysis:**
"What are the main occupations of people in the rural areas of Rajasthan? Describe any one in brief."
*   **Part 1: Identifying occupations.** Requires knowledge of Rajasthan's rural economy. Agriculture and Animal Husbandry are the most prominent and commonly taught. Handicrafts could also be mentioned.
*   **Part 2: Describing one in brief.** If they can name one, describing it (e.g., "farming means growing crops like wheat and bajra") should be relatively straightforward conceptually, *if* they understand the English terms.
*   **Keywords:** "main occupations," "rural areas," "Rajasthan," "describe."

**Challenges for the Students:**
1.  **English Comprehension:** "Occupations" might be a known word, but "main," "rural areas," and "describe in brief" could be tricky. "Rural" versus "urban" might not be firmly established, especially if their exposure is limited.
2.  **Recall of Specifics:** While agriculture and animal husbandry are fundamental, recalling them in an exam setting, with limited English, can be difficult. They might know *what people do* but struggle to put the *correct English terms* to it.
3.  **Contextual Knowledge (Rajasthan):** While these are general for rural India, specifically linking them to "Rajasthan" adds a layer. If the lesson was very general, they might not immediately make the specific connection.
4.  **Two-Part Question:** Students might answer the first part but struggle with the second, or vice-versa. The rubric only requires *naming two* for the max score, which simplifies it slightly.
5.  **Memorization vs. Understanding:** They might have memorized "agriculture" but not truly grasp its scope or be able to briefly describe it.
6.  **"Basic" but not "Basic":** For a student from an agricultural background, "agriculture" might seem obvious. But for a student whose family does something else, or who struggles with academics, it's just another word to learn and recall.

**Recalibrating:**

My first instinct might be: "Most kids in rural India would know what people do for a living in villages, so they'd get this."
However, the caveats hit hard:
*   "Limited English" - Can they read "occupations" and "rural areas" correctly?
*   "Basic concepts aren't basic" - The *terms* "agriculture" and "animal husbandry" might not be readily available in their productive vocabulary, even if they understand the concepts.
*   "Never practiced this exact question type" - This can throw students off.
*   "Exam anxiety" - Simple recall can become impossible under pressure.
*   "Absent for topic" - This is always a significant factor in government schools.

Considering the rubric only requires naming *two main occupations correctly* for a max score of 1, this slightly lowers the bar. They don't *have* to describe one accurately to get the point, just name two. This is key.

If they can recall "farming" and "rearing animals" (or "animal husbandry"), they get the point. "Farming" is a relatively common word.

Given an average pass rate of 29% on *similar* questions, and factoring in the specific challenges for this question, I need to be cautious. The recall of *terms* in English is the biggest hurdle.

Perhaps a student can write "kheti" (Hindi for farming) or draw a picture, but that won't get them the mark. They need the English words.

Let's think of how many students would likely get *at least two* of these terms correctly:
*   Agriculture/Farming
*   Animal Husbandry/Pastoralism
*   Handicrafts (less likely to be the first two remembered)

I think a significant portion would recall "farming." Many might also recall "animal rearing" or "animal husbandry." The key is *two*.

I'll lean slightly above the average pass rate for *this specific question* because the concepts are very fundamental to their lived experience, even if the English terms are a struggle. The rubric being lenient (just naming two) helps.

Let's assume:
*   10-15% will struggle with English comprehension entirely
