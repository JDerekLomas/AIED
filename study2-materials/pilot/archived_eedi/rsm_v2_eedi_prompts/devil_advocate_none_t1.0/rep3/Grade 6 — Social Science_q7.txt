Let's break this down using the provided rubric and critical thinking points.

**Rubric:** Mentions two correct natural resources (e.g., water, Marble, Copper, Sandstone, Gypsum, mica, limestone, zinc, salt, Sunlight for solar energy, Wind for wind energy).
Max score: 1

**Critical Thinking Application:**

*   **Limited English:** The question uses "Mention," "natural resources," "explain," and "influences the lives." While these aren't highly complex, "natural resources" might be a specific term they've learned, but "influences the lives" requires a slightly more nuanced understanding and expression than just listing.
*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** "Natural resources" itself is a core concept, but for a Class 6 student from EWS with limited exposure, the *recall* and *application* of this concept in a specific regional context (Rajasthan) might not be universal. They might know "water" and "sand" but connect them explicitly as "natural resources of Rajasthan" is another step.
*   **Exam Anxiety:** For a student already struggling, this type of open-ended question can be daunting. Even if they know *some* resources, the pressure to "explain how one influences lives" might lead to a blank or incomplete answer.
*   **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** While they might have learned about natural resources, practicing *this exact formulation* (mention two, explain influence of one) might be less common than simply listing resources. The "explain how it influences lives" part is the more challenging component.

**Initial Instinct vs. Challenged Instinct:**

*   **Initial Instinct:** Many Class 6 students should know about water, sand, or maybe even marble/copper as resources in Rajasthan. Explaining the influence of water (for farming, drinking) seems straightforward. So, perhaps 40-50%.
*   **Challenged Instinct (Applying Constraints):**
    *   **"Mention any two natural resources":** This part is likely achievable for a good portion, maybe 50-60%. Water and sand are very obvious.
    *   **"and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":** This is where the difficulty spikes significantly.
        *   They need to understand "influences the lives."
        *   They need to articulate this influence in basic English.
        *   Even if they know water is for farming, expressing "Water is used for irrigation, helping farmers grow crops and earn a living" is a step beyond just "water = farming."
        *   For resources like marble or copper, explaining their influence (e.g., providing jobs in mining/crafts, building materials) requires more specific knowledge and expression.
    *   **Rubric:** The rubric gives max score for *just mentioning two resources*. This is critical. The *explanation* part of the question is not part of the scoring. This changes things dramatically!

**Re-evaluating based *only* on the rubric:**

The rubric states: "Mentions two correct natural resources... Max score: 1". It *does not* require the explanation to be correct or even attempted for a score of 1.

Therefore, the question simplifies to: "Can a student name two natural resources of Rajasthan?"

*   **Water:** Almost universally known.
*   **Sand:** Given Rajasthan's desert landscape, this is also highly likely.
*   **Marble/Stone:** Rajasthan is famous for this, many students might know it.
*   **Sunlight (for solar energy):** Given the government's push, some might be aware.
*   **Salt:** From Sambhar Lake.

Considering the average pass rate is 29%, this is a relatively *easier* question *if you strictly adhere to the rubric*. However, students often overthink and might *try* to explain, wasting time, but the score hinges only on the first part.

If a student just writes "Water, Sand" or "Water, Marble," they get the point.

Given the low pass rate average of 29%, and the simplicity of just naming two resources, this question should be on the higher end for students who understand what a "natural resource" is. The challenge is the English comprehension of "natural resources of Rajasthan."

Let's assume:
*   20-30% might not understand "natural resources" at all or fail to connect it to Rajasthan.
*   Another 10-15% might only name one.
*   But a significant portion, perhaps around half, should be able to recall two common resources like water, sand, or marble.

The fact that the *explanation* is not required for the point dramatically increases the potential success rate. If the explanation was required
