Let's break down the question and the target audience.

**The Question:** "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning."

**Key Concepts Required:**
*   **Harappan Civilization:** Recognition of the term, recall of its historical context.
*   **Urban Planning:** Understanding what this phrase means (how cities were designed and built).
*   **Key Feature:** Ability to identify a defining characteristic, not just a minor detail.
*   **Describe:** Ability to articulate the feature in a coherent sentence or two.

**Target Audience (Class 8 Indian Government School Students, Economically Weaker Sections, Limited English):**

1.  **Limited English:** This is a major hurdle.
    *   "Describe" might be understood, but "key feature" could be tricky. "Urban planning" is a relatively advanced term. Many might not grasp its full meaning, even if they've heard it. They might interpret it more generally as "how Harappan cities were."
    *   Formulating a description in English will be challenging for many. Even if they know the feature, expressing it correctly could be a barrier.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   While Harappan Civilization is typically covered in Class 6-8 history, retention rates for specific details like "urban planning features" can be low, especially if not reinforced.
    *   "Grid layout," "drainage system," "baked bricks," "citadel and lower town" are specific terms. Students might remember "Harappa had good drainage" but struggle to articulate it formally or connect it explicitly to "urban planning."

3.  **Exam Anxiety:** Can easily lead to blanks even if some knowledge is present.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** While descriptive questions are common, one specifically asking for a "key feature of urban planning" might not have been practiced extensively, especially if the topic was rushed.

5.  **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is a crucial anchor. It tells us that, on average, students struggle significantly. This question, while not overtly complex, requires recall of specific historical detail and English articulation.

**Challenging My First Instincts:**

*   **Initial thought:** "Harappan Civilization is a core topic, they must know this."
*   **Re-evaluation:** Knowing *of* the Harappan Civilization is different from recalling a *specific key feature of its urban planning* and *describing it in English*. Many students might remember "Harappa" and "Indus Valley" but struggle with the details.
*   **Consider the "barely reads English" student:** They might pick up on "Harappan Civilization" but "urban planning" would likely be a complete blocker. Even if they remembered "good drainage," translating that into a clear, rubric-matching description in English is a high bar.
*   **Consider the "absent for this topic" student:** This is highly probable given attendance issues.
*   **Consider the "memorized but didn't understand" student:** They might have rote-learned a few points but struggle to apply them to "urban planning."

**Estimating:**

*   The 29% pass rate indicates a very high proportion of students struggle with even basic questions.
*   This question requires: historical recall of specific details, understanding relatively sophisticated English vocabulary ("urban planning," "key feature," "describe"), and the ability to articulate an answer in English.
*   Given the multiple layers of difficulty for this specific demographic, the success rate for *this particular question* would likely be lower than the overall average pass rate.

I would estimate that a significant portion of the students who generally pass might still struggle with the specificity and English demands of this question.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **18%**
