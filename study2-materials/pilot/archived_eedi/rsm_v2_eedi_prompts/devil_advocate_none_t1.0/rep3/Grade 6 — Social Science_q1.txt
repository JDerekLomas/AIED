Let's break down the question and the student profile.

**Student Profile:**
*   Class 6, Indian government schools.
*   Economically weaker sections.
*   Limited English proficiency.
*   Average pass rate ~29%.
*   Vulnerable to exam anxiety, gaps in learning, lack of practice.

**Question Analysis:**
*   "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."
*   **Key terms:** "major mountain ranges," "located in India."
*   **Task:** Recall and name.
*   **Rubric:** 0.5 points for *one* correct range. This simplifies the task significantly, as they don't need two for a partial score.

**Initial Instinct vs. Challenged Assumption:**

*   **Initial Instinct:** "Himalayas are super famous, everyone knows them. Aravallis are also well-known, especially in the north. Many students should get at least one." -> Maybe 40-50%
*   **Challenging Assumptions:**
    *   **Limited English:** While "mountain" is likely understood, "ranges" might be less common. "Major" could also be a barrier.
    *   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** Geography might be taught in local languages. Recalling the *English names* of geographical features, especially if the topic was covered briefly or if they were absent, is difficult.
    *   **Exam Anxiety:** Even if they know it, under pressure, they might forget the English name, or panic and leave it blank.
    *   **Never practiced this exact question type:** They might have identified mountains on a map, but recalling names directly might be less practiced.
    *   **Focus on one correct name for partial credit:** This is a big help. They don't need to recall two. "Himalayas" is arguably the most recognized.

**Re-evaluating based on challenges:**

1.  **Himalayas:** This is the strongest candidate. It's geographically prominent and taught widely. However, the English name might still be a hurdle for some.
2.  **Other ranges (Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Ghats):** These are less universally known by Class 6 students across *all* of India, especially if they are not from those specific regions. While taught, the *recall* in English is the issue.
3.  **Language barrier:** "Name any two" is straightforward enough, but the target words (Himalayas, Aravalli, etc.) themselves need to be recalled in English. If they learned it as "हिमालय" (Himalaya) in Hindi, writing "Himalaya" might be a stretch for some.
4.  **Learning Gaps:** Given the 29% pass rate, a significant portion of these students are struggling. They might have missed the topic, not understood it, or simply not retained the information.

Considering the *low average pass rate* (29%) for the entire exam, this single question, while seemingly easy, is still a recall task in a foreign language for many struggling learners. The fact that they only need *one* correct name for the partial score is the saving grace.

I think the proportion that can recall even one correct name in English will be significantly lower than what a teacher would expect. Many might recall one in their local language but fail to translate, or simply not remember.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Given the student profile, the limited English, the high probability of learning gaps, and the general low pass rate, I'd expect fewer than half of them to correctly recall even one mountain range in English. The "Himalayas" is the most likely answer, but even that isn't a guaranteed recall for a struggling Class 6 student under exam conditions.

My previous instinct of 40-50% feels too high. I'll drop it significantly.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 25%**
