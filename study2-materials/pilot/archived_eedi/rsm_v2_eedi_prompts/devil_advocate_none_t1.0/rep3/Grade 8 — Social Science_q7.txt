Let's break down the question and the context.

**Question Analysis:**
*   **Keywords:** "Battle of Plassey," "1757," "contribute," "expansion of British power," "India."
*   **Concept:** Cause and effect – how a specific historical event led to a broader trend.
*   **Required knowledge:**
    *   Knowing *what* the Battle of Plassey was (a British victory).
    *   Knowing *when* it happened (1757).
    *   Understanding its *immediate consequence* (control over Bengal, puppet nawab).
    *   Connecting this immediate consequence to the *larger trend* of British power expansion.

**Student Context (Class 8, Indian Government Schools, EWS, Limited English):**

*   **English:** This is a major barrier. The question uses terms like "contribute," "expansion," "political dominance," "establishment." Even if students know the history, expressing it in correct English can be tough.
*   **Historical Knowledge:**
    *   The Battle of Plassey is a foundational event taught in Indian history. They *should* have covered it.
    *   However, depth of understanding varies greatly. Simply knowing "British won" might not be enough to explain the *contribution to expansion*.
    *   Rote learning is common. Can they recall specific details like Mir Jafar being a puppet nawab, or articulate the shift from trading power to political power?
*   **Conceptual Understanding:** "Expansion of British power" requires understanding imperialism, political control, and economic exploitation. These are abstract concepts.
*   **Exam Anxiety:** Can easily lead to blanks or incomplete answers, even if they have some knowledge.
*   **Practice:** "Explaining how X contributed to Y" is a common question type, but specific practice with *this exact phrasing* and *this level of detail* might be lacking for many.
*   **Absenteeism/Learning Gaps:** Many students will have missed topics or not fully grasped them due to various reasons.

**Challenging First Instincts:**

My first instinct (as someone who studied this in school) might be, "This is a basic history question, they should know it."

*   **Re-evaluation:**
    *   **English Barrier:** A student who "barely reads English" would struggle immensely with the vocabulary, let alone formulating a coherent answer. "Contribute" is not a simple verb. "Expansion" is abstract.
    *   **"Basic" Concepts:** While the event is basic, the *nuance* of explaining *how* it led to *political dominance* and *expansion* is not basic for a struggling learner. Many might recall "British won and got rich," but connecting it to "political dominance via a puppet nawab" is a step deeper.
    *   **Specifics vs. General:** The rubric requires explaining "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)." This isn't just "they won and became more powerful." It requires a specific mechanism.
    *   **Passing Rate (29% average):** This is a critical piece of data. If the average pass rate is 29% across *all* subjects and questions, a question requiring specific historical detail, conceptual understanding, and good English articulation is likely to be below that average.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

Considering the significant English barrier, the need for specific historical detail (puppet nawab), conceptual understanding (political dominance, expansion), and the low overall pass rate, I believe the proportion correct would be quite low. Many might know *of* Plassey, but few will articulate its contribution to *political dominance via specific mechanisms* in comprehensible English.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **12%**
