Let's break down the challenge here.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):** My first thought might be, "It's a simple comprehension question. They just pick a line and say why. Most should get this, maybe 60-70%."

**Challenging the Instinct based on the provided context:**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"
    *   "Which," "line," "from," "poem," "like," "most," "and," "why." All are common words, but for a student with "limited English," stringing them together to understand the full *intent* of the question is harder than it seems. They might understand "line" and "poem" and "like" but struggle with "most" and especially "why."
    *   The act of *articulating* "why" in English, even a simple reason, can be a major barrier. They might have a reason in their head but not the vocabulary to express it.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   The concept of expressing a *personal preference* and then *justifying* it, while seemingly basic to us, requires a level of meta-cognition and linguistic fluency that struggling learners often lack. It's not just about recalling facts.

3.  **Exam Anxiety:**
    *   Being asked an open-ended question that requires a personalized response, rather than a direct factual recall, can be more intimidating for anxious students, leading to blanks.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   Indian government school curricula often emphasize rote learning and factual recall. Questions asking for personal opinion and justification ("why do *you* like...") are less common, especially in written form where English expression is required.
    *   They might have practiced identifying lines or answering factual questions *about* the poem, but not this introspective, justificatory style.

5.  **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is a crucial anchor. If the average pass rate for *all* questions is 29%, a question requiring more complex language and reasoning skills is likely to be below average.

6.  **The Rubric:** "Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why."
    *   Denoting a line might be achievable for some, but *mentioning why* is the significant hurdle. Even a very simple "because it is good" or "I like this" might suffice for "mentioning why," but the student still has to produce that much.

**Re-evaluation:**

*   **Picking a line:** Many might be able to physically copy or point to a line, so that part might be done by perhaps 40-50%.
*   **Mentioning "why":** This is where the significant drop-off occurs.
    *   Students with *very* limited English won't be able to articulate any "why."
    *   Students who were absent for the poem or topic might pick a line randomly and still be unable to say why.
    *   Anxiety will lead to blanks for the "why."
    *   Lack of practice with this question type means they don't have a template for answering.

Consider a student who "barely reads English." They might recognize "line," "poem," "like," but "most" and "why" become opaque. They might copy a line at random. They almost certainly won't be able to articulate a "why."

This question requires not just comprehension of the poem, but comprehension of the question itself, and then the productive language skills to formulate an answer with justification. Given the severe limitations, the "why" part will drastically reduce success.

If the average pass rate is 29%, and this requires more abstract thinking and productive English than a typical factual recall, it will be *lower* than average.

Let's estimate:
*   Perhaps 20-25% might be able to pick a line and attempt *some* form of justification, however rudimentary.
*   Another 5-10% might pick a line but fail entirely on the "why." These wouldn't get credit.

My calibrated estimate must be significantly below the average pass rate, reflecting the unique challenges of this question type for this demographic.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **18%**
