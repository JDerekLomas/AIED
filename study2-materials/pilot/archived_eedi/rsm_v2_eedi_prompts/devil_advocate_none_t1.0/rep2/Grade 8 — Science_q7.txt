Let's break down the question and the likely struggles:

**Question Analysis:**

*   "A gardener has collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit." - This sets up a composting scenario.
*   "Does gardener notice any change after some days?" - This is a direct question about observation.
*   "Give reasons" - Requires understanding *why* the change happens (decomposition).
*   "and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health" - Requires understanding the *impact* of decomposition (humus, nutrients).

**Student Challenges (Applying the "Expert Overestimation" Filter):**

1.  **English Comprehension:**
    *   "collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits" - Probably understandable for most.
    *   "in a pit" - Also clear.
    *   "Does gardener notice any change" - Straightforward.
    *   **"Give reasons"** - This phrase itself can be a hurdle. It's not just "why." It requires explaining a process.
    *   **"evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health"** - "Evaluate" is a higher-order thinking verb and can be very difficult for students with limited English and academic vocabulary. "Beneficial" might be known, but "soil health" as a concept, linked to the decomposition process, is more abstract.

2.  **Conceptual Understanding:**
    *   **Decomposition:** While they might have seen things rot, connecting it to "microorganisms" or "bacteria" as a "reason" might be missing, or the specific vocabulary for it. They might just say "it rots."
    *   **"Beneficial for soil health":** This requires understanding that the decomposed material (humus/manure) adds nutrients and improves soil structure. This is a core concept but might not be explicitly taught or retained in this exact phrasing. Many might just know "it becomes manure" but struggle to articulate *why* that's good for "soil health."

3.  **Question Type:** "Give reasons and evaluate" is not a simple recall question. It demands explanation and critical thinking, which is challenging even for native English speakers, let alone those with limited English proficiency.

4.  **Assumed Prior Knowledge/Experience:** While many students might live in rural areas and see composting or waste decomposition, the *academic explanation* and the *specific vocabulary* needed to answer this question correctly, as per a rubric, are different. They might know "it becomes khad (manure)" but struggle with the scientific explanation.

5.  **Anxiety/Lack of Practice:** This exact multi-part, higher-order question might be new.

**Re-evaluating the Rubric:** "The user suggests that the gardener will notice significant changes." This is a very low bar for 0.5 points.

*   Will they notice a change? Yes, most students would intuitively know this. "It will rot/become less."
*   "Significant changes"? Yes, they would likely assume this.

However, the full prompt asks for *reasons* and *evaluation of benefit*. The rubric only covers the first part of the first question. If the 0.5 points are ONLY for "Yes, there will be changes," then the proportion would be higher. But if it implies a correct *explanation* of change, reasons, *and* benefit, then it drops significantly.

Given the wording "The user suggests that the gardener will notice significant changes," it implies a simple "Yes, it will change" type of answer for the 0.5 points. This is *much* easier than the rest of the question.

If the *entire question* had to be answered correctly for a score, I'd put it very low (5-10%). But for just acknowledging "changes," it's different.

Let's assume the 0.5 points is specifically for "Does gardener notice any change after some days?" and the student correctly answers "Yes, they will notice a change" or implies it.

Even with limited English, "change" and "after some days" are comprehensible. Most students would intuitively understand that waste in a pit changes over time (rots, shrinks, smells).

However, "significant changes" might be a slight stretch for some to articulate in English, but the core idea of "change" is there.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for *all* questions, and this specific low bar for 0.5 points, it's still not 100%. Some students will simply leave it blank due to anxiety or not understanding "change" in this context, or focusing on the harder parts and getting stuck.

If the rubric implies the *full intent* of the question's first part, not just a yes/no:
*   "Yes
