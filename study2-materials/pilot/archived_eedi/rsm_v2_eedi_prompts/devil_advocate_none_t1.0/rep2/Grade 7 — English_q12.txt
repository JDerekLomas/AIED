Here's a breakdown of how a typical Class 7 student in an Indian government school, especially from economically weaker sections, might approach this, and why the "expert" instinct is often wrong:

**Challenges for the student:**

*   **English Comprehension:** The sentence itself is relatively simple, but understanding "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" as concepts requires a certain level of English proficiency. Many will struggle to even grasp what the question is asking them to do.
*   **Vocabulary:** "Blew" and "blown" are irregular verbs. While "blow" is common, many students struggle with irregular past participles, especially if their exposure to English is limited. They might not know "blown."
*   **Grammatical Concepts:**
    *   **Identifying Subject/Object:** They need to identify "wind" as the actor (subject) and "leaves" as the receiver of the action (object). This is not always intuitive for struggling learners.
    *   **Forming "to be" verb:** They need to know to use "were" (past tense, plural) with "leaves." This requires agreement in number and tense.
    *   **Past Participle:** The biggest hurdle for many will be knowing to use "blown."
    *   **"by the..." phrase:** Understanding that the original subject often becomes an optional "by the..." phrase.
*   **Prior Instruction:**
    *   **Quality of Teaching:** The quality of English teaching in many government schools can be inconsistent. Topics might be rushed, taught in a rote manner without deep understanding, or taught by teachers who themselves are not highly proficient.
    *   **Attendance:** Many students have irregular attendance, especially if they need to work or help at home. They might have missed the lesson entirely.
    *   **Practice:** They might have seen *examples* but never *practiced* transforming sentences themselves, or only practiced very simple, predictable ones. This specific sentence has an irregular verb, making it slightly harder than "The boy kicked the ball."
*   **Exam Anxiety:** Even if they have some knowledge, the pressure of an exam can make them forget.
*   **Guessing:** Many will just guess, perhaps by rearranging words randomly or changing only one word. "The leaves blew the wind away" is a possible incorrect answer.

**Challenging the "Expert" Instinct:**

My first instinct *might* be "it's a basic grammar rule, Class 7 students should know this." But then I force myself to think about:

*   **Barely reads English:** Such a student would likely stare blankly or just copy the sentence, or change a random word. They wouldn't understand "Active Voice" or "Passive Voice."
*   **Absent for the topic:** They have zero chance.
*   **Irregular verb difficulty:** "Blew" to "blown" is not a simple addition of "-ed."
*   **Multiple steps involved:** Identify subject/object, determine tense, find correct "to be" form, find correct past participle, add "by the..." phrase. Each step is a potential point of failure.

Given an average pass rate of 29% for the entire paper, a question requiring specific grammatical transformation, irregular verb knowledge, and conceptual understanding of "voice" would likely be harder than average.

Many students will produce answers like:
*   The leaves blew away the wind. (Reversed subject/object)
*   The leaves blowed away by the wind. (Incorrect past participle)
*   The leaves were blow away by the wind. (Missing past participle)
*   The leaves was blown away by the wind. (Incorrect "to be" verb agreement)
*   They will just write the original sentence again.
*   They will write something completely irrelevant.

The "correctly transforms" part of the rubric is key. Partial understanding won't earn a point.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

I believe this question would be correctly answered by only a fraction of students who are doing well in English, consistently attend, and have had good instruction. This is a difficult question for a student at the 29% average pass rate.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **15%**
