Let's break down the challenge of this question for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, keeping in mind the caveats about overestimating student performance.

**Initial Instinct (and why it might be wrong):**
My first instinct might be, "This is a simple paragraph. Most Class 7 students should be able to write about their hobby. It's a very common topic."

**Challenging the Instinct (applying the given constraints):**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences)" – The *instruction* itself might be partially understood. "Paragraph" might be a known word, but "short," "4-5 sentences" might be interpreted loosely or not at all.
    *   "My Favourite Hobby" – "Favourite" and "Hobby" are common, but for students with limited English, they might not immediately click or might be confused with other similar words.
    *   "Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it." – This is a complex instruction, requiring comprehension of "mention," "what," "when," "why," and "enjoy." Many students will struggle to break this down into components and ensure all parts are addressed. They might understand "write about my hobby" but miss the specific requirements.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   Paragraph structure: Many students, especially those struggling, may not consistently write in complete sentences, or structure a coherent paragraph. They might write a list of ideas or one-word answers.
    *   Formulating reasons ("why you enjoy it"): This requires higher-order thinking and vocabulary to express reasons beyond "it is good" or "I like it."

3.  **Exam Anxiety:**
    *   Even if they know the answer, the pressure of writing in English, adhering to a sentence count, and covering specific points can lead to them freezing up or providing incomplete answers.
    *   Fear of making mistakes in English grammar or spelling might deter them from writing much at all.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   While they might have written "essays" or "paragraphs" on "My Best Friend" or "My School," this specific combination of explicit instructions ("what, when, why") within a sentence count might be new.
    *   The expectation of covering *all three points* and maintaining paragraph form is quite high. Many will likely cover one or two points, but miss one, or not structure it as a coherent paragraph.

5.  **Absent for Topic / Struggling Learners:**
    *   A student who missed the "paragraph writing" unit or who consistently struggles with sentence formation will find this very difficult. They might write one or two disjointed sentences.
    *   Their "hobby" might be playing cricket, but articulating *why* they enjoy it, *when* they do it, and stringing it all together in English, with correct grammar, is a significant hurdle.

**Revisiting the Rubric:** "Student writes a complete paragraph that clearly mentions the hobby, when it is done, and why it is enjoyable."
*   "Complete paragraph": This means more than just a few sentences; it implies some coherence.
*   "Clearly mentions": Requires clear vocabulary.
*   "All three points": This is the biggest hurdle. Many might only get 1 or 2.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for "Class 7 students in Indian government schools, mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English," this question, while seemingly simple, demands a level of English comprehension, writing skill, and adherence to instructions that a significant portion of these students will struggle with.

I imagine a large number of students might write 1-2 sentences, or write something grammatically incorrect, or miss one of the three required points. Only those who have a relatively solid grasp of basic English sentence structure and can follow multi-part instructions will succeed.

My first instinct of "most students" would lead me to a 50-60% estimate. But after challenging it:

*   Likely to write a few sentences, but not a "complete paragraph."
*   Likely to mention the hobby, but struggle with "when" and especially "why" in coherent English.
*   Likely to miss one of the three specific requirements.

Given the existing 29% average pass rate, this question is likely *harder* than average because it demands structured writing and multi-part instruction following, not just recall.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 20%
