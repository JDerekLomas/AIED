Let's break down the thinking process, challenging common biases.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):**
My first thought, as an educated adult fluent in English, is "This is incredibly easy. Almost everyone would get this." I immediately see "He is reading a book." This is the kind of question that appears in early English lessons.

**Challenging the Instinct (Applying the Given Context):**

1.  **Limited English Proficiency:**
    *   "book/reading/a/is/he" - These are common words, but for someone with *limited* English, processing them individually and then seeing the *grammatical relationships* is a much bigger leap.
    *   They might recognize "book," "reading," "he." But "is" and "a" might be harder to place grammatically.
    *   They might try to form a sentence like "Book is reading he a" or "He reading book is a." The SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure isn't innate; it needs to be taught and practiced. If their exposure is limited, they might not have internalized it.
    *   *Self-correction:* Even if they know all the words, do they understand the *function* of each word in a sentence? "Is" as a linking verb, "a" as an article.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic for Struggling Learners:**
    *   Sentence formation, especially with auxiliary verbs ("is") and articles ("a"), is a foundational concept. If a student is struggling, this foundation might be shaky or non-existent.
    *   Rearranging words requires not just vocabulary but also a grasp of syntax. This isn't just word recognition; it's grammatical construction.
    *   *Self-correction:* This isn't just about knowing what "reading" means; it's about knowing *where* "reading" goes in relation to "he" and "is."

3.  **Exam Anxiety:**
    *   Even if they *could* do it under relaxed conditions, the pressure of an exam can cause simple things to become difficult.
    *   A student might just stare at it, panic, and write something jumbled or nothing at all.
    *   *Self-correction:* Anxiety impacts recall and processing speed.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   While they might have learned sentence formation, have they practiced *rearranging jumbled words* frequently? This specific task requires a particular mental process.
    *   If they've only practiced *forming* sentences from scratch, this specific "reverse engineering" might be unfamiliar.
    *   *Self-correction:* Familiarity with the *task type* is crucial, not just the underlying skill.

5.  **Average Pass Rate 29%:**
    *   This is a critical anchor. If the overall pass rate is so low, it suggests a significant portion of students are truly struggling across subjects.
    *   While this question seems "easy" relative to, say, a math problem, it's still an English comprehension/grammar question. It won't be immune to the general academic struggles.
    *   *Self-correction:* This question *must* be considered in the context of a generally low-performing group. It's not an outlier that everyone will magically ace.

6.  **"Absent for this topic":**
    *   The SVO structure, use of auxiliary verbs, and articles are taught. If a student missed those lessons, they'd be lost.
    *   *Self-correction:* We cannot assume perfect attendance or retention of all prior lessons.

**Re-evaluating based on challenges:**

*   Many students might get "He reading a book" or "He is a book reading" or "Reading he is a book." They might get *some* words in the right place, but not the *exact* sentence required by the rubric. The rubric is quite strict: "He is reading a book."
*   The "is" and "a" are small words but crucial for grammatical correctness. Placing them correctly is a higher-order skill than just recognizing the main nouns and verbs.
*   Given the general struggles, low English proficiency, and potential lack of specific practice with this exact question type, the number of students who will get it perfectly right (according to the rubric) will be considerably lower than my initial optimistic guess.

I need to calibrate *down* significantly from my initial "most students" thought. If the average pass rate is 29%, this specific question *might* be slightly easier than average, but not by a huge margin for the reasons stated above.

Let's think about a range. Could it be 70%
