Let's break down the question and the student profile.

**Student Profile:**
*   Class 7, Indian government schools.
*   Mostly from economically weaker sections.
*   Limited English proficiency.
*   Average pass rate ~29%.
*   Prone to exam anxiety, gaps in learning (absenteeism), lack of practice with specific question types.
*   "Basic" concepts aren't basic for them.

**Question Analysis:**
*   "What are the main occupations of people in the rural areas of Rajasthan?" - This requires recall of specific geographical/socio-economic knowledge related to a particular state.
*   "Describe any one in brief." - This requires not just recall, but also basic descriptive ability in English.

**Challenging Initial Instincts:**

My first instinct might be: "This is a pretty standard geography/social studies question for Class 7. They should have covered this about Rajasthan."

However, remembering the caveats:

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "Main occupations" - Do they understand "main" and "occupations"?
    *   "Rural areas of Rajasthan" - Do they recognize "rural" and "Rajasthan"?
    *   "Describe any one in brief" - Can they formulate even a simple sentence or two in English to describe agriculture or animal husbandry? Many might understand the concept but struggle with the vocabulary or sentence structure.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While agriculture and animal husbandry are fundamental to rural India, have they internalized them as "occupations"? Have they explicitly learned this for Rajasthan, or is it a general idea they need to apply? For students with patchy attendance or who struggle with comprehension, these links might not be made.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** Even if they know the answer in their native language, the pressure of translating it into English under exam conditions can lead to a blank.

4.  **Lack of Practice:** Have they practiced open-ended questions like this, especially those requiring both recall and description, *in English*? Many exams might rely on multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blanks.

**Re-evaluating based on the rubric:**
*   **Rubric:** "Names at least two main occupations correctly (e.g., Agriculture/farming, Animal Husbandry/pastoralism, handicrafts)."
*   This means they *don't* even need to describe one correctly to get the point, *if* they correctly name two occupations. This slightly increases the potential, but the English barrier for even *naming* two remains. Can they spell "agriculture" or "animal husbandry" correctly, or close enough to be recognizable? Many might write "kheti" (farming in Hindi) if allowed, but here English is required.

Considering the *very* low average pass rate (29%), the limited English, the struggle with "basic" concepts, and the specific requirement to name *two* occupations *in English*, this question is harder than it appears. Many might get one, but two *and* in English is a significant hurdle. Even "handicrafts" might be a difficult word.

I'm leaning towards a significantly lower percentage than one might initially guess for a knowledge-based question. Many might recall *one* (e.g., farming), but struggle to recall a second or spell it correctly in English.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **18%**
