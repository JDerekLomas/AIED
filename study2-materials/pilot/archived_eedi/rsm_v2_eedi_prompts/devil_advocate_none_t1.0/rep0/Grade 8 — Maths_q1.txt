Let's break down the thought process to arrive at a calibrated estimate.

**Initial Instinct (and why it's probably wrong):**
My first thought, as someone with a strong math background and native English, is "This is incredibly easy. Most students would get this." I immediately think of the simple subtraction needed. This is the expert bias the prompt warns about.

**Challenging the Assumptions (Applying the Prompt's Guidance):**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "Find the value of `y` in the equation: `y + 9 = 4`"
    *   "Find the value of `y`": This phrase itself might be a hurdle. Do they understand "value," "equation"?
    *   The symbols `+`, `=`, `4`, `9` are generally universal, but the *sentence structure* surrounding them is English.
    *   Consider a student who *barely reads English*. They might identify `y`, `+`, `9`, `=`, `4` but struggle to translate "Find the value of y" into "I need to isolate y."

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   The core concept here is solving a linear equation.
    *   For students from struggling backgrounds, the idea of "balancing an equation" by performing the same operation on both sides might not be intuitive or well-taught.
    *   Many might try to "guess and check" or simply move numbers around without understanding the underlying principle.
    *   The idea of *negative numbers* is a significant hurdle. `4 - 9 = -5`. This is where many will falter. If they are used to only working with positive results in simple subtraction, `9 - 4 = 5` might be their default answer. This is a common error even for students in more developed educational systems at this level.

3.  **Exam Anxiety:**
    *   Even if a student knows the concept, anxiety can cause them to misread, make simple arithmetic errors, or simply "freeze up."
    *   The pressure of an exam can turn a simple problem into something daunting.

4.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   While they might have practiced `y + 4 = 9` (where the result is positive), have they practiced `y + 9 = 4` where the result is negative? This specific nuance is critical.
    *   If their practice was primarily with problems where `number_on_right > number_being_added`, they might default to `9 - 4 = 5`.

5.  **Average Pass Rate (29%):** This is a crucial anchor. The *overall* pass rate is very low. This suggests a significant portion of students are struggling across the board. While this is a math question, the general academic weakness suggests many won't even approach it correctly due to foundational gaps.

**Re-evaluating based on challenges:**

*   **Negative Numbers are the biggest trap:** I suspect a large percentage who attempt it will get `y = 5` instead of `y = -5`.
*   **Understanding "equation" and "find the value":** This is a barrier for a segment.
*   **Procedural knowledge:** Do they understand "subtract 9 from both sides"? Or do they just see `y = 9 - 4` or `y = 4 - 9`? The latter is more likely to lead to errors if the order is flipped.

**Estimating the percentage:**

*   If the average pass rate is 29%, this specific question *might* be slightly easier than some, but the negative number result makes it harder than it first appears.
*   Let's consider groups:
    *   **Group 1: No idea / Can't understand question/anxiety.** (Likely a significant portion, maybe 30-40% based on general pass rate) -> 0% correct.
    *   **Group 2: Understands the concept but makes the negative number error.** (This is a very common error for this specific type of question at this level) -> Will answer `y = 5`. This could be another 30-40%. -> 0% correct.
    *   **Group 3: Gets it perfectly.** These are the students who have truly grasped solving equations with integers. This is the target group.

If 30-40% get `y=5` and another 30-40% are completely lost, that leaves only 20-40% who *might* get it right. Given the "economically weaker sections," "limited English," and the specific difficulty of negative integer subtraction, I lean towards the lower
