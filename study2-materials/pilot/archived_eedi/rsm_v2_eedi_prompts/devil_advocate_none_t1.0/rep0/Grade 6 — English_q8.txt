Let's break down the thinking process, challenging assumptions:

**Initial Instinct (and why it's likely wrong):**
My first thought, as an educated English speaker, is "This is incredibly easy. Most students would get this." I immediately recognize "He is reading a book." This is the expert bias at play.

**Challenging the Assumptions (Applying the provided filters):**

*   **Limited English:**
    *   "book," "reading," "is," "he" - These are all very common words. Individually, they might be recognized.
    *   But understanding the *grammatical structure* required to form a sentence is a huge leap. "Rearrange to make a meaningful sentence" - do they understand "meaningful sentence" in this context?
    *   They might understand individual words but not how they fit together in a standard English sentence structure. They might attempt a literal translation from their native language's syntax, which could lead to "Book reading a is he" or similar.

*   **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) is fundamental in English. But for someone whose primary language might have a different structure (SOV, VSO, etc.), or for whom formal grammar instruction in English is weak, this isn't "basic." It's a learned rule that needs practice.
    *   They might recognize that "he" is a person and "book" is a thing, "reading" is an action. But how do you combine them? Where does "is" fit?
    *   Is "is" understood as a helping verb in this context, or just another word?

*   **Exam Anxiety:**
    *   Even if they *could* do it in a calm environment, the pressure of a test can make simple tasks difficult. A blank page, a timer, and unfamiliar question types can cause a complete shutdown.

*   **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:**
    *   This is huge. While they might have learned individual words or simple sentences, "rearrange words" might be a novel task. They might not understand the *goal* of the rearrangement. Is it to just put them in any order that makes *some* sense, or the grammatically correct English one?

*   **Absent for This Topic:**
    *   Grammar lessons can be sporadic or poorly delivered in under-resourced schools. If they missed the specific lesson on sentence structure, they'd be completely lost.

*   **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is a crucial anchor. If the *overall* pass rate for a test is 29%, this specific item has to fit within that general context. An "easy" item for a fluent speaker isn't easy for this demographic.

**Re-evaluation:**

Considering all the above, my initial "most students" feeling is shattered.

*   A student with very limited English might put the words in any order they can make sense of, or even just write them down in the given order.
*   They might struggle with the placement of "is."
*   They might not understand the concept of "rearranging" to achieve a *specific grammatical structure*.
*   The SVO structure might not be internalized.

While the words are simple, the task of *synthesizing* them into a grammatically correct English sentence is complex for struggling learners. It requires understanding of:
1.  Vocabulary (which is likely ok for these words)
2.  Grammar (SVO, verb conjugation/auxiliary verb use)
3.  Question type (rearrangement)

I need to be much lower than my initial thought. Given the 29% average pass rate, this question, while seemingly basic to an expert, is likely in the "moderately difficult" category for these students. It's not a complete guess, but it requires specific knowledge of English sentence structure, which is often a weak point.

If 29% is the *average*, this question might be slightly above average difficulty for them, or right around it. Let's think about who *would* get it:
*   Students who have consistently attended English classes.
*   Students who have had good quality English instruction.
*   Students who have practiced sentence formation.
*   Students who aren't too stressed.

This feels like a task that separates students who have *some* grasp of basic English sentence structure from those who are just learning words.

I'll aim for a figure that reflects this challenge, keeping it within the general context of the 29% pass rate, but acknowledging the perceived simplicity of the *words* themselves, which might make it slightly higher than the average for *some* questions.
