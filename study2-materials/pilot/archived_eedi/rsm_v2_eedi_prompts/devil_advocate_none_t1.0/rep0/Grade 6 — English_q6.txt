Let's break down the question and the context.

**The Question:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"

**The Rubric:** "Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why." (Max score: 1.5)

**The Context (Class 6, Indian Government Schools):**
*   **Economically weaker sections:** Implies less exposure to English outside school, potentially less home support for studies, and often larger class sizes with less individual teacher attention.
*   **Limited English:** This is crucial. "Which line... do you like the most" is relatively simple, but "and why?" requires a certain level of expressive capability.
*   **Average pass rate about 29%:** This is a strong indicator of overall academic struggles and limited mastery of even "basic" concepts.
*   **Teachers/Experts overestimate:** This is the core challenge. We need to fight the urge to think "this is easy."

**Challenging Assumptions:**

1.  **"Understanding the question is easy":**
    *   "Which line from the poem" - likely understood if they know what "line" and "poem" mean.
    *   "do you like the most" - "like" is common, "most" might be tricky but generally inferred.
    *   **"and why?" - This is the major hurdle.** Many students might understand they need to pick a line, but articulating *why* they like it, even in simple English, is a significant leap. They might just rephrase the line or give a very generic, unspecific reason.

2.  **"They've studied poems before":** While true, have they *practiced* answering "why do you like X?" in English, especially in a written format? Probably not extensively. Often, English teaching focuses on literal comprehension or grammar, not subjective expression.

3.  **"They will have a clear 'favorite' line":** Students might not engage with poetry in a way that naturally cultivates a "favorite" line, especially if the poem itself is difficult or uninteresting to them. They might just pick the first line they remember or one that seems easy to write.

4.  **"Exam anxiety won't affect this":** Anxiety often causes students to shut down on open-ended questions that require original thought, especially when they are unsure of their English abilities. They might default to a blank answer or a very minimal, incorrect response.

5.  **"Basic concepts are basic":** For a struggling learner, even generating a simple, coherent sentence to explain a preference can be a monumental task.

**How students might fail to get full credit (1.5 marks):**

*   **Blank:** Many will leave it blank due to lack of understanding, anxiety, or inability to articulate.
*   **Picks a line, but no "why":** Understands the first part, fails the second.
*   **Picks a line, and gives an irrelevant or nonsensical "why":** "I like this line because it is a line." or "I like this line because the sun is bright."
*   **Copies the entire poem instead of a line.**
*   **Answers in their local language.** (Though usually not scored).
*   **Misinterprets "line" as "word" or "stanza."**

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%):** This question requires higher-order thinking (choosing, evaluating, explaining) and communicative competence (articulating a reason) than simple recall. If only 29% pass overall, questions requiring subjective expression and justification in English will likely have a *lower* success rate than the average.

**Calibrating the Estimate:**

*   My first instinct might be around 40-50% because the question seems "simple."
*   However, after applying the stated criteria: limited English, economic background, exam anxiety, no prior practice of *this exact question type* for many, and the fact that teachers overestimate...
*   The "and why" is the killer. Many will pick a line. Far fewer will give a coherent *and correct* reason in English. Even a very simple "I like it because it is happy" might pass, but generating even that simple sentence is a hurdle.
*   The 29% average pass rate suggests overall significant difficulty for this cohort. A question requiring *original written English expression* will be harder than average.

I'm going to lean towards a lower figure, considering the severe limitations.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **18%**
