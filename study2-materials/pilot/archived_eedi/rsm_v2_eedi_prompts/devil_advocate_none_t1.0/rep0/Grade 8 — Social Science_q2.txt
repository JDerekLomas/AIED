Let's break down the challenge for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, especially given the context of economically weaker sections and limited English.

1.  **"Describe one key feature"**: This requires more than just recalling a word; they need to form a coherent sentence or two. For students with limited English, "describe" itself can be a hurdle.

2.  **"Harappan Civilization"**: While this topic is part of the curriculum, retention can be low, especially if taught in a rote manner without deep understanding. Many students might struggle to recall *any* feature, let alone a *key* one.

3.  **"Urban planning"**: This is a relatively sophisticated term. Do students fully grasp what "urban planning" entails, or do they just associate it with cities? This abstract concept can be difficult to connect with specific architectural features if their understanding is superficial.

4.  **Specific Features (Grid layout, drainage system, baked bricks, citadel/lower town)**:
    *   **Grid layout**: Might be recalled, but articulating "well-planned grid layout of streets" in English could be tough.
    *   **Advanced drainage system**: This is a very common feature taught. "Drainage system" might be remembered, but "advanced" might not be part of their vocabulary or understanding.
    *   **Use of baked bricks**: This is also frequently mentioned. "Baked bricks" is relatively simple English.
    *   **Division into citadel and lower town**: "Citadel" is a less common English word and might be a major vocabulary barrier. "Lower town" might be simpler.

**Recalibrating based on the warnings:**

*   **Limited English:** Forming a complete sentence describing *any* feature correctly is a significant hurdle. Even if they know "drainage," can they say "The Harappans had a good drainage system"?
*   **"Basic" concepts aren't basic:** While these features are core to Harappan history, for a struggling learner, simply knowing *what* "urban planning" means in practice for an ancient civilization might be fuzzy.
*   **Exam anxiety:** The pressure to articulate in a foreign language can cause blank responses even if they have some knowledge.
*   **Never practiced this exact question type:** They might have practiced recall questions (e.g., "Name two features..."), but "describe one key feature" requires a slightly different cognitive process and linguistic construction.

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for *all* questions, and the specific challenges of this question:
*   Many might remember a *word* like "drainage" or "bricks" but fail to form a descriptive sentence.
*   Some might mix up civilizations or features.
*   The English requirement for "describe" and understanding "urban planning" will filter out many.

I initially might think around 30-35% because "drainage system" is so prominent. However, the requirement to *describe* it *correctly* and in *English*, plus the anxiety and general low proficiency, will significantly reduce that. Only the students who have a solid grasp of the content AND the English required for description will get this right.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **18%**
