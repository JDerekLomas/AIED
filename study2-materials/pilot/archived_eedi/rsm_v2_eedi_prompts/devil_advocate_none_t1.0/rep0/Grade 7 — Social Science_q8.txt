Let's break down the question and potential student struggles before estimating.

**Question:** "What are the main occupations of people in the rural areas of Rajasthan? Describe any one in brief."

**Rubric:** "Names at least two main occupations correctly (e.g., Agriculture/farming, Animal Husbandry/pastoralism, handicrafts)."

**Challenges for Class 7 students in Indian government schools (economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate 29%):**

1.  **English Comprehension:**
    *   "Main occupations": While "occupation" might be a known word, "main" could be missed or misunderstood as just "any."
    *   "Rural areas of Rajasthan": This specific geographic and demographic context is key. If "rural" or "Rajasthan" isn't clear, they might list general occupations or occupations from their own (non-Rajasthan) area.
    *   "Describe any one in brief": This part is *not* scored for this rubric, but it adds to the cognitive load and complexity of the question. A student might get fixated on the description part and miss the core identification.

2.  **Content Knowledge:**
    *   **"Main occupations in rural Rajasthan"**: This requires specific social science/geography knowledge. While agriculture and animal husbandry are common, knowing they are *main* for *Rajasthan* might not be universally taught or retained, especially if the curriculum focuses broadly. Handicrafts is even more specific.
    *   **Recalling specific examples:** Even if they understand the concept, recalling *two distinct* correct examples under exam pressure can be difficult.

3.  **Prior Learning & Absence:**
    *   If this specific topic (occupations in Rajasthan) was taught quickly, or if the student was absent on those days, they would struggle. Given the overall low pass rate, consistent attendance and deep learning for all topics cannot be assumed.

4.  **Exam Anxiety/Question Type:**
    *   It's a two-part question (identify + describe), even if only the first part is scored. This can be intimidating.
    *   Students might just write one occupation, forgetting the "at least two" requirement due to pressure.

**Challenging Initial Instinct:**

My first instinct, based on a general understanding of Indian rural life, might be "agriculture and animal husbandry are so common, surely everyone knows that." However, the filter of "limited English," "economically weaker sections," "struggling learners," and the specific "Rajasthan" context drastically changes this.

*   A student who barely reads English might only pick out "occupation" and "Rajasthan" and just list one or two random jobs.
*   "Basic concepts aren't basic": While agriculture is prevalent, articulating it as a "main occupation" for a *specific region* might not be basic for a struggling learner.
*   "Never practiced this exact question type": While they practice answer questions, combining specific geographic knowledge with occupational categories and the "list two" instruction under timed conditions might be a hurdle.

**Revised thought process:**

*   Many will likely write "farming" or "agriculture." This is one.
*   Getting a *second* distinct one like "animal husbandry" or "dairy farming" (which often falls under animal husbandry) or "handicrafts" is where the difficulty significantly increases.
*   Some might write things like "labor" or "selling goods," which might be present but not necessarily the "main occupations" the question is looking for in a socio-economic context.
*   The "rural areas of Rajasthan" specificity is key. If they miss this, they might list occupations relevant to their own state.

Given the 29% average pass rate, and the specific requirement of *two* correct occupations, many will likely get one but miss the second, or write something too general.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:** **15%**
