Let's break down the question and the likely student performance:

**Question Analysis:**
*   **"Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan"**: This part requires recall of specific geographical knowledge. Rajasthan is known for certain resources, but students from different parts of India might not be intimately familiar with its specific natural resources beyond the most obvious ones (like sand/desert, which is less of a *resource* in the typical sense for this question, or water scarcity).
*   **"and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."**: This requires a higher-order thinking skill – application and explanation, not just recall. It demands understanding a cause-and-effect relationship.

**Factors Affecting Performance (Considering the Constraints):**

1.  **Limited English:**
    *   "Mention," "natural resources," "found in," "influences the lives," "explain." These are all common academic terms. Students struggling with basic English might misinterpret "natural resources" or "influences."
    *   Formulating an *explanation* in correct English will be a significant hurdle, even if they grasp the concept. Many might just list impacts without a clear explanatory sentence structure.

2.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:**
    *   The concept of "natural resources" might be taught, but linking them specifically to *Rajasthan* might not be universal knowledge across all Class 6 government school curricula in India.
    *   Understanding *how* a resource "influences" daily life requires abstract thinking. For example, knowing that "water scarcity means people walk far" is an influence, but framing it as an explanation is harder.

3.  **Exam Anxiety/Never Practiced:**
    *   If they've never seen a question asking for *two* items *and then an explanation* for one, the multi-part nature will be confusing and anxiety-inducing.
    *   Even if they know the resources, connecting them to "influences" might be a new demand.

4.  **Absenteeism/Prior Knowledge:**
    *   Geography topics, especially regional ones, are often taught at specific times. If a student was absent or the topic was rushed, this specific knowledge about Rajasthan will be missing.
    *   Many students might only know "sand" or "desert," which, while present, aren't typically what these questions expect as a "natural resource" (e.g., they're looking for minerals, water, energy sources).

**Challenging the Instinct:**

My first instinct might be "They've probably learned about natural resources, and Rajasthan is a well-known state." However, the "explain how it influences" part, combined with the low English proficiency and the specificity of *Rajasthan*, makes it much harder.

*   **Could a student who barely reads English do this?** Unlikely. The explanation part requires more than just identifying keywords.
*   **Could a student who was absent for this topic?** No, as the question is highly specific to Rajasthan's resources.
*   **Could they *really* explain the influence well enough to get full credit?** Most likely, many will provide simplistic answers or just list impacts without proper explanation.

**Revised Assessment:**

Considering the average pass rate is 29%, and this question demands specific recall *and* explanation in potentially weak English, it's a significant challenge.

*   A small percentage might know two resources.
*   An even smaller percentage of those would be able to formulate a coherent explanation in English.
*   Many might get one resource right but fail on the second or the explanation.

I need to calibrate *below* the average pass rate for questions that demand more than simple recall.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 15%**
