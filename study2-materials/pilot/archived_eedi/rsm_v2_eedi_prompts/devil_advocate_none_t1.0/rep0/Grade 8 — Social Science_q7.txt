Let's break down the question and the context.

**Question Analysis:**
*   **"How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?"**
    *   **"Battle of Plassey in 1757":** This is a specific historical event and date. Students need to know *what* it was.
    *   **"contribute to the expansion of British power in India":** This asks for the *consequence* or *significance* of the battle in a broader context. It requires understanding cause and effect in history.
*   **Rubric:** "explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)."
    *   The core idea is *political dominance in Bengal*.
    *   The example of Mir Jafar is a good specific detail, but not strictly required if the general idea of control is conveyed.

**Student Context (Class 8, Indian Government Schools, EWS, Limited English, 29% average pass rate):**

1.  **Limited English:** This is a huge factor.
    *   "Contribute" might be challenging. "Expansion" too. "Dominance," "political." These are not everyday words for someone with limited English.
    *   Even if they know the *facts* in their regional language, translating and articulating them precisely in English is a skill in itself.
2.  **Economically Weaker Sections:** Often means less access to resources, extra tutoring, well-stocked libraries, or English-speaking environments outside school.
3.  **"Basic" Concepts Aren't Basic:** While Plassey is a core topic in Indian history, the *nuance* of "political dominance" and its *contribution* to broader "expansion" requires deeper understanding than just memorizing facts. Many students might only remember "British won, Siraj-ud-Daulah lost."
4.  **Exam Anxiety:** Can cause students to forget even known information or struggle with complex sentence formation.
5.  **Never Practiced This Exact Question Type:** While they might have learned about Plassey, a question framed *exactly* as "How did X contribute to Y" requiring an analytical answer might be new. They might be used to more direct recall questions.
6.  **Absent for Topic:** A significant portion of students could have missed the lesson or were too distracted to absorb it fully.
7.  **Teacher/Expert Overestimation:** My initial gut might be "Oh, Plassey is famous, everyone knows it." But then I remember the English barrier, the need for analytical thinking, and the specific nuance of "political dominance in Bengal." Many might just say "British won" or "British got more powerful" without specifying *how* or *where*.

**Calibrating the Estimate:**

*   **Who *could* get it right?** Students who:
    *   Attended the lesson and understood it well.
    *   Have a decent grasp of English vocabulary and sentence structure.
    *   Can connect cause and effect in history.
    *   Are not overly stressed during the exam.
*   **Who *would struggle*?**
    *   Students who only remember "British won." (Might say "British won and got powerful.") This isn't quite the rubric's "political dominance in Bengal."
    *   Students with very limited English who can't articulate the answer even if they know some facts.
    *   Students who missed the topic or didn't grasp the significance beyond a surface level.
    *   Students who get the "how" but not the "political dominance over Bengal" part. They might say "British took control of India" which is too broad and incorrect for the immediate aftermath.

Considering the 29% average pass rate, this question requires more than just factual recall; it demands a degree of historical understanding and expression in English.

My first instinct might have been 20-25%. But after considering the very specific rubric (political dominance *over Bengal* via Mir Jafar) and the extremely limiting factors (English, analytical skill, EWS background), I think even that is too high for *fully* meeting the rubric. Many might get partial credit if such a thing existed, but for a full point, they need to hit the nuance.

If the answer "British won and became powerful" isn't enough, and they need to specify *political control over Bengal* or the puppet nawab, then the percentage drops significantly.

**Final Calibrated Estimate:**

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **12%**
