Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis: "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Geography of India:** Students are expected to have a basic understanding of India's physical geography, specifically the location and names of prominent mountain ranges. This is typically covered in Class 6 Social Science (Geography) textbooks in India.
*   **Recall:** This is a straightforward recall question. There's no complex application or reasoning involved beyond remembering names.

**Language Demands:**
*   **Low:** The question uses simple and direct English: "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."
    *   "Name" is a common directive.
    *   "Any two" clearly indicates the quantity required.
    *   "Major" helps narrow down to prominent features.
    *   "Mountain ranges" is standard geographical terminology, likely introduced in both English and their native language context in geography lessons.
    *   "Located in India" specifies the geographical scope.
*   **Compared to other items:**
    *   *Lower than 5% item ("The Last Bargain" theme):* That requires abstract understanding, interpretation, and synthesis of a poem, then expressing it cohesively. Much higher cognitive and linguistic demand.
    *   *Similar to/Lower than 15% item (Archaeological vs. Literary sources):* That requires defining/differentiating two concepts, often using slightly more formal vocabulary, and providing examples. The language used in explanations can be more complex.
    *   *Lower than 30% item ("My favorite season" paragraph):* Requires paragraph construction, coherent thought, specific details, and some descriptive vocabulary. Higher linguistic output demand.
    *   *Comparable to 50% item (King's three questions):* That's also a recall question, but the 'questions' themselves are often a bit longer or more embedded in a narrative, which *could* make recall slightly harder than a list of proper nouns. However, both are low language demand for *understanding* the prompt.
    *   *Slightly lower than 66% item (Fundamental Rights):* While also recall, "Fundamental Rights" is a specific term from civics, and students might be taught a longer list from which to select two. Mountain ranges are often visualized and repeatedly pointed out on maps, which can aid memory. The names themselves (Himalayas, Aravalli) might feel more accessible than formal rights like "Right to Constitutional Remedies."

**Type of Task (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
*   **Pure Recall:** This is a factual recall question. Students either know the names or they don't. There's minimal scope for partial understanding or logical deduction if they haven't explicitly learned them.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   **Easy/Standard:** This is a very common type of question found at the end of geography chapters, as map work exercises, or in basic quizzes. Learning major geographical features of their own country is a core part of Class 6 Social Science. The specific textbook chapter on physical features of India would prominently feature these. Many students would have marked these on physical maps repeatedly.

**Rubric:** The rubric requires naming *one* correct mountain range for a score. The question asks for "any two major mountain ranges." If they only name one, they get 0.5 points. If they name two, they get 1 point. We're estimating the proportion correct, so a student getting one correct would technically be "correct" according to the score scale.

Given the average pass rate for all items is 29%, this question is clearly *easier* than average.

*   The low linguistic demand is a huge factor for these students.
*   It's direct recall of fundamental geographic knowledge for India.
*   It's likely extensively covered and reinforced in textbooks and classroom maps.
*   The proper nouns for mountains are relatively memorable, especially for features within their own country.
*   The 66% anchor is "Name any two Fundamental Rights..." which is conceptually similar (list two named items from civics). Mountain ranges are perhaps even more foundational and visually taught than abstract rights, making it slightly easier or at least comparable.

Comparing it to the 50% item ("three questions the king wanted to answer"), this mountain range question is probably a bit easier due to the directness of the knowledge and its highly visual teaching often associated with maps. The names are distinct proper nouns which are often easier to recall than potentially more abstract "questions" from a story.

Therefore, it should fall between the 50% and 66% anchors, potentially leaning towards the higher end given its commonality and visual teaching aids.
