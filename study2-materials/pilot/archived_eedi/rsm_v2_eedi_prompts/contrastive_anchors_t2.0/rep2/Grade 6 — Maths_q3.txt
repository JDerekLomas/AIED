Here's an analysis of the question "Arrange in ascending order: 3367, 5492, 736, 4799" and an estimate of the pass rate, specifically for the partial credit of identifying the smallest number (736) and placing it first.

## Contrastive Analysis

Let's break down the question's difficulty for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, compared to the calibration anchors.

**Question: Arrange in ascending order: `3367, 5492, 736, 4799`**
Rubric: For correctly identifying the smallest number (736) and placing it first. Max score: 0.5

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Number Sense:** Students must understand the concept of place value (hundreds, thousands).
*   **Comparison of Numbers:** They need to be able to compare multi-digit numbers, starting from the leftmost digit.
*   **Ordering:** The concept of "ascending order" (smallest to largest) is fundamental. This would be taught extensively in Class 3, 4, and 5 mathematics.

**2. Language Demands:**
*   **"Arrange":** A common English verb in math instructions.
*   **"Ascending order":** This is the key mathematical term. While they might understand the concept in Hindi ("badhte kram mein"), they need to recognize "ascending order" or have it reinforced.
*   **Numerals:** Recognizing standard Hindu-Arabic numerals is assumed.
*   **Minimal Sentence Structure:** The question is short, direct, and uses standard mathematical notation, which is less text-heavy than many of the ELA questions.

**3. Type of Task (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
*   **Application:** This is a direct application of learned mathematical concepts (comparing and ordering numbers). It's not recall of a fact, nor does it require complex reasoning beyond the standard algorithm for number comparison.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   **Standard Exercise:** This is a very standard type of exercise for Class 6 mathematics, typically found at the beginning of chapters on "Numbers" or "Comparing and Ordering." It's foundational.
*   **Simpler Numbers Often:** Textbook examples might start with 3-digit and 4-digit numbers mixed, but typically students progress to comparing numbers of similar digit counts (all 4-digit). Here, the presence of a 3-digit number (736) actually makes finding the smallest one quite straightforward for those who understand place value. It stands out visually.
*   **Likely Encountered:** Students would have solved many similar problems in their preceding classes and likely in their current Class 6 textbooks.

## Contrast with Anchors:

*   **Compared to 5% anchor ("Theme of poem"):** Far, far easier. This is a direct math skill, not requiring abstract thought, creative interpretation, or extensive English writing.
*   **Compared to 15% anchor ("Differentiate sources"):** Easier. While that's more factual recall, it requires more elaborate English answers and understanding specific history terminology. Our math question is very concrete.
*   **Compared to 30% anchor ("My favorite season" paragraph):** Easier, especially for partial credit. This math question doesn't require composing sentences or paragraphs in English. Students just need to manipulate numbers. The only 'writing' is listing numbers.
*   **Compared to 50% anchor ("King's three questions"):** More challenging than *just identifying* the number, but overall potentially around this level *for full credit*. However, the partial credit asks for *just the first number*. That anchor required specific recall from a story. This is pure math application.
*   **Compared to 66% anchor ("Two Fundamental Rights"):** Similar difficulty, *for full credit*. That question involves recalling specific facts, but the answer structure is simple (two phrases). Our question is an application of a learned algorithm. For *partial credit*, our question is likely *easier* than the Fundamental Rights recall, because even a student who struggles with the full ordering might pick out the 3-digit number first.

**Focus on Partial Credit (Identifying smallest and placing it first):**

The rubric specifically says: "For correctly identifying the smallest number (736) and placing it first. Max score: 0.5".
This significantly simplifies the task.
*   Many students, even if they struggle with the complete ascending order of 4-digit numbers, will easily spot **736** as the only three-digit number among the four-digit numbers. This immediately marks it as the smallest.
*   The "placing it first" part is straightforward for
