The question asks about the decomposition of organic matter in a pit, its impact on soil health, and reasons for any observed changes.

Here's a breakdown of the factors influencing its difficulty:

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Decomposition:** Students are expected to understand that organic matter (plants, vegetables, fruits) breaks down over time. This concept is typically introduced in lower grades or at least by Class 8 science in the context of food chains, waste management, or ecosystems.
*   **Microorganisms:** An implicit understanding that living organisms (like bacteria and fungi, even if not named explicitly) cause this breakdown.
*   **Nutrient Cycling/Fertilizer:** The idea that decomposed organic matter enriches soil (forms manure/compost) is a fundamental concept in agriculture and environmental science for this age group.
*   **Pit/Composting:** Students might not explicitly know the term "composting" but the description of a "pit" for collecting waste suggests a common practice that could lead to decomposition.

**Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
*   "collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits in a pit" - Fairly straightforward vocabulary.
*   "Does gardener notice any change after some days?" - Simple question.
*   "Give reasons" - Requires explanation, which can be challenging in limited English. Students might struggle to articulate "decomposition" or "microorganisms" clearly. They might use simpler phrases like "rotten" or "becomes mud."
*   "evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health" - "Beneficial" is a common word, and "soil health" is directly related to what they might learn in EVS/Science.
*   The overall structure is a direct question requiring observation, reasoning, and evaluation. This multi-part nature increases the linguistic and cognitive load.

**Type of Task:**
*   **Recall:** Students need to recall the concept of decomposition and its products (manure/compost).
*   **Application/Reasoning:** They need to apply this knowledge to the specific scenario of a gardener's pit and reason why changes occur and why it's beneficial for soil. It's not a direct fact recall but requires a basic conceptual understanding.
*   **Evaluation:** The "evaluate if beneficial" part requires making a judgment based on their understanding of soil health.

**Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   Class 8 science often covers topics like waste management, types of waste (biodegradable/non-biodegradable), the role of microorganisms, and the formation of manure/compost.
*   Questions like "How is manure formed?" or "What are the benefits of composting?" are common.
*   This question is slightly more open-ended, requiring students to describe the change and *then* explain *why* it's beneficial, rather than just stating facts. However, the core concepts are fundamental.

**Contrastive Analysis with Anchors:**

*   **Item (5%): Write a theme of "The Last Bargain."** This is highly subjective, requires strong interpretative skills, and likely relies on students having deeply understood the poem. The language "theme" and "central idea" is abstract. *Much harder than the target question.*
*   **Item (15%): Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources.** Requires specific historical vocabulary and distinct definitions for abstract concepts. While learned in history, it demands precise language and recall. *Likely harder than the target question.* Students might confuse examples or not fully grasp the "differentiation."
*   **Item (30%): Short paragraph on "My favorite season."** This is creative writing, allowing for simple sentences and personal expression. The language is very accessible, though articulating 6-8 lines can be a challenge. The 30% suggests many students struggle with expressing even simple ideas in length or with grammatical correctness. The prompt also specifies "what you like to do, what you eat or wear," giving some structure.
*   **Item (50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is direct recall from a story often read in Class 8 English/Moral Science. If they read and remembered the story, it's easy. The 50% pass rate suggests a significant proportion of students either didn't understand the story, didn't read it carefully, or struggled with basic recall. This is very low linguistic load, just requiring simple retrieval.
*   **Item (66%): Name two Fundamental Rights.** Direct recall of two specific facts taught in Social Science. High likelihood of having learned and memorized these. Requires specific terms, but they are generally simple lists (e.g., Right to Equality, Right to Freedom).

**Considering the Target Question:**

The core concept (decomposition leads to beneficial compost) is fundamental and frequently taught. However
