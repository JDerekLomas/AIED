## Contrastive Analysis: "Find the area of a triangle"

Let's break down the question "Find the area of a triangle whose base is `8` cm and height is `6` cm." and compare it to the calibration anchors.

**1. Prior Knowledge:**

*   **Assumed:** Students need to know the formula for the area of a triangle (`Area = 1/2 × base × height`). This is typically taught in Class 6 or 7 mathematics in India. They also need basic multiplication and division skills.
*   **Comparison:**
    *   **5% "The Last Bargain":** Requires complex literary interpretation and abstract thought. Much harder.
    *   **15% "Archaeological/Literary sources":** Requires recall of two distinct categories of historical sources and ability to differentiate them, plus examples. Requires understanding specific vocabulary and abstract categorization. Similar cognitive load to recalling a math formula, but perhaps with more room for confusion.
    *   **30% "My favorite season":** Requires creative writing, basic sentence structure, and personal expression. Lower cognitive load in terms of factual recall, but higher in terms of constructing coherent English sentences.
    *   **50% "Three questions the king wanted":** Pure recall from a story. Similar to recalling a formula in terms of a specific piece of information. The English is more complex here than in the triangle question.
    *   **66% "Fundamental Rights":** Pure recall of two specific items. Very direct recall, similar to recalling a math formula. The concept itself (rights) might be slightly more abstract than a triangle's area, but the English is relatively simple.

**2. Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**

*   **Question:** "Find the area of a triangle whose base is `8` cm and height is `6` cm."
    *   **Keywords:** "Find," "area," "triangle," "base," "height," "cm."
    *   These are all very common mathematical terms, and usually introduced visually with diagrams in Hindi-medium schools even if the exam is in English. The phrase structure is simple and direct.
*   **Comparison:**
    *   **5% "The Last Bargain":** Very high language demand (theme, central idea, poetic language).
    *   **15% "Archaeological/Literary sources":** High language demand ("differentiate," "sources," "history," "example"). "Archaeological" and "literary" are challenging vocabulary.
    *   **30% "My favorite season":** Moderate language demand (write a short paragraph, talk about what you like to do/eat/wear). Requires sentence construction.
    *   **50% "Three questions the king wanted":** Moderate language demand (the exact phrasing from a story). While recall-based, accurately transcribing or paraphrasing can be tough.
    *   **66% "Fundamental Rights":** Low to moderate language demand (Name any two Fundamental Rights, provided by the Constitution). "Fundamental Rights" is a specific term they'd likely have heard in Social Studies.

    **Conclusion for Language:** The triangle question has *very low* language demand compared to the literary and social science items. The terms are technical but highly contextualized within mathematics and likely learned with visual aids. "Base" and "height" are visually intuitive concepts.

**3. Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**

*   **Question:** Primarily **application** of a memorized formula. It's a direct plug-and-chug.
*   **Comparison:**
    *   **5% "The Last Bargain":** High-level reasoning and interpretation.
    *   **15% "Archaeological/Literary sources":** Recall and application of definitional understanding (differentiation).
    *   **30% "My favorite season":** Creative application (writing).
    *   **50% "Three questions the king wanted":** Pure recall.
    *   **66% "Fundamental Rights":** Pure recall.

    **Conclusion:** This math problem is an application of a formula. It's a step up from pure recall but simpler than complex reasoning. The "pure recall" items (50% & 66%) might suggest a higher success rate for recalling information *if* that information is directly taught and practiced. This formula is definitely directly taught and practiced.

**4. Difficulty vs. Typical Textbook Exercises:**

*   **Question:** This is an *extremely standard* textbook exercise. It's the most basic application of the area of a triangle formula. There are no tricky numbers (integers only), no need to convert units, no need to infer base or height from other information, and no word problem context that requires translation of text into a
