Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated pass rate:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge:** This question assumes basic grammatical knowledge of English, specifically the usage of "some" and "any" in affirmative and interrogative/negative sentences. While students in Class 6 in India would be learning English, the nuance of "some" vs. "any" might still be challenging, especially without strong foundational grammar.
*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** The vocabulary is very simple: "apples," "basket," "there are." These are common words students would likely know.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** The sentence structure "There are... in the basket" is a common and relatively simple English construction.
    *   **Concept:** The core difficulty lies in understanding the specific rule for "some" in affirmative statements vs. "any" in negative statements or questions. This is a grammatical concept, not just a vocabulary one. For students with limited English, grammatical rules can be harder to internalize than individual words.
*   **Cognitive Demand:** This is an **application** question. Students need to recall the rule for "some" and "any" and apply it to a given sentence. It's not just recall of a word definition, nor is it complex reasoning.
*   **Difficulty vs. Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Typicallity:** This type of fill-in-the-blanks "choose the correct word" question is *extremely common* in Class 6 English textbooks and exams in India. They would have encountered many such exercises.
    *   **Specificity of Rule:** The "some/any" distinction is a fundamental point of early English grammar, typically introduced and practiced. However, mastery varies significantly.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Below 66% (Fundamental Rights):** Naming two Fundamental Rights is pure recall of social science content. While requiring English output, the core information is taught directly. "Some/any" is more nuanced grammar.
*   **Around 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This requires recall of a specific detail from a story. It's relatively straightforward recall once the story is understood. Our question is about applying a *rule*, which can be harder than just remembering a detail.
*   **Around 30% (My favorite season - paragraph):** This is a production task (writing 6-8 lines) requiring sustained coherent English, which is a significant hurdle. Our question is a multiple-choice-like selection, much less demanding in terms of production. This clearly places our question significantly *above* 30%.
*   **Around 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** This requires understanding a concept, differentiating between two types, and giving examples. This is higher-order thinking and concept application/recall in English, more demanding than a single word choice.
*   **Around 5% (Theme of the poem):** This requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and synthesis, and expressing it clearly in English. This is clearly much harder.

**Reasoning for Estimate:**

*   The question tests a very common and foundational grammatical point ("some" vs. "any").
*   The vocabulary and sentence structure are extremely simple.
*   It's a "selection" task, not a "production" task, significantly lowering the barrier compared to writing.
*   However, despite being common, "some/any" is a rule that *can* trip up students, especially those whose primary language doesn't have such a direct equivalent. They might often hear and use "some" correctly in context, but actively selecting it over "any" when given a choice demonstrates rule application.
*   Given that 50% answered a recall question (king's questions) and 66% answered another recall question (Fundamental Rights), this grammatical application is likely to be slightly harder than direct recall for a good number of students, but significantly easier than a production task or complex differentiation.
*   The high frequency of this type of exercise in their curriculum means a fair proportion *should* have encountered and practiced this.

Considering these factors, I'd place it higher than the story recall question (50%) due to its foundational nature and explicit teaching in grammar, but lower than the extremely simple recall for "Fundamental Rights" which are more about social science memorization. The conceptual application here is fairly low-stakes and widely practiced.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **58%**
