Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geographical knowledge:** Students need to know basic geography, specifically what Rajasthan is (a state in India) and general characteristics of its natural environment.
    *   **Concept of "natural resources":** They need to understand what constitutes a natural resource. This is a common social science topic in Class 6.
    *   **Influence/impact:** They need to connect a resource to its effect on people's lives, requiring some basic understanding of human-environment interaction.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   **Keywords:** "Natural resources," "found in Rajasthan," "explain how one of them influences the lives." These are relatively straightforward and common terms in social science.
    *   **Task complexity:** It's a two-part question: identify two resources, then explain the influence of one. The "explain how..." part requires slightly more elaborate sentence construction than simple recall, but the explanation can be quite brief and still score (e.g., "Water is scarce, so people conserve it" or "People use marble for buildings").
    *   **Limited English proficiency:** The phrasing is direct. "Mention any two" is simple. "Explain how one of them influences the lives of the people" is slightly more complex, but manageable. The expectation for a 'pass' score might be quite low for the explanation, potentially accepting very simple connections.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Recall:** Naming two natural resources from Rajasthan is largely recall (or inferential knowledge if they know Rajasthan is a desert state, implying sand, specific minerals, or limited water).
    *   **Application/Reasoning:** Explaining the influence requires a very basic level of application/reasoning. For example, knowing water is scarce and concluding it affects agriculture or daily life. Or knowing about marble quarries and concluding it provides jobs or materials for construction.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This question format (identify X, then explain Y about one of them) is very common in Social Science textbooks and exams.
    *   **Familiarity:** Rajasthan is a prominent state in India, often discussed in geography for its desert, minerals, and historical significance. Its natural resources are frequently highlighted.
    *   **Scoring Rubric:** "Max score: 1" for mentioning two resources AND explaining one influence suggests a relatively low bar for getting the full score, as long as both parts are attempted and mostly correct. The examples for other items (e.g., "My Favorite Season" allowing "Winter\nSweater\nBaju..." for a score of 3) suggest a fairly generous scoring for simple, fragmented responses, which bodes well for this question's second part.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Compared to 5% (Poem Theme):** This question is *significantly easier*. "Theme of a poem" requires deeper analytical thinking, understanding literary nuances, and abstract expression. This resource question is factual recall + basic functional explanation.
*   **Compared to 15% (Archaeological vs. Literary):** This question is likely *easier*. Differentiating two academic concepts with examples requires a more precise understanding of definitions and specific historical context. Naming resources from a state and explaining one impact is more grounded and potentially intuitive for many students (e.g., water in a desert).
*   **Compared to 30% ("My favorite season" paragraph):** This question is *comparable or slightly easier*. While both require explanation/description, "My favorite season" is highly subjective and allows for very basic responses. The resources question has specific correct answers, but the "explanation" can be very simple, and naming two resources is quite direct. The word count requirement for the paragraph might be a hurdle for some.
*   **Compared to 50% (Three questions the king wanted):** This question is *slightly easier or comparable*. "Three questions" is pure recall from a specific story. This question combines recall with a basic explanation. However, general knowledge about Rajasthan's resources (like water scarcity or prominent minerals) might be more accessible than the specific plot details of a particular story for many. The explanation part here can be simpler than perfect recall of three exact questions.
*   **Compared to 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This question is *harder*. Fundamental Rights are a core part of Civics/Political Science and often rote-learned, making it highly recall-based and often achieving high pass rates due to memorization. The current question requires a mix of specific geographical recall and a basic logical connection, which isn't pure memorization in the same way.

**Synthesizing the Difficulty:**
The "mention two resources" part is relatively straightforward.
