Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Implicit:** Understanding the meaning of "important," "real life," and "reason."
    *   **Passage Dependent:** Students must have understood the "Three Questions" story and recalled the king's three questions (which were explicitly asked in a 50% pass rate item). The question "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life?" requires students to apply those questions to a broader, personal context, moving beyond mere recall.
    *   **General World Knowledge:** No specific academic prior knowledge beyond the passage is required. It leans on basic life reasoning.

2.  **Language Demands (for limited English proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Important," "real life," "reason" are relatively common words, though "important" and "reason" require abstract understanding.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason." is a straightforward question with a clear request.
    *   **Abstract Reasoning in English:** This is the most significant language challenge. While the vocabulary is not overly complex, expressing a *reason* for why something is "important in real life" requires students to formulate a thought in English that goes beyond simply repeating facts from the passage. They need to connect the abstract concepts (right time, right people, right thing) to personal relevance. This is more demanding than just listing facts or simple descriptions.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily an **application and reasoning** question.
        *   **Application:** Students apply the abstract ideas of the king's questions to the concept of "real life."
        *   **Reasoning:** They must provide a *reason* for their stance, demonstrating an understanding of *why* these questions might matter. It's not just a yes/no, nor is it merely recalling information from the text.
    *   It sits between a pure recall task (like naming Fundamental Rights, 66% pass rate) and a complex thematic analysis (like "theme of the poem," 5% pass rate). It's more demanding than recalling facts but less abstract than deep literary analysis.

4.  **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Typical Class 7 English textbook exercises often include comprehension questions that require recalling facts, identifying characters, or describing events. Questions that ask for personal opinion or justification ("Do *you* think... Give a reason") are present but might be slightly less frequent than direct factual recall.
    *   Compared to "My favorite season" (30%), this question requires more conceptual understanding. While "My favorite season" also asks for personal details, it's about concrete experiences. "The king's questions" involves more abstract principles.
    *   Compared to "Differentiate archaeological/literary sources" (15%), which is highly factual and academic, this question is more subjective and requires personal insight, yet it's grounded in a story. The differentiation item also has two components for the answer, making it slightly harder to score perfectly.

**Difficulty Analysis & Calibration:**

*   **Anchor comparison:**
    *   **66% pass rate (Fundamental Rights):** Pure recall, no complex reasoning. Easier.
    *   **50% pass rate (King's three questions):** Pure recall, direct from passage. Slightly easier than the target question. Our target question builds on this by requiring *application* of these recalled questions.
    *   **30% pass rate (My favorite season):** Personal, requires basic descriptive writing. While subjective, it's about concrete experiences. Our target question involves slightly more abstract thought and justification of an abstract principle. This feels like a good upper bound for the difficulty.
    *   **15% pass rate (Differentiate sources):** Factual, academic, multi-part, specific terminology. Clearly harder.
    *   **5% pass rate (Theme of poem):** Highly abstract, difficult to articulate. Much harder.

*   The question asks for a subjective opinion but then demands a "reason," which requires a small degree of explanatory coherence in English.
*   The concepts are not highly complex (right time, right people, right thing are relatable). The challenge lies in connecting them to "real life" and expressing a valid justification.
*   Given that the *questions themselves* were identified by 50% of students in a previous item, this means a significant portion already grasp the core information. The extra step is the application and justification.
*   Students from economically weaker sections, while limited in English, can often relate to practical life wisdom. The king's questions are essentially practical wisdom.
