The problem asks students to calculate a new temperature given an initial temperature, a rate of change, and a duration.

Here's a contrastive analysis:

*   **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   **Time:** Students need to understand how to calculate the difference between times (e.g., from 10 am to 4 pm). This involves understanding a 12-hour clock (and possibly translating to a 24-hour clock mentally) and simple subtraction/counting hours. This is fundamental time calculation, typically covered by Class 3-4.
    *   **Basic Arithmetic:** Students need to perform simple multiplication ($6 \times 2$) and addition ($30 + 12$). These are fundamental operations covered in earlier grades.
    *   **Units:** Understanding what degrees Celsius means for temperature, though the core calculation doesn't depend heavily on a deep scientific understanding of temperature, just the numerical values.
*   **Language Demands:**
    *   "at 10 am in the morning," "temperature," "increases by 2^0 C per hour," "what will be the temperature," "at 4:00 in the evening."
    *   The language is fairly straightforward for a math problem. The words used are common vocabulary, and the structure is typical for word problems. "Increases by per hour" is a common phrase to indicate a rate of change.
*   **Type of Task:** This is an **application** task, requiring students to:
    1.  **Calculate duration:** From 10 am to 4 pm.
    2.  **Calculate total change:** Multiply the hourly change by the duration.
    3.  **Calculate final value:** Add the total change to the initial value.
    This involves multiple steps but each step is computationally simple. It is not rote recall. It does involve reasoning in terms of connecting the rate to the time and applying the operations in the correct order.
*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:** This is a very common type of word problem found in Class 5-6 mathematics textbooks in India. These types of problems, involving time differences and rates, are standard. It's likely many students would have encountered similar problems before.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of a poem:** Requires high-level comprehension, abstract thought, and expressive writing, extremely difficult for this demographic. Our target question is much easier.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate archaeological/literary sources:** Requires understanding abstract historical concepts and analytical comparison. Again, much harder than our problem.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): "My favorite season" paragraph:** Requires creative writing, sentence construction, and paragraph organization. While the content is familiar, the writing demands are high. Our problem only requires numerical calculation.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer:** This is a recall question from a specific story. Students who know the story can answer it. Our question requires simple multi-step arithmetic, which might be harder for some than direct recall if they remember the story, but probably easier if they need to infer. The pass rate indicates that about half the students recall the key details from the story.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name two Fundamental Rights:** This is also a recall question, from civics. The concepts are relatively concrete ("right to equality," "right to freedom"), and many students might have memorized these. It's often taught directly. This suggests a solid majority can recall basic factual information when it's part of the curriculum.

**Conclusion:**

The temperature problem combines two very common skills: time calculation and multi-step arithmetic involving rates. Each component is elementary. The language is simple. Given that a significant proportion of students (50-66%) can answer recall-based questions, and a lower proportion (30%) can do multi-sentence composition, our question, being a fairly standard two-step math problem, should fall in the upper-middle range.

Students who struggle are likely to make errors in:
1.  **Time calculation:** Miscounting hours between 10 am and 4 pm (e.g., saying 5 hours or 7 hours).
2.  **Order of operations:** Forgetting to multiply before adding, or performing operations incorrectly.
3.  **Calculation errors:** Simple arithmetic mistakes ($6 \times 2 = 10$, or $30 + 12 = 40$).

Compared to the "Favorite Season" item (30%), this math problem is more structured and objective, potentially leading to a higher pass rate if students grasp the steps. Compared to the "King's questions" (50%) or "Fundamental Rights"
