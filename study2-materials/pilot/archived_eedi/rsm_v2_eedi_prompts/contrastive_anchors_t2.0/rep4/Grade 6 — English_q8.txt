Here's an analysis of the target question compared to the anchors, followed by an estimate:

## Contrastive Analysis of Target Question: "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence: book/reading/a/is/he"

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Target Question:** Assumes basic understanding of English sentence structure (subject-verb-object) for a simple declarative sentence. Students need to know what constitutes a subject pronoun, a helping verb, a main verb, and an object noun phrase (article + noun). It also assumes knowledge of common words: 'he', 'is', 'reading', 'a', 'book'. These are very high-frequency words typically introduced early in English instruction.
*   **Comparison to Anchors:**
    *   **5% Anchor (Poem theme):** Assumes high-level comprehension of a specific poem, ability to infer abstract themes, and express them coherently in English. Much more complex prior knowledge and language skill.
    *   **15% Anchor (Archaeological vs. Literary):** Assumes knowledge of history concepts (archaeological/literary sources) and the ability to differentiate and provide examples. Requires recall of specific learned content.
    *   **30% Anchor (My favorite season):** Assumes personal experience, ability to brainstorm relevant details, and construct a short paragraph. More open-ended, but still requires sentence formation and thematic coherence.
    *   **50% Anchor (King's questions):** Assumes recall of specific details from a story or text. The text would likely have been provided or previously studied. Less language demands if direct recall is possible.
    *   **66% Anchor (Fundamental Rights):** Assumes recall of specific factual information (Fundamental Rights) from civics/social science. Often rote memorization. Minimal sentence structure needed beyond listing.

**2. Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
*   **Target Question:**
    *   **Low Vocabulary Load:** All words ('book', 'reading', 'a', 'is', 'he') are highly basic and frequently encountered in Class 6 English curriculum.
    *   **Grammar:** The core grammar required is subject-verb-object, which is foundational. The structure is direct and does not involve complex clauses or tenses (present continuous, but for a common action).
    *   **Cognitive Load:** Primarily analytical and synthetic. Students need to understand the function of each word and assemble them correctly. This is less about comprehending a long passage and more about manipulating discrete elements.
*   **Comparison to Anchors:**
    *   **5% Anchor:** Extremely high language demands – abstract vocabulary ('theme', 'central idea'), complex sentence construction to express abstract concepts.
    *   **15% Anchor:** High language demands – specific academic vocabulary ('differentiate', 'archaeological', 'literary', 'sources'), need to articulate a comparison and provide examples clearly.
    *   **30% Anchor:** Moderate language demands – requires generating original sentences, linking ideas, and sustaining a paragraph, albeit on a familiar topic.
    *   **50% Anchor:** Moderate language demands – primarily recall, but formulating the questions still requires correct English sentence structure.
    *   **66% Anchor:** Low language demands – mostly direct recall of terms. "Right to equality" is a fixed phrase. This item is easier due to its fixed vocabulary and minimal need for novel sentence construction.

**3. Is this Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
*   **Target Question:** This is primarily **application** of grammatical rules and basic sentence structure. Students apply their knowledge of how English sentences are formed to an unfamiliar combination of words. It also involves a degree of **reasoning** (identifying the subject, verb, and object, and ordering them logically). It is not direct recall.
*   **Comparison to Anchors:**
    *   **5% Anchor:** Primarily **reasoning** (inferring theme) and **application** (expressing it).
    *   **15% Anchor:** **Recall** (definitions) and **application** (differentiation, examples).
    *   **30% Anchor:** **Application** (paragraph writing based on personal experience) and some **reasoning** (organizing thoughts).
    *   **50% Anchor:** Predominantly **recall** (specific facts from a text).
    *   **66% Anchor:** Pure **recall** (memorized facts).

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
*   **Target Question:** This type of rearrangement exercise is *extremely common* in Class 6 English textbooks in India. It's a staple exercise designed to reinforce basic sentence structure (S-V-O). Students would have done many such exercises. It
