This is an interesting question, as it tests a grammatical concept rather than content knowledge, and active/passive voice can be tricky for second-language learners. Let's break it down using the provided calibration anchors.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Core Concept:** Understanding of active and passive voice. This is a standard grammar topic typically introduced around Class 6 or 7 in English curricula.
    *   **Grammatical Structures:** Knowledge of subject, verb, and object, and how they rearrange. Understanding of auxiliary verbs ("to be") and past participles.
    *   **Vocabulary:** The words "wind," "blew," "leaves," "away" are all very common, high-frequency words that Class 7 students would likely know. The instruction "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice" also uses standard grammatical terminology.

2.  **Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** The words in the sentence and the instruction itself are relatively simple and common, which helps.
    *   **Syntax/Structure:** This is the primary challenge. Transforming a sentence from active to passive voice requires understanding how to identify the object of the active sentence (which becomes the subject of the passive), how to choose the correct form of "to be" (matching the tense of the active verb and the new subject), and how to form the past participle of the main verb. The irregular past tense "blew" transforming to the past participle "blown" adds a layer of complexity for non-native speakers who might struggle with irregular verbs.
    *   **Instruction Comprehension:** The instruction "Change... from Active Voice to Passive Voice" is direct but requires knowing what these terms mean. If a student doesn't grasp "active voice" or "passive voice," they won't even know what to do.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of grammatical rules. Students aren't just recalling a definition; they are applying a transformation rule to a specific sentence.
    *   It also involves some **recall** of the past participle form of "blow."

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very common type of exercise found in grammar sections of textbooks. It's a foundational skill for understanding different sentence structures.
    *   The sentence itself ("The wind blew the leaves away.") is fairly straightforward: one simple clause, a direct object, an irregular verb. It's not overly complex in terms of subordinate clauses or multiple verbs, which would make it harder.
    *   However, compared to the anchors, it's testing a specific grammatical manipulation that many might *struggle to perfectly execute* if their formal grammar instruction has been weak or if they lack consistent practice in English.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): "Write a theme..."** This requires high-level analytical comprehension, interpretation, and expression. Much harder than grammar.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..."** This requires understanding specific social science terminology, recall of definitions, and ability to compare/contrast with examples. Requires domain-specific knowledge.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): "Write a short paragraph... on 'My favorite season.'"** This tests expressive writing, content generation, and basic sentence construction. Students often get some points for relevant sentences, even if grammatically imperfect. The hurdle is producing 6-8 *meaningful* lines. The grammar manipulation is much more rigid than open-ended writing.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"** This is a direct recall question from a specific text ("Three Questions" by Tolstoy). If they read the story, they *might* remember these key plot points. The challenge is often recall accuracy and expressing them in English. This is simpler English recall.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): "Name any two Fundamental Rights..."** This is direct recall of specific civic information. There's a high probability many would have memorized at least two. The English required is minimal – just naming them.

**Estimating the Proportion Correct:**

*   The question on fundamental rights (66%) is simple recall.
*   The "king's three questions" (50%) is also recall, but slightly more complex phrasing might be needed.
*   The paragraph writing (30%) allows for partial credit even with errors.

The passive voice transformation requires precise grammatical execution:
1.  Identifying the object ("the leaves").
2.  Making it the new subject ("The leaves").
3.  Choosing the
