Here's a detailed analysis to estimate the proportion of correct answers for the question "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'."

## Contrastive Analysis: 'My Favourite Hobby' vs. Calibration Anchors

**Target Question: Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about 'My Favourite Hobby'. Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it.**
*Max score: 1 (Complete paragraph meeting criteria)*

### Key Considerations:

1.  **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students need to understand the concept of a "hobby." This is a relatively common concept even for children from diverse backgrounds, as activities for leisure or personal enjoyment are universal. They need to have at least one hobby in mind.
    *   **Compared to anchors:**
        *   "Theme of poem": Requires deeper textual analysis and abstract understanding. (Harder)
        *   "Archaeological/Literary sources": Requires specific social science concepts. (Harder)
        *   "My favorite season": Similar, but "season" is concrete and experienced by everyone. (Similar/Slightly easier as the prompt gave more guidance - "what you like to do, what you eat or wear").
        *   "King's three questions": Requires recalling specific plot points from a story they may or may not have read recently. (Depends on recency bias, could be similar difficulty).
        *   "Fundamental Rights": Requires specific civics knowledge. (Harder)

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   **Limited English:**
        *   **Vocabulary:** "Paragraph," "favourite," "hobby," "mention," "enjoy" are all relatively common words, though "paragraph" and "mention" might be less frequent for those with very limited exposure. "Hobby" itself could be challenging for some, as they might have activities but not know the English term.
        *   **Sentence Structure:** Students need to construct 4-5 coherent sentences, connecting them to form a paragraph. This requires basic grammatical accuracy (subject-verb agreement, tense) and linking words (and, because, so, when).
        *   **Clarity:** The prompt clearly defines what to include (what it is, when, why). This provides a strong scaffold.
    *   **Compared to anchors:**
        *   "Theme of poem": Requires sophisticated vocabulary to express abstract ideas and analytical sentence structures. (Much Harder)
        *   "Archaeological/Literary sources": Requires precise comparative language and definitions. (Harder)
        *   "My favorite season": Very similar language demands. "Write a short paragraph" is identical instruction. The details requested are similar ("what you like to do, what you eat or wear").
        *   "King's three questions": Recall specific phrasing, but doesn't require paragraph construction. (Simpler language structure, harder content recall).
        *   "Fundamental Rights": Short, declarative sentences. Less complex. (Simpler language structure, harder content recall).

3.  **Type of Task (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   **This question:** Primarily **personal application** and **expression**. Students apply the concept of a "hobby" to their own life and express their thoughts. It's not rote recall.
    *   **Compared to anchors:**
        *   "Theme of poem": High-level **reasoning** and interpretation. (Harder)
        *   "Archaeological/Literary sources": **Recall** of definitions and **application** of examples. (Harder due to specific content).
        *   "My favorite season": Very similar **personal application/expression**. (Direct comparator).
        *   "King's three questions": Pure **recall** of plot details. (Different skill).
        *   "Fundamental Rights": Pure **recall** of factual information. (Different skill).

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   "Write about your hobby" is a very common type of English language writing exercise at the primary and lower secondary levels globally. It's designed to encourage personal expression and practice basic paragraph construction.
    *   **Compared to anchors:**
        *   "My favorite season" (Pass rate 30%) is an *excellent* direct comparator. The structure, length, and personal nature are nearly identical. The only minor difference is the 'season' prompt gave slightly more explicit sub-points ("what you like to do, what you eat or wear"), whereas 'hobby' gives ("what it is, when you do it, why you enjoy it"). Both are straightforward.
        *   The 30% item (My Favorite Season) had responses like "Winter\nSweater\nBaju\nHot water
