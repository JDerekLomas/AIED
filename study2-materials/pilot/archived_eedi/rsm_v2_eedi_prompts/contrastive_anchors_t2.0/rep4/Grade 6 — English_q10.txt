**Contrastive Analysis of the Question:**

Let's break down the difficulty of "Choose the correct word. There are (some/any) apples in the basket." for Class 6 Indian government school students.

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic understanding of nouns (apples, basket).
    *   Rudimentary grasp of countability (apples are countable).
    *   Implicit knowledge of affirmative sentence structures. The main "knowledge" tested is the usage of 'some' vs. 'any'.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** Extremely basic and common words ('are', 'in', 'the', 'apples', 'basket'). These are likely within the productive vocabulary of most Class 6 students, even those with limited English.
    *   **Grammar/Syntax:** Simple sentence structure (Subject-verb-object/complement). The challenge lies in distinguishing 'some' and 'any', which is a grammatical rule often taught explicitly.
    *   **Cognitive Load:** Low. It's a fill-in-the-blank style question with only two options, making it a straightforward choice. There's no complex sentence parsing or inference required.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   Primarily **application** of a specific grammatical rule. Students need to recall the rule regarding 'some' for affirmative statements and 'any' for negative statements or questions, and then apply it to the given sentence. It's not just rote recall of a word definition, but applying a learned grammatical pattern.

*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very *common and standard* type of exercise for Class 5-6 English grammar. 'Some' and 'any' are fundamental parts of elementary English curricula. They would encounter numerous such fill-in-the-blanks or multiple-choice questions in their textbooks and worksheets.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."** This requires higher-order thinking (synthesis, interpretation of abstract concepts), strong comprehension of a poem (potentially unseen or poorly understood), and the ability to articulate complex ideas in English. The target question is significantly easier as it's a closed, concrete grammar rule.

*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources...** This demands recall of specific historical terminology, understanding of distinct categories, and the ability to provide examples. While requiring some domain-specific knowledge, the structure of definition + example is also common. The target question is arguably easier as it's a single word choice from two options.

*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season."** This involves generating original content, structuring a paragraph, expanding on ideas, and using descriptive language, all while adhering to a line count. This is a much higher language production and ideation task. The target question is trivial in comparison.

*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This requires recall of specific details from a story. While direct recall, it depends on prior story comprehension and memory. The fact that an empty response or partial recall is common suggests a comprehension gap for many. The target question is about applying a fixed rule, not recalling a story detail, which might be more universally accessible if the rule has been taught.

*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India.** This is direct recall of factual information from civics. Many students, even with limited English, might memorize such lists if it's a key curriculum topic. The English required to *state* the names of rights (e.g., "Right to equality") is quite low-level. The target question also relies on recalling a rule, but for a fundamental grammatical concept rather than specific civic facts. It's plausible many students would be taught 'some'/'any' rules earlier and more frequently than precise lists of Fundamental Rights.

**Conclusion:**

The question about "some/any" is extremely foundational.
*   The vocabulary is basic.
*   The grammatical concept (some for affirmative, any for negative/question) is a cornerstone of early English learning.
*   It's a discrete skill, not requiring sustained writing or complex thought.
*   It's the kind of item that, if the concept has been taught even minimally, offers a clear right or wrong answer without much ambiguity or need for nuance.

Given its simplicity, the prevalence of this grammatical rule in elementary curricula, and the binary choice, this question should be much easier than creative writing, abstract interpretation, or multi-point recall of
