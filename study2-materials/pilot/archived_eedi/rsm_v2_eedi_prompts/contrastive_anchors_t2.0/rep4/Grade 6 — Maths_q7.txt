I will break down the analysis of the target question's difficulty and then provide the estimated proportion correct.

## Analysis of the Target Question:

**Question:** At `10` am in the morning, the temperature of Jodhpur was `30^0 C`. If the temperature increases by `2^0 C` per hour, then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?

### What prior knowledge is assumed?

*   **Time calculation:** Students need to understand how to calculate the duration between two given times (10 am to 4 pm). This involves understanding "am" and "pm" and possibly crossing the 12 o'clock noon mark. Basic subtraction or counting skills are needed for hours.
*   **Basic arithmetic:** Addition (for adding temperature increases) and multiplication (for total temperature increase: hours * rate per hour).
*   **Contextual understanding:** Understanding temperature as a numerical value and "increases by" as addition.
*   **Implicit understanding of units:** Though not explicitly asked to include units in the answer, they should understand what `^0 C` means and that the answer will be in those units.

### What language demands does it place on students with limited English?

*   **Vocabulary:**
    *   "temperature"
    *   "increases by"
    *   "per hour"
    *   "morning," "evening" (distinction between am/pm)
*   **Sentence structure:** The sentence structure is relatively straightforward. "At X time, Y temperature. If Z increases per hour, what at T time?" This is a common pattern for word problems.
*   **Phrasing of the question:** "what will be the temperature" is clear.

Compared to the calibration items:
*   "Theme or central idea" (5%): Very high language demand, abstract concept.
*   "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources" (15%): High academic vocabulary, specific discipline-related terms, analytical thinking.
*   "Write a short paragraph...on My favorite season" (30%): Demands extended written English, creative expression.
*   "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%): Requires recall of a specific detail from a text, moderately demanding.
*   "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66%): Requires recall of specific civic facts, names of rights. The terms "Fundamental Rights" are specific, but "Right to equality" or "Right to freedom" are simpler English concepts than archaeological/literary sources.

The language in the target math question is simpler and more concrete than the 5%, 15%, and 30% items. It's more on par with the 50% item (which tested recall, not problem-solving). "Increases by" and "per hour" are key phrases but are very standard in math word problems. The most challenging linguistic aspect might be correctly parsing "10 am in the morning" and "4:00 in the evening" to correctly calculate time difference for students unfamiliar with Western clock conventions. However, time telling and calculations are fundamental at this grade level.

### Is this recall, application, or reasoning?

*   **Application:** This is a classic application problem. It requires students to apply their knowledge of:
    *   Time calculation
    *   Multiplication
    *   Addition
    *   To a real-world (albeit simplified) scenario.
*   It's not pure recall, as they need to perform calculations. It's not high-level abstract reasoning, but it does require sequential logical steps.

### How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?

This type of word problem (rate, time, and initial value to final value) is extremely common in Class 6 mathematics textbooks in India and globally. It represents a fundamental problem-solving skill introduced around this age.
*   **Complexity:** It's a two-step problem:
    1.  Calculate time duration (6 hours).
    2.  Calculate total temperature increase (6 * 2 = 12°C).
    3.  Calculate final temperature (30 + 12 = 42°C).

Many students would approach it as 30 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2, which also works but is less efficient.

**Potential Pitfalls:**
*   **Time calculation error:** Miscounting hours (e.g., 10 am to 4 pm being 5 hours instead of 6). This is the most likely error for this specific group, especially if they are not entirely fluent with clock arithmetic across noon. 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 1 -> 2 ->
