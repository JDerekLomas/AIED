This question is from Social Science, specifically Geography/Environmental Studies, a subject typically taught in Class 6. Let's break down its difficulty.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   **Assumed:** Students are expected to know what "natural resources" are (basic definition) and have some geographical knowledge of Rajasthan (where it is, some general characteristics of the region). They should be able to recall at least two natural resources associated with the state. This is direct recall of geographical facts.
    *   **Comparison to anchors:**
        *   **Lower than 5% (Poem theme):** That requires deep comprehension, interpretation, and synthesis of literary ideas, which is much harder for language-limited students.
        *   **Similar to/slightly higher than 15% (Archaeological vs Literary sources):** This anchor also requires recalling specific definitions and examples from history. The current question asks for *two* resources and then *explains* one influence. The "explanation" part adds a layer of complexity.
        *   **Lower than 30% ("My favorite season"):** That is a personal essay, allowing for a wide range of vocabulary and simple sentence structures, and doesn't require specific factual recall, only creative expression within a given theme. The prompt also provided strong scaffolding for what to write about.
        *   **Lower than 50% ("King's three questions"):** This is a specific recall from a story likely read in their English textbook. It's about remembering key plot points, often memorized directly.
        *   **Lower than 66% (Fundamental Rights):** That's direct recall of very fundamental concepts, often repeated. The question asks for *any two*, which provides flexibility.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   "Mention any two natural resources": "Mention" is a relatively straightforward verb. "Natural resources" is a core concept that they likely encounter repeatedly in science/social science textbooks, often alongside examples.
    *   "found in Rajasthan": Specific geographical context.
    *   "and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there": The word "explain" is key here. It requires more than just listing. They need to articulate a cause-and-effect relationship between a resource and human life. This is the trickiest part from a language perspective, requiring functional English to form coherent sentences about influence. However, common influences (e.g., water -> farming, lack of water -> hardship) might be expressed simply. "Influences" might be a moderately difficult vocabulary word for some.
    *   **Comparison to anchors:** The language demand is higher than "King's three questions" (pure recall) and "Fundamental Rights" (pure recall of proper nouns/phrases). It's somewhat comparable to the "differentiate" and "explain" component of the "Archaeological vs Literary" item, where specific definitions need to be articulated. The "Poem theme" question's language demand is *much* higher due to abstract ideas. "My favorite season" allows for very simple, conversational language.

*   **Type of Task:**
    *   Part 1 (Mention two resources): **Recall**
    *   Part 2 (Explain influence): **Application/Reasoning** – requires understanding a concept (influence) and applying it to a specific resource in a specific region. It's not complex reasoning, more a direct consequence.

*   **Difficulty compared to typical textbook exercises:**
    *   Listing natural resources of a region is a very common textbook exercise.
    *   Explaining their influence is also common, but requires slightly more independent thought and articulation than just naming. The phrasing "how one of them influences the lives of the people there" is a standard question type to test understanding beyond mere memorization. Rajasthan being a prominent Indian state, its natural resources and the impact of its arid climate are frequently discussed.

**Analysis of potential responses:**

*   Many students might be able to list two resources, even if only basic ones like "water" or "sand."
*   The "explanation" part is where many might struggle. They might give very rudimentary explanations (e.g., "Water is important for life") or provide examples without explicitly linking it to "influence" or "lives of people." However, partial credit could be given if the idea is conveyed.
*   Given the single maximum score for *both* parts, a correct mention of two resources *and* a passable explanation of influence is needed. Students who only list resources will not get full credit.
*   The resources are plentiful in Rajasthan, making recall easier.

**Recalibrating with anchors:**

*   The need for *both* recall and explanation elevates it above pure recall tasks like "King's questions" (
