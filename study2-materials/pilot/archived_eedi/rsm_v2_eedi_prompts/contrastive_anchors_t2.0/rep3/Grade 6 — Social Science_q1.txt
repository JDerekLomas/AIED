Here's a breakdown of the question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" and my estimate of the pass rate:

## Contrastive Analysis:

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Difficulty:** Low. This question assumes basic geographical knowledge of India, specifically identifying major physical features. Mountain ranges are typically introduced early in Social Science/Geography curricula at this level. Students would have likely seen these on a physical map of India.
*   **Comparison to anchors:**
    *   *Easier than Theme/Central Idea (5%) and Differentiate Sources (15%):* These require abstract thinking, interpretation, and complex factual recall/application.
    *   *Similar to Three Questions (50%) and Fundamental Rights (66%):* These are direct recall of factual information often presented in lists or as key points. The 'Three Questions' relies on remembering specifics from a story, and 'Fundamental Rights' relies on memorizing specific constitutional provisions.

**2. Language Demands (limited English proficiency):**
*   **Difficulty:** Very Low.
    *   "Name any two" is a very common and simple instruction.
    *   "major mountain ranges" - "Major" is a common adjective, "mountain" is a basic noun, and "ranges" (in the context of mountains) is also fairly straightforward. The question doesn't use complex sentence structures or obscure vocabulary.
    *   "located in India" - clear and unambiguous.
*   **Comparison to anchors:**
    *   *Much easier than Theme/Central Idea (5%) and Differentiate Sources (15%):* These have significant linguistic hurdles, requiring students to articulate complex ideas or comparisons. "Theme" requires understanding a relatively abstract concept in English. "Differentiate" is a higher-level command word.
    *   *Similar or slightly easier than Fundamental Rights (66%) and Three Questions (50%):* These still require understanding the context of rights or a story plot, even if the question itself is simple. "Mountain ranges" is a more concrete and visually understandable concept for English language learners compared to abstract 'rights' or a specific literary plot.
    *   *Easier than Short Paragraph (30%)*: That question explicitly requires sustained writing and adherence to specific prompts, which is linguistically very demanding.

**3. Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
*   **Difficulty:** Pure Recall. This is a direct factual recall question. Students either know the names of mountain ranges in India or they don't. There's no application or reasoning involved.
*   **Comparison to anchors:**
    *   *Recall like Fundamental Rights (66%) and Three Questions (50%):* These are all recall.
    *   *Unlike Theme (5%), Differentiate Sources (15%), or Short Paragraph (30%):* These involve higher-order thinking, application, or structured creative expression.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
*   **Difficulty:** Very typical and common. Naming geographical features like mountain ranges, rivers, plains, etc., is a standard, fundamental exercise in Class 6 Social Science/Geography textbooks in India. It's usually one of the first things taught about the physical features of the country. Students would likely encounter this repeatedly through maps and text.

## Additional Considerations:
*   **Visibility on Maps:** Major Indian mountain ranges (Himalayas, Aravallis, Vindhyas, Western/Eastern Ghats) are prominently displayed on physical maps of India, which are ubiquitous in textbooks and classrooms. Even if students struggle with English, visual recognition can aid recall.
*   **Minimum Requirement:** The rubric requires only *one* correct mountain range for a 0.5 score (implying the "proportion correct" refers to anyone getting at least 0.5 points). Naming even one major range like "Himalayas" or "Aravalli" is quite basic.
*   **Likelihood of exposure:** Himalayan mountain range in particular is taught across subjects (eg History - as a natural boundary). Other ranges like the Western and Eastern Ghats are important for local geography and often appear in context.

## Estimate:

Given that this is a direct recall question, with very low language demands, and covers fundamental, visually reinforced geographical knowledge, it should perform significantly better than the average item pass rate (29%) and much closer to the high-pass recall items. The "Name any two" instruction for easily identifiable features should make this accessible to a very large proportion of students who have received basic geography instruction. The low bar of "one correct" name makes it even more forgiving.

I believe this question would perform similar to or slightly better than "Name any two Fundamental Rights" (66%), because geography terms are often more concrete and visually
