This question is assessing basic reading comprehension from an unknown source text. Since no source text is provided, the students are unable to answer this question. The question relies entirely on direct recall of information from a presumably previously read story.

Let's break down the difficulties:

*   **Prior Knowledge:** No prior knowledge is assumed *beyond* having read the source text. However, since the source text isn't given, students cannot apply this knowledge. This immediately makes the question impossible to answer correctly for anyone.
*   **Language Demands:** The English used in the question "Who lived inside the book?" is very simple, basic Class 6 level. The words "who," "lived," "inside," and "book" are likely all within their vocabulary. If they *had* read a story containing this information, the language wouldn't be a barrier.
*   **Cognitive Demand:** This is purely a recall question. It does not require application, reasoning, or critical thinking, only memory of a specific detail from a text.
*   **Difficulty Compared to Textbook Exercises:** If the students had just read a story in their textbook, a question like "Who lived inside the book?" would be a very easy, low-level comprehension question, similar to finding a fact directly stated in the text. However, in this context (an isolated question without the source text), it becomes impossible.

**Crucial Point:** The fundamental issue is the *absence of the source text*. Without the story from which this question is drawn, it's impossible for *any* student to know the answer. A "magical fairy" is a very specific detail.

Considering this, the *only* way a student could "answer" this correctly is by pure guessing, or by recalling a story they might have coincidentally read elsewhere that matches this very specific detail. Given that this is an exam item designed to test comprehension of a *specific* text (which is not provided), guessing is not a reliable path to a correct answer for a significant portion of students.

Therefore, the proportion of students who would correctly answer this by chance is extremely low, likely 0%, as "a magical fairy" is a highly specific and unlikely guess. The pass rates of the calibration anchors highlight that even relatively straightforward recall items from *provided* texts don't always yield perfect scores (e.g., "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" - 50%).

If this question *was* preceded by the story, and the answer was clearly stated, it would likely fall into the 50-66% pass rate range due to its simplicity. But without it, it effectively tests nothing but the student's ability to pull information from thin air.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 0%**
