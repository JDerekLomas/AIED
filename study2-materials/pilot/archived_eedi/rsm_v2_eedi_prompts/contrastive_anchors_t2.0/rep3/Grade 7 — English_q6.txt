**Contrastive Analysis of the Question:**

Let's break down the difficulties of "Describes the poet’s writing style" compared to the anchor items:

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Low Difficulty:** Requires some basic understanding of what a "writing style" entails. This is generally covered in literary analysis or comprehension lessons, even at a basic level, when students are asked to consider how an author writes.
    *   **Hidden Complexity:** While the concept might be introduced, actually articulating *how* a poet writes (e.g., "simple," "descriptive," "informal") requires more sophisticated understanding and vocabulary than just identifying factual information. Many students, especially those struggling with English, might understand "what the poet wrote" but struggle with "how they wrote it."
    *   **Dependence on unseen text:** This question implies students have just read a poem and are now asked to comment on its style. The difficulty depends entirely on the simplicity and distinctiveness of that specific poem's style, which isn't provided here. Assuming a relatively straightforward poem (as is common for Class 7), the style might be generally "simple" or "descriptive."

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **"Describes":** This is a fairly common verb, but students need to understand it means "to tell about" or "to give the characteristics of."
    *   **"Poet's writing style":** This phrase is key. "Poet's" is possessive, "writing style" is a specific literary term. Students with limited English might understand "poet" and "writing," but "style" in this context (as opposed to fashion style) could be confusing. They might know the *word* "style" but not its literary application.
    *   **Required Output:** The rubric asks for a "suitable and relevant word describing the writing style (e.g., simple, descriptive, informal, direct)." Generating such a word requires a decent vocabulary related to literary analysis, which is likely a significant barrier for students with limited English. They might be able to *recognize* simple words but struggle to *produce* appropriate descriptive adjectives on their own. This moves beyond basic recall.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application and basic reasoning**, leaning heavily on **vocabulary**. It's not a direct recall of facts like "three questions the king wanted to answer." It requires reading a text, identifying its manner of presentation, and then applying an appropriate descriptive term.
    *   It's less about complex reasoning than differentiating between sources (15% item) and more about vocabulary and concept application.

*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   In many Hindi-medium schools, "writing style" analysis might be present but often translated into simpler terms or focuses on identifying specific literary devices (like rhyme or repetition) rather than overarching stylistic descriptions.
    *   Exercises are more likely to be multiple-choice (e.g., "The poet's style is A) Simple B) Complex C) Funny") rather than open-ended production of descriptive words.
    *   Therefore, asking students to *produce* an appropriate descriptive word without prompts is likely more challenging than typical exercises.

**Anchor Item Comparison:**

*   **vs. 5% item (Theme):** The 5% item requires understanding abstract concepts and articulating a "theme" from a poem, which is a high-level interpretive skill, often poorly understood. "Writing style" is arguably slightly less abstract than "theme" but still challenging. The 5% item's rubric for a '1' score allows for fragmented or incomplete understanding, but this question's rubric requires a "suitable and relevant *word*."
*   **vs. 15% item (Differentiate sources):** This item requires understanding two distinct concepts, recalling their definitions, and providing an example. It's a structured knowledge recall and application task. "Writing style" is a single concept but requires abstract description, making it different but potentially in a similar difficulty range as articulating two distinct concepts *with* examples. The scoring on the 15% item (up to 2 points) might allow for partial understanding.
*   **vs. 30% item ("My favorite season"):** This is a paragraph writing task requiring creative expression and basic structure. Students might write short, broken sentences, but they can still earn points for expressing *something*. The vocabulary burden here is high ("write a short paragraph"), but the *ideas* are simple and personal. Our target question requires specific academic vocabulary.
*   **vs. 50% item (King's questions):** This is pure factual recall from a text, albeit requiring the extraction of specific details. The main challenge is finding
