Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis: "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence: book/reading/a/is/he"

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Word Recognition:** Students must recognize the individual words: "book," "reading," "a," "is," "he." These are very common words taught early in English language learning.
    *   **Basic Sentence Structure (Subject-Verb-Object):** This is fundamental to English. They need to implicitly understand that "he" is the doer (subject), "is reading" is the action (verb phrase), and "a book" is what is being acted upon (object).
    *   **Grammatical Concepts:** They don't need to *name* parts of speech, but intuitively understand that "is reading" goes together.

**2. Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** All words are high-frequency and very basic. "Book," "reading," "is," "he" are typically among the first words taught. "a" is also a common article.
    *   **Grammatical Complexity:** The sentence structure is extremely simple (S-V-O). There are no complex tenses, subordinate clauses, or abstract concepts.
    *   **Task Understanding:** "Rearrange the words to make a meaningful sentence" is a common instructional phrase in English exercises. While it might take a moment to process, the brevity and clear example should help them understand the goal.
    *   **Writing/Transcription:** They just need to write out the words in order, not generate new content.

**3. Is this Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
    *   **Application/Reasoning (Light):** It's not direct recall. They need to *apply* their knowledge of English word order to create a grammatical and meaningful sentence. The "reasoning" is about putting the pieces into a sensible structure. It's a very low-level application of grammatical rules.

**4. How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   **Easy Side of Typical:** This is a very common type of exercise for beginners learning sentence formation in English. It would typically appear early in Class 4 or 5 English textbooks. For Class 6, this would likely be seen as a warm-up or review activity.

## Comparison to Calibration Anchors:

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain."** Highly challenging. Requires comprehension of a poem (potentially unseen/new vocabulary), abstract thought (identifying theme), and ability to express it coherently in English. Much harder.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources.** Requires specific historical knowledge, analytical comparison, and ability to articulate differences and examples in English. Far more challenging.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Short paragraph on "My favorite season."** Requires sentence construction, vocabulary generation (what they eat/wear/do), paragraph structuring, and creative writing, all within a specific word count. The content is personal, which might make it slightly easier for some, but the sustained English writing is a significant hurdle. This question is significantly easier than generating a paragraph.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer.** This is a recall question based on a specific story. Success depends heavily on whether they studied that particular story and remembered the specific details. The *output* (list three things) is simple, but the *input* (story recall) is variable. This question (rearrange) is arguably more universally accessible because it relies on fundamental grammar, not specific content recall. The words are very familiar.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights.** This is pure recall of specific factual information taught in Social Science/Civics. The output is minimal. The success rate hinges entirely on whether they learned and remembered those rights. If they know them, it's very easy; if not, impossible. Our target question requires fundamental grammatical understanding, which is likely to be somewhat known across the board, even if imperfectly. The provided words are common.

**Synthesis:**

This "rearrange the words" question is foundational. The vocabulary is extremely basic, and the sentence structure is the simplest S-V-O. There are no complex ideas or nuanced meanings to extract. Students who have *any* exposure to English (which they would, as Class 6) would likely recognize the words and have an intuitive grasp of where "he," "is reading," and "a book" fit.

Compared to the 50% "King's questions" item, where specific story recall is crucial
