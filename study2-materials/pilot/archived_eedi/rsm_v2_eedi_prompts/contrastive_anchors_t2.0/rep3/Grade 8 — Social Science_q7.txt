Okay, let's break down the question and estimate the pass rate.

**Contrastive Analysis of the Question:**

*   **Question:** How did the Battle of Plassey in 1757 contribute to the expansion of British power in India?
*   **Rubric:** For explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal (e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab).
*   **Max score: 1**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Specific Historical Event:** Students need to know about the Battle of Plassey (year 1757 is given, which helps) and its direct aftermath.
    *   **Causal Relationship:** They need to understand that historical events have consequences and be able to articulate this cause-and-effect (Plassey → British Power).
    *   **Concept of "Expansion of British Power":** While seemingly straightforward, connecting it to "political dominance" or "control over Bengal" requires more than just knowing it was a battle. They need to understand its strategic significance, not just tactical victory.
    *   **Terminology:** "Expansion of British power," "contribute," "political dominance," "puppet nawab."

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   The question uses relatively academic English ("contribute to," "expansion of power"). Students need to understand these phrases to grasp the prompt's intent.
    *   Producing an answer that clearly explains the causal link ("led to," "resulted in," "established control over") can be challenging for those with limited expressive English.
    *   Even if they know the historical facts in Hindi, translating them accurately and coherently into English for a clear explanation is a significant hurdle. They might use simplified language or list facts without linking them explicitly.

3.  **Type of Task (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   **Recall:** Requires recalling the events surrounding Plassey and its immediate political consequences.
    *   **Reasoning/Application:** It's not just rote recall of facts (like naming fundamental rights). It requires understanding the *impact* and *contribution* – a causal reasoning step. Students need to apply their knowledge of Plassey to explain its role in British expansion, not just describe the battle itself.
    *   This is a higher-order thinking skill than simple factual recall.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Textbook exercises often ask "What was the Battle of Plassey?" or "Who fought in the Battle of Plassey?".
    *   Asking "How did it *contribute to*...?" moves beyond simple description to requiring an analytical explanation of significance.
    *   Many government school curricula, especially for weaker students, might focus more on memorizing facts and less on understanding deeper historical processes or cause-and-effect. They might learn that Britain won, but struggle to articulate *how* that win expanded their power beyond just "they took over."

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."** This is very abstract, highly interpretive, and language-intensive. Our question is less abstract but still requires interpretation of historical significance.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources.** This requires understanding two concepts and giving examples. It's also definitional and comparison-based. Our question is a specific historical event explanation. The difficulty for the 15% item comes from nuanced definitions and correct examples. Our question demands a narrative/explanatory answer.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph on "My favorite season."** This is creative writing on a personal, everyday topic. The high pass rate here shows that students *can* write in English if the topic is familiar and simple, even with errors. However, this is fundamentally different from academic content.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is direct recall from a story. If they read/remembered the story, it's straightforward. The challenge is purely recall and extracting specifics.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights.** This is direct recall of specific, foundational political science facts that are heavily taught. This is much simpler recall than the Plassey question, which demands an explanation of *causality*.

**Synthesizing and Estimating:**

*   The question requires specific historical knowledge (Battle of Plassey, its date, its direct outcome), understanding of complex historical concepts ("expansion of power," "political dominance"), and expressing a causal link.
*   The language demands
