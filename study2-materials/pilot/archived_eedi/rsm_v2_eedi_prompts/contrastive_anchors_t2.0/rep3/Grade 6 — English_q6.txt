This question asks students to identify a line they like and explain why. Let's break down its difficulty compared to the calibration anchors:

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Reading Comprehension:** Students need to have read and understood the general meaning of the poem (the context of "The Last Bargain" is implied as it's the preceding poem in the exam, even though the specific poem isn't named in the prompt).
*   **Opinion Formulation:** They need to be able to form an opinion about a line.
*   **Basic Justification:** They need to provide a reason for their opinion.

**Language Demands:**
*   **English Comprehension:** The question "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?" is fairly straightforward English for Class 6, focusing on common verbs ("like," "why").
*   **English Production (Written):** This is the biggest hurdle.
    *   **Quoting:** They need to accurately write or recall a specific line from the poem. This requires a decent level of English spelling and memory, or the ability to transcribe from their exam paper (if the poem is present there).
    *   **Expressing Opinion and Justification:** They need to write a simple sentence or two to explain *why* they like that line. This tests basic sentence construction and vocabulary to express feelings or reasoning (e.g., "I like this line because it means freedom," "It sounds beautiful").
*   **Compared to other items:**
    *   **5% item ("Theme of The Last Bargain"):** This question requires higher-level abstract thinking, analysis, and ability to summarize complex ideas, all in English. The scoring example "Happiness is find in innocence" shows simple English, but the underlying cognitive task is hard. The question asks for "a theme or central idea," which is cognitively much harder than "which line do you like."
    *   **15% item ("Differentiate archaeological and literary sources"):** This is a specific academic definition/comparison requiring factual recall and understanding of technical terms. The language for explaining is demanding.
    *   **30% item ("My favorite season"):** This is similar in that it asks for personal preference and a paragraph of writing, but it's on a very common and simple topic. It allows for broader expression and is less constrained by quoting a specific line. However, the requirement for 6-8 lines and varied details is quite high.
    *   **50% item ("Three questions the king wanted to answer"):** This is pure recall of specific facts from a story, which is often easier if the story has just been read. The language demand is only to list the questions.
    *   **66% item ("Two Fundamental Rights"):** Pure factual recall of common, taught political science. The language demand is only to name them.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
*   **Recall:** Students need to recall (or transcribe) a specific line.
*   **Application/Reasoning:** They need to *reason* why they like it and *apply* that reasoning into simple English sentences. It's an opinion question, making it personal, but requiring some basic reasoning skill.

**Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   Textbooks often have "comprehension" questions that ask for factual recall or summary.
*   "What do you think about X?" or "Which part did you like?" are common enough in English lessons but require creative written expression, which can be challenging for students with limited proficiency.
*   This is not a highly complex analytical question, but it's not rote recall either. It's a bridge between understanding and personal expression.

**Contrastive Analysis Summary for THIS Question:**

*   **Ease:**
    *   The question's prompt ("Which line... and why?") is very simple English.
    *   It asks for a personal opinion, which generally has a lower bar for a "correct" answer's content compared to factual or analytical questions.
    *   Students just need to pick *any* line and provide *any* reason. The bar for a valid reason is likely quite low for this age group and context.
*   **Hardness:**
    *   **Poem comprehension:** While asking for "any line" and "any reason," a coherent reason requires at least a minimal understanding of the line's meaning within the poem's context.
    *   **Writing specific lines:** Accurately recalling and writing a line from a poem is difficult if they don't have the poem in front of them, especially given potential spelling and transcription issues.
    *   **Formulating reasons in English:** Articulating *why* one likes something, even simply, can be tough for low-proficiency English speakers. They might *feel* why but
