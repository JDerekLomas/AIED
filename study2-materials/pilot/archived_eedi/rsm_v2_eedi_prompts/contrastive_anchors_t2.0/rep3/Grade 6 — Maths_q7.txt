Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication).
    *   Understanding of "per hour" as a rate of change.
    *   Concept of temperature increasing.
    *   Ability to calculate time difference across AM/PM boundaries (from 10 AM to 4 PM). This involves understanding 12-hour clock time.

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   **Low:** The question uses simple, direct language. "Temperature," "increases by," "per hour," "what will be" are common phrases. The numerical values and units are clearly presented. The time format "10 am," "4:00 in the evening" is straightforward. There's no complex vocabulary or abstract concepts to grasp in English.
    *   Compared to "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15% pass rate), this question's language is significantly simpler. Even compared to "Write a theme or central idea..." (5%), this question is more concrete and less interpretative in its language.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   This is primarily an **application** problem, involving a straightforward two-step calculation.
        *   Step 1: Calculate elapsed time (application of time concepts).
        *   Step 2: Apply the rate of increase to the initial temperature (application of multiplication and addition).
    *   It requires minimal **reasoning** beyond understanding the problem's context. It's not a complex word problem requiring deep strategic thinking or multi-stage logical deductions like some geometry or complex fraction problems might.
    *   There's no specific factual **recall** other than basic math facts.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This is a very common type of word problem encountered in Class 5/6 mathematics textbooks. These "rate and time" or "temperature change" problems are standard.
    *   The numbers are whole numbers and the increase is consistent. There are no fractions, decimals (apart from the degree sign which isn't computationally relevant here), or negative numbers to complicate it.
    *   The biggest potential hurdle might be correctly calculating the time elapsed from 10 AM to 4 PM. Some students might simply subtract 10 from 4, which would be incorrect for AM/PM calculation (leading to -6 or a miscalculation of 6 in a different direction). However, 10 AM to 12 PM is 2 hours, and 12 PM to 4 PM is 4 hours, making a total of 6 hours – this is typically taught.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **"Theme of poem" (5%):** Requires abstract understanding, interpretation, and expression in English. Much harder.
*   **"Differentiate archaeological/literary sources" (15%):** Requires conceptual understanding, recall of examples, and comparison. Higher language demand and abstract thinking. Harder.
*   **"My favorite season" (30%):** Requires creative writing, sentence construction, and specific detail. While familiar content, the English writing demand is significant for a low-proficiency group. Similar students struggle to form coherent sentences in English. This math problem has almost no English production demand beyond understanding the question.
*   **"Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%):** Requires recall of specific facts from a story, likely taught in class. Lower language demand but pure memorization. If they remember the story, it's easy. If not, impossible.
*   **"Two Fundamental Rights" (66%):** Requires specific factual recall. If students learned these rights by heart (often done), it's straightforward. Language demand for naming them is low.

This math question:
*   Has *much lower language demand* than the 5%, 15%, and 30% items. Students just need to grasp the numbers and operations, not interpret meaning or compose text.
*   Is an *application* problem, not pure recall like the 50% and 66% items, but the application steps are quite simple.
*   The concepts (time, rate of change, addition, multiplication) are core Class 6 math.
*   The primary challenge will be the elapsed time calculation (10 AM to 4 PM is 6 hours) and then performing the two operations (6 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 12 degrees; 30 degrees + 12 degrees = 42 degrees). This sequence is very standard.

Given the average pass rate across items is 29%, and the language demand for this math question is minimal, it should perform significantly better than writing/comprehension tasks. The difficulty
