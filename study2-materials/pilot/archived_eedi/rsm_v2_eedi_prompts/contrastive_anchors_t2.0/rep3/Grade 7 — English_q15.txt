Here's an analysis of the "My Favourite Hobby" question, contrasting it with the calibration anchors, and an estimated pass rate:

**Contrastive Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   **"My Favourite Hobby" (Target Question):** Assumes basic knowledge of personal interests and activities (hobbies). Most students will have *some* hobby or interest they can talk about. No specific curriculum knowledge is required. This makes it broadly accessible.
    *   **Anchor (5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain":** Requires deep comprehension of a specific poem (likely from their curriculum), abstract thinking to identify a theme, and the ability to articulate it concisely. Very difficult.
    *   **Anchor (15%): Archaeological vs. Literary Sources:** Requires recall and differentiation of specific history concepts taught in class, with examples. Moderately difficult, assumes specific knowledge.
    *   **Anchor (30%): "My favorite season":** Very similar to the target question in terms of prior knowledge. Requires knowledge of personal preferences and seasons, which is universal. This is a very strong anchor for comparison.
    *   **Anchor (50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer:** Requires recall of a specific detail from a story, likely from their textbook. Less demanding than identifying themes, but still requires memory of specific text content.
    *   **Anchor (66%): Two Fundamental Rights:** Requires recall of specific civics knowledge. Easier than differentiating sources, but still specific curriculum content.

*   **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **"My Favourite Hobby" (Target Question):**
        *   **Lexicon:** Uses common, high-frequency words: "favourite," "hobby," "when," "enjoy," "it is," "what I like to do." Students are likely familiar with these or cognates in Hindi/local languages.
        *   **Sentence Structure:** "Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences)." This structure guides them. The prompt clearly breaks down the required content: "Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it." This bulleted guidance is very helpful for students with limited English as it simplifies the task into discrete parts. They don't need complex sentence structures to fulfill the prompt, simple sentences like "My hobby is playing cricket. I play everyday. I enjoy it because it is fun." would likely score 1.
        *   **Generation vs. Comprehension:** This is a *generation* task, but the topic is highly personal and low-stakes, reducing cognitive load. The prompt provides strong scaffolding.
    *   **Anchors:**
        *   **"The Last Bargain" (5%):** Requires sophisticated abstract vocabulary and complex sentence structures to express a theme. Very high language demand.
        *   **Archaeological/Literary (15%):** Requires specific academic vocabulary and the ability to contrast using appropriate connecting words. Moderate language demand.
        *   **"My favorite season" (30%):** Very similar language demands to the target question. Simple vocabulary, personal experience, structured prompt.
        *   **King's Questions (50%):** Primarily recall, but writing out the questions (often multi-part) still requires constructing sentences in English.
        *   **Fundamental Rights (66%):** Very low language demand – largely just recalling and listing specific phrases, often fixed and rehearsed.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   **"My Favourite Hobby" (Target Question):** Primarily a *recall* task of personal information/preference, then *generation* of simple sentences to express it. It's an accessible personal application task, not requiring abstract reasoning or complex factual recall.
    *   **Anchors:**
        *   **Theme (5%):** High-level *reasoning* and *interpretation*, then *generation*.
        *   **Sources (15%):** *Recall* of definitions and *application* to give examples.
        *   **"My favorite season" (30%):** *Recall* of personal preference, *generation*. Very similar to target.
        *   **King's Questions (50%):** Pure *recall* from text.
        *   **Fundamental Rights (66%):** Pure *recall* of facts.

*   **Difficulty compared to typical textbook exercises:**
    *   **"My Favourite Hobby" (Target Question):** This is a very common type of "free writing" or "composition" exercise found in English language textbooks, especially for lower secondary levels. It's often given early in the year to build confidence and assess basic writing skills. It is less demanding than factual recall from textbooks as it is personally relevant.
