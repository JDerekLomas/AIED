Let's break down the question "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice: The wind blew the leaves away" using the provided anchors and context.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior knowledge assumed:**
    *   **Grammar:** Understanding of active and passive voice, including subject, verb, and object. Knowledge of verb conjugations (past participle of 'blow' is 'blown'). Understanding of auxiliary verbs ('were'). Understanding of prepositions ('by').
    *   **Vocabulary:** 'wind', 'blew' (past tense of blow), 'leaves', 'away'. These are fairly common words, but 'blew' and 'blown' might be tricky for some with limited English if they don't know irregular verbs well.
    *   **Syntactic structure:** Students need to be able to identify the subject ('the wind'), the verb ('blew'), and the object ('the leaves').

2.  **Language demands on students with limited English:**
    *   **Understanding the instruction:** "Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice." This is the most significant language hurdle. "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" are technical grammar terms. While they might have learned this in Hindi grammar, the direct English translation and application in English might be difficult. Many students might not understand what "active" and "passive" voice *mean* even if they've been taught the concept, let alone how to apply it consistently.
    *   **Producing the correct structure:** Even if they understand the concept, accurately forming the passive voice in English (object + auxiliary verb 'be' (conjugated for tense and number) + past participle + 'by' + subject) requires precise English construction, which can be challenging for L2 learners. Irregular verbs (blow/blew/blown) add another layer of complexity.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of a grammatical rule. Students need to recall the rules of active/passive voice transformation and apply them to a given sentence. It involves some analysis (identifying sentence components) and then synthesis (reconstructing the sentence in the new voice).

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   In a dedicated English grammar class, this would be a standard exercise once the concept of active/passive voice has been thoroughly taught. However, in government schools with potentially less rigorous English instruction and focus, this concept might be taught superficially or in a way that doesn't foster deep understanding or application.
    *   The specific sentence "The wind blew the leaves away" is relatively simple in its lexical content, making the primary challenge the grammatical transformation itself, not vocabulary.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain."** This is highly interpretive, requires advanced reading comprehension, literary analysis, and articulate expression in English. Far more difficult than the current question.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources.** This requires specialized social science knowledge, conceptual understanding, and the ability to articulate definitions and examples clearly in English. This is still a high bar, demanding more specific knowledge and explanation than just a grammatical transformation.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): "My favorite season." (short paragraph).** This is a creative writing task that allows for varied responses. While it requires writing in English, the content is personal and open-ended. A basic, simple paragraph could still score points, unlike the active/passive transformation which is pass/fail. This suggests that basic English production skills get around 30%.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is pure recall of specific factual details from a story. It requires basic reading comprehension of the story and remembering distinct pieces of information. The English production requirement is minimal (just listing phrases). The current active/passive question is harder because it's not simple recall; it's application of a grammatical rule that itself has to be *understood* and *recalled*.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights.** This is another factual recall question from civics. It requires remembering specific terms (e.g., Right to Equality, Right to Freedom). English production is minimal. The main challenge is the recall of two specific proper nouns/phrases.

**Synthesizing the Difficulty:**

The critical bottleneck here is the understanding and application of grammatical concepts ("Active Voice," "Passive Voice"). Students from economically weaker sections, in Hindi-medium schools, often struggle significantly with advanced English grammar terms and their practical application. Even if they know basic English, grammatical transformations can be a hurdle.

While the sentence itself is simple
