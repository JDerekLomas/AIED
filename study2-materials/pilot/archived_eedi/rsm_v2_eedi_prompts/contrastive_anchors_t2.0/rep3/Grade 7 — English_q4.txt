## Contrastive Analysis: "Do you think the king's questions are important in real life? Give one reason."

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
* **Recalling the King's Questions:** Students need to have a basic memory of the king's three questions from the story. This is explicitly tested in the 50% pass rate anchor "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" suggesting that many students can recall them, at least partially.
* **Basic Understanding of "Real Life" and "Important":** These are fairly common vocabulary words, but "important" in an abstract sense might be slightly more nuanced than purely concrete terms.
* **Ability to Articulate a Reason:** This requires basic reasoning skills and the ability to formulate a simple explanatory sentence.

**Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
* **"Do you think..."**: Simple present tense, direct question.
* **"...the king's questions are important in real life?"**: Relatively straightforward vocabulary. "Important" and "real life" are fairly common phrases.
* **"Give one reason."**: A very common instruction for short answers.
* **Expressing a Reason:** This is the most demanding part. While the expected reason doesn't need to be complex, it requires stringing together a few words to make a coherent point. For students struggling with English, articulating even a simple "yes, because..." or "no, it's not important because..." can be challenging.

**Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
* **Recall (implicit):** Students implicitly need to recall or understand the king's questions to answer whether they are important.
* **Reasoning/Application:** The core of the question is reasoning. It asks students to *apply* the king's questions to a "real-life" context and provide a *justification* for their stance. This is a step beyond simple recall of facts.

**How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**

* **Easier than:**
    * **"Write a theme or central idea..." (5%):** This requires deeper analytical skills, abstract thinking, and the ability to synthesize complex ideas, often with more sophisticated vocabulary.
    * **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15%):** This demands specific disciplinary knowledge, conceptual understanding, and the ability to articulate differences, often with precise terminology.
* **Similar to/Slightly harder than:**
    * **"Write a short paragraph... My favorite season." (30%):** While that question involves more extensive writing (6-8 lines) and specific prompts (what you do, eat, wear), it's largely descriptive and personal. This question, though shorter in required output, demands a specific type of reasoning and justification. However, the King's questions are generally understood to be relevant and therefore easy to say "yes" to.
    * **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50%):** This is pure recall. The current question builds on this by asking for an opinion and a reason, adding a layer of cognitive demand. Many students who could answer *what* the questions were, would likely grasp *that* they are important.
* **Harder than:**
    * **"Name any two Fundamental Rights..." (66%):** This is direct recall of learned facts, which for many students, especially in civics education, might be memorized.

**Difficulty specific considerations for this question:**

* **Subjectivity:** While the rubric accepts "any valid reason," this also means students can't just recall a stock answer. They need to generate their own thought. However, most will likely agree the questions are important, making the 'yes' part easy. The challenge is the 'why'.
* **Conciseness:** Only "one reason" is required, which reduces the writing burden compared to a paragraph. This is a significant factor for limited English proficiency. A short phrase like "because it helps us succeed" or "to make good decisions" would likely suffice.
* **Broad Relevance:** The king's questions ("right time, right thing, right people") are quite universally relatable to decision-making, which is an accessible concept even for younger students. This makes it easier to connect to "real life."
