## Contrastive Analysis of the Question:

**"Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there."**

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Geographical Awareness:** Students need to know where Rajasthan is on the map of India and recall basic facts about its geography and natural features. This is standard Class 6 Social Science (Geography) curriculum in India.
*   **Definition of Natural Resources:** They need a working understanding of what "natural resources" are. This concept is typically introduced in earlier grades or the beginning of Class 6.
*   **Basic Understanding of Influences/Impacts:** They need to connect a resource to its practical use or effect on daily life, e.g., water for drinking/agriculture, minerals for industry/livelihood.

**2. Language Demands:**
*   **Keywords:** "Mention," "natural resources," "Rajasthan," "explain," "influences," "lives of the people."
*   **Complexity:** The question is fairly straightforward in its phrasing. "Mention any two..." is simple recall. "Explain how one of them influences..." requires slightly more complex sentence structure and a cause-and-effect relationship, but not abstract reasoning.
*   **Target Audience:** For Hindi-medium students with limited English, "natural resources" (प्राकृतिक संसाधन) is a commonly taught term. "Explain" and "influences" might be a bit more challenging than just "list," but they are common academic verbs. The required output is relatively short (two items + a brief explanation), limiting complex sentence construction.

**3. Type of Cognitive Task:**
*   **Recall:** Identifying two natural resources in Rajasthan is purely recall-based.
*   **Application/Basic Reasoning:** Explaining the influence requires a very basic application of knowledge or common-sense reasoning. For example, knowing Rajasthan is a desert region, students can logically link water scarcity to nomadic lifestyles or the importance of canals. Knowing minerals are extracted, they can link it to mining jobs. It's not complex analytical reasoning, but rather connecting a fact to its common consequence.

**4. Difficulty Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Compared to 5% item (Poem Theme):** This question is significantly easier. "Poem Theme" requires interpretation, synthesis, and abstract thinking about a literary piece, which is very challenging for this demographic, especially with the limited English to express nuanced ideas. This resource question is factual recall + basic explanation.
*   **Compared to 15% item (Archaeological vs. Literary Sources):** Similar in cognitive load but arguably slightly easier in execution. The 15% item requires distinguishing between two distinct concepts and providing *different* examples, demanding precise knowledge and clear differentiation. The current question asks for resources from *one specific location* and *one explanation*. While identifying the *right* two resources for Rajasthan requires specific geographical knowledge, the "explain" part is generally easier to articulate with basic examples (e.g., "water is for drinking" or "marble is used for building"). Students might struggle with *examples* for abstract "sources," but not for tangible "resources."
*   **Compared to 30% item ("My Favorite Season"):** The "Favorite Season" item is a narrative/descriptive task, open-ended, and allows students to write about personal experience, which is often easier if they can manage the language. However, it requires a paragraph of 6-8 lines, which is a higher writing load. Our current question is more constrained: two specific facts + one explanation. The factual component makes it harder than free writing but the shorter explanation requirement is less demanding than a whole paragraph.
*   **Compared to 50% item (Three Questions King Wanted to Answer):** This is similar to the 50% item in that both require factual recall from a specific text (the story of the king's three questions is a very common Class 6 English chapter, similar to how natural resources of states are covered in Geography). However, the "king's questions" is verbatim recall. Our current question asks for *any* two resources from a broader set and then a basic explanation. The explanation makes it slightly more demanding than pure recall, but the commonality of Rajasthan's resources (like water scarcity/canal systems) would make the explanation part fairly intuitive for many.
*   **Compared to 66% item (Two Fundamental Rights):** This item is slightly harder than the Fundamental Rights question. The Rights are specific, often memorized, and universally applicable. Natural resources vary by region. While resources of major states like Rajasthan are taught, it might require a slightly more specific memory retrieval than a list of "rights" that apply to *all* citizens. However, common resources like water, sand, or marble for Rajasthan are well-known.
