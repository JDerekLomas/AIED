Let's break down the difficulty of "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning." for Class 8 Indian government school students.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Historical context:** Students are expected to have been taught about the Harappan Civilization (also known as Indus Valley Civilization) in their Social Science curriculum. This is a foundational topic typically covered in Class 6 or 7, and certainly reinforced in Class 8.
*   **Specific features:** Knowledge of the *urban planning* aspects specifically is required, not just general facts about the civilization. Common features taught include the grid pattern, drainage systems, citadel/lower town division, use of baked bricks, and standardized weights and measures (though the latter is less about urban *planning* per se).

**Language Demands:**
*   **Key terms:** "Harappan Civilization," "urban planning," "feature." While "urban planning" might be slightly formal, "Harappan Civilization" and "feature" should be accessible.
*   **Instruction verb:** "Describe" requires more than just naming; it asks for a brief explanation. This is a common task verb in exams.
*   **Expected response:** A simple sentence or two would suffice, naming and briefly elaborating on one feature. Given the 1-mark maximum, deep linguistic complexity is not expected.
*   **Limited English proficiency:** The terms related to the content (grid layout, drainage system, baked bricks, citadel, lower town) are likely introduced in English in textbooks, even if explained in Hindi. Students often rote learn these key phrases. The simplicity of the required answer ("well-planned grid layout" or "advanced drainage system") helps mitigate severe language barriers compared to tasks requiring more complex sentence construction.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
*   **Recall:** This is almost purely a recall question. Students are expected to remember specific facts about Harappan urban planning as taught in their history lessons. There's no application to a new scenario or complex reasoning involved.

**Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   This question is highly typical of end-of-chapter or internal comprehension questions in Social Science textbooks for this level. Questions like "What are the main features of Harappan cities?" or "Name two aspects of Harappan urban planning" are standard. It's not a trick question, nor does it require advanced critical thinking beyond simple recall.

**Contrastive Analysis with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain."** This is subjective, requires deep comprehension of poetry, inferential reasoning, and expressing a nuanced idea. Highly difficult, language-intensive. *Our target question is much easier.*
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate archaeological and literary sources.** Requires understanding two distinct concepts and providing *examples* for each. While concepts are likely taught, the "differentiate" and "give examples for each" makes it a two-part recall/application task, slightly more complex than naming *one* feature. The vocabulary might also be slightly more advanced. *Our target question is likely easier.*
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Paragraph on "My favorite season."** This is creative writing, requiring students to generate their own ideas, organize them into a paragraph, and adhere to a line count, *and* cover specific prompts (what you like to do, eat/wear). It's personal, but requires sustained English writing. The example scores show that even short, disjointed points can fetch marks, but *fluency and topic adherence are key.* *Our target question is easier as it requires recall of a factual point rather than generative writing.*
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is a direct recall question from a specific story/text. If students read and remembered the story, this is relatively straightforward. It requires remembering *three* specific points. The language is likely simple (from the story). *Our target question is comparable in its recall nature but asks for only *one* feature, making it potentially slightly easier for full marks.*
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights.** This is very direct factual recall of a core civics topic. Students usually rote learn Fundamental Rights. Naming *any two* out of several options provides flexibility. This is a very common and central topic. *Our target question is similar in its factual recall but the Harappan civilization might be slightly less universally prioritized than fundamental rights by some students.*

**Conclusion:**

The question "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning" is:
*   Direct recall of a core Social Science topic.
*   Uses accessible language and common task verbs.
*   Requires a simple, factual answer (one point,
