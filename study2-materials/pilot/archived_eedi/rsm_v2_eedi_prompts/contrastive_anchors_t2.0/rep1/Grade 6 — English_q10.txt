Here's an analysis of the question and my estimate:

**Question Analysis:**

*   **Prior Knowledge:**
    *   Basic understanding of singular/plural nouns (apples).
    *   Familiarity with the common usage of "some" and "any" in affirmative sentences and questions/negatives. This is a very fundamental grammar concept typically introduced early in English language learning.
*   **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   The sentence structure is very simple: Subject (There are) + Quantifier (some/any) + Noun (apples) + Prepositional phrase (in the basket).
    *   The vocabulary ("apples," "basket") is extremely basic and likely known by most students at this level, even those with limited English.
    *   The core task is to differentiate between "some" and "any." While "any" might be used in a question ("Are there any apples?"), its use in a positive, affirmative statement like this is incorrect for expressing existence of a non-zero, indefinite quantity.
*   **Cognitive Task:** This is a **recall/application** task. Students need to recall the rules for "some" and "any" and apply them to a simple, direct sentence. It does not require complex reasoning or synthesis.
*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:** This is a very standard fill-in-the-blanks type exercise, common in elementary English grammar textbooks, often appearing in the very first units introducing quantifiers. It's likely easier than constructing full sentences, defining terms, or answering open-ended questions.

**Contrastive Analysis Against Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Theme of "The Last Bargain."** This requires comprehension of a poem (potentially in English, or at least understanding a translation), abstract thinking, and articulating a theme in English. Far, far harder.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources.** This requires knowledge of specific historical terms, understanding the *difference*, and providing examples. It's a conceptual understanding with factual recall, much more complex than choosing "some/any."
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Short paragraph on "My favorite season."** This requires free production of multiple sentences in English, organized around a theme, with specific prompts for detail. Even the simple "Winter\nSweater\nBaju" got a 3/3, suggesting very basic sentences are scored well, but it still demands *production*. Our target question is selection.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): Three questions the king wanted to answer.** This tests recall of specific details from a story/text, but crucially, it doesn't require complex sentence formation; fragmented but correct answers are accepted. It's easier than paragraph writing but still depends on text comprehension and recall of specifics.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name two Fundamental Rights.** This is a direct recall question, similar to naming parts or listing items. It relies on rote memorization or familiarization with specific terms. It's often high-scoring because terms are often repeated in civic education. The example given for score 0 is just gibberish, suggesting even partial phonetic attempts are scored.

**Conclusion:**

The question "There are (some/any) apples in the basket" is:
*   **Simpler vocabulary and sentence structure** than even the 50% anchor.
*   **Purely grammatical, common pattern matching**, unlike the 15% conceptual question or the 5% abstract question.
*   **Easier than producing full sentences/paragraphs** (30% anchor), requiring only selection.
*   **Similar in cognitive load to direct recall** like naming fundamental rights (66% anchor), but arguably slightly trickier as it requires *application* of a rule rather than just retrieving a memorized fact. However, it's such a fundamental rule that it almost functions as recall for most.

Considering these students have limited English proficiency and the average pass rate is 29%, a question that is fundamental, has very simple vocabulary, and requires minimal English production will likely be on the higher end of the distribution. The "some/any" distinction is one of the very first quantifiers taught. Even if they don't know the explicit rule, they might "feel" it through repeated exposure in listening/reading simple sentences.

I would expect this to be significantly above the average pass rate, perhaps closer to the level of basic factual recall. It's probably easier than the Fundamental Rights question because it relies on more fundamental grammar acquisition rather than specific civics knowledge.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **75%**
