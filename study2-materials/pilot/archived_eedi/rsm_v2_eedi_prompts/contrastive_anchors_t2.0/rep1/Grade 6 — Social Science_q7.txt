This question combines recall and simple explanation. Let's break down its difficulty compared to the anchors:

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Recall of Natural Resources:** Students need to know what natural resources are in general and specifically recall at least two that are found in Rajasthan. This is a common topic in Social Science (Geography) at Class 6, typically covered when studying Indian states and their geography/resources.
*   **Understanding Influence:** They need to connect a resource to its impact on people's lives (e.g., how water affects farming, marble affects building/artisan work, salt affects industry/diet). This requires a basic cause-and-effect understanding related to their local context.

**Language Demands:**
*   **"Mention any two natural resources":** Fairly straightforward. "Mention" is a common directive. "Natural resources" is a key term that would have been taught.
*   **"explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":** "Explain" requires more than just listing. "Influences" and "lives of the people" are also fairly standard vocabulary, though "influences" might be slightly more abstract than simpler verbs.
*   The total word count expected for a correct answer is quite low, probably 2-3 short sentences. This limits the linguistic burden.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
*   **Recall:** Naming two resources is pure recall.
*   **Application/Reasoning (simple):** Explaining the influence is a simple application of learned facts or very basic reasoning based on common sense (e.g., if there's no water, people can't farm easily; if there's marble, people might carve things or build with it). It's not complex critical reasoning.

**Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   This type of question is very common in Social Science textbooks and exams – often appearing as "List two resources from X region and describe their importance" or similar. It's a standard level of difficulty for understanding regional geography.

**Contrastive Analysis against Anchors:**

*   **Compared to 5% (Theme of poem):** Much easier. That item requires abstract interpretation and understanding of figurative language, a high cognitive load, and potentially difficult vocabulary. This resource question is concrete and factual.
*   **Compared to 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** Easier. Differentiation requires understanding two distinct concepts and drawing contrasts, which can be harder than just listing and explaining one. Also, "archaeological" and "literary" can be higher-level vocabulary. This question deals with more familiar concepts.
*   **Compared to 30% (My favorite season - 6-8 lines):** Similar difficulty, possibly slightly easier for the target content. The "favorite season" item requires more sustained writing and creative thought (even if simple). This natural resource question requires less writing but needs specific factual recall *and* a basic explanation. The 30% pass rate suggests students can handle a simple paragraph, and this question's explanation part is likely simpler than a full paragraph.
*   **Compared to 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer?):** Slightly harder. The king's question is pure recall from a specific story, requiring memory of details. This resource question requires factual recall *plus* a simple explanation. While recall of the story detail is easy if they remember, the added explanation component here pushes it slightly beyond just direct recall. However, knowing general resources of a major state like Rajasthan is often easier than recalling specific plot points of one particular story.
*   **Compared to 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Significantly harder. "Fundamental Rights" is a core concept that should be taught well. The answer is direct recall of specific legal terms. This question demands recall of specific geography *and* a simple explanation. The vocabulary for "Fundamental Rights" can also be precise.

**Conclusion:**

This question involves specific factual recall about Rajasthan (a prominent state) and then a relatively simple, common-sense explanation. It avoids complex language or abstract thinking. Students are likely to have covered basic geography of states and their resources. The average pass rate is 29%. This question feels like it's in the realm of slightly harder than pure recall, but simpler than extended writing or complex differentiation. It balances factual recall with a basic analytical step. The fact that the natural resources in Rajasthan (like water scarcity, marble, salt) are very distinctive might make them easier to recall for students familiar with the region.

I expect this to perform better than the "favorite season" item because the content is more strictly factual and the required explanation is more structured and less open-ended than describing preferences. However, the requirement for *two* resources AND an explanation means more than just a single fact recall.
