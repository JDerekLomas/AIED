Here's a breakdown of the question "Who lived inside the book?" compared to the calibration anchors and Class 6 context:

**Analysis of the Target Question:**

*   **Prior Knowledge:** This question requires knowledge of a specific text/story that Class 6 students would have read or heard. It's purely recall from a *pre-existing story*.
*   **Language Demands:** The English is extremely simple: "Who lived inside the book?" It uses basic vocabulary and a direct interrogative structure. It's likely simpler than most other English questions they face on this exam.
*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?** Pure recall. No application or reasoning is involved beyond remembering the detail from the story.
*   **Difficulty compared to typical textbook exercises:** If this story is part of their syllabus, then this is a very straightforward, basic recall question – the kind often found as comprehension checks at the end of a chapter or passage. It's not inferential or requiring deep analysis.

**Contrastive Analysis with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Compared to 5% (Theme of a poem):** The target question is *significantly easier*. "Theme" is an abstract concept, requiring inferential skills and often multi-sentence articulation. The English demands are much higher, as evidenced by the messy responses attempting to convey an abstract idea.
*   **Compared to 15% (Differentiate sources):** This question is *much easier*. "Differentiate" is a higher-order skill, requiring understanding of two distinct concepts and the ability to articulate their differences and examples. Even though it's still largely recall (of definitions/examples), the cognitive load and English expression demands are much higher.
*   **Compared to 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** The target question is *easier*. Writing a multi-line paragraph requires sustained English composition, sentence structuring, and idea generation. Even a simple paragraph like "My favorite season" demands more than a one-word/phrase answer. Students struggling with basic sentence formation would fail here.
*   **Compared to 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is the closest comparison, and possibly even easier.
    *   **Similarities:** Both are recall questions about a story. Both require extracting specific factual details. The language demands are low for both.
    *   **Differences that make "Who lived inside the book?" easier:**
        *   "Three questions" requires remembering *three* distinct points, potentially in sequence. "Who lived inside the book?" only requires *one* specific piece of information (the character). Remembering multiple items increases cognitive load.
        *   The prompt "What were the three questions..." explicitly sets the expectation for multiple points. For a student with limited English, successfully extracting all three might be harder than just one.
        *   The 50% example suggests that students sometimes only list one or two points, or partially transcribe, meaning remembering *all three* details was a hurdle for a significant portion.
*   **Compared to 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** The target question is *easier or on par in difficulty but lower in content demand*.
    *   **Similarities:** Both are direct recall of factual information. Both accept concise answers. English demands are low for both.
    *   **Differences that make "Who lived inside the book?" potentially easier:**
        *   "Fundamental Rights" is a socio-political concept that might be more abstract or require more formal learning/memorization than a character from a simple story. While the *question* is direct, the *content* itself might be less intuitively graspable or universally known.
        *   Listing "any two" from a larger set still requires recalling *more than one* specific item. The "fairy" is usually the singular main character for this kind of question.

**Key Determining Factors for the Target Question:**

1.  **If the story is well-known/recently taught:** This is the most crucial factor. If the story of "the fairy in the book" is part of their standard Class 6 English curriculum and was recently covered, then this is a very easy recall question.
2.  **Extremely low linguistic barrier:** The English is almost trivial, meaning students won't fail because they don't understand the question itself or struggle with basic English articulation.
3.  **Single, concrete piece of information:** Unlike questions requiring multiple points or abstract themes, this asks for one clear character.

Given the average pass rate is 29%, a question that is **simpler than the 50% anchor** due to needing to recall only one item, and on par or slightly easier than the 66% anchor because the content (a story character) is potentially more accessible than "Fundamental Rights," we can place it above the
