Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis of "Describe the poet's writing style."

This question's difficulty lies in several factors, especially considering the target student population.

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Literary Terminology:** The core assumption is that students understand what "writing style" means in a literary context. This isn't just about reading the words but interpreting *how* the author writes.
*   **Analytical Reading:** Students need to have read a poem (or passage by a poet) and formed an opinion about its characteristics, beyond just understanding its literal meaning. This implies an ability to step back and analyze the craft, not just the content.
*   **Vocabulary for Description:** Even if they understand the concept, they need a suitable English vocabulary to articulate it (e.g., "simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct," "figurative," "imaginative"). This is often lacking in limited English proficiency (LEP) students.

**Language Demands on Students with Limited English:**
*   **Abstract Concept:** "Writing style" is an abstract concept. It's not a concrete noun like "book" or an action like "run." Understanding and explaining abstract concepts is significantly harder for LEP students than concrete ones.
*   **Sophisticated Vocabulary:** As mentioned above, generating appropriate adjectives to describe style requires a higher level of English vocabulary than simply understanding the content of a sentence.
*   **Productive Skill:** This question requires students to *produce* language (an adjective or short phrase) rather than just identify information. Productive skills are always harder than receptive skills (reading/listening) for LEP students.
*   **Open-ended Nature:** There isn't one single "correct" answer in terms of a specific word, but rather a range of appropriate descriptors. While this might seem flexible, it can be intimidating for students who prefer concrete answers.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
*   **Application/Reasoning:** This is not a recall question. It requires students to apply their understanding of the poem and reason about the poet's choices in terms of language and structure to deduce a "style." This is a higher-order thinking skill than simple recall.

**Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   **Less Common in Lower Grades:** In Indian government school textbooks at Class 7, questions about "writing style" are typically less common or simplified. Most questions focus on comprehension (who, what, when, where), identifying themes, or summarization. Analytical questions requiring students to describe authorial craft are generally introduced in more detail later or in more advanced curricula.
*   **Lack of Scaffolding:** Textbook exercises might sometimes prompt with choices (e.g., "Is the style formal or informal?"), but an open-ended "describe" question like this is more challenging as it lacks such scaffolding.

## Calibration Anchors Comparison:

Let's compare to the anchors:

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'"** This is conceptually similar to "writing style" in that both require analysis and abstract understanding. Identifying a theme, however, can sometimes be slightly more accessible if the theme is very explicit. The 5% rate suggests very high difficulty for abstract analysis and articulation in English.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each."** This is knowledge-based recall and application, requiring specific terminology and definitions. It's challenging due to the specialized vocabulary, but more concrete than "writing style."
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'"** This is a creative writing task that allows for personal expression, potentially using simpler, more familiar language. The prompts give clear guidance (what you like to do, eat, wear). The 30% suggests that even free-form paragraph writing on a familiar topic with scaffolding is quite difficult for many students to produce coherent English for.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"** This is a direct recall question from the text. Students need to locate specific information and reproduce it. This is significantly easier as it's less abstract and purely factual.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India."** This is pure factual recall of memorized information, likely directly from a civics lesson. This is the easiest category because it doesn't require complex processing or abstraction, only memory and the ability to write two phrases.

**Conclusion based on analysis and anchors:**

The question "Describes
