Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication).
    *   Concept of time duration (calculating hours between two points).
    *   Understanding of temperature units (Celsius) and changes (increase).
    *   Ability to read and understand numbers (30, 2, 10, 4).

2.  **Language Demands:**
    *   The question uses relatively simple and direct English vocabulary: "morning," "temperature," "increases by," "per hour," "evening," "what will be."
    *   The sentence structure is straightforward, with a clear question at the end.
    *   The mathematical concepts (temperature, time) are common enough that the English terms might be understood even with limited proficiency, especially since the numbers provide significant context.
    *   It's a word problem, so students must extract the numerical information and the operations from the text. This is a common hurdle for students with language difficulties.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:**
    *   This is primarily an **application** problem. Students need to apply their knowledge of time calculation, multiplication, and addition to a real-world scenario.
    *   There's a mild **reasoning** component in understanding that "per hour" means multiplication and "increases by" means addition, and correctly identifying the starting point, rate of change, and duration.
    *   It doesn't require specific mathematical **recall** of complex formulas beyond basic operations.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises (Class 6 Math in India):**
    *   **Similar:** Problems involving time differences, rates, and cumulative changes are standard in Class 6 mathematics.
    *   **Potentially Easier:** The numbers are small and direct. No fractions or decimals involved in the rates. The time conversion (am/pm to hours) is also straightforward (10 am to 4 pm is 6 hours, which is quite direct counting).
    *   **Potentially Harder (Language Barrier):** For students with very limited English, extracting "10 am," "30°C," "2°C per hour," "4:00 in the evening" and putting them together can be the biggest challenge. They might understand "temperature" and "increase" but struggle with "10 am...4:00 in the evening" for time duration.
    *   **Absence of distractor information:** The question is very clean and does not include any irrelevant numbers or facts, making it easier to parse for the core information.

**Comparison with Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Poem Theme):** This requires high-level abstract comprehension and expression in English. Far harder.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Archaeological vs Literary Sources):** Requires recalling specific factual definitions and providing examples, also demanding more complex language and subject-specific knowledge. Harder.
*   **Pass rate 30% ("My favorite season"):** This is a free-response writing task, heavily dependent on English writing fluency and creative expression. The score reflects content *and* language ability. Likely harder for the average student to achieve a high score, but possibly comparable for getting some points for a basic response. However, our math question is objectively solvable if the student can parse the English.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This requires comprehension of a narrative and recalling specific details from a story, then articulating them. Similar language demands to our question but specific story recall vs. mathematical application. The 50% anchor suggests that simple retrieval and short answers in English for concrete details are doable for about half the students.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This requires recall of specific terms from Civics/Social Science, again articulated in English. This is simpler recall of facts, but the terms themselves are subject-specific. Our math question requires applying concepts, but the language might be marginally simpler if basic math vocabulary is understood. The higher pass rate suggests that direct recall of specific names in simple English is relatively high.

Our math question requires calculation based on information provided, rather than complex recall or open-ended writing. The critical steps are:
1.  Calculate time difference (10 am to 4 pm = 6 hours).
2.  Calculate total temperature increase (6 hours * 2°C/hour = 12°C).
3.  Calculate final temperature (30°C + 12°C = 42°C).

The biggest hurdle for Class 6 Hindi-medium students will be the English word problem structure and particularly understanding "per hour" and correctly calculating the time duration between "10 am" and "4
