Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion correct:

## Contrastive Analysis: "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."

**1. Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Geographical Awareness:** Students need to have learned about the physical features of India, specifically mountains, in their geography curriculum (likely part of Social Science). This is standard content for Class 6.
*   **Recall of Names:** They need to be able to recall the specific names of at least two prominent mountain ranges.

**2. Language Demands:**
*   **Very Low:** The question uses simple, direct language: "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India."
    *   "Name" is a basic verb.
    *   "two" is a simple quantity.
    *   "major" implies prominent, but even less prominent ones would likely count if truly mountain ranges.
    *   "mountain ranges" is a core geographical term they should be familiar with in English (even if they know the concept in Hindi).
    *   "located in India" clearly defines the scope.
*   **No complex sentence structure, no nuanced vocabulary, no inferential tasks.** This is purely recall of a label.

**3. Type of Cognitive Task:**
*   **Recall:** This is a straightforward recall question. There's no application of concepts or complex reasoning required. They either know the names or they don't.

**4. Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   **Easy:** This is a very common type of question found at the end of a chapter on physical features of India, or as a quick fact-recall exercise. It's on par with "Name the capital of X" or "Name two rivers."
*   **Lower difficulty than the "Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" (15% pass rate):** That question required understanding definitions and applying them, plus forming a coherent comparison. "Name two mountain ranges" is much simpler.
*   **Potentially comparable to or easier than "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50% pass rate):** That also required recall of specific details from a story. However, story details can sometimes be more transient than core geographical facts, which are often reinforced visually on maps and in lessons.

### Comparison with Calibration Anchors:

*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights..." (66% pass rate):** This question is highly similar in structure and cognitive demand. Both require naming two specific examples from a list. Fundamental Rights are a key civics topic, just as major mountain ranges are a key geography topic. Given the score is 0.5 for naming *one* correct range, and the high familiarity students would have with the Himalayas, this question is likely to have a high pass rate.
*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50% pass rate):** This involves recall of details from a specific story. While "mountain ranges" is factual recall, it's generally presented as foundational knowledge over multiple lessons (maps, physical features) rather than one specific text, potentially making it more ingrained.
*   **"Write a short paragraph... My favorite season" (30% pass rate):** This requires creative output, sustained writing, and elaboration, which are much harder.
*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15% pass rate):** This requires understanding abstract concepts and comparing/contrasting, a higher-order thinking skill than simple recall.
*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem..." (5% pass rate):** This requires deep comprehension, inferential reasoning, and articulation of abstract ideas, by far the most difficult.

The similarity to the Fundamental Rights question is striking. While Fundamental Rights might be *slightly* more politically emphasized in certain contexts, major geographical features like the Himalayas are virtually impossible for a Class 6 student in India to *not* have encountered repeatedly. The question's extreme simplicity in terms of language and cognitive demand strongly suggests a high pass rate. Even if a student only knows the Himalayas, they'd get 0.5 marks, making partial credit highly accessible.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: **72%**
