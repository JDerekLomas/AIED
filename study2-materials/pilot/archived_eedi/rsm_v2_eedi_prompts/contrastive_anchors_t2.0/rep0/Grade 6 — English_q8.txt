Here's a breakdown of the question's difficulty and my estimated proportion correct:

**Analysis of the Specific Question:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic English vocabulary (book, reading, is, he, a). These are extremely common words taught very early.
    *   Fundamental understanding of English sentence structure (subject-verb-object). This is a foundational concept in any English curriculum, even for beginners.
    *   Recognition of proper capitalization for the start of a sentence.
*   **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** All words are simple and high-frequency. They are highly likely to be known by Class 6 students who have had even basic exposure to English.
    *   **Grammar/Syntax:** The task directly tests syntax. However, the sentence itself is very basic present continuous ("He is reading a book"), which is typically introduced early. It doesn't involve complex tenses, passive voice, or unusual word orders.
    *   **Cognitive Load:** The sentence has only five words. This minimizes the memory load and allows students to focus purely on the arrangement.
*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning?** This is primarily an **application** task, requiring students to apply their knowledge of basic English sentence structure. It has elements of recall (recalling SVO order) and minimal reasoning (figuring out which word starts the sentence and how the parts fit).
*   **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:** This is a very common type of exercise found in introductory English textbooks and workbooks for young learners. It's often one of the first grammatical exercises taught after basic vocabulary. It's generally considered foundational and relatively easy.

**Contrastive Analysis with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Compared to 5% (Theme of "The Last Bargain"):** This question is *massively* easier. The 5% item requires deep comprehension of a poem (often literary interpretation is hard), abstract thinking, and ability to articulate a complex idea in English. Our target question only requires arranging five simple words.
*   **Compared to 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** This question is significantly easier. The 15% item requires specific historical knowledge, analytical skills (differentiating), and the ability to provide examples, all articulated in coherent English. Our target question involves no content knowledge beyond basic English words and grammar.
*   **Compared to 30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This question is considerably easier. The 30% item requires idea generation, sustained writing (6-8 lines), vocabulary for description, and complex sentence construction. Our target question requires forming just one, very simple, given sentence.
*   **Compared to 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This question is likely slightly easier or comparable. The 50% item requires recall of specific details from a story and expressing them. Our target question doesn't require prior content recall beyond general language rules, but the language complexity is even lower than retrieving specific facts and stating them correctly. The example responses for the 50% item show struggles with completeness, which is less of a factor for our task.
*   **Compared to 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This question is likely easier. The 66% item requires specific civics knowledge (recalling actual Fundamental Rights) and the ability to articulate them correctly. While many students know *some* rights, remembering two specific ones and writing them down accurately in English might be harder than arranging five simple, common words into a basic sentence. The 66% item is still recall-based, similar to the 50% one, but with potentially slightly higher retention difficulty for specifics.

**Key Strengths of the Target Question for this Demographic:**

*   **Simplicity:** Few words, basic structure.
*   **High-Frequency Vocabulary:** All words are common.
*   **Common Exercise Type:** Students would likely have practiced this many times.
*   **Low Cognitive Load:** Doesn't require deep thinking, content knowledge, or creative expression.

**Weaknesses:**

*   Even basic English grammar can be a barrier for those with extremely limited exposure. Some students might simply not know what "he is reading a book" means or the standard English SVO order.
*   Typographical errors or scrambling even simple sentences can happen under test conditions for stressed or less-proficient students.

**Estimate:**

Given its extreme simplicity, reliance on very basic English constructs, and being a common exercise type, this question should fall well above the 50% and 66% anchors. While there will always be a segment of students with very minimal English proficiency who might struggle, a large majority, having reached Class 6 and with some English exposure, would likely
