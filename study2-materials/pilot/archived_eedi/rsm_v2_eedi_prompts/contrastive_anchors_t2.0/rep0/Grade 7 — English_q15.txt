This question falls in line with common Class 7 English language tasks, making it relatively accessible.

Here's a breakdown of the difficulty factors compared to the calibration anchors:

*   **Prior Knowledge:** The question requires no specific academic prior knowledge. It's about personal experience. This is significantly easier than answering questions about specific poems ("The Last Bargain," 5% pass rate), historical sources (15% pass rate), or fundamental rights (66% pass rate, but specific knowledge required). Even "The Three Questions" (50% pass rate) requires recall of a specific story. "My Favorite Season" (30% pass rate) is the most similar in requiring personal expression.

*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Favourite Hobby," "mention," "enjoy" are all relatively common and basic English words for this age group, even for those with limited English proficiency. They are likely to have encountered these in basic English lessons.
    *   **Sentence Structure:** Students are asked to write a "short paragraph" of "4-5 sentences." This length is manageable. The prompt gives clear structural guidance: "what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it." This scaffolding significantly reduces the linguistic burden of structuring a response independently.
    *   **Compared to other items:** This is easier than comprehending and analyzing a poem (5%), differentiating abstract concepts (15%), or summarizing a specific literary plot (50%). It's comparable to, but slightly easier than, "My Favorite Season" because hobbies are often more clearly defined and personal than seasons, which might require a bit more descriptive language. The fundamental rights question (66%) required specific names, which can be hard to spell, but the concepts themselves might be simpler if known.

*   **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:** This is primarily an application and expressive task, based on personal experience. It's not recall (like historical facts or story details) or complex reasoning. This is generally an easier cognitive load for students than factual recall or analytical tasks.

*   **Difficulty compared to typical textbook exercises:** Writing short paragraphs about personal topics like "My Family," "My Pet," "My School," or "My Hobby" are very common exercises in basic English language curricula, especially in government schools aiming to build foundational writing skills. This question is a staple. The provided structure ("what it is, when you do it, why you enjoy it") is also typical for such guided writing prompts.

**Contrast with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Easiest Anchor (66% - Fundamental Rights):** That item required specific factual recall, but the concepts themselves might be well-taught. Our question, while also specific, is about *personal* experience, which is always accessible.
*   **"My Favorite Season" (30%):** This is the closest analog. "My Favorite Hobby" is likely slightly easier.
    *   **Definition:** Hobbies are generally more concretely defined by students than the broader concept of a "season." Students are more likely to have a very specific "favourite hobby" (e.g., playing cricket, drawing) than they are a specific "favourite season" with clear actions tied to it, beyond general descriptions.
    *   **Specificity:** A hobby tends to lend itself more readily to describing "what you do" and "why you enjoy it" than a season, where descriptions might be more sensory or less action-oriented. The structure given for "Hobby" (what, when, why) feels more natural for a hobby description. The "My Favorite Season" prompt asked for "what you like to do, what you eat or wear, and w," which is also descriptive, but the hobby context might be more directly related to *personal agency*.

Considering these points, the question is highly accessible, requires no external knowledge, provides clear structural scaffolding, and asks for personal expression on a common topic. It should perform better than "My Favorite Season." It is also easier than purely factual recall requiring precise vocabulary or differentiating concepts.
