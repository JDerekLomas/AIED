Contrastive Analysis:

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:** This question assumes specific recall knowledge about the Harappan Civilization, which is a core topic in Indian history (ancient history, specifically the Indus Valley Civilization) for Class 8. Students would have been taught this in their social science textbooks. The key features like grid planning, drainage, citadel, baked bricks are standard textbook content.

2.  **Language Demands:** The language demand is moderate. "Describe one key feature" is a straightforward instruction. The vocabulary "key feature," "urban planning," and "Harappan Civilization" are likely familiar from the curriculum. However, formulating a descriptive answer in English can be challenging for students with limited proficiency. They need to articulate a *feature* and *describe* it, rather than just state a word.

3.  **Recall, Application, or Reasoning:** This is primarily a **recall** question. Students need to remember specific details taught about Harappan urban planning. There's minimal application or reasoning required beyond retrieving facts.

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:** This is a very common type of question found in end-of-chapter exercises or exam papers related to the Harappan Civilization. "List features," "Describe features," or "Explain aspects of" are standard question formats for historical topics. It's not obscure or requiring deep analytical skill; it asks for fundamental factual knowledge.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% ("Write a theme... poem"):** This requires interpretation, synthesis, and expressing abstract ideas about a poem, which is generally harder than recalling historical facts, especially for non-native English speakers. Our question is simpler in its cognitive demand.
*   **Pass rate 15% ("Differentiate between... sources"):** This requires defining two concepts and then *differentiating* them, implying comparative analysis, plus providing examples. While factual recall is involved, the comparative aspect and providing two distinct examples make it slightly more complex than just stating *one* feature. The topic itself (archaeological/literary sources) might also be a bit more abstract for some than Harappan cities.
*   **Pass rate 30% ("My favorite season"):** This requires sustained paragraph writing (6-8 lines) on a personal, albeit familiar, topic, including elaboration. While not demanding deep factual recall, producing coherent sentences and a paragraph in English can be tough. Our question is a single point of description, not a paragraph.
*   **Pass rate 50% ("Three questions the king wanted to answer?"):** This is pure recall of specific plot details from a known story. This is *very* similar in cognitive demand to our question: recall a specific piece of information from the curriculum. The "three questions" are likely very prominent in the story "Three Questions" by Tolstoy. This 50% pass rate anchor feels quite close to the nature of our question.
*   **Pass rate 66% ("Two Fundamental Rights"):** This is direct recall of highly emphasized information. Fundamental Rights are a critically important, repeatedly taught topic. Stating *two* specific rights, which are almost certainly rote-learned, makes it relatively easy. The Harappan features are also rote-learned, but perhaps slightly less universally prioritized than Fundamental Rights in every class.

**Overall Assessment:**

The question "Describe one key feature of the Harappan Civilization's urban planning" is:
*   **Direct recall** of standard social science curriculum.
*   Involves **specific, often visually reinforced details** (grid plan, drainage).
*   **Low language barrier** for comprehension, but modest barrier for description.
*   Requires *one* key feature, not multiple, reducing cognitive load.
*   A common, expected type of question.

It sits somewhere between the "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%) and the "Two Fundamental Rights" (66%). The "Three questions" anchor requires remembering three specific items. Ours requires one, but the specific phrasing for 'urban planning' might be a tiny bit more nuanced than just naming rights or question elements. However, Harappan civilization's urban planning features are iconic and heavily emphasized in textbooks. Given that 29% is the average pass rate, 50-66% is a good range for a straightforward recall question from a major curriculum topic.

The constraint of articulating a "description" in English, rather than just naming it, will pull it down a bit from the 66% anchor. The fact it's "one key feature" and these features are very distinct and memorable pulls it up towards the 50-66% range.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55%**
