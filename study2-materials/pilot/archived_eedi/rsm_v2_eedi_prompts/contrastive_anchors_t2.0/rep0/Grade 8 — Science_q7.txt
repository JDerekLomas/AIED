## Contrastive Analysis of the "Gardener Waste" Question:

**Compared to the calibration anchors, here's an analysis of the "Gardener Waste" question:**

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Directly Relevant:** Basic understanding of decomposition, organic matter, and composting (even if they don't know the formal terms). They need to understand that biological waste *changes* over time when left in a pit. This is fundamental science for Class 8, often covered in chapters on environment, soil, or even basic agriculture.
    *   **Less Direct but Helpful:** Some familiarity with gardening practices or observing natural processes in their surroundings. Many students, especially from rural backgrounds, might have observed this process even without formal instruction.
*   **Language Demands:**
    *   **Keywords:** "gardener," "collected waste of plants, vegetables and fruits," "pit," "change," "reason," "evaluate," "beneficial," "soil health."
    *   **Complexity:** The language is relatively straightforward for the subject matter. "Beneficial for soil health" might be slightly more abstract than simply asking *what* changes occur, but it's a common phrase in environmental science. The sentence structure is simple.
    *   **English Proficiency:** While English medium, the vocabulary is likely within the reach of students exposed to basic science terms in English. "Decomposition" is the key scientific concept, but even without knowing that exact word, students can describe the "changes" observed (e.g., waste turning into dark soil-like material).
*   **Type of Task:**
    *   **Recall/Application:** Primarily application and some recall. Students need to recall the concept of organic decomposition and then *apply* it to the scenario presented.
    *   **Reasoning/Evaluation:** The "Give reasons and evaluate if this is beneficial for soil health" part pushes it beyond mere recall to requiring basic reasoning. They need to understand *why* the changes occur and *why* they are good for the soil.
*   **Difficulty vs. Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   This type of question (observational scenario + explanation + evaluation) is common in environmental science or biology chapters for Class 8. It requires more than rote memorization.
    *   Many textbook questions would ask "What is decomposition?" or "List the benefits of compost." This question wraps it in a short, relatable narrative, which can sometimes make it easier to visualize for students, but requires them to connect observations to scientific principles.

**Comparison with Anchors:**

*   **Compared to 5% (Poem Theme):** This question is *significantly easier*. The poem theme requires deep comprehension, inferential reasoning, and articulate expression about abstract concepts in English. The gardener question is concrete and relates to observable natural processes.
*   **Compared to 15% (Archaeological vs. Literary Sources):** This is likely *easier*. Differentiating sources requires understanding historical methodology and specific examples, which can be conceptual and prone to memorization errors if not fully grasped. The gardener question taps into more universal, practical observations.
*   **Compared to 30% ("My favorite season"):** This is arguably *harder* than simply describing a season, but in a different way. "My favorite season" requires creativity and personal expression, which many students can do even with basic English. The gardener question demands a specific scientific understanding and logical reasoning, though the scientific concept itself is foundational. If a student only writes "yes, it changes" without reason or evaluation, they score 0.
*   **Compared to 50% (King's 3 questions):** This question is probably *around the same difficulty or slightly easier*. The "King's questions" is pure recall of a specific story, which can be high if the story was recently covered, or low if forgotten. The gardener question draws on general science knowledge, which is less subject to forgetting a specific detail and more about a basic understanding. The max score here is 0.5, implying a relatively low bar for correctness (e.g., just identifying a change and a minimal reason/benefit).
*   **Compared to 66% (Fundamental Rights):** This is *harder*. Naming two fundamental rights is pure recall of memorized civic information. While important, it doesn't require reasoning or application. The gardener question demands explanation and evaluation.

**Key Factors for This Question's Difficulty:**

*   **Relatability:** The scenario is highly relatable for students, particularly those in agricultural or semi-urban settings where composting or waste disposal in pits is common. This direct experience can aid understanding.
*   **Core Science Concept:** Decomposition is a fundamental concept that should be covered in Class 8 environmental science or biology.
*   **Low Scoring Bar (Max 0.5):**
