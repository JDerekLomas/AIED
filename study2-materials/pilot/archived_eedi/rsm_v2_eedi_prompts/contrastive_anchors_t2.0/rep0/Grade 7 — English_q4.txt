This question asks students to consider the importance of the king's three questions in their own lives and provide a reason. Let's break down its potential difficulty.

**Prior Knowledge:**
*   **Implied Context:** The question assumes students have read the passage about the king's questions (likely "The Three Questions" by Leo Tolstoy, though not explicitly stated). They need to recall what those questions were or at least understand their essence (timing, action, people).
*   **Life Experience:** Students need some basic understanding of decision-making, social interactions, and planning to relate the king's questions to "real life." This is common human experience.

**Language Demands:**
*   **"Do you think...important in real life?"**: This is a fairly straightforward English phrasing for a Class 7 student. "Important" and "real life" are common vocabulary.
*   **"Give one reason"**: Clear instruction for justification.
*   **Abstract Concept:** While the words are simple, the task requires students to connect abstract philosophical questions to practical application, which might be slightly challenging for students with limited English to articulate nuanced thoughts, but the prompt asks for "one reason," simplifying the task.

**Type of Task:**
*   **Application/Reasoning:** This is not a simple recall question. Students need to apply the themes from the story to a real-world context and articulate a reason for their viewpoint. It goes beyond rote memorization.
*   **Subjectivity:** There isn't one "correct" answer for *why* they are important. Any reasonable justification would suffice (e.g., "to make good decisions," "to live happily," "to succeed"). This openness might make it easier as students aren't looking for a single precise answer.

**Comparison to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% ("Write a theme...The Last Bargain"):** This is harder. Identifying a "theme or central idea" is a higher-order thinking skill that requires deeper comprehension and abstraction, often difficult for students who struggle with literal meaning. It also implies more specific analytical writing.
*   **Pass rate 15% ("Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..."):** This is also harder. It requires specific historical vocabulary, a clear understanding of two distinct concepts, and the ability to articulate differences and examples precisely. This is academic content with specific definitions.
*   **Pass rate 30% ("Write a short paragraph... 'My favorite season'"):** This is similar in a way. Both ask for personal opinion/reflection with some justification. "My favorite season" requires generating multiple sentences and details. The target question asks for only "one reason." However, the vocabulary in "My favorite season" might be more immediate and concrete. The target question is slightly more abstract.
*   **Pass rate 50% ("What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"):** This is easier. This is pure recall from the text. Students who understood the story and remember the questions can get this right directly. The target question builds on this by asking for an *interpretation* of those questions' importance.
*   **Pass rate 66% ("Name any two Fundamental Rights..."):** This is easier. This is also recall of specific, foundational civic knowledge taught in Class 7. Students who studied civics know these directly.

**Contrastive Analysis Summary:**

This question lies somewhere above pure recall but below complex analysis or specific academic differentiation. It taps into general life wisdom and allows for a simple, personal justification. The open-ended nature ("any valid reason") lowers the bar for correctness significantly. Students don't need complex English to state "Yes, because we need to make good decisions." The core concepts (decision-making, choosing right actions/people/time) are universal and accessible. The difficulty would largely be in connecting the "king's questions" explicitly to "real life" and articulating a reason in English. Given that they just read about these questions, the first part is primed.

The constraint of providing "one reason" is very forgiving. Even a slightly awkward English sentence conveying a basic point should get a point.

I'd place this above the pure recall items but below the more analytical or definition-based questions. The "My favorite season" question for 30% is a decent anchor; this question asks for less content (one reason vs. 6-8 lines) but on a slightly more abstract topic. However, the abstract topic here is more relatable to general life principles than academic subjects.
