Let's analyze the target question in comparison to the calibration anchors.

**Target Question:** Change the following sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice:\nThe wind blew the leaves away.

**Contrastive Analysis:**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   Basic understanding of subject, verb, and object in a sentence.
    *   Knowledge of the concept of active and passive voice (even if not explicitly named, the grammatical transformation).
    *   Knowledge of verb tenses, specifically the simple past tense (blow, blew, blown).
    *   Implicit understanding of "by the wind" as an agent.
    *   Compared to other items:
        *   Easier than "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources" which requires factual recall and conceptual understanding of two distinct categories.
        *   Easier than "Write a theme or central idea..." which requires interpretive reading and abstract thought.
        *   Similar to "What were the three questions..." in that it's a specific grammatical transformation, but perhaps a bit more complex than just recalling items from a story.
        *   Harder than "Name any two Fundamental Rights..." which is straightforward recall.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Vocabulary:** "wind," "blew," "leaves," "away" are relatively common words for Class 7. "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice" are grammatical terms that might be new or not fully grasped in English, even if the concept is taught in Hindi.
    *   **Grammar:** Requires understanding of verb forms (past participle "blown"), auxiliary verbs ("were"), and sentence structure rearrangement. This is a core grammatical transformation that can be tricky for second-language learners.
    *   **Instructions:** "Change... from Active Voice to Passive Voice" is explicit and uses precise grammatical terminology. Students might struggle if they don't know what "active voice" and "passive voice" mean *in English*, even if they know how to do the transformation intuitively in Hindi. This is a significant hurdle compared to instructions like "Name any two..." or "Write a short paragraph...".
    *   Compared to other items:
        *   "My favorite season" or "Three questions the king wanted to answer" primarily require reading comprehension and basic sentence formation. The target question adds a specific grammatical *transformation* with technical terms.
        *   The themes/differentiation questions have higher vocabulary demands for expressing complex ideas.
        *   The key challenge here is the *grammatical transformation* itself and understanding the *technical instructions* in English.

3.  **Is this recall, application, or reasoning?**
    *   This is primarily **application** of grammatical rules. It's not rote recall (like "Fundamental Rights") nor deep reasoning/interpretation (like "theme of the poem"). It requires applying a learned grammatical pattern to a new sentence.

4.  **How does it compare in difficulty to typical textbook exercises?**
    *   Changing voice is a standard grammar exercise in Class 6/7 English textbooks in India. However, *proficiency* in performing this consistently, especially given the low average pass rate and limited English proficiency, will vary. Many students might struggle with the specific past tense/past participle forms or the correct use of "were" + past participle.

**Detailed Breakdown of Difficulty Factors:**

*   **Understanding "Active/Passive Voice" terms:** A significant blocker if students haven't explicitly learned these terms in English, or if their conceptual understanding is weak. They might know *how* to transform a sentence in Hindi but struggle with the English terminology and the equivalent grammatical structure.
*   **Verb Transformation:** "blew" (past simple) to "were blown" (past passive). The irregular verb "blow-blew-blown" adds a layer of difficulty. Many might just change "blew" to "was blew" or similar.
*   **Subject/Object Inversion:** Recognizing "the leaves" as the new subject and introducing "by the wind."
*   **Conciseness of Rubric:** The rubric expects the precise "The leaves were blown away by the wind." Any significant deviation (wrong tense, incorrect verb form, missing "by the wind" if crucial, etc.) would likely lead to a 0.

**Calibration Point Reference:**

*   **Pass rate 5% ("Theme or central idea"):** This is too high-level and abstract. The target question is more concrete.
*   **Pass rate 15% ("Differentiate archaeological/literary"):** Requires conceptual knowledge and specific examples. The grammatical transformation is a different kind of challenge, but also rule-based. The fact that the target question asks for a *transformation* using specific English terminology makes it challenging, perhaps in the ballpark of this or slightly higher.
