This question tests a very common and fundamental grammatical concept in English – the use of 'some' vs. 'any'.

Here's a breakdown of its difficulty compared to the anchors:

**Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
*   **Basic English vocabulary:** Students need to understand words like "apples," "basket," and the core meaning of "are." This is very basic Class 6 vocabulary.
*   **Basic sentence structure:** Students need to understand a simple declarative sentence.
*   **Rule of 'some' vs. 'any':** This is the core knowledge being tested. The rule is that 'some' is used in affirmative sentences and offers/requests, while 'any' is typically used in negative sentences and questions. This is a common topic introduced around Class 4-6 in English grammar curricula.

**Language Demands:**
*   **Minimal English proficiency needed:** The sentence structure is extremely simple ("There are X in Y"). There are no complex clauses, obscure vocabulary, or idiomatic expressions.
*   **Reading:** The reading load is very low.
*   **Writing:** No writing is required, only selecting one of two given options. This significantly reduces the language demand compared to even short-answer questions.

**Recall, Application, or Reasoning?**
*   This is primarily **application** of a learned grammatical rule. Students need to recall the rule and apply it to a straightforward, unambiguous sentence. There's no complex reasoning involved.

**Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
*   This question is highly representative of typical fill-in-the-blank or multiple-choice grammar exercises found in Class 4-6 English textbooks for students learning basic grammar. It's usually one of the first grammar points taught regarding quantity determiners.

**Contrastive Analysis with Anchors:**

*   **Compared to 5% anchor ("Write a theme or central idea..."):** Hugely easier. That item requires advanced comprehension of a poem, abstract reasoning to identify a theme, and complex English writing skills to articulate it coherently. This item is pure basic grammar recall/application.
*   **Compared to 15% anchor ("Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..."):** Significantly easier. That item requires recall of two specific historical terms, understanding their definitions, providing distinct examples, and organizing this information into a comparative written response. This item is simpler vocabulary, no explanation, no complex organization, and just a choice.
*   **Compared to 30% anchor ("Write a short paragraph on 'My favorite season.'"):** Considerably easier. That item demands creative generation of ideas, vocabulary recall (season, activities, food/wear), sentence construction, and sustained writing (6-8 lines). This item is passive comprehension and selection, not active generation.
*   **Compared to 50% anchor ("What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"):** Easier. While that item requires recall of specific information from a story and concise writing, this grammar item tests a fundamental, recurring rule rather than specific plot points. Also, "Empty Response" was common for the 50% anchor, which implies some struggle with recall or articulating the answer. This item reduces writing demands to zero.
*   **Compared to 66% anchor ("Name any two Fundamental Rights..."):** Similar difficulty, possibly slightly easier. That item tests specific factual recall of social studies content and then the ability to write those names correctly. This grammar question tests a pervasive rule and just needs identification. While Fundamental Rights are taught, the exact naming can be tricky, as seen by the partial/incorrect responses in the anchor examples. The 'some/any' rule is simpler to apply without specific word memorization. Students are more likely to have internalized the 'some/any' rule through repeated exposure than the precise wording of two specific fundamental rights.

**Conclusion:**

This question is at the foundational level of English grammar. The vocabulary is simple, the sentence structure is elementary, and the task is merely selecting between two words, eliminating any writing barrier. The rule for 'some' and 'any' is introduced early in English instruction. Given the 66% anchor tests recall of specific social studies facts (which still have some vocabulary and writing demands), this question, which tests a basic, universally applicable grammar rule with minimal cognitive and linguistic load, should have a very high pass rate.
