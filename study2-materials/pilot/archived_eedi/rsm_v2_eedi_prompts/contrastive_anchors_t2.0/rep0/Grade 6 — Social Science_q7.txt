Here's a detailed analysis to arrive at the estimated proportion correct:

**Contrastive Analysis of the Target Question:**

**Question:** Mention any two natural resources found in Rajasthan and explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there.

*   **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Geographic Knowledge:** Students need to know basic geography, specifically that Rajasthan is a state in India and generally what kind of environment/resources are found there (e.g., desert, minerals, limited water). This is standard Class 6 Social Science content.
    *   **Definition of "Natural Resources":** They should understand what natural resources are. This term is introduced early in environmental studies/geography.
    *   **Basic Understanding of Influence/Impact:** They need to be able to connect a resource to its effect on human life (e.g., water scarcity means a particular lifestyle, minerals mean mining jobs).
*   **Language Demands (for students with limited English):**
    *   "Mention" and "explain" are common command words.
    *   "Natural resources" is a technical term but likely taught in their curriculum (perhaps in Hindi: प्राकृतिक संसाधन).
    *   "Influences" might be a slightly harder vocabulary word for some, but the core idea of "how it affects/changes lives" should be graspable.
    *   The second part requiring an explanation (even a simple one) increases the linguistic demand slightly more than just naming.
*   **Cognitive Demands (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   **Recall:** Naming two natural resources is largely recall.
    *   **Application/Simple Reasoning:** Explaining the influence requires a basic level of application of knowledge and simple reasoning about cause and effect. This isn't complex, deep reasoning but requires more than just memorization.
*   **Comparison to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   Listing resources of a state is a very common type of Class 6 geography question.
    *   Explaining the *impact* is slightly more complex than just listing, often appearing as "short answer" type questions in textbooks.
    *   It's not as simple as defining a term, but not as complex as analyzing a historical event or deeply interpreting a poem.

**Comparison with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (5% pass rate): Theme of "The Last Bargain" poem:** Highly abstract, requires deep understanding of poetry, symbolism, and English language. Our target question is far more concrete and factual.
*   **Item (15% pass rate): Differentiate archaeological and literary sources:** Requires understanding two abstract concepts and comparing/contrasting them with examples. "Differentiate" is a higher-order thinking skill. Our question's explanation part is simpler cause-and-effect.
*   **Item (30% pass rate): Short paragraph on "My favorite season":** Requires creative writing, sentence construction, and sustained English expression. Students often struggle with quantity and coherence. Our target question requires factual recall and a very brief explanation, not extensive writing. The prompt also *gives* suggestions for what to write, making it easier than pure freeform.
*   **Item (50% pass rate): Three questions the king wanted to answer?:** Pure recall of specific plot details from a known story. High recall, low language demand if the story is familiar. The target question is similar in requiring recall, but the second part adds a small layer of explanation/reasoning.
*   **Item (66% pass rate): Two Fundamental Rights:** Pure recall of specific, well-taught constitutional facts. This is highly emphasized content in civics. Minimal language demand beyond naming.

**Where does our target question fit?**

*   **Higher than 5% and 15%:** It's not as abstract or demanding in comparison/differentiation as those items.
*   **Likely higher than 30%:** While there's an "explain" part, it's about facts and simple relationships, not free-form creative writing which many struggle with structurally and linguistically. A simple answer like "Rajasthan has a lot of marble, and people build houses and monuments with it, and some work in mines" would get credit.
*   **Below 66% (and perhaps even 50%):** The 66% item is pure, core recall from a major civics topic. The 50% item is also pure recall from a likely well-known story. The target question has the "explanation" component, which adds a layer of difficulty beyond simple recall.
    *   While natural resources of a region are important, "Fundamental Rights" is often drilled extensively.
    *   Students might recall "desert" or "minerals" but struggle to correctly identify *two specific* natural resources from Rajasthan
