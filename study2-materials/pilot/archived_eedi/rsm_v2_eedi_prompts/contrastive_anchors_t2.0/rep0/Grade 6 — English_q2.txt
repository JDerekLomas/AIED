Here's an analysis of the question "Who lived inside the book?" for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, followed by the estimated proportion correct.

**Contrastive Analysis of "Who lived inside the book?"**

1.  **Prior Knowledge Assumed:**
    *   **Low Assumption:** This question assumes direct recall of a specific detail from a previously read story/text. It doesn't require complex historical facts (like the "Archaeological/Literary sources" question), deep poetic analysis ("The Last Bargain" theme), or abstract concepts. It's likely a comprehension question about a story they have encountered.
    *   **Specific Detail:** The key is remembering a very specific character detail, which implies the story was either recently read or particularly memorable for this aspect.

2.  **Language Demands (Limited English Proficiency):**
    *   **Relatively Low:** The question is very straightforward: "Who lived inside the book?"
        *   "Who" is a basic interrogative.
        *   "Lived" is a common verb, past tense, but understandable.
        *   "Inside" is a common preposition.
        *   "The book" is basic vocabulary.
    *   **Challenge:** The difficulty wouldn't come from understanding the question itself, but from accurately recalling the answer *in English* if their primary medium of instruction for the story was Hindi or another regional language. However, "fairy" is a reasonably common word in children's stories and could be learned.

3.  **Nature of Task (Recall, Application, Reasoning):**
    *   **Pure Recall:** This is a direct recall question. There is no application, reasoning, synthesis, or creative writing required. Students either know the specific detail from the text or they don't. This is simpler than explaining "My Favorite Season" (which requires personal expression and structuring) or differentiating between two types of historical sources (which requires understanding definitions and examples).

4.  **Difficulty Compared to Typical Textbook Exercises:**
    *   **Average to Easy-Average:** Questions like "Who lived in X?" or "What did Y do?" are staple comprehension questions found in almost every reading comprehension exercise in textbooks. They are fundamental for checking if students have understood the basic plot and characters. It's much simpler than the open-ended "My favorite season" or the more complex analytical tasks.
    *   The "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50% pass rate) is also a direct recall question of specific details. This question, "Who lived inside the book?", seems directly comparable in cognitive demand, if not slightly easier due to often being a primary character.

**Comparison to Anchors:**

*   **"Three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50% pass rate):** This is the closest comparison. Both are direct recall of specific textual details. The king's three questions might be slightly more abstract or numerous to recall than a single, distinct character. "A magical fairy" is quite a memorable detail for a story about something living inside a book.
*   **"My favorite season" (30% pass rate):** Requires sentence construction, organization, and personal expression. "Who lived inside the book?" only requires a phrase or a word.
*   **"Archaeological/Literary sources" (15% pass rate):** Requires understanding definitions, examples, and differentiating. Much higher cognitive load.
*   **"Theme of The Last Bargain" (5% pass rate):** Highly abstract, requiring deep comprehension and analytical skills.

**Considering the Students:**

*   **Economically weaker sections, Hindi-medium, limited English:** The simplicity of the English phrasing is a huge advantage here. If they understood the story (even if in Hindi), translating the key character name ("fairy" / 'pari') is highly probable. The main barrier is knowing the *correct answer* from the text, rather than formulating a complex English response.

**Refinement:**
The "King's three questions" had a 50% pass rate. While similar in requiring recall, identifying a single prominent character (a magical fairy) often feels slightly easier or more central to the plot's memorability than remembering *three* specific questions. Children's stories often emphasize a key protagonist or unusual character. Given the very basic vocabulary and sentence structure, if the story was adequately taught, a large proportion *should* be able to recall this specific detail.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 55-60%**

I'm placing it slightly higher than "The three questions" because a singular, memorable character like a "magical fairy living inside a book" often sticks more vividly in a child's mind than a list of three questions, especially in a simple story context. The ease of English input also supports a higher
