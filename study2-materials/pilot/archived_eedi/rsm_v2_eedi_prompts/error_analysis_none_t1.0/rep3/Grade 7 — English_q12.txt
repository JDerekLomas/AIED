Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the student profile (economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate 29%):

*   **Core Misconceptions about Voice (Grammar):**
    *   **Lack of understanding of "Voice" concept:** Many students might not even understand what "active" and "passive" voice mean, let alone how to transform between them. This is a higher-level grammatical concept.
    *   **Difficulty identifying Subject and Object:** In active voice, the subject performs the action. In passive, the object becomes the subject. Identifying these roles correctly is the first hurdle.
    *   **Incorrect tense transformation:** The original sentence is in Simple Past. The passive voice must maintain this tense (was/were + past participle). This is a very common error. Students might use "are blown," "is blown," or "will be blown."
    *   **Incorrect Past Participle:** "Blew" is the past tense. The past participle is "blown." Irregular verbs are a major stumbling block for English learners, especially those with limited exposure. Many might stick with "blew" or invent something like "blowed."
    *   **Missing "by + agent":** While "by the wind" can sometimes be omitted in general passive voice, it's usually expected in transformation exercises. Students might forget it or place it incorrectly.
    *   **Word order confusion:** Even if they get some elements right, the correct word order ("The leaves were blown away by the wind") can be challenging.

*   **Language Misunderstandings (Vocabulary/Phrasing):**
    *   **"Blew away":** This phrasal verb might be understood literally as "wind went away" rather than "carried away by wind."
    *   **"Leaves":** While a common word, some might struggle with plural forms or associate it primarily with "leaf" and get confused.
    *   **Lack of familiarity with "be" verbs in different tenses:** Understanding "was/were" in the context of past tense passive voice is crucial.

*   **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **Attempt and Fail (Most Common):** Most students will likely attempt it, as it's a direct instruction. However, the attempt will be riddled with errors due to the issues listed above.
    *   **Not Attempting:** Some students, completely lost on the concept of "voice" or unable to form a coherent sentence, might leave it blank. This would likely be a smaller proportion than those who attempt and fail.

*   **Most Common Wrong Answer Look-Alikes:**

    1.  **Incorrect Tense/Auxiliary Verb:**
        *   "The leaves **are** blown away by the wind." (Very common, confusing simple past with simple present)
        *   "The leaves **is** blown away by the wind." (Incorrect subject-verb agreement for plural "leaves")
        *   "The leaves **will be** blown away by the wind." (Future tense confusion)

    2.  **Incorrect Past Participle:**
        *   "The leaves **were blew** away by the wind." (Sticking with past tense)
        *   "The leaves **were blowed** away by the wind." (Invented regular past participle)

    3.  **Mixing Active and Passive/Incorrect Structure:**
        *   "The leaves away the wind blew." (Just reordering words)
        *   "The wind was blown away the leaves." (Completely misunderstanding subject/object)

    4.  **Missing "by the wind" or "away":**
        *   "The leaves were blown."
        *   "The leaves were blown by the wind." (Missing "away")

    5.  **Partial/Incomplete answers.**

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

Considering the complexity of the grammar, the irregular verb, and the typical language proficiency of the target group, a very low pass rate is expected. Even with "average pass rate about 29%," this specific question is quite challenging.

*   Identifying subject/object: Hard
*   Changing position: Medium
*   Using correct auxiliary verb (was/were): Hard (tense error likely)
*   Using correct past participle (blown): Very Hard (irregular verb)
*   Maintaining "away": Medium
*   Adding "by the wind": Medium

I would estimate that only a small fraction of these students would get all these elements correct.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 7%**

This estimate is significantly lower than the average pass rate because this question requires a specific, multi-step grammatical transformation involving an irregular verb, which is a common area of
