Let's break down the likely errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) Misconception:** This is the most fundamental grammatical structure. Students might struggle to identify the subject (he), the verb phrase (is reading), and the object (a book).
    *   **Misconception:** They might not understand that the sentence *must* start with the doer of the action (he).
    *   **Common Errors:** Placing the verb before the subject, or the object before the verb/subject.

2.  **Lack of Punctuation Knowledge (Implied):** While not directly tested in *rearrangement*, the absence of a capital letter for 'he' and a full stop at the end can be a subtle indicator of broader grammatical weakness. Students might not conceptualize a "sentence" as starting with a capital letter and ending with a full stop.

3.  **Understanding of "Meaningful Sentence":** "Meaningful" can be interpreted differently. A student might produce a grammatically incorrect sentence that they *believe* conveys meaning, even if it's jumbled.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** They might not fully grasp that "meaningful" implies grammatical correctness and natural word order in English.

4.  **Word-by-Word Translation/L1 Influence:** Students often translate concepts directly from their mother tongue (L1) into English. Many Indian languages have different sentence structures (e.g., Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) is common).
    *   **L1 Interference:** A student might try to form an SOV sentence, leading to structures like "He a book is reading" or "A book he is reading is."
    *   **Confusion with Auxiliary Verbs:** The "is" might be particularly tricky. In some L1s, the equivalent of "is" might appear at the end or be implied.

5.  **Identifying the Main Verb and its Tense:** "Reading" is a present participle, requiring the auxiliary "is." Students might not associate "is" with "reading" as forming a continuous tense.
    *   **Common Errors:** "He reading a book is," "He is a book reading."

6.  **"A" as an Article:** While usually straightforward, students might place "a" incorrectly if they don't understand it precedes "book."

7.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **Attempt and Fail:** The vast majority would attempt this. It's not a question that requires complex vocabulary or understanding of a long passage. They have all the words.
    *   **Not Attempt:** Very few, perhaps only those with extremely low literacy or who are completely overwhelmed by English.

8.  **Most Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   **L1 influenced SOV:** "He a book is reading." (Very common)
    *   **Misplaced 'is':** "He reading a book is." or "He is a book reading."
    *   **Beginning with object:** "A book he is reading." (Less likely as 'he' is a clear subject)
    *   **Jumbled but retaining some word pairs:** "Reading a book he is."
    *   **Simplistic, omitting 'is' or 'a':** "He book reading." (If they completely miss the structure) - *However, the instructions are to rearrange *all* words.*

**Considering the Context:**

*   **Class 6, Indian Government Schools:** This means limited exposure to spoken English, often taught by teachers who themselves might have less fluency. Rote learning is common.
*   **Economically Weaker Sections:** Less access to supplementary learning materials, tutors, or English-speaking environments.
*   **Average Pass Rate 29%:** This is a crucial benchmark. It implies a significant struggle with basic English tasks. Our current question is *basic* but requires structural understanding.

**Revisiting the Question Difficulty:**

This question is a fundamental test of English sentence structure. While simple for a native speaker, for a Class 6 student in this context, it is challenging. The "average pass rate about 29%" for general English questions indicates that even basic tasks are difficult.

**Factors that might *increase* the pass rate for *this specific question* above the average 29%:**

*   **High Frequency of Words:** "He," "is," "reading," "a," "book" are very common words.
*   **Relatable Action:** Reading a book is a common and easily visualized action.
*   **Limited Words to Rearrange:** Only 5 words, which reduces the complexity compared to a longer sentence.

**Factors that might *decrease* the pass rate for *this
