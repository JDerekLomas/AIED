Let's break down the likely errors for Class 6 students in Indian government schools from economically weaker sections with limited English.

## Analyzing Likely Errors

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science:**

*   **Difficulty defining "natural resource":** This is a core concept. Students might confuse natural resources with man-made things, products, or even abstract ideas. They might list cities, temples, or crops without understanding the *source* of the crop (e.g., fertile land, water, but not the crop itself as the *resource*).
*   **Lack of regional knowledge:** While Rajasthan is a prominent state, students might lack specific knowledge about its resources beyond very general ones like "water" or "land." They might not differentiate between resources found generally in India and those specific to Rajasthan.
*   **Concrete vs. Abstract:** "Sunlight for solar energy" or "Wind for wind energy" might be too abstract for some. They are more likely to think of tangible items like minerals or water.
*   **Confusing "natural resources" with "famous things":** They might list famous tourist attractions or historical sites instead of resources.
*   **Difficulty with "influences":** Understanding cause-and-effect ("how one of them influences the lives") is a higher-order thinking skill. They might just describe the resource or its use, but not the *influence* on daily life, economy, or culture. For example, they might say "Marble is used to build houses" but not connect it to "provides employment" or "attracts tourism."

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Natural resources":** This phrase itself can be tricky. "Natural" might be understood, but "resources" could be a stumbling block. They might default to "things from nature."
*   **"Mention any two":** This should be straightforward, but coupled with the difficulty of identifying actual resources, it can lead to problems.
*   **"Explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":** This is the most complex part linguistically and conceptually.
    *   "Influences": A relatively abstract verb. Students might use simpler verbs like "helps," "is used," or "gives."
    *   "Lives of the people": This needs to be understood broadly – economy, daily activities, culture, housing, etc.
    *   "There": Refers back to Rajasthan, which should be clear.

**3. Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**

*   **Likely to attempt:** Most students will try to answer something, even if it's incorrect. They will probably write *something* in response to "mention any two."
*   **Difficulty with the explanation:** The "explain how one influences" part is where many will fail to provide a coherent or correct answer. They might provide a basic use but not an *influence*.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer Look Like:**

*   **Listing general items:** "Trees," "Animals," "Water," "Land" (without specificity). While "Water" is a correct resource, it might be the only correct one, or they might struggle with the explanation.
*   **Listing man-made items or famous places:** "Jaipur," "Udaipur," "Hawa Mahal," "Desert."
*   **Listing crops/products without identifying the underlying resource:** "Bajra," "Cotton," "Milk."
*   **Correct resources but no explanation or a weak, non-influential explanation:** "Marble. People use marble." (Doesn't explain *influence*).
*   **Partial credit attempt:** Mentions one correct resource, but the second is wrong, or the explanation is missing/incorrect.
*   **Completely off-topic:** Writing about unrelated social studies topics or personal anecdotes.
*   **No explanation provided:** Only lists resources.

**Example of a Common Incorrect Answer:**
"1. Trees 2. Water. Water is important for drinking." (Only one correct resource and the explanation is basic use, not influence on lives).
"1. Jaipur 2. Desert. Desert is hot." (Both incorrect resources).
"1. Marble 2. Copper. People use marble for building." (Two correct, but explanation is weak on *influence*).

## Estimated Pass Rate

Considering the factors:

*   **Low base pass rate (29% average):** This implies a significant struggle with even basic questions.
*   **Complexity of "natural resources" and "influence":** These are not trivial concepts for this age group and background.
*   **Language barrier:** "Natural resources" and "influences" are moderately challenging vocabulary.
*   **Reliance on specific regional knowledge:** While water/sandstone/marble are somewhat common, many might not think of them immediately or specifically link them
