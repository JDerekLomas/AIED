Let's break down the likely errors for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, considering their background.

**Likely Errors and Analysis:**

**1. Misconceptions about Mathematics:**

*   **Difficulty with "per hour" / multiplication:** Many students at this level struggle with the concept of repeated addition or multiplication, especially when it's embedded in a word problem. They might add `2` once, or not understand that `2^0 C` is added *for each hour*.
*   **Simple addition/subtraction bias:** Faced with numbers, the default operation for many younger students is addition or subtraction, without deeply understanding the context. They might simply add all the numbers they see (`10 + 30 + 2 + 4`) or subtract them.
*   **Ignoring the initial temperature:** Some might just calculate `6 * 2 = 12` and present `12^0 C` as the answer, forgetting to add it to the initial `30^0 C`.
*   **Incomplete Calculation:** They might correctly find the hours (6) and correctly multiply by 2 (12), but then forget the final step of adding it to the initial temperature.
*   **Time Calculation Errors:**
    *   **Simple Subtraction:** `4 - 10 = -6` (and get confused), or `10 - 4 = 6` (which is correct by coincidence, but for the wrong reason).
    *   **"12-hour clock" confusion:** Many struggle with time duration spanning AM/PM, especially with the transition at noon. Counting on fingers ("10 to 11 is one, 11 to 12 is two, 12 to 1 is three...") is a common but error-prone method.
    *   **Not counting the starting hour:** Some might count 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4 as 5 hours, forgetting the hour *from* 10 to 11.
    *   **Adding 12 to 4:** Thinking 4 PM is 16:00, then `16 - 10 = 6`, which is correct but might be an advanced step for some.
    *   **Focusing only on the hour digit:** `10` to `4` – some might only look at `4` and `10` and try to do `10-4` or `4-10`.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"per hour":** This phrase can be tricky. While commonly used, some students might not grasp its meaning as "for each hour" or "every hour."
*   **"increases by":** Could be understood as just "add 2" once.
*   **"what will be":** Future tense might be a subtle cognitive load.
*   **"in the morning" / "in the evening":** While visually clear (AM/PM), the transition at noon is often a point of confusion for time duration.
*   **Word Order/Complexity:** The sentence structure, though simple to us, can be complex for a student with limited English proficiency. They might extract numbers without understanding the relationships.

**3. Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**

*   **Most will attempt:** Given the numbers, most students will likely attempt something. They won't leave it blank unless they completely give up or are severely intimidated.
*   **Many will fail:** While attempting, a significant portion will fail to get the correct answer due to the reasons above.
*   **Partial attempts:** Some might get the hours correct but mess up the multiplication, or vice-versa. Others might get the increase correct but forget to add to the base temperature.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   **12°C:** (Calculates `6 * 2` but forgets to add to initial temperature). This is a very strong candidate for a common wrong answer.
*   **32°C:** (Adds `30 + 2`, perhaps misinterpreting "per hour" as just a one-time addition, or only considering 1 hour has passed).
*   **36°C:** (Calculates 3 hours, e.g., 1 to 4, then multiplies by 2, then adds 30. `3 * 2 + 30 = 36`). This suggests an error in calculating the duration. Or, perhaps correctly identifies 6 hours, adds 30, but only adds 6 (mistaking 6 hours for 6 degrees).
*   **40°C:** (Mistakes 4 hours for 5 hours or 6 hours, or simply guesses). Or calculates 5 hours
