Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science (specifically Geography):**

*   **Confusion between Mountains and Hills/Plateaus/Plains:** Students might not clearly differentiate between a "mountain range" and other geographical features. They might name a plateau (e.g., Deccan Plateau) or even a major river (e.g., Ganga).
*   **Lack of Specificity/General Knowledge:** While they might know "mountains" exist in India, they might not know the *names* of specific ranges. Their understanding might be very generalized.
*   **Regional Bias:** Students might only know the mountain ranges most prominent in their own region or nearby, and struggle to name two that are geographically distinct or further away. For example, a student from Rajasthan might know Aravalli but not Vindhya.
*   **Difficulty with Abstract Concepts:** "Mountain range" is a somewhat abstract geographical concept. They might know individual mountains but not the larger "range."
*   **Focus on Political Geography over Physical Geography:** Their education might emphasize states, capitals, and historical places more than physical features.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Major":** While "major" is a common word, some students might struggle with its implication here – meaning well-known, significant ranges, not just any hill. They might name a local hill.
*   **"Mountain Ranges":** This is the core term.
    *   **Hindi Equivalent:** Many students will translate this to "पर्वत शृंखला" (Parvat Shrinkhala) or "पहाड़ी श्रृंखला" (Pahadi Shrinkhala) or even just "पर्वत" (Parvat - mountain). If they only understand "पर्वत," they might name individual peaks if they know any, rather than ranges.
    *   **"Range" as a concept:** The idea of a "range" (a series of connected mountains) might be difficult to grasp, leading them to list individual mountains instead of the broader range name.
*   **Limited English Vocabulary:** Even if they know the Hindi names, recalling or spelling the English names correctly could be a challenge. They might mix up spellings or misremember names.

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **Attempt:** Given it's a direct question requiring recall, most students will likely *attempt* it. They might write something down, even if it's incorrect. Blank answers are less likely unless they genuinely have no idea about any geographical features.
*   **Failure:** Many will attempt but fail due to the reasons above.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer Look-Alikes:**

*   **Rivers:** Ganga, Yamuna, Brahmaputra. (Confusion between physical features).
*   **Plateaus:** Deccan Plateau, Malwa Plateau. (Confusion between different landforms).
*   **Cities/States:** Delhi, Mumbai, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh. (General lack of understanding of the question type).
*   **General terms:** "Pahad" (mountain in Hindi), "Big mountains." (Lack of specific names).
*   **Individual peaks (if they know any):** Mt. Everest (even though mostly in Nepal, its proximity and fame might lead to this), Kanchenjunga (if they know it). (Missing the "range" aspect).
*   **Misspellings:** Himlaya, Aravali, Vindya.
*   **Only one correct answer:** The rubric specifically asks for *two* to get the maximum score. If they name only one, they only get 0.5. The question asks for two, and the rubric gives credit for one. This is an important distinction. The "pass rate" means getting *at least one* correct.

**Estimation of Pass Rate:**

Let's consider the breakdown:

*   **Top Performers (Good GK, good English):** Will easily name two (Himalayas, Aravalli, Western Ghats, etc.).
*   **Average Students (Some GK, limited English):**
    *   Might know "Himalayas" as it's very prominent. This alone gets them 0.5.
    *   Might struggle for a second, or name a more regional one like Aravalli if they are from that region, or Vindhya.
    *   Spelling will be a major issue.
    *   Will likely name at least one correct range.
*   **Weaker Students (Limited GK, very limited English):**
    *   Will likely name rivers, plateaus, or just general "mountains."
    *   May leave it blank or write something completely irrelevant.
    *   May only know "Himalayas" as a general
