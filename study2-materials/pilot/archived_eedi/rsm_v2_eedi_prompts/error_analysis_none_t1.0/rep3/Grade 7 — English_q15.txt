Let's break down the likely errors for Class 7 students in Indian government schools, mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English, attempting the "My Favourite Hobby" paragraph question.

**Anticipated Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Grammar and Sentence Structure (High Impact):**
    *   **Tense Confusion:** Struggling to consistently use present simple tense for routine actions (e.g., "I played cricket everyday" instead of "I play cricket everyday").
    *   **Subject-Verb Agreement:** Common errors like "My hobby *are* reading" instead of "My hobby *is* reading."
    *   **Prepositions:** Incorrect usage of prepositions for time and place (e.g., "I do it *on* evening" instead of "in the evening," "I play *in* home" instead of "at home").
    *   **Article Usage:** Omitting or misusing "a," "an," "the" (e.g., "I like *book*" instead of "I like *books*" or "I like *a book*").
    *   **Pronoun Reference:** Confusion with possessive pronouns (e.g., "My hobby is playing. *He* is fun." instead of "It is fun.").
    *   **Run-on Sentences/Sentence Fragments:** Either combining too many ideas without proper punctuation/conjunctions, or writing very short, choppy, incomplete sentences.

2.  **Vocabulary Limitations (Moderate Impact):**
    *   **Limited Descriptive Adjectives:** Struggling to articulate *why* they enjoy it beyond simple terms like "good" or "nice." They might lack words like "relaxing," "exciting," "creative," "challenging," "stress-relieving."
    *   **Struggling to name the hobby:** While common hobbies like "cricket," "reading," "drawing" will be known, less common ones might be poorly phrased.
    *   **Repetitive Vocabulary:** Using the same few words repeatedly.

3.  **Understanding of "Paragraph" and "Sentences" (Moderate Impact):**
    *   **Lack of Cohesion:** Sentences might be isolated ideas rather than flowing logically to form a coherent paragraph.
    *   **Not understanding "4-5 sentences":** Some might write only 1-2 sentences, others might write 10-12 without realizing the constraint.
    *   **Bullet Points instead of Paragraph:** A common error where students list points instead of writing continuous prose.
    *   **Copying the prompt:** Some might just write "My favourite hobby is" and not elaborate.

4.  **Addressing all Prompt Requirements (High Impact):**
    *   **Missing one element:** Students might correctly state the hobby and when they do it, but completely omit *why* they enjoy it, or vice-versa. This is a common failure point for getting a "1."
    *   **Vague answers:** "I like my hobby. It is good." This doesn't sufficiently answer "why."

5.  **Language Misunderstandings (Low to Moderate Impact):**
    *   **"Hobby" itself:** While "hobby" is a fairly common word, some might confuse it with "work" or "study." However, in a Class 7 context, it's likely understood.
    *   **"Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it":** While the instructions are clear, the *application* of fulfilling all three points can be a challenge. They might just list them rather than integrate them into a paragraph.

6.  **Effort and Engagement:**
    *   **Attempt but Fail:** This is the most likely scenario. Students will try to write something, but due to the cumulative effect of the above errors, their answer won't meet the rubric.
    *   **Not Attempt at All:** A smaller percentage might leave it blank due to extreme lack of confidence or very poor English skills.
    *   **Partial Attempt:** Writing 1-2 sentences but not completing the paragraph or addressing all points.

**Most Common Wrong Answer Look Like:**

"My favourite hobby is playing cricket. I play cricket in evening. It is good."

*   **Why it's wrong (by rubric):**
    *   Only 3 sentences, not 4-5.
    *   "It is good" is too vague for "why you enjoy it." It doesn't clearly articulate the enjoyment.
    *   Grammar errors: "in evening" instead of "in the evening."

Another common one:

"My favourite hobby is reading. I read books everyday. I like books. It is nice."
