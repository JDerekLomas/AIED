Let's break down the likely errors for a Class 8 student in an Indian government school, mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English, attempting this question.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Misconceptions about Social Science/Harappan Civilization:**
    *   **Lack of Specific Knowledge:** The primary issue will be a lack of recall of specific features. While "Harappan Civilization" might be a familiar term, detailed aspects like urban planning might not have been sufficiently emphasized or retained. Students might remember broad strokes (ancient, Indus Valley, India) but not the specifics.
    *   **Over-generalization/Confusion with Other Civilizations:** Students might mix up features with other ancient civilizations they've studied (e.g., general features of early settlements) or even modern Indian cities, without distinguishing the unique aspects of Harappan planning.
    *   **Focus on Non-Urban Aspects:** They might recall other facts about Harappa (e.g., seals, pottery, agriculture, religious practices) but fail to connect them specifically to "urban planning." They might describe something true about Harappa, but not relevant to the question.
    *   **Difficulty with "Key Feature":** Students might list *a* feature, but not necessarily a "key" or distinctive one, or simply a generic description of a city.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Describe":** While a common verb, some might offer just a single word or a very brief phrase rather than a descriptive sentence or two.
    *   **"Key Feature":** This phrase might be challenging. "Key" implies importance, distinctiveness, or something central. Students might not grasp this nuance and just recall *any* feature.
    *   **"Harappan Civilization":** While they would likely recognize the name, their understanding of what constitutes a "civilization" might be rudimentary.
    *   **"Urban Planning":** This is the most crucial vocabulary. Many students, especially with limited English, might struggle with "urban planning."
        *   They might understand "urban" (city) but not "planning" in the context of architecture/layout.
        *   They might interpret "planning" very broadly, perhaps thinking about *any* aspect of how people lived in the city, rather than the physical layout and design.
        *   They might completely misunderstand it and focus on non-architectural aspects like their food, clothing, or daily life.

3.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **High Attempt Rate:** Most students would attempt the question. It's not inherently difficult to *write something* about Harappa if they've studied it at all. It's a direct recall question, not requiring complex analysis.
    *   **Attempts with Irrelevant Information:** A significant portion would attempt but provide answers that are irrelevant to "urban planning" or are too vague.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:**

    *   **Vague or Generic:** "They had a good city." / "They lived in cities."
    *   **Irrelevant but True about Harappa:** "They made seals." / "They farmed." / "They worshipped a mother goddess." / "They traded." / "They had script." (These are factual but don't address urban planning).
    *   **Focus on Materials without Context:** "They used bricks." (True, but without mentioning *baked* bricks or their structured use, it's not a *key feature of planning*).
    *   **Partial Understanding:** "They had drains." (Good, but might lack the "advanced system" part of the rubric).
    *   **Confusion with Modern Cities:** "They had roads." (Again, true, but lacks the "grid layout" or "well-planned" aspect).

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%) and Language Barriers:**

The low average pass rate for these students across subjects suggests a significant struggle with both content retention and English comprehension. "Urban planning" is a relatively specific and academic term.

*   Students who *do* know the content might still struggle to phrase it correctly in English or link it explicitly to "urban planning."
*   Students who struggle with English might not even recognize what the question is truly asking, even if they have some general knowledge of Harappa.

**Revisiting the Rubric:** "Correctly describes one key feature, such as the well-planned grid layout of streets, the advanced drainage system, the use of baked bricks, or the division of the city into a citadel and a lower town."

*   "Well-planned grid layout": Requires specific recall and understanding of "grid."
*   "Advanced drainage system": "Advanced" is key, not just "drains."
*   "Use of baked bricks": "Baked"
