Let's break down the likely student responses to this question.

**Analysis of Potential Errors:**

1.  **Misconceptions about Social Science/History (Harappan Civilization specifically):**

    *   **Lack of Specific Knowledge:** The biggest hurdle is simply not having been taught this specific detail, or having forgotten it. Harappan Civilization is a foundational topic, but *details* about urban planning might not be emphasized in every classroom or retained by all students, especially if the teaching method relies heavily on rote memorization without deeper understanding.
    *   **Confusing with other Civilizations:** Students might mix up features with other ancient civilizations (e.g., Egyptian pyramids, Mesopotamian ziggurats), or even later Indian empires (e.g., Mauryan cities).
    *   **Vagueness/Generalizations:** They might remember "Harappan was advanced" but struggle to pinpoint *how* it was advanced in terms of urban planning. They might give very general answers like "they had cities" or "they were smart."
    *   **Focus on Non-Urban Planning Aspects:** They might remember other facts about Harappan civilization like agriculture, trade, seals, or the Great Bath (without linking it to overall drainage/planning). The Great Bath is a good specific example, but they might not frame it as "part of a sophisticated water management/drainage system" but just as "they had a big bath."
    *   **Anachronisms:** Attributing modern city features to Harappan civilization.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings (English):**

    *   **"Key Feature":** Students might understand "feature" but struggle with "key" – what makes it *important* or *defining*? They might list any random fact they remember.
    *   **"Urban Planning":** This is a fairly specific academic term.
        *   "Urban" might be understood as "city" (शहर - shahar).
        *   "Planning" (योजना - yojana) might be understood as "making a plan."
        *   But "urban planning" as a combined concept might be less clear. They might just focus on "city" and describe something general about Harappan cities, not necessarily their *design* or *layout*.
    *   **"Describe":** They might struggle to articulate a description, resorting to single words or very short phrases.

3.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

    *   **Attempt but Fail:** This is likely the most common scenario. Given it's a direct recall question about a fundamental topic, most students would attempt something. They'd likely write down whatever comes to mind that's related to Harappan cities.
    *   **Not Attempt at all:** Less likely for a 1-mark question unless they truly have absolutely no idea, or if time management is an issue and they prioritize longer answers. However, if they don't understand "urban planning," they might leave it blank rather than risk writing something completely irrelevant.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answer Look Like:**

    *   **"They had cities."** (Too vague, doesn't describe a *feature* of planning).
    *   **"They were a very old civilization."** (True, but irrelevant to the question).
    *   **"They had farming."** (Irrelevant).
    *   **"They had the Great Bath."** (Good specific fact, but often not framed in terms of "urban planning" - they might just say "Bada Snanaghar था"). If they just say "Great Bath," it might not be enough for full credit, but it's close. If they add "and they used water well" or "it shows water management," then it moves towards correctness.
    *   **"They used seals."** (Irrelevant).
    *   **"They traded."** (Irrelevant).
    *   **"They had good houses."** (Getting closer, but still vague. "Good" doesn't describe the *planning* aspect. If they said "houses made of baked bricks," then it's correct).
    *   **Mixture of correct and incorrect facts:** "They had cities and good farming and traded." (Only part is relevant but not the core answer).
    *   **Broken/poor English:** Attempts to describe something like drainage but in very difficult-to-understand English.

**Connecting to Rubric and Pass Rate:**

The rubric is quite generous, accepting *any one* of several distinct features. This helps.

*   "Well-planned grid layout of streets" - This is a classic.
*   "Advanced drainage system" - Another classic, often linked to the Great Bath or house drains.
*   "Use of baked bricks" - A very tangible and unique
