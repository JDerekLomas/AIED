Let's break down the potential errors for Class 8 Indian government school students from economically weaker sections with limited English attempting to define "fable."

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

**1. Misconceptions about English/Lack of Vocabulary:**

*   **"Define" itself:** Many students might not fully grasp the meaning of "define." They might think it means "give an example of," "tell a story about," or "explain a related concept."
*   **"Fable":** This is the core vocabulary word.
    *   **Complete Unknown:** A significant portion will simply not know the word "fable" at all. This will lead to non-attempts or random guessing.
    *   **Partial Recognition/Confusion:** Some might have heard it but not fully understood its meaning. They might confuse it with:
        *   **Story:** The broadest and most likely association.
        *   **Animal Story:** If they've encountered examples like "The Lion and the Mouse."
        *   **Moral Story:** If they've heard the term "moral" but not linked it specifically to animal stories.
        *   **Myth/Legend:** Other types of traditional stories.
        *   **Poem/Song:** If they're generally referring to literary forms.
*   **Keywords in the Rubric:** Even if they know "fable," expressing the definition accurately requires other vocabulary:
    *   **"typically uses animals as characters":** "Typically" might be too nuanced. "Characters" might be known, but expressing the "animal" part is key.
    *   **"imparts a moral lesson":** "Imparts" is likely unknown. "Moral lesson" might be understood as "good advice" or "what you learn from it." "Lesson" alone might be used.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **Grammatical Structure:** Even if they have some of the right words, forming a coherent, grammatically correct definition in English will be challenging for many. They might use fragmented sentences or very simple structures.
*   **Translating from Native Language:** Students might try to translate a concept they understand in their native language (e.g., *kahani*, *neeti katha*) directly into English, leading to awkward phrasing or incorrect word choices.
*   **Focus on one aspect only:** If they've only been exposed to fables through examples, they might latch onto one characteristic (e.g., "story about animals") and omit the other crucial part (the moral).

**3. Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**

*   **Not Attempting at all:** This will be very common for students who simply don't recognize the word "fable" or "define." They might leave it blank or write "I don't know."
*   **Attempt but Fail:** Many will attempt, even with limited knowledge. Their answers would likely be:
    *   Very short, incomplete.
    *   Using generic terms.
    *   Focusing on one characteristic.
    *   Grammatically incorrect.
    *   Using related but incorrect terms.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answers:**

*   "It is a story." (Too general)
*   "Story about animals." (Missing the moral)
*   "A story that teaches a lesson." (Missing the animal aspect, "teaches a lesson" is a common proxy for "imparts a moral lesson")
*   "An animal story." (Short and common)
*   "It is a story of moral." (Awkward English, getting at the moral)
*   "Fable means a story." (Simple, basic understanding)
*   "I don't know." / Blank

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%):**

Given an overall average pass rate of 29% for the entire paper, a question requiring definition of a specific literary term in English, and the student demographic, this question is likely to be significantly harder than the average.

Many students will struggle with the vocabulary ("fable," "define," "imparts," "typically"). Even those who grasp the core meaning might struggle with the English expression to meet the rubric's requirements.

To get full marks, students need to include **both** the animal characters and the moral lesson. Getting only one aspect would likely yield 0 marks, as the rubric is quite specific for "Max score: 1."

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

I would expect a very low pass rate for this specific question.

*   A large number will not know "fable" at all.
*   Many will know "story" but nothing else.
*   Some will get "animal story" but miss the moral.
*   Some will get "moral story" but miss the animals
