Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Potential Errors:**

1.  **Misconceptions about English / Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Do you think..."**: Many students might not grasp that this is an opinion-based question requiring a "yes" or "no" (or similar affirmative/negative) followed by a justification. They might just try to rephrase the question or give a generic answer.
    *   **"King's questions"**: While they've read the passage, some might struggle to recall *what* the king's questions were specifically. They might confuse them with other details from the story.
    *   **"Important in real life"**: This is a key phrase.
        *   "Important": They likely know this word.
        *   "Real life": This phrase might be slightly abstract for some. They might interpret it literally as "their life" rather than "life in general" or "applicable beyond the story."
    *   **"Give one reason"**: This instruction is crucial. Many might give just a "yes" or "no" and stop, or give a reason without explicitly stating "yes/no." They might also give multiple reasons, but that doesn't necessarily make it wrong, just inefficient.
    *   **Vocabulary Gaps**: Words like "important," "real life," "reason" are relatively common, but combined with the sentence structure, it can be challenging.
    *   **Grammar/Sentence Structure**: Even if they have the right idea, forming a grammatically coherent sentence in English to express it will be a significant hurdle for many. Subject-verb agreement, tense, and appropriate conjunctions will be common stumbling blocks.

2.  **Cognitive Hurdles / Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**
    *   **Reading Comprehension**: The question *assumes* they understood the preceding passage about the king's three questions. If they didn't fully grasp the passage, answering this question becomes impossible.
    *   **Abstract Thinking**: The question requires them to bridge the gap between a story and its real-world applicability. This abstract thinking (applying a lesson from fiction to reality) can be difficult for students, especially those not regularly exposed to such analytical tasks.
    *   **Formulating an Opinion**: Being asked for *their* opinion and then defending it is a higher-order thinking skill. Many might be used to recalling facts directly from the text.
    *   **Not Attempt at all**: A significant portion (perhaps 10-15%) might not attempt if they feel completely lost, either due to language or not understanding the underlying passage.
    *   **Attempt but Fail**: The majority who attempt will likely fail due to the language barriers, misinterpretation of the question, or inability to articulate a valid reason.

3.  **Most Common Wrong Answer Looks Like:**
    *   **Just "Yes" or "No"**: Many will stop here, not providing a reason.
    *   **Rephrasing the question**: "The king's questions are important in real life." (No reason given).
    *   **Summary of the king's questions**: "The king wanted to know the right time, right thing, right people." (No connection to "real life" or "importance" explicitly stated as a reason).
    *   **Irrelevant answer/Confused answer**: "The king was good." or "He had many servants." (Completely off-topic).
    *   **Single word answers**: "Good." "Yes good."
    *   **Grammatically incorrect but attempts a reason**: "Yes, because it helps to do work." (Valid idea, but often poorly expressed, making it hard to score). "Yes, it is important to know everything." (A bit too vague, but might get partial credit depending on marker leniency).
    *   **Focus on the king's benefit, not general importance**: "Yes, because the king wanted to rule well." (Less about "real life" and more about the king's specific goal).

**Rubric Considerations:**
The rubric is quite generous: "Any valid reason." This means if they can articulate *any* reason that connects the king's questions (knowing the right time, thing, people) to general life importance, they should get it. However, the articulation is the biggest hurdle.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for the entire paper, this question requires:
*   Reading comprehension of the source passage.
*   Understanding an opinion-based question.
*   Understanding "important in real life."
*   Formulating an opinion.
*   Providing a *reason*.
*   Expressing that reason
