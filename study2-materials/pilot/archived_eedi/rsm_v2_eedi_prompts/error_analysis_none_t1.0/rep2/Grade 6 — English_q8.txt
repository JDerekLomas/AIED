Let's break down the likely errors for a Class 6 student in an Indian government school, considering their background.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Misconceptions about English Word Order (SVO vs. SOV influence):**
    *   Many Indian languages (like Hindi, Marathi, Bengali) follow an Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order.
    *   Students might instinctively try to map this SOV structure onto English, leading to errors like "He a book reading is" or "He book reading is."
    *   They might place the verb at the very end.

2.  **Lack of Understanding of Auxiliary Verbs ('is'):**
    *   The role of "is" as an auxiliary verb in a continuous tense might not be fully grasped. They might see "is" as just another word to be placed, rather than having a specific grammatical function related to "reading."
    *   They might confuse "is" with "he" or "a" as a 'thing' or 'person' word.

3.  **Difficulty with Articles ('a'):**
    *   The use of indefinite articles like "a" before a noun ("a book") can be tricky. They might omit it, place it incorrectly, or not understand its necessity.
    *   Some might see "a" as just an extra, optional word.

4.  **Identifying the Subject ('he'):**
    *   While "he" is usually identifiable as the subject, some might struggle to start the sentence correctly, especially if they are looking for the 'action' first.

5.  **Understanding "meaningful sentence":**
    *   They might produce a word salad that *to them* sounds somewhat coherent, even if grammatically incorrect, especially if they are translating individual words rather than understanding the flow.
    *   The concept of a "meaningful sentence" might be interpreted broadly as "all words present."

6.  **Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**
    *   Most students *would attempt* this question. It's a rearrangement, and they can see all the words. There's a low barrier to entry for trying to put them together. They wouldn't leave it blank unless they truly understood nothing.

7.  **Common Wrong Answers:**
    *   **SOV Influence:** "He a book reading is." (Very common, trying to fit the verb at the end)
    *   **Auxiliary Verb Misplacement:** "He reading a book is." (Putting "is" at the very end after the main verb)
    *   **Omitting "a":** "He is reading book." (Grammatically incorrect, but understandable omission)
    *   **Focus on Action First:** "Reading he is a book." (Less likely, but possible if they prioritize the action verb)
    *   **Simple Juxtaposition:** "He book reading is a." (Just putting words next to each other without clear structure)
    *   **Partial Correctness:** "He is a book reading." (Mix-up of object and verb position)

**Factors Increasing Difficulty (leading to lower pass rate):**

*   **Limited Exposure:** If they haven't had much practice with sentence formation or "jumbled words" exercises in English.
*   **Emphasis on Rote Learning:** If their English teaching focuses more on vocabulary or simple dialogues rather than grammatical structure.
*   **Confidence:** Lack of confidence might lead to guessing rather than analytical thought.

**Revisiting the Average Pass Rate (29%):**

Given the general difficulty for Class 6 students from EWS backgrounds and the common SOV interference, a 29% pass rate for an *average* English question seems reasonable for this demographic. This particular question, while seemingly simple to a native speaker, contains several traps for learners from SOV language backgrounds.

**How this question compares to the average:**

*   It involves a basic Present Continuous tense, which should be covered.
*   It has common words.
*   The number of words is small (5), which reduces complexity.

However, the "is" and the SVO structure are significant hurdles.

If the *average* is 29%, a question requiring accurate SVO formation with an auxiliary verb is likely to be around that average, or perhaps slightly above if sentence structure is a heavily emphasized topic, but probably not significantly higher than 40-50% given the SOV interference.

Let's consider the breakdown:
*   Maybe 10-15% will get it perfectly (either naturally picked it up or specifically taught this structure well).
*   Another 15-20% will get very close, like "He reading a book is" or "He a book reading is," demonstrating
