Let's break down the likely errors for Class 6 students in Indian government schools tackling the question: "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"

**Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Understanding "Which line...":**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might struggle with the concept of a "line" as a specific textual unit from a poem. They might not understand they need to *quote* or *identify* a single sentence/phrase from the given text.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** "Line" could be interpreted more broadly as "part" or "idea" rather than a precise textual element.
    *   **Result:** They might summarize the poem, pick a general theme, or just say "the poem was good" without referencing a specific line. They might also pick a word rather than a line.

2.  **Understanding "do you like the most":**
    *   **Misconception:** While "like" is a common word, "the most" adds a comparative element that might be challenging. They might not grasp the need to *select* a single preferred line from multiple options, but rather express general approval.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** Students might understand "like" but not the superlative "the most," or they might feel obligated to like *all* of it.
    *   **Result:** They might simply say "I liked the poem" or "It was a good poem" without making a specific choice.

3.  **Understanding "and why":**
    *   **Misconception:** This is likely the biggest hurdle. Articulating a *reason* requires analytical thinking, vocabulary for expressing emotions or ideas, and the ability to connect a specific line to that reason. This is a higher-order thinking skill often underdeveloped at this stage, especially with limited English.
    *   **Language Misunderstanding:** "Why" is a basic question word, but providing an answer *in English* that explains preference is difficult. They might struggle with sentence structure ("because it was nice," "it felt good").
    *   **Result:**
        *   Most common: No "why" provided at all.
        *   Next most common: Very simplistic "why" like "because it was good," "because I liked it," "it was beautiful," which might not be detailed enough for partial credit if the rubric is strict on "mentions why."
        *   They might give a reason unrelated to the line itself, e.g., "because I like poems."

4.  **English Proficiency and Vocabulary:**
    *   **Limited vocabulary:** Students may lack the words to describe *why* they like a particular line (e.g., "evocative," "descriptive," "makes me feel happy," "reminds me of...").
    *   **Grammar and sentence structure:** Even if they have the idea, forming a grammatically correct sentence to express it will be challenging. "Me like this line because good."
    *   **Access to the poem:** If the poem isn't physically present or they have to recall it, quoting a line accurately becomes an additional burden. Many might struggle to copy it correctly.

**Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**

*   **Attempt but fail (most common):** Given it's a direct question and likely expected, most will attempt *something*. They will likely write *some* words.
*   **Not attempt at all (less common, but possible):** Some might be completely stumped by the "why" or the overall complexity in English and leave it blank, especially if they are low-performing. However, the "like" part might encourage a general positive response.

**Most Common Wrong Answer Look Like:**

*   "I like the poem." (No line, no why)
*   "The poem was good." (No line, no why)
*   "I like [a word from the poem]." (Not a line, no why, or very weak why)
*   "I like the first line because it was good." (Specific line mentioned, but the "why" is too generic for full credit, possibly not even meeting "mentions why" depending on rubric strictness).
*   "I like the line [copied line] because it was nice." (This would get some credit, but "nice" might not be sufficient for full "why").
*   "I like the line [copied line]." (No why)
*   "The poem is very good." (General statement, no line, no why).

**Breakdown by Rubric Components (Max Score: 1.5):**

*   **Denotes a line from the poem (0.75 marks):**
