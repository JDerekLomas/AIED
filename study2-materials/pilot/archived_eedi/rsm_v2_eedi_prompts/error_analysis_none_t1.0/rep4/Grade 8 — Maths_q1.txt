Let's break down the likely errors for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and the nature of the question.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Misconceptions about Mathematics:**

    *   **Understanding of Negative Numbers (Most Significant):** This is the single biggest mathematical hurdle. Many students at this level, especially those with weaker foundational understanding, struggle to grasp that subtracting a larger number from a smaller number results in a negative value. They might instinctively think "you can't take 9 from 4" or assume the answer must be positive.
    *   **Transposition/Operation Confusion:** When moving from `y + 9 = 4` to isolating `y`, the conceptual understanding of "doing the inverse operation" might be weak.
        *   They might think: `y = 9 + 4` (adding instead of subtracting).
        *   They might think: `y = 9 - 4` (but transpose the numbers incorrectly).
    *   **Order of Operations (Less likely for this specific problem, but a general weakness):** While not directly applicable here, a general lack of rigid understanding of mathematical operations can contribute to confusion.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings:**

    *   **"Find the value of y":** While this is standard mathematical phrasing, for students with limited English exposure, it might be slightly less intuitive than "y kya hai?" (What is y?) if the question were in Hindi. However, the symbols `y`, `+`, `=`, `4` are universal enough that they should understand the core task.
    *   **"Equation":** The term "equation" itself might not be fully understood, but the visual format `y + 9 = 4` clearly indicates a problem to be solved.
    *   **Overall, language is unlikely to be the primary barrier for *this specific question*, given its simplicity and universal mathematical symbols.** It might contribute to a slight slowdown in processing, but not a fundamental misinterpretation of the task.

3.  **Would students attempt but fail, or not attempt at all?**

    *   **Attempt but Fail (Very High Probability):** This is a simple, direct question. Most students will attempt it. The structure `variable + number = number` is very common.
    *   **Not Attempt at All (Low Probability):** Only students with extremely low confidence or who are entirely overwhelmed by the exam environment might skip this. Given it's the first question type they likely encounter in algebra, they would have seen many similar examples.

4.  **What would the most common wrong answer look like?**

    *   **`y = 5`:** This would be the **overwhelmingly most common wrong answer**.
        *   Reasoning: Students subtract the smaller number from the larger number, ignoring the position of `y` and the negative outcome. They see `9` and `4` and think `9 - 4 = 5`. They might apply `y = 9 - 4` or simply flip the operation.
    *   **`y = 13`:** This would be the second most common wrong answer.
        *   Reasoning: Students incorrectly perform addition instead of subtraction (i.e., `y = 4 + 9`). They might see `+9` and think they need to add it to `4`.
    *   **Blank/No Answer:** Some students might just leave it blank if they are completely lost on how to handle the negative number concept, or if they arrive at `5` and then second-guess themselves because they know it's not quite right but can't articulate why.

**Revised Estimation based on Class 8 context (low pass rate, EWS, limited English):**

Given the average pass rate of 29% for *all* questions, and this question specifically testing a fundamental but often tricky concept (negative numbers in simple equations), the struggle with `y = -5` will be significant.

*   A large chunk will get `y = 5`.
*   A smaller, but still significant chunk will get `y = 13`.
*   A few might leave it blank or make other errors.

While it's a "simple" algebra problem, the *negative number* aspect elevates its difficulty considerably for this demographic. If the question were `y - 4 = 9` (resulting in `y=13`), the pass rate would be much higher because it avoids the negative answer.

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

Considering the difficulty with negative numbers, even in a simple equation:

*   Many will confidently write `y = 5`.
*   A fair number will write `y = 13`.
*   Only those who truly grasp the concept of transposition
