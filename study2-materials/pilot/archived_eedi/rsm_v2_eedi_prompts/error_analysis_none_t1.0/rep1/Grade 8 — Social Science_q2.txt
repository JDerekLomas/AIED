Let's break down the likely errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **Subject Matter Knowledge/Misconceptions (Social Science):**

    *   **Lack of Specific Recall:** Harappan Civilization is a core topic, but the *specific features* of its urban planning might not be deeply ingrained. Students might remember "Harappan Civilization" and "cities" but struggle to articulate *how* those cities were planned.
    *   **Generalizing vs. Specific:** They might know it was "advanced" or "old" but not the details like grid patterns or drainage.
    *   **Confusing with Other Civilizations:** There's a slight chance they might mix features with other ancient civilizations studied (e.g., Vedic period, although less about urban planning there).
    *   **Focusing on Non-Urban Aspects:** They might recall other aspects of the civilization (e.g., seals, agriculture, trade, religious practices) and describe those instead of urban planning. For example, "They farmed wheat and barley" or "They worshipped a mother goddess." This is a very common error: answering a different question they *do* know.
    *   **Simplistic Answers:** "They had good houses" or "The cities were big." These are too vague to earn a point.
    *   **Difficulty with "Key Feature":** Understanding what "key" implies – something distinctive and significant – might be a challenge. They might pick something less prominent.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings (English):**

    *   **"Describe":** Generally understood, but some might just list a word or two without description.
    *   **"Key Feature":** "Key" might be slightly ambiguous for some. "Important feature" would be clearer, but "key" is common.
    *   **"Harappan Civilization":** This is a proper noun, so likely recognized.
    *   **"Urban Planning":** This is the most challenging phrase.
        *   "Urban": Many students might not explicitly know this word, but infer it from "cities" being discussed when Harappan is brought up.
        *   "Planning": Likely understood as "making a plan."
        *   **Combined "Urban Planning":** The concept of *how cities are designed and organized* might be abstract. They might understand "city" and "plan" separately but struggle with the conceptual union. They might think "planning" refers to daily life or general organization rather than physical layout.

3.  **Attempt vs. Non-Attempt:**

    *   **Attempt:** Most students would likely attempt this question, as "Harappan Civilization" is a known topic. They wouldn't want to leave it blank.
    *   **Failure:** The failure would stem from the points above – either lack of specific knowledge or misinterpreting "urban planning."
    *   **Guessing:** They might guess based on general knowledge of ancient times ("they built with mud" or "they had many people").

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:**

    *   **Focus on other aspects of Harappan Civilization:**
        *   "They had seals with animals."
        *   "They grew crops like wheat."
        *   "They traded with Mesopotamia."
        *   "They worshipped goddesses."
    *   **Vague, non-specific descriptions of cities:**
        *   "They had big cities."
        *   "Their cities were good."
        *   "They had houses."
    *   **Partially correct but insufficiently described:**
        *   "Drainage system." (Needs more description like "advanced" or "covered")
        *   "Baked bricks." (Needs context related to planning, e.g., "used for sturdy construction")
    *   **Misunderstanding "urban planning" leading to daily life descriptions:**
        *   "People lived and worked there."

**Likely Pass Rate Estimation:**

Given the context:
*   Mostly economically weaker sections, limited English.
*   Average pass rate for the *entire exam* is 29%, meaning individual questions might have varying difficulty. This question is relatively specific but core.
*   The concepts (grid, drainage, citadel, baked bricks) are taught.

Factors increasing difficulty:
*   Specificity required ("key feature").
*   Nuance of "urban planning."
*   Recall of detail rather than general understanding.

Factors decreasing difficulty:
*   Harappan Civilization is a foundational topic.
*   Simple, one-sentence answer is enough.

Let's consider the breakdown:
*   **Strong Recall & Understanding (Pass):** These students remember details like "grid pattern" or "advanced drainage system" and understand "urban planning." This might be a smaller segment
