Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

Given the student profile (economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate 29%):

1.  **Fundamental Lack of Understanding of Voice/Grammar Concepts (High Likelihood):**
    *   **Misconception:** Many students might not even understand what "Active Voice" or "Passive Voice" means. They might have heard the terms but not grasped the underlying concept of subject-verb-object relationships and how they shift.
    *   **Impact:** They wouldn't know *what* to change, leading to either no attempt or a random alteration.

2.  **Difficulty Identifying Subject/Object/Verb (Moderate to High Likelihood):**
    *   **Misconception:** Even if they vaguely understand voice, identifying "the wind" as the subject, "blew" as the verb, and "the leaves" as the object might be challenging due to sentence structure and vocabulary.
    *   **Impact:** If they can't correctly identify these components, they can't correctly reorder them for passive voice.

3.  **Irregular Verb Form (Blew -> Blown) (High Likelihood):**
    *   **Misconception:** This is a major hurdle. "Blew" is the past simple of "blow." For passive voice, the past participle ("blown") is required. Many students struggle with irregular verb forms, especially distinguishing between past simple and past participle.
    *   **Impact:** They might write "The leaves were *blew* away by the wind," "The leaves were *blow* away...", or completely avoid the verb.

4.  **Incorrect Auxiliary Verb (Be Verb) (High Likelihood):**
    *   **Misconception:** They need "were" because "the leaves" is plural and the original sentence is past tense. Students might use "is," "are," "was," or simply omit it.
    *   **Impact:** "The leaves *is* blown away..." or "The leaves *was* blown away..."

5.  **Difficulty with "by the wind" placement/inclusion (Moderate Likelihood):**
    *   **Misconception:** While optional in some passive sentences, for a full transformation, "by the agent" is expected. They might forget it, misplace it, or struggle with "by."
    *   **Impact:** "The leaves were blown away" (partial credit, depending on strictness) or "The leaves were blown away the wind."

6.  **Vocabulary Issues (Low Likelihood for this sentence):**
    *   "Wind," "blew," "leaves," "away" are relatively common words, so direct vocabulary comprehension isn't the primary barrier here.

7.  **"Not Attempt at All" vs. "Attempt and Fail":**
    *   Given the general pass rate of 29%, a significant portion would likely *not attempt at all* if they don't understand the question or feel completely lost.
    *   Among those who attempt, many would likely *fail* due to the specific grammatical hurdles mentioned above.

**Most Common Wrong Answers Would Look Like:**

*   **No Attempt / Question mark / Random words:** Reflects complete lack of understanding.
*   **"The leaves was blown away by the wind."** (Incorrect auxiliary verb - singular 'was' for plural 'leaves')
*   **"The leaves were blew away by the wind."** (Incorrect past participle form - used past simple 'blew')
*   **"The leaves blown away by the wind."** (Missing auxiliary verb)
*   **"The wind blown the leaves away."** (Attempting to change but not understanding voice, possibly just changing "blew" to "blown" without other structural changes)
*   **"The leaves blew away by the wind."** (Missing auxiliary verb and incorrect verb form)
*   **"The leaves are blown away by the wind."** (Incorrect tense - present instead of past)
*   **Simple rephrasing without changing voice:** "The wind blew away the leaves." (No change in voice)

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT:**

Considering the multiple specific grammar points that need to be correct (identifying S/V/O, using correct auxiliary verb, using correct past participle, including "by the agent"), and the general low pass rate and limited English proficiency:

I estimate a very small percentage will get this perfectly correct. Even students who grasp the general idea often stumble on the irregular verb form or the auxiliary verb agreement.

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 10-15%**

I'm leaning towards the lower end of this range because the combination of
