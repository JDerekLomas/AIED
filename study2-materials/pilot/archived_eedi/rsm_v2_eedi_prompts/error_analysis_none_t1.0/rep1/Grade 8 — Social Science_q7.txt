Let's break down the likely errors for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, considering their background and the nature of the question.

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science:**

*   **Rote Learning vs. Understanding Causality:** A significant issue will be students having memorized facts about Plassey (date, participants, victor) but not fully grasping its *consequences* or *contribution*. They might be able to state "British won" or "Mir Jafar became Nawab" but struggle to connect this to "expansion of British power."
*   **Focus on Military Victory, Not Political Impact:** Students might see it as simply another battle won, not understanding its profound political implications for establishing dominance. They might mention the *fact* of victory but miss the *why it mattered* for British expansion.
*   **Lack of Nuance on "Expansion":** "Expansion" might be understood very literally as territorial conquest only. The idea of *political control* or *economic leverage* being a form of expansion might be too abstract.
*   **Confusing *Who* with *How*:** They might correctly identify *who* won or *who* became Nawab, but fail to explain *how* this contributed to the expansion of power. The question asks for the mechanism of contribution.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Contribute to":** This phrase can be tricky. It requires understanding cause and effect. Students might struggle to articulate the direct link between the battle's outcome and the broader concept of "expansion of British power."
*   **"Expansion of British Power":** While seemingly straightforward, "power" can be interpreted narrowly. They might focus solely on military strength or land, missing political or economic power.
*   **"Rubric terms (e.g., 'political dominance/control,' 'puppet nawab'):** These are sophisticated concepts. Students might not use such precise vocabulary, even if they have a rudimentary understanding. They might say "British bossed over Bengal" instead of "political dominance."

**3. Attempt vs. No Attempt:**

*   **Likely to Attempt:** History is a core subject, and the Battle of Plassey is a major event. Students will likely recognize the terms "Battle of Plassey" and "1757" and attempt to answer, even if their understanding is superficial. They might write down whatever they recall about the battle.
*   **Failure to Attempt (or Minimal Attempt):** Could happen if they truly have no grasp beyond the name, or if the language completely stumps them, but generally, there's an incentive to write something down in an exam.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer:**

The most common wrong answers would likely fall into these categories:

*   **Descriptive, Not Explanatory:**
    *   "The British won the Battle of Plassey." (Correct fact, but doesn't explain *how* it contributed to expansion of power).
    *   "Mir Jafar became the Nawab after the Battle of Plassey." (Correct fact, but misses the *puppet* aspect and the direct link to British power).
    *   "It was fought between Siraj-ud-Daulah and Robert Clive." (Factual, but irrelevant to the *contribution* to expansion).
*   **Partial Understanding:**
    *   "The British got control of Bengal." (Closer, but lacks the specific mechanism of *how* Plassey led to this control, or the nature of that control).
    *   "The British started taking over India." (Too general, not specific to Plassey's role).
*   **Focus on Economic Gains (without political link):**
    *   "The British started getting more money from Bengal." (True, but often without explicitly linking it to political control as the *means* to that economic gain).

**Analysis against Rubric:**

The rubric specifically looks for explaining that Plassey led to:
*   "establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal"
*   "(e.g., placing Mir Jafar as a puppet nawab)."

Most wrong answers will miss the "political dominance/control" aspect or the "puppet" nuance. They might state Mir Jafar became Nawab, but not explain *why* that was significant for British power.

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%):**

This average pass rate for *all* questions suggests that students struggle with understanding and application, not just recall. A question requiring *causal explanation* will be harder than a simple factual recall.

*   Students who have merely memorized facts will fail.
*   Students who understand Plassey as a *turning point* and can articulate the shift in power (even if not using sophisticated terms like "puppet") will pass.
*   The "puppet nawab" detail is key. If
