Let's break down the likely errors for Class 6 students in Indian government schools, keeping in mind their background and the average pass rate of 29%.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

1.  **"Which line from the poem..."**:
    *   **Misconception/Misunderstanding**: Many students, especially at this level and with limited exposure, might not understand "line" in the context of poetry. They might think of it as "topic" or "idea."
    *   **Alternative interpretation**: They might pick a *word* they liked, or a *stanza* they liked, rather than a single line.
    *   **Attempt/Failure**: They would likely attempt this part but fail to identify a specific line. They might point to a general section or a significant word.

2.  **"...do you like the most..."**:
    *   **Language Misunderstanding**: "Like the most" is generally understood, but expressing a *personal preference* in English can be challenging for those with limited vocabulary. They might understand the "liking" part but struggle to articulate *which* one.
    *   **Cultural Context**: In some learning environments, students are more accustomed to rote answers or identifying the "correct" answer, rather than expressing personal opinions. This could lead to hesitation or an attempt to guess what the teacher *wants* them to like.
    *   **Attempt/Failure**: They would likely attempt to identify something they liked, but might struggle to pinpoint "the most" or articulate it clearly.

3.  **"...and why?"**:
    *   **Core Challenge**: This is by far the most difficult part. Explaining "why" requires:
        *   **Causal language**: Words like "because," "since," "as it shows," "it makes me feel."
        *   **Descriptive language**: To describe *what* about the line they liked (e.g., "it is beautiful," "it makes me think of freedom," "it sounds nice").
        *   **Abstract thought**: The ability to connect a specific line to an emotion, an idea, or a personal experience.
    *   **Limited English Vocabulary**: Students will heavily lack the vocabulary needed to articulate reasons beyond very basic ones (e.g., "it is good," "I like it").
    *   **Cognitive Load**: Even if they understand the question, processing the poem, identifying a line, liking it, and then explaining *why* in English is a significant cognitive load for a Class 6 student from this background.
    *   **Attempt/Failure**: Many will either skip this part entirely or offer very simplistic, non-explanatory reasons (e.g., "because I like it," "it is nice line").

4.  **Overall Attempt/Engagement**:
    *   Most students will likely *attempt* the question, as it asks for a personal opinion which can feel less intimidating than a factual recall question.
    *   However, the quality of the attempt will vary drastically.

**Most Common Wrong Answers Would Look Like:**

*   **Identifying a word or phrase instead of a line, with no "why":** "Flower" or "The beautiful bird."
*   **Identifying a line, but providing no "why" or a circular "why":** "I like 'The birds are singing in the sky.' Because I like it." or "It is good."
*   **Identifying a line, but the "why" is generic and doesn't connect to the line:** "I like 'My mother loves me.' Because my mother is good." (The "why" is about the mother, not the *line* itself).
*   **Copying a whole stanza or multiple lines without selection or explanation.**
*   **Writing a general statement about the poem:** "The poem is good."
*   **No answer (for the "why" part specifically).**

**Rubric Consideration (Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why. Max score: 1.5):**

*   To get *any* score, they need to identify *a line*. This will be a hurdle for many.
*   To get the full score, the "why" needs to be coherent and relevant. This will be the biggest obstacle. A simple "I like it" likely won't get much, if any, credit for the "why" part.

**Estimated Proportion Correct:**

Given the average pass rate of 29% for general questions, and the specific challenges of this question (identifying a "line" and articulating a "why" in English, involving abstract thought and causal language), this question is significantly more difficult than a basic recall or simple comprehension question.

*   A small percentage might correctly identify a line and provide a very basic but relevant "why" (
