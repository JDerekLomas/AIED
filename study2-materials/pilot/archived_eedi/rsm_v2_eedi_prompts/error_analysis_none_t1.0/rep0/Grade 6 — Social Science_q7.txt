Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors:**

**1. Misconceptions about Social Science:**

*   **Definition of "Natural Resources":**
    *   Many students might confuse "natural resources" with "things found in nature" generally, or even "things found in Rajasthan" without the "resource" aspect. They might list animals, plants (specific crops), or even famous landmarks without understanding the utility/economic value implicit in a "resource."
    *   They might list man-made things if they don't fully grasp the "natural" aspect. (Less likely for "Rajasthan" but possible).
    *   **Common error:** Listing "desert" or "sand" as a resource without specifying *how* it's a resource (e.g., for construction sand, or for solar energy by leveraging the sun in a desert environment).
*   **Understanding "Influence on Lives":**
    *   This part requires a cause-and-effect understanding that might be challenging. Students might simply describe the resource or state its presence without linking it to people's lives.
    *   They might give a very generic explanation ("it is important") without specific details.
    *   They might list the resource's use without explaining its *influence* (e.g., "Copper is used for wires" without "this provides jobs for miners" or "it makes electricity available").
*   **Specificity of "Rajasthan":** Students might list general natural resources without linking them specifically to Rajasthan. While many resources are common, the question specifically asks for *found in Rajasthan*.

**2. Language Misunderstandings:**

*   **"Mention any two natural resources":**
    *   "Mention" is generally understood.
    *   "Natural resources": As discussed above, this is the primary conceptual hurdle, exacerbated by language. Students might know the individual words "natural" and "resources" but struggle with the compound concept.
*   **"explain how one of them influences the lives of the people there":**
    *   "Explain how": Requires a descriptive answer, not just a list.
    *   "Influences": This is a key vocabulary word that might be difficult. Students might substitute it with "uses," "helps," or "is important for," which might or might not fully capture the nuance.
    *   "Lives of the people": Fairly straightforward.
    *   "There": Refers to Rajasthan.

**3. Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**

*   **Attempt:** Most students will likely attempt this question, as it asks for factual recall and a simple explanation. It doesn't require complex calculations or deep analytical skills that might lead to complete abandonment.
*   **Failure to attempt:** Would likely be due to a complete lack of understanding of "natural resources" or severe language barriers where they don't grasp the question's core.

**4. Most Common Wrong Answer:**

*   **Part 1 (Listing resources):**
    *   Listing two things found in Rajasthan that are *not* strictly natural resources (e.g., "desert," "camels," "forts," "food").
    *   Listing only one correct natural resource.
    *   Listing correct natural resources but not two.
    *   Listing generic resources not tied to Rajasthan.
*   **Part 2 (Explanation):**
    *   Simply stating the resource is "important" or "used for various things" without explaining *how* it influences lives.
    *   Describing the resource itself rather than its influence.
    *   Giving a completely irrelevant explanation.
    *   Not attempting the explanation part at all, even if they list resources.

**Example of a Common Wrong Answer:**

*   "Two natural resources are sand and water. Sand is important." (Fails on sand as a resource without context, and fails on the "how it influences" for water).
*   "Resources are marble and desert. Marble is used for buildings." (Desert is not a resource; "used for buildings" is a use, but doesn't fully explain *influence on lives* without more context, though it might get partial credit depending on marker leniency).
*   "Rajasthan has zinc and copper. Zinc is a metal." (Doesn't explain influence).

**Considering the Average Pass Rate (29%):**

This question requires both factual recall (two resources) and a basic explanatory skill. Given the low average pass rate and the challenges for economically weaker sections with limited English:

*   **Resource Recall:** Many might struggle to recall *two specific natural resources* for Rajasthan. "Water" is common, but the second one might be harder. "Marble" might be known if they connect it to monuments, but "Copper,"
