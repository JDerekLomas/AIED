Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Potential Errors**

Given the student profile (economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate 29%):

*   **Misconceptions about English / Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"King's questions"**: While "king" might be understood, "questions" could be misinterpreted. Some might just see "king" and "important" and connect it to a general idea of kings being important, not necessarily the *questions*.
    *   **"Important in real life"**: This phrase is crucial.
        *   "Important": Could be understood as "big" or "powerful" rather than "significant" or "relevant."
        *   "Real life": This abstract concept might be difficult to grasp fully. Students might interpret it literally as "what happens in my daily life right now" rather than "generally applicable principles."
        *   The *combination* "important in real life" requires a higher level of comprehension than individual words. They need to connect the king's abstract philosophical questions to practical application.
    *   **"Give one reason"**: This is often a significant hurdle. Even if they grasp the *yes/no* part, formulating a coherent *reason* in English is challenging.
        *   **Lack of vocabulary**: They might understand the concept but lack the specific English words to express it.
        *   **Grammar/Sentence structure**: Even if they have some words, constructing a grammatically correct and understandable sentence for a "reason" is difficult.
        *   **Abstract reasoning**: Providing a *reason* for an abstract concept like "importance" requires critical thinking beyond simple recall from the passage.

*   **Attempt vs. Not Attempt:**
    *   **Attempt but fail:** This is highly likely. The words "king," "questions," "important" are common enough that many will try. They might write something, but it will likely be incorrect or irrelevant.
    *   **Not attempt at all:** Less likely for this specific question because it has some familiar words. However, if they are completely overwhelmed by the "real life" and "reason" parts, some might leave it blank, especially if it's towards the end of the exam and they're running out of time/energy.

*   **Most Common Wrong Answer Look Like:**
    *   **Yes/No without a reason (or an irrelevant one):**
        *   "Yes." (No reason given)
        *   "No." (No reason given)
        *   "Yes, king is important." (Connects "king" and "important" but doesn't address the *questions' importance*)
        *   "Yes, king is powerful." (Similar to above)
        *   "Yes, I like king." (Personal opinion, not a reason related to the question's content)
    *   **Misinterpreting "real life":**
        *   "Yes, because king is in the story." (Confusing story life with real life)
    *   **Focusing on the king's *desire* rather than the *questions' merit*:**
        *   "Yes, king wanted to know." (Doesn't explain *why* the questions are important in real life, just that the king sought answers)
    *   **Partial or garbled attempts at a reason:**
        *   "Yes, because for time." (Trying to connect to "right time" but failing to elaborate)
        *   "Yes, for work." (Similar to above)
        *   "Yes, good work." (Vague, lacks specific connection)
    *   **Answers directly copied from the passage but not answering the *evaluative* part of the question:**
        *   "The king wanted to know the right time to do everything, the right thing to do, and the right people to work with." (This *describes* the questions but doesn't answer if they are "important in real life" or give a reason for their importance). This is a common error when students struggle to move from recall to analysis.

**Rubric Consideration:**
The rubric allows for "any valid reason." This is helpful, as it doesn't require a specific phrase. However, the reason *must be valid* and relate to the *importance of the questions in real life*.

**Estimated Proportion Correct**

Considering the average pass rate of 29% for this group, this question requires:
1.  **Basic comprehension** of "king's questions" and "important."
2.  **Higher-level comprehension** of "real life."
3.  **Analytical thinking** to determine *why* they are important.
4.
