Let's break down the likely errors for Class 8 students in Indian government schools, mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English, attempting this question.

**Analysis of Potential Errors:**

1.  **Subject Matter (Social Science) Misconceptions:**
    *   **Lack of Specific Detail:** Harappan Civilization is a standard topic, but the *depth* of understanding about its *urban planning* specifically might be superficial. They might know "Harappan" but struggle to recall a *key feature* of its planning beyond vague notions of "cities" or "old civilization."
    *   **Confusing with Other Civilizations:** There's a risk of conflating features of Harappan with other ancient Indian civilizations (e.g., Vedic period) or even general "ancient city" characteristics.
    *   **Focus on Generalities vs. Specific Features:** Students might recall general facts about Harappa (e.appan cities were "big" or "old") but fail to pinpoint a *specific, distinctive feature* of its planning as required by "key feature."
    *   **Memorization without Understanding:** They might have memorized a list of features but struggle to *describe* one accurately or identify it as a "key feature of urban planning." For example, they might remember "granaries" but not connect it to urban planning, or just state "houses" without detailing their layout.

2.  **Language Misunderstandings:**
    *   **"Describe":** While a common verb, some might struggle with the nuances of *describing* versus simply *listing* or *naming*. They might just write "drainage system" instead of "They had an advanced drainage system."
    *   **"Key Feature":** "Key" might be overlooked, leading them to state any minor detail. "Feature" might be clear enough.
    *   **"Harappan Civilization":** This term itself might be a barrier for those with weaker English, even if they've studied it in their local language. They might recognize it but struggle with the written form or its full implications in an English question.
    *   **"Urban Planning":** This is a crucial phrase. "Urban" might be understood as "city," but "planning" might be the tricky part. They might understand "cities" but not the *deliberate design and layout* aspect. Some might interpret "planning" very broadly, leading to answers like "they planned their festivals."

3.  **Attempt vs. No Attempt:**
    *   **Partial Attempt:** Many would likely attempt it, even if just writing a single word or a short, vague phrase. The topic is fundamental.
    *   **No Attempt:** A smaller percentage might not attempt if they genuinely have no recall or are completely stumped by the language or the specificity required.
    *   **Attempt but Fail:** This will be the most common scenario. Students will write something related to Harappa, but it will either be too vague, incorrect, or not address "urban planning" specifically.

4.  **Most Common Wrong Answer:**
    *   "They had cities." (Too vague, doesn't describe a *feature* of *planning*)
    *   "Advanced drainage system." (Good, but might lack the "description" part, just a list)
    *   "They had big houses." (Not specific enough to "planning" or a "key feature")
    *   "Harappan people were farmers." (Completely off-topic from urban planning)
    *   "They found many artifacts." (Off-topic)
    *   "They prayed to gods." (Off-topic)
    *   "Their cities were old." (True, but not a *feature* of *planning*)
    *   "Citadel." (A good start, but might not be described adequately as a *division of the city*)
    *   "Baked bricks." (Could be accepted if described as part of construction/planning, but might just be stated without context)

    The most common *wrong but attempting* answer would likely be something like: **"They had a good drainage system."** This is close, but often lacks the "advanced" or the context of *how* it's a feature of *planning*. If they just say "drainage system," it might not quite meet the *description* aspect for a full mark. Another very common one would be something too vague about "cities."

**Revisiting the Rubric:**
"Correctly describes one key feature, such as the well-planned grid layout of streets, the advanced drainage system, the use of baked bricks, or the division of the city into a citadel and a lower town."

This rubric is quite specific in requiring a *description*. "Advanced drainage system" would likely pass. "Drainage system" might be
