Let's break down the potential errors and then estimate the pass rate.

**Analysis of Likely Errors and Misconceptions:**

1.  **Fundamental Lack of Understanding of Voice:**
    *   **Misconception:** Many students at this level, especially with limited exposure to formal grammar instruction in English, might not even understand the terms "Active Voice" and "Passive Voice." They might have heard the terms but not grasped the concept.
    *   **Impact:** They will not know *what* they are supposed to do.
    *   **Attempt:** They might try to change *something* about the sentence, but it won't be a voice transformation. Or they might leave it unchanged if they don't understand the instruction.

2.  **Difficulty Identifying Subject/Object/Verb:**
    *   **Misconception:** Even if they know what "active" and "passive" mean, identifying "the wind" as the subject and "the leaves" as the object might be challenging.
    *   **Impact:** If they reverse the roles incorrectly or cannot identify them, they cannot form the passive structure.

3.  **Incorrect Verb Form (Past Participle):**
    *   **Misconception:** The past participle of "blow" is "blown." This is an irregular verb. Many students struggle with irregular verb forms. They might use "blew" again, or a non-existent form like "blowed."
    *   **Impact:** The core of the passive structure is `be + past participle`. If the past participle is wrong, the sentence is incorrect.

4.  **Incorrect Auxiliary Verb ("to be"):**
    *   **Misconception:** The original sentence is in the simple past tense ("blew"). The passive voice requires the "to be" verb in the *same tense*. So, "were" is needed for "leaves" (plural, past). Students might use "are," "is," "was" (incorrect for plural), or omit it entirely.
    *   **Impact:** Crucial for forming the correct passive tense.

5.  **Placement/Use of "by the wind":**
    *   **Misconception:** While technically optional in some contexts, it's often expected when the agent is known and specific, as in this question. Students might omit it, place it incorrectly, or write "from the wind."
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to a partial score or be deemed incorrect if a full transformation is expected.

6.  **Direct Translation/Literalism (Hindi/Regional Language Influence):**
    *   **Misconception:** Students might try to directly translate a Hindi passive structure, which might not map perfectly to English grammar.
    *   **Impact:** Grammatically awkward or incorrect English.

7.  **Not Attempting at All:**
    *   **Reason:** Complete lack of understanding of the instruction or fear of making a mistake.
    *   **Impact:** Zero score.

**Most Common Wrong Answers:**

Given the above, here's what the most common wrong answers would look like, ranging from "attempted but failed" to "didn't understand":

1.  **Unchanged:** "The wind blew the leaves away." (Didn't understand the instruction or how to change it).
2.  **Incorrect Verb Form/Tense, but some attempt at object-subject swap:**
    *   "The leaves blew away by the wind." (Missing "were", incorrect verb form).
    *   "The leaves was blown away by the wind." (Incorrect "was" for plural "leaves").
    *   "The leaves are blown away by the wind." (Incorrect tense - present instead of past).
    *   "The leaves blowed away by the wind." (Incorrect past participle).
3.  **Completely garbled/restructured, but not passive:**
    *   "Away went the leaves by the wind."
    *   "The leaves wind blew away."
4.  **Omitting "by the wind":** "The leaves were blown away." (This is a *partially correct* answer that might get some credit depending on the strictness of the rubric, but for "max score 1", it might be marked down).

**Revisiting the Average Pass Rate (29%):**

The average pass rate of 29% for *all* questions indicates a significant struggle. This question is relatively complex:

*   It requires understanding a specific grammatical concept (Active/Passive Voice).
*   It involves an irregular verb (blow/blew/blown).
*   It requires correct subject-verb agreement in the past tense for the passive structure.

Considering the students are mostly from economically weaker sections with limited English exposure, this question is likely to be
