I will estimate the proportion of Class 7 students in Indian government schools who would correctly answer the question: "Find the area of a triangle whose base is `8` cm and height is `6` cm," given the rubric "States or uses the correct formula for the area of a triangle: `Area = 1/2 × base × height`."

Let's break down the difficulty based on the calibration anchors:

**Key Challenges for this question:**

1.  **Recall of Formula:** Students need to recall the specific formula for the area of a triangle. This isn't just about understanding the concept of area, but remembering the `1/2 * base * height` part.
2.  **Basic Multiplication:** The calculation `1/2 * 8 * 6` involves fractions and multiplication. While `8 * 6 = 48` is simple, `1/2 * 48 = 24` is also straightforward, but calculation errors or confusion with fractions can occur.
3.  **English Comprehension:** "Find the area," "base," and "height" are standard mathematical terms, but for students with limited English, understanding the question accurately is the first hurdle.
4.  **Mathematical Anxiety/Prior Knowledge:** Mathematics can be a subject of high anxiety. If a student struggles with basic arithmetic or has missed lessons on geometry, this question will be very difficult. The average pass rate is 29%, indicating a significant portion of students are struggling learners.

**Comparing with Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of poem):** This requires abstract thinking and nuanced English comprehension. The current question is more concrete.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological vs. literary sources):** This requires recall of definitions and examples, often involving more complex vocabulary and structured writing. The current question is less demanding on English writing, but requires precise formula recall.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Short paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This allows for some creativity and simpler English, but still requires sentence construction. Many students struggled significantly, even with basic responses. The current question is more about a single, correct mathematical fact.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is a direct recall question from a story, likely taught recently. Students who paid attention and understood the story would likely get this. This is a good anchor for direct recall of a specific piece of information.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is also direct recall of two specific facts, likely memorized. The high pass rate suggests that for well-drilled facts, students can perform.

**Analysis of the "Area of a Triangle" Question:**

*   **Formula Recall:** This is the primary hurdle. Geometry formulas are often taught explicitly and drilled. If students were taught this, they either know it or they don't.
*   **Calculation:** The numbers are small and the calculation is simple. This should not be a major barrier if the formula is known.
*   **English:** "Area," "base," "height" are standard math terms. If students have learned the concept in their local language, they should recognize these terms.

The question is a direct application of a standard geometric formula. It's similar in nature to "Name two Fundamental Rights" (66%) in that it requires direct recall and application of a specific piece of information. However, math formulas can be forgotten more easily than general facts, and the `1/2` factor can sometimes be missed. Also, the average pass rate across all questions is 29%, suggesting that even "basic" concepts aren't universal.

Given the 50% and 66% anchors are for direct factual recall (story details, fundamental rights), and this is a direct formula recall and application, it should fall somewhere in that range, but likely lower due to the mathematical context and potential for calculation error or forgetting the `1/2`.

Many students struggle with math. The `1/2` is a common point of error or omission. Some might just multiply `8 * 6`. If the rubric is *strictly* "States or uses the correct formula," then just multiplying `8 * 6` would be a 0.

Considering the average pass rate is 29%, and the 50% and 66% items are purely factual recall. This question requires both recall *and* a simple calculation. It's more complex than just naming two rights. It's less abstract than differentiating sources (15%) or finding a theme (5%).

I think it's harder than the 50% item (King's questions) because the king's questions are direct plot points, while a math formula might be less ingrained for many students.
