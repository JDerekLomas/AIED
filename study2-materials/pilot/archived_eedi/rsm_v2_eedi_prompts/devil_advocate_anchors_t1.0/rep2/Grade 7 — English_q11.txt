I need to estimate the proportion of Class 7 students in Indian government schools who would correctly identify "tiny" as an adjective in the given sentence.

Let's break down the question and the student profile:
*   **Question:** Identify the adjective phrase in "A tiny bird built its nest in our balcony."
*   **Rubric:** Correctly identifies "tiny" as an adjective. (Note: The question asks for an adjective *phrase*, but the rubric specifies identifying "tiny" as an adjective. This mismatch in the question/rubric is important. If the student only identifies "tiny" and not a "phrase," they still get full marks according to the rubric). This simplifies the task for the students considerably, as identifying a single word is easier than identifying a multi-word phrase.
*   **Student Profile:** Class 7, Indian government schools, economically weaker sections, limited English, average pass rate ~29%.

**Analysis of the task for these students:**

1.  **Understanding "Adjective":** This is a core grammatical concept taught in English class. However, the depth of understanding and the ability to apply it can vary greatly. Many students might be able to *define* an adjective but struggle to *identify* it in a sentence, especially if their English exposure is limited.
2.  **Identifying "tiny":** The word "tiny" is a relatively common and simple adjective. It modifies "bird."
3.  **English Proficiency:** While limited, Class 7 students would have covered basic parts of speech. The sentence structure is straightforward.
4.  **Misinterpretation of "Adjective Phrase":** The question asks for an "adjective phrase," but the rubric only requires identifying "tiny." This is a huge simplification. If the rubric were strict on "adjective phrase," the pass rate would plummet. Since it's just "tiny," the task is much easier.

**Comparing to Calibration Anchors:**

*   **5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, understanding nuanced language, and expressing complex ideas in English. Much harder than identifying a single word.
*   **15% (Differentiate sources):** Requires understanding two distinct concepts, recalling examples, and articulating differences. More complex than identifying a word.
*   **30% (Paragraph on "My favorite season"):** Requires sustained writing, expressing personal opinions, following prompts, and managing basic paragraph structure. It shows that around 30% can produce some coherent, albeit simple, writing.
*   **50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is recall of specific factual information from a story, likely read in class. It's a comprehension check. Many students would remember these specific points.
*   **66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is recall of specific factual information, likely from a Civics or Social Science class, and is often drilled. It's also two distinct items to recall.

**Recalibrating:**

My initial instinct might be higher, but considering the "limited English" and "struggling learners" points:

*   Many students might know "adjective" in theory but struggle to pick it out consistently.
*   The word "tiny" is simple.
*   The fact that it's just one word to identify, despite the "phrase" in the question, is a major factor boosting the score. If they wrote "tiny bird" for "adjective phrase," that would likely be marked correct too, but "tiny" alone is enough.

Let's consider the 50% anchor: recalling three specific facts from a story. This involves comprehension and memory.
The 66% anchor: recalling two specific, drilled facts (Fundamental Rights). This is primarily memory.

Identifying an adjective is a basic grammar skill. If 50-66% can recall specific facts, a decent proportion should be able to identify a simple adjective in a simple sentence, *especially* with the simplified rubric.

However, the "adjective *phrase*" part of the question might trip up some students, even if the rubric is lenient. They might try to find a phrase when only a word is needed, or they might not recognize "tiny" as an adjective at all. Some will just leave it blank due to anxiety or not knowing.

Given the rubric allows for identifying just "tiny", which is a very simple adjective modifying "bird" in a straightforward sentence, this task is quite basic. It's more akin to recalling a simple fact or identifying a very basic concept. It's easier than writing a paragraph or differentiating two concepts. It's harder than simply recalling two memorized facts, but comparable to recalling three facts from a story if that story was well-understood.

I believe this would be slightly easier than the "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%) because "
