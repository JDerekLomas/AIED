I need to estimate the proportion of Class 6 Indian government school students who would correctly answer the following question:

**Question:** At `10` am in the morning, the temperature of Jodhpur was `30^0 C`. If the temperature increases by `2^0 C` per hour, then what will be the temperature of Jodhpur at 4:00 in the evening?
**Rubric:** Calculates the time elapsed from `10:00` am to `4:00` pm as `6` hours.
Max score: 1

Let's break down the question and the steps required for a correct answer:

1.  **Understand the initial temperature and time:** `30^0 C` at `10` am.
2.  **Understand the rate of increase:** `2^0 C` per hour.
3.  **Understand the target time:** `4:00` in the evening (pm).
4.  **Calculate the time elapsed:** This is the crucial step according to the rubric. From 10 am to 4 pm is 6 hours (10-11-12-1-2-3-4).
5.  **Calculate the total temperature increase:** `6` hours * `2^0 C/hour` = `12^0 C`.
6.  **Calculate the final temperature:** `30^0 C` (initial) + `12^0 C` (increase) = `42^0 C`.

The rubric specifically states: "Calculates the time elapsed from `10:00` am to `4:00` pm as `6` hours." This implies that correctly determining the time difference is the core component for receiving a score. Even if they get the final answer wrong but correctly calculate 6 hours, it might score 1 depending on the strictness of the actual marking, but the question is asking for the *proportion correct* which usually implies the full correct answer. I will assume "correctly answer" means providing the final correct temperature, which implicitly requires calculating the time elapsed.

**Analysis of difficulty:**

*   **Reading Comprehension (English):** The language is relatively straightforward. "Temperature," "increases," "per hour," "morning," "evening" are common words. However, "Jodhpur" is a place name, and "C" for Celsius might be unknown to some, but the context implies it's a unit. The biggest potential hurdle is understanding "4:00 in the evening" and relating it to "10 am in the morning" to calculate elapsed time.
*   **Mathematical Concepts:**
    *   **Time Calculation:** Calculating time difference across noon (from am to pm) can be tricky for Class 6 students, especially those who struggle with basic arithmetic or time concepts. They need to understand that 12 pm is noon, and then count hours from there. Many might simply subtract 10 from 4, getting -6 or 6, but without understanding the am/pm transition.
    *   **Multiplication:** Simple multiplication (`6 * 2`).
    *   **Addition:** Simple addition (`30 + 12`).
*   **Problem-Solving Steps:** It requires multiple steps: calculate time, calculate increase, calculate final temperature. This multi-step nature increases difficulty.
*   **Real-world context:** Temperature questions are generally relatable, but the precise calculation of time can be abstract for some.

**Calibration Anchors Comparison:**

*   **Pass rate 5%:** "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" - Requires abstract thinking, understanding poetry, and expressing a theme in English. Very difficult.
*   **Pass rate 15%:** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." - Requires definitional knowledge, comparison, and examples. Concepts can be difficult for struggling learners.
*   **Pass rate 30%:** "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'" - Requires sustained writing, organizing thoughts, and specific details. Writing paragraphs is a significant challenge for many. The examples show fragmented or very short responses.
*   **Pass rate 50%:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" - Requires recall from a specific story, which is likely taught. If they remember the story, it's straightforward recall. If not, it's a blank. The examples show partial recall.
*   **Pass rate 66%:** "Name any two Fundamental Rights..." - Requires recall of two specific facts. This is highly dependent on memorization and teaching. The examples show correct recall.

**Comparing the current question:**

*   It's a multi-step word problem, similar in structure to some math problems
