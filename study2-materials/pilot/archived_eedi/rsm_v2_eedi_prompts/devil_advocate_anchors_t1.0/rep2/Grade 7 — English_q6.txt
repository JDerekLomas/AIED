The question asks students to describe the poet's writing style. The poem "The Last Bargain" by Rabindranath Tagore is a relatively simple narrative, but understanding and articulating "writing style" requires a certain level of abstract thought and vocabulary in English.

Let's break down the challenges for the target demographic:
1.  **Limited English proficiency:** Describing a "writing style" goes beyond literal comprehension. It requires understanding nuances of language and having the vocabulary to express them (e.g., "simple," "descriptive," "informal," "direct"). Many students might understand the poem but struggle to find the right English words to characterize its style.
2.  **Abstract concept:** "Writing style" is an abstract concept. Students might be able to identify themes or characters, but analyzing the *how* of the writing can be difficult, especially if they haven't been explicitly taught stylistic analysis in a way that resonates with their level.
3.  **Lack of practice:** As noted, students might not have practiced this exact question type. They might be able to extract information but not synthesize it into an analytical description of style.
4.  **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** Even if a student has a vague idea, the pressure of the exam might lead to a blank response or a very poor attempt if they lack confidence in their English vocabulary.
5.  **Average pass rate (29%):** This overall pass rate suggests that many students struggle with even straightforward questions.

Let's compare this to the calibration anchors:

*   **Pass rate 5%:** "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" This is a very difficult question, requiring deeper interpretation and articulate expression. Describing "writing style" is arguably slightly less abstract than a "theme" but still requires analytical language.
*   **Pass rate 15%:** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each." This requires recall of specific definitions and examples, which is concrete but multi-part.
*   **Pass rate 30%:** "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'" This is a creative writing task based on personal experience, which often sees a higher pass rate because students can draw on their own lives, even with limited English. The rubric for this item allows for very basic responses to score.
*   **Pass rate 50%:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" This is a direct recall question from a text, which is generally easier.
*   **Pass rate 66%:** "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India." This is a direct recall of factual information, which is the easiest type of question for many students.

The current question ("Describes the poet's writing style") is more demanding than simple recall (like the 50% and 66% items) and more abstract than a personal paragraph (30% item). It's closer in difficulty to the "theme" question (5%) or the "differentiate" question (15%) because it requires analysis and appropriate vocabulary, not just content recall.

While "simple" or "direct" might seem obvious to a native English speaker or a well-prepared student, articulating this and choosing the correct word will be a significant hurdle. Many might write something about what the poem is *about* rather than *how* it's written. Given the limited English, the abstract nature, and the low overall pass rate, I anticipate a difficulty level closer to the lower end of the anchors.

A student might be able to say "simple" or "easy to understand," but retrieving even those words and applying them to "writing style" accurately is a stretch for many, especially if they haven't been specifically prepped. The rubric is quite generous ("suitable and relevant word"), but getting *any* suitable word is the challenge.

Considering the challenges, particularly the limited English and abstract nature of "style" analysis, this question is likely to be difficult for most of the students. It's more challenging than the 30% creative writing task and definitely harder than direct recall questions. It shares some cognitive demands with the 15% differentiation question (requiring specific vocabulary and comparative understanding) and the 5% theme question (requiring analytical abstraction).

I'll lean towards a difficulty closer to the 15% mark, as it's a single word response, making it potentially slightly easier than differentiating with examples, but still harder than basic recall or personal narrative.
