The question asks students to change a sentence from active to passive voice. This is a grammatical concept that requires understanding of sentence structure, verb tenses, and subject-object relationships.

Here's a breakdown of factors influencing the pass rate:

**Factors decreasing the pass rate:**

*   **English Proficiency:** The primary hurdle will be the limited English proficiency of students from economically weaker sections. Understanding "active voice," "passive voice," "subject," "object," and past participles (blown) will be challenging for many.
*   **Grammar Concepts:** Active/passive voice is a specific grammatical transformation. While taught, it's often a difficult concept for struggling learners to internalize and apply, especially under exam conditions. Many might get the tense wrong (e.g., "are blown") or omit "by the wind."
*   **Verb Irregularities:** The verb "blew" (past tense of "blow") becomes "blown" (past participle). Irregular verbs are a common stumbling block.
*   **Exam Anxiety/Blanks:** As noted, anxiety leads to blank responses. Students unsure of how to start or complete the transformation might leave it empty.
*   **Lack of Practice:** If this exact question type hasn't been extensively practiced, students might struggle to recall the rules.
*   **"Basic" but not basic:** For teachers, active/passive voice might seem basic. For these students, it's an abstract grammatical rule applied to a specific sentence, requiring a higher level of cognitive processing than simply recalling facts.

**Factors increasing the pass rate (slightly):**

*   **Relatively Short Sentence:** The sentence is short and straightforward, which is easier to manipulate than a longer, more complex one.
*   **Common Vocabulary:** "Wind," "blew," "leaves," "away" are common words, so vocabulary isn't the main issue.

**Calibration Anchor Comparison:**

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."** This requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and expression, which is very difficult.
*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each.** This requires understanding two concepts, comparing them, and providing examples, which is a moderate challenge. The examples show some students getting partial credit.
*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season."** This is a creative writing task on a personal topic. While it requires writing ability, the subject is accessible, allowing students to express themselves even with poor English. The examples show basic, fragmented attempts still scoring points.
*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?** This is a direct recall question from a text. If they read and remembered, it's easy. Many can recall key phrases.
*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India.** This is direct recall of facts taught in Civics. Even if English is poor, students can often list two specific rights, as seen in the examples.

**Comparison with the current question:**

The active-passive voice transformation is more complex than direct recall (50% and 66% items) and more specific than general paragraph writing (30%). It's less abstract than finding a poem's theme (5%), but arguably more difficult to execute precisely than differentiating between two types of sources (15%) because it requires a multi-step grammatical transformation.

Students need to:
1.  Identify the subject ("The wind") and object ("the leaves").
2.  Understand that the object becomes the new subject.
3.  Change the verb "blew" to "were blown" (correct tense and past participle).
4.  Add "by the wind" (optional but standard for a full transformation).

The "were blown" part is crucial and where many might stumble. Some might write "The leaves are blown away..." or "The leaves blew away..."

Given the average pass rate of 29% and the difficulty of this specific grammatical transformation for students with limited English, it will be challenging. It's not just recall; it's application of a rule. Many will likely get the tense wrong or omit parts.

I would place this question's difficulty slightly above the 15% mark but below the 30% mark. It's harder than recalling basic facts but not as open-ended as "favorite season" where any attempt gets some credit. The strictness of the rubric (correct transformation) will limit scores for partial attempts.
