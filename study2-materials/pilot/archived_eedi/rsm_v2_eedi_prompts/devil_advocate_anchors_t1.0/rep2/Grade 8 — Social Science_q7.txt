Let's break down the question and the context.

**Question Analysis:**
*   **Key terms:** "Battle of Plassey 1757," "contribute to," "expansion of British power," "India."
*   **Core concept:** Understanding the *consequence* of a specific historical event on British imperial expansion.
*   **Required knowledge:** Students need to know about the Battle of Plassey (date, participants, outcome) and its immediate aftermath in terms of British control over Bengal.
*   **Difficulty for students:**
    *   **Historical recall:** This is a specific event and date. While taught in Class 8, retention can be an issue.
    *   **Causal relationship:** Students need to connect the battle to the *expansion of power*, not just state that the British won.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Contribute," "expansion," "dominance," "puppet nawab" – these are not extremely simple terms for a student with limited English.
    *   **Formulating an answer:** Even if they know the facts, articulating them clearly in English, meeting the rubric's expectation (political dominance/control over Bengal, mention of Mir Jafar), is challenging.

**Calibration Anchors Analysis:**
*   **5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and expression in English. Very hard.
*   **15% (Differentiate sources):** Requires recalling definitions and giving examples. Factual recall and comparison. Examples show even partial answers got points, but many struggle with differentiating and providing good examples.
*   **30% (Paragraph on favorite season):** A personal, descriptive task. Relatively open-ended, but still requires sentence construction and basic paragraph writing. Pass rates show many can barely form sentences.
*   **50% (King's three questions):** Pure factual recall of specific details from a story. If they remember the story, it's straightforward. If not, it's a blank.
*   **66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Factual recall of two out of many options. If they remember any two, it's correct. High pass rate because it's a very direct recall task with multiple correct answers.

**Comparing the Target Question to Anchors:**

*   **Complexity:** The Plassey question is more complex than simply listing facts (like Fundamental Rights or King's questions). It requires understanding a historical *consequence* and articulating it.
*   **Specificity:** It's more specific than writing about a favorite season (which is personal). It's less abstract than finding a poem's theme.
*   **English demand:** Similar to the 15% item, it requires precise language to explain a historical concept. The 30% item shows basic sentence formation is a struggle.
*   **Recall vs. Interpretation:** It's primarily recall of historical facts and their immediate political implications, similar to the 15% and 50% items, but with a slightly higher demand for connecting cause and effect.
*   **Rubric:** The rubric for Plassey is quite specific: "political dominance/control over Bengal" and ideally mentioning Mir Jafar. This means a vague answer like "British got stronger" might not get a point.

**Challenging Initial Instinct:**

My first instinct might be "Battle of Plassey is important, they must know it." However, the anchors strongly suggest otherwise:
*   "Basic" concepts are not basic.
*   English limitations are severe (look at the 30% item for simple paragraph writing).
*   Even pure recall (50% item) isn't universal.
*   Connecting cause-and-effect with specific historical outcomes in proper English is harder than just recalling facts.

The question is about *how* it contributed, not just *what* happened. This requires a slightly more sophisticated answer than just "British won." Many might just write "British won" or "British got powerful," which might not be enough for the rubric without mentioning Bengal or political dominance.

The 15% item (differentiating sources) required two distinct points and examples, and many struggled. This Plassey question requires a specific historical cause-and-effect articulated clearly. It feels harder than the 50% item (direct recall of three questions) and definitely harder than the 66% item (direct recall of two rights). It's more demanding in terms of explanation than the 15% item.

Given the linguistic struggles, the need for specific historical detail, and the expectation of explaining a *contribution* (cause-and-effect), I anticipate a significant drop-off from students who might vaguely remember the battle but can't articulate its precise impact on British power in Bengal.

**Calibrated Estimate:**

This question requires specific historical knowledge
