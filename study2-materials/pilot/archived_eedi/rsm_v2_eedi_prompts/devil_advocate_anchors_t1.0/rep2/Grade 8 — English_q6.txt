The question "Define fable" requires a student to recall a specific definition, likely from a textbook or classroom instruction. Given the context of Class 8 students in Indian government schools from economically weaker sections with limited English, several factors will influence their ability to answer this correctly.

Let's break down the potential difficulties:

1.  **Vocabulary/English Proficiency:** While "fable" might seem a common word, for students with limited English, it might not be. They might have encountered the concept but not explicitly learned or memorized the English definition. Their understanding could be more illustrative (e.g., "story with animals and a lesson") rather than a formal definition.

2.  **Recall vs. Understanding:** Even if they understand what a fable is, defining it precisely as "a short story that typically uses animals as characters and imparts a moral lesson" requires specific recall. Many students might only recall parts of it (e.g., "story with animals" or "has a moral").

3.  **Prior Instruction:** The success depends heavily on whether this specific definition was taught and emphasized in their curriculum and whether the students were present and attentive during that lesson. The average pass rate of 29% suggests a significant proportion struggles with basic recall and comprehension.

4.  **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** As noted, exam anxiety can lead to blank responses, even if a student has some idea.

**Calibration against Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of "The Last Bargain"):** This requires higher-order thinking (interpreting a poem's theme) and strong English comprehension, which is very difficult. "Define fable" is more direct recall.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** This requires defining two terms and comparing them, with examples. It's more complex than defining a single term. Students getting 1 or 2 points indicates partial knowledge is often rewarded.
*   **Pass rate 30% ("My favorite season" paragraph):** This is a creative writing task within a simple structure, allowing for many different acceptable answers, even with poor English, as long as it's relevant. The scoring allows for partial credit. Defining "fable" is less forgiving in terms of what constitutes a "correct" answer.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is direct recall from a story. Students either remember the three questions or they don't. Similar to "Define fable" in terms of recall, but the king's questions might be more prominently featured and repeated in a story than a formal definition of "fable."
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** This is also direct recall of specific facts. The high pass rate suggests these are likely very emphasized topics and perhaps common knowledge, or the scoring is quite lenient (any two correct).

**Applying the insights:**

"Define fable" is a direct recall question, similar to "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50%) and "Two Fundamental Rights" (66%). However, "fable" as a *definition* might be less frequently practiced or emphasized than key elements of a story or fundamental rights, which are core civics.

The rubric for "Define fable" is quite specific: "short story," "animals as characters," and "imparts a moral lesson." A student needs to hit most of these points. Partial answers might not get full credit (Max score: 1).

Considering the limited English, the common struggles with basic concepts, and the likelihood of blank/partial responses:

*   Some students will know it perfectly.
*   Some will remember "story with animals" but forget "moral."
*   Some will remember "moral lesson" but forget "animals."
*   Many will have no idea or struggle to articulate it in English.

Compared to the 50% anchor, where the "three questions" are specific details from a narrative that might be easier to remember in context, a formal definition might be harder to recall precisely for a large group of students. The 66% anchor is likely from very prominent constitutional topics.

I'd place it closer to the 50% mark, but slightly lower due to the need for a precise *definition* and the potential for students to miss one of the key components (animals, moral, short story) given their English limitations and curriculum variation. It's not as hard as differentiating two sources (15%) or finding a theme (5%), but it's harder than simply naming two well-taught rights (66%) or recalling easily identifiable plot points (50%).

Let's say a good chunk remembers "animals" and "moral," but struggles with the "short story" aspect or the articulation.

My first instinct might be 50-
