This question asks "Who lived inside the book?" with a simple correct answer of "a magical fairy" or "fairy." This requires recalling a specific detail from a text, likely a story they read.

Let's compare this to the calibration anchors:

*   **Pass rate 66%**: "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India." This is a recall question of two specific items. Many students would have been taught this explicitly. The language is straightforward.
*   **Pass rate 50%**: "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" Another recall question, but for three specific pieces of information. It's from a story, similar to our target question. Students who read and understood the story would likely get this.
*   **Pass rate 30%**: "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season."" This requires sentence construction and expressing personal ideas, which is much harder for students with limited English than simple recall.
*   **Pass rate 15%**: "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each." This requires understanding two concepts, comparing them, and providing examples. Much higher cognitive load and specific knowledge needed.
*   **Pass rate 5%**: "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" This is a very abstract question, requiring higher-order thinking and sophisticated English expression.

Our target question, "Who lived inside the book?", is a direct recall from a story, much like the 50% anchor ("What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?"). Both require having read and understood the specific detail in the text.

However, "a magical fairy" is a single, very specific noun phrase. The "king's questions" involves recalling three distinct clauses. Sometimes, a simpler answer can be easier or harder depending on the salience of the information in the story.

Consider the potential challenges:
1.  **Limited English**: "Who lived inside the book?" is simple English. "Magical fairy" is also relatively common vocabulary, especially in stories for this age group.
2.  **Story Recall**: Did they read this specific story? Was the detail prominent? If they were absent or didn't understand that part of the story, they won't know.
3.  **Anxiety/Blank Responses**: Even if they knew, some might leave it blank.

The question structure is very similar to the 50% anchor. It's a "who" question, asking for a single entity, which might be slightly easier than recalling three distinct questions. The answer is short and specific.

Given that the 50% anchor asks for *three* specific questions, and our target asks for *one* specific entity, it might lean slightly higher than 50% if the story was widely read and the fairy was a central character. However, it's not as universally known as "Fundamental Rights" (66%).

Let's split the difference between 50% and 66%. The recall is very direct, and the answer is short.
