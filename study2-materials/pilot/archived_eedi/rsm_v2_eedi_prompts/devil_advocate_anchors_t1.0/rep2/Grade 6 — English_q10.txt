I'll break down my reasoning using the calibration anchors and the "challenge your first instinct" advice.

1.  **Initial Instinct (before challenging):** My first thought is that "some/any" is a very basic grammar concept taught early on. Many students, even with limited English, might have encountered this enough to get it right. I'd initially guess something like 60-70%.

2.  **Challenging the Instinct with Calibration Anchors:**
    *   **Pass rate 66% (Fundamental Rights):** This requires recalling two specific legal terms. It's a memory recall task. Students with *some* grasp of the topic, even if not perfect in English, can often retrieve these. The English barrier isn't as high as for comprehension or open-ended writing.
    *   **Pass rate 50% (King's questions):** This also requires recalling specific details from a story. Similar to the Fundamental Rights, if they understood and remembered the story, they could answer, despite English limitations. The examples show direct recall is acceptable.
    *   **Pass rate 30% (My favorite season - paragraph):** This is where English *composition* really comes into play. Even with bullet points of ideas, forming coherent sentences is hard. The examples show fragmented thoughts or very simple sentences. This is a much higher barrier than recalling facts.
    *   **Pass rate 15% (Archaeological vs. Literary sources):** Requires both recall of definitions *and* the ability to differentiate and provide examples, which is a higher-order thinking skill. English proficiency also starts to matter more for articulating the difference.
    *   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of "The Last Bargain"):** This is extremely difficult. It requires deep comprehension, inferential reasoning, and the ability to articulate an abstract concept (theme) in English. The examples show students struggling with basic understanding, let alone abstract themes.

3.  **Applying to "Some/Any":**
    *   **Concept Difficulty:** The "some" vs. "any" distinction for positive vs. negative/interrogative sentences is indeed fundamental. It's often taught through repetition.
    *   **English Barrier:** The sentence itself is very simple: "There are ___ apples in the basket." No complex vocabulary.
    *   **Question Type:** It's a multiple-choice/fill-in-the-blank with two options, making it easier than open-ended questions.
    *   **Likely Exposure:** Students would likely hear "some apples" in everyday classroom English and in textbooks more often than "any apples" in a positive statement.
    *   **Common Error:** The main error would be choosing "any," perhaps due to confusion or simply guessing randomly. However, "some" is the overwhelmingly more natural and common usage in this context.
    *   **Comparison to Anchors:**
        *   It's easier than the paragraph writing (30%) because it doesn't require *producing* a sentence, just selecting a word.
        *   It's simpler than differentiating sources (15%) or finding a theme (5%) because it's a basic grammatical rule, not a higher-order thinking skill.
        *   It's comparable in *type* to the recall questions (50-66%), but it's a grammatical rule rather than a factual recall. The key difference is that while facts can be memorized, grammar rules need to be *applied*. However, this specific application is very common.

4.  **Recalibrating:**
    *   The fact that it's a simple, common grammatical rule, with a clear correct answer in a positive statement, means many students would likely have drilled this.
    *   The English sentence itself is so basic that the "limited English" factor is less detrimental than for more complex questions.
    *   The low bar for "correct" (just choosing one word) reduces the impact of writing anxiety or poor articulation.

    I think my initial estimate was a bit high considering the *average* pass rate is only 29% and the "challenging assumptions" warning. However, this is *much* easier than the 30% and below questions. It's probably easier than the 50% questions because it doesn't rely on remembering specific content from a story, but rather a widely applicable grammar rule. It's closer to the 66% level in terms of simplicity and directness, but perhaps slightly lower because grammar application can still trip up students even if it seems "basic." The main challenge would be those who have genuinely had almost no exposure to basic English grammar or simply guess incorrectly.

    I'll lean slightly below the 66% anchor, but well above the 50%.
