I'm tasked with estimating the proportion of Class 6 Indian government school students who would correctly answer the question: "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India." They need to name one correct range to get 0.5 points.

Here's my thought process, using the calibration anchors and keeping in mind the student profile (economically weaker, limited English, average pass rate ~29%):

1.  **Analyze the question:**
    *   **Concept:** Basic geography of India. Mountain ranges.
    *   **Vocabulary:** "Major mountain ranges," "located in India." These are fairly common terms in a geography context.
    *   **Cognitive Load:** Recall. Students need to remember the names of at least one mountain range.
    *   **Output:** One name. Very low writing burden.

2.  **Initial Instinct (and why it might be wrong):** My first thought is relatively high, maybe 40-50%. Why? Because "Himalayas" is a very prominent feature and usually taught early in geography. Aravalli, Vindhya, Western/Eastern Ghats are also significant. It seems like a fundamental piece of knowledge.

3.  **Challenging the Instinct with Calibration Anchors:**

    *   **Pass rate 66% (Name any two Fundamental Rights):** This question requires recalling specific, somewhat abstract political science terms. Students need to get two for a full point, one for half. The fact that 66% got at least one suggests that rote memorization of key terms, even if abstract, can be high if it's emphasized. "Right to equality" and "Right to freedom" are common.
    *   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This requires recall of a specific detail from a story. The answers are quite long (e.g., "the right time to do everything"). Students often struggle with recalling exact phrases. Yet, 50% got it. This implies that if a concept is central to a story or topic, recall can be moderate.
    *   **Pass rate 30% (Write a paragraph on "My favorite season"):** This requires creative writing, expressing preferences, and some English fluency. It's a much higher cognitive and linguistic load. The pass rate is lower, as expected.
    *   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources):** This requires understanding two concepts, differentiating them, and providing examples. It's a higher-order thinking skill than simple recall, plus a higher writing burden. Pass rate is low.
    *   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of "The Last Bargain"):** This is abstract, requires interpretation, and expressing a complex idea. Very high cognitive load, very low pass rate.

4.  **Re-evaluating "Name any two major mountain ranges":**

    *   **"Himalayas" is extremely prominent.** It's hard to imagine an Indian geography curriculum not highlighting the Himalayas in Class 6. Other ranges like Aravalli, Vindhya, Western/Eastern Ghats are also likely covered.
    *   **Low English barrier:** Just needs a single word or a short phrase. "Himalayas" is widely recognized.
    *   **Low writing burden:** Not a sentence, not a paragraph.
    *   **Core geography:** This is basic factual recall for a core subject.

    Comparing this to the 66% Fundamental Rights question:
    *   Both are factual recall.
    *   "Himalayas" is arguably *more* concrete and visually reinforced than "Right to Equality."
    *   The "Fundamental Rights" question required *two* for a full score, but one was sufficient for a partial score (which is effectively what this mountain range question is asking for, getting 0.5 points for one correct answer). The fact that 66% got *at least one* Fundamental Right is a strong indicator that recall for prominent, taught facts can be quite high.

    Comparing to the 50% "King's questions":
    *   The king's questions were longer phrases, suggesting a slightly higher recall burden. "Himalayas" is a single word.
    *   Geography is a core subject, and major features are usually emphasized.

    Given that a student only needs to name *one* range correctly, and "Himalayas" is almost universally known/taught, I expect a relatively high success rate for this specific item. It's a foundational fact. The low English barrier and minimal writing make it accessible even for struggling students if they've encountered the name.

5.  **Final Calibration:**
    The 66% anchor for "Name any two Fundamental Rights" is very instructive. Those are
