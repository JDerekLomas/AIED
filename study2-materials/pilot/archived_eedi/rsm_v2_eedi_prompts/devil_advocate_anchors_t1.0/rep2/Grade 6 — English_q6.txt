I will use the provided calibration anchors and insights to estimate the proportion of Class 6 students who would answer the question correctly.

**Analyzing the Question:** "Which line from the poem do you like the most and why?"

**Rubric:** Denotes a line from the poem and mentions why. (Max score: 1.5)

**Difficulty factors:**

1.  **Reading Comprehension:** Students need to have read and understood the poem (which is not provided, but we can assume it's a poem they've studied). The poem is "The Last Bargain," which had a 5% pass rate for identifying its theme. This suggests the poem itself might be challenging for many students.
2.  **Recall/Selection:** They need to recall a specific line *from the poem*. This requires retention and understanding of the poem's content.
3.  **Opinion Formation:** They need to decide which line they *like the most*. This is subjective but still requires engagement with the text.
4.  **Justification:** They need to explain *why* they like that line. This demands a simple argumentative or explanatory sentence, which can be challenging for students with limited English.
5.  **English Proficiency:** The response needs to be in English. Even simple "because..." constructions can be difficult.
6.  **Question Type:** This is a subjective, open-ended question that requires more than just recalling a fact. It's similar in a way to the "favorite season" question (30% pass rate) but requires interacting with a specific text.

**Comparing with Anchors:**

*   **"Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" (5% pass rate):** This question is about interpreting the poem, which is a higher-level task. The current question is about *liking* a line, which is less about deep interpretation, but still requires understanding the poem. The very low pass rate here indicates that "The Last Bargain" might be a tough poem for these students. If only 5% could get the theme, how many could confidently pick a line *and* explain why?
*   **"Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources..." (15% pass rate):** This requires conceptual understanding and comparison, and specific examples. It's more factual/conceptual than the target question.
*   **"Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'" (30% pass rate):** This is a good comparison point. It's open-ended, subjective, asks for a "favorite" and "why," and requires some descriptive writing. The target question is similar but *constrained by the poem*. The requirement to specifically "denote a line" adds a layer of difficulty. If 30% could write about their favorite season (a very personal and accessible topic), doing something similar but tied to a potentially difficult poem might yield lower results.
*   **"What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" (50% pass rate):** This is recall of specific facts from a story. Much easier than interpreting or justifying a preference.
*   **"Name any two Fundamental Rights..." (66% pass rate):** This is recall of specific factual information. Very different.

**Challenging Initial Instincts:**

My first instinct might be that choosing a favorite line and giving a simple reason isn't *that* hard. However, considering the calibration anchors and the specific student population:

*   **Limited English:** Even simple reasons like "because it talks about freedom" or "because it is beautiful" might be grammatically challenging. Many might just write the line without a reason, or a very poor reason. The rubric demands "mentions why."
*   **Poem Difficulty:** The 5% pass rate for the poem's theme is a huge red flag. If students barely grasp the theme, choosing a favorite line and articulating *why* they like it will be very difficult. They might pick a random line or struggle to articulate a reason beyond "I like it."
*   **Exam Anxiety/Blank Responses:** As noted, this leads to lower scores.
*   **"Denotes a line":** Students need to correctly identify a line from the poem. This isn't just "write something you liked."

**Revised Estimation:**

The "favorite season" question (30%) is the closest in terms of requiring a subjective choice and justification. However, the current question is significantly harder because:
1.  It's tied to a specific, potentially difficult poem ("The Last Bargain" with its 5% theme pass rate).
2.  It requires accurately quoting or at least clearly identifying a line *from that poem*.
3.  The justification needs to relate to *that specific line's content or impact*, not
