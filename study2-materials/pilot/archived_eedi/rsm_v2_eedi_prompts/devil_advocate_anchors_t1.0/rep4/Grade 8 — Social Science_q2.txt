I'll analyze the question and compare it to the calibration anchors, keeping in mind the students' limited English, economic background, and the tendency of experts to overestimate.

**Question Analysis:**
*   **Concept:** Harappan Civilization's urban planning. This is a specific historical topic, likely taught in Class 8 history.
*   **Task:** "Describe one key feature." This requires recall and a brief descriptive sentence or phrase.
*   **Language:** "Describe," "key feature," "urban planning," "Harappan Civilization." These are moderate vocabulary words for a Class 8 student. "Urban planning" might be less familiar than "city plan."
*   **Expected Answer:** Something like "They had good drainage," "Streets were in a grid," "Used baked bricks," or "Cities divided into parts."

**Comparison to Anchors:**

*   **Pass rate 5% (Theme of poem):** Requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and expressing a complex idea. The question at hand is more direct recall.
*   **Pass rate 15% (Differentiate archaeological/literary sources):** Requires understanding two distinct concepts, differentiation, and providing examples. More complex than recalling one feature.
*   **Pass rate 30% (Short paragraph "My favorite season"):** This is a creative writing task requiring 6-8 lines, which is a substantial amount of English for these students. It's personal, so no factual recall, but the output requirement is high. Many students might struggle to produce enough coherent English.
*   **Pass rate 50% (Three questions the king wanted to answer):** This is direct recall from a story. It requires remembering specific details and listing them. The language is straightforward. This feels somewhat comparable in terms of recall, but the Harappan question is about a specific historical concept rather than a story detail. The "three questions" are concrete items, whereas "urban planning features" might be slightly more conceptual.
*   **Pass rate 66% (Two Fundamental Rights):** Direct recall of specific legal/civic concepts. Requires remembering two items. The terms "Fundamental Rights" are probably well-drilled. The output is minimal (just naming two).

**Challenging Assumptions:**

*   **Limited English:** Students might know the facts in their native language but struggle to articulate them in English. "Urban planning" might be confusing. "Drainage system" or "grid layout" might be hard to phrase.
*   **"Basic" concepts:** Harappan Civilization is a core Class 8 history topic. However, "urban planning" as a specific feature might not be as universally remembered as, say, "who was the first Prime Minister."
*   **Exam anxiety/blank responses:** Even if they know it, some will leave it blank.
*   **Absence/Lack of practice:** Not all students would have been present for that lesson or practiced answering in English.

**Reasoning:**

The question requires factual recall of a specific historical concept. It's more complex than just naming two rights (66% anchor) but less demanding than differentiating between two concepts (15% anchor) or writing a lengthy paragraph (30% anchor).

The "Three questions the king wanted to answer" (50% anchor) is a good comparison point for direct recall. However, "urban planning" might be slightly more abstract than specific questions from a story. Also, "one key feature" is a bit open-ended, which can sometimes be harder for students than listing concrete items. Some students might remember general facts about Harappan civilization but struggle to pinpoint a "key feature of urban planning" specifically and articulate it in English.

Considering the common pitfalls (English limitations, conceptual difficulty, blank responses), I think it will be lower than the 50% anchor. The 30% anchor is for creative writing, which is a different skill, but the output demand is high there. This question demands accurate conceptual recall in English, which many might fail to do even if they have some idea.

I'm leaning towards a rate slightly above the 30% anchor but below the 50% anchor, given the specific nature of the recall and the potential English challenges in describing it. The concept itself is fundamental to Harappan studies, but expressing it correctly and precisely is the challenge.

Let's consider what a "score 1" would look like. "They had good drains." "Their roads were straight." These are relatively simple phrases.

I'll lean towards the lower end of the middle range.

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 40%
