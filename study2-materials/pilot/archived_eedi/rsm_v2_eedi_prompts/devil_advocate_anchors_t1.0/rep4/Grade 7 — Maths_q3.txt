I will analyze the question and the calibration anchors to make an informed estimate.

The question asks students to find the area of a triangle given its base and height. This requires:
1.  Knowing the formula for the area of a triangle (Area = 1/2 * base * height).
2.  Being able to substitute the given values (8 cm and 6 cm) into the formula.
3.  Performing the multiplication and division correctly.
4.  Understanding the English used in the question ("find the area," "base is," "height is").

Let's consider the calibration anchors:

*   **Pass rate 5%:** "Write a theme or central idea of the poem 'The Last Bargain.'" This is highly abstract and requires nuanced understanding of literature and expressive English. Very few students can do this.
*   **Pass rate 15%:** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each." This requires conceptual understanding, comparative analysis, and recall of specific examples. It's an information retrieval and comparison task, which is harder than direct application.
*   **Pass rate 30%:** "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on 'My favorite season.'" This is a creative writing task requiring sentence construction, vocabulary, and coherence. Even with simple language, many struggle to produce a coherent paragraph of that length.
*   **Pass rate 50%:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" This is a direct recall question from a specific text. If students remember the story, it's easy. If not, they get 0. This suggests that about half the students have sufficient recall and reading comprehension for basic information.
*   **Pass rate 66%:** "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India." This is a direct recall question of factual information, likely from civics/social studies. Similar to the 50% item, it tests recall, but perhaps these rights are more frequently discussed or simpler to remember than the specific king's questions.

Now, let's assess the target question:

*   **Mathematical Concept:** The area of a triangle is a fundamental concept taught in middle school mathematics (Class 7). The formula `Area = 1/2 × base × height` is a cornerstone.
*   **Language Barrier:** The language is quite straightforward: "Find the area," "base is X," "height is Y." This is less abstract than literary analysis or historical differentiation.
*   **Recall vs. Application:** It's an application of a formula, not just pure recall. However, if they know the formula, the application is direct.
*   **Common Errors:** Students might forget the "1/2", or make calculation errors, or write the formula but not the answer. The rubric focuses only on *stating or using the correct formula*. This means even if they mess up the calculation but write `1/2 * 8 * 6`, they get a point. This significantly increases the pass rate.

Comparing to anchors:
*   It's far less abstract than the 5% and 15% items.
*   It's less demanding creatively than the 30% item.
*   It's an application, not just recall like the 50% and 66% items, but the *formula itself* is a piece of recallable information, and its application is simple.

The fact that the rubric states "States or uses the correct formula" is crucial. This means a student who writes "Area = 1/2 * b * h" or "Area = 1/2 * 8 * 6" gets full credit, even if they don't solve it to "24 sq cm". This removes the calculation error as a barrier to getting credit.

Knowing the formula is a direct recall item. Applying it with simple numbers is a very basic step.
The 50% and 66% items are purely recall based. A mathematical formula like the area of a triangle is very basic and frequently reinforced. It's likely as well-known, if not better, than specific historical details or constitutional rights. The language is also very direct.

Given the rubric's generosity (just "states or uses the correct formula"), and the fundamental nature of the concept, I expect this to be on the higher end of the pass rates for recall/application. Students often struggle with *multi-step problems* or *conceptual explanations*, but this is a very direct, single-formula application.

If 66% can recall two fundamental rights, a good portion should be able to recall and apply a basic math formula. The difficulty comes from recalling the formula and understanding the question. The English is not a major barrier here.

Challenging my assumption:
