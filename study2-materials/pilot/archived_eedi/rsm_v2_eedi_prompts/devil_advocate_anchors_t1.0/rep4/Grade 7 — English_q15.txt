I will use the provided calibration anchors to estimate the pass rate for the given question.

**Analysis of the target question:**
*   **Topic:** "My Favourite Hobby" - This is a very common, personal topic that students are likely to have thought about. It doesn't require specific academic knowledge.
*   **Format:** Short paragraph (4-5 sentences). This is a standard writing task.
*   **Requirements:** Mention what it is, when you do it, and why you enjoy it. These are straightforward prompts for personal expression.
*   **Language:** Requires basic English vocabulary and sentence construction to describe a personal activity.

**Comparing with Calibration Anchors:**

*   **Item (pass rate 30%): Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season." Talk about what you like to do, what you eat or wear, and w**
    *   This is the most similar anchor. It's a personal paragraph about a favorite topic, with specific prompts. The length requirement (6-8 lines) is slightly longer than the target question's (4-5 sentences).
    *   The examples show very basic English, sometimes fragmented, but still scoring.
    *   The topic "My favorite season" is also very relatable.

*   **Item (pass rate 50%): What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?**
    *   This requires recall of specific information from a story, but the answer itself can be listed or stated simply.
    *   The pass rate of 50% suggests that simple recall of known information, even if specific, is achievable for about half the students.

*   **Item (pass rate 66%): Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India.**
    *   This is purely recall of two specific terms. The high pass rate indicates that simple recall of known terms (which might be memorized) is very achievable.

*   **Item (pass rate 15%): Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each.**
    *   This requires understanding two distinct concepts and providing examples, which is more complex than simply stating a preference or recalling facts. The pass rate is accordingly lower.

*   **Item (pass rate 5%): Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."**
    *   This requires abstract thinking, interpretation, and articulation of a complex idea. The very low pass rate is understandable.

**Reasoning for the Estimate:**

The target question is very similar to "My favorite season" (30% pass rate) in terms of structure and personal nature.
*   Both ask for a short paragraph about a "favorite" thing.
*   Both provide specific prompts to guide the content.
*   "My Favourite Hobby" might be slightly easier than "My Favorite Season" because students often have a clearer, more consistent idea of a hobby they actively pursue, compared to describing a season with multiple facets.
*   The length requirement for the target question (4-5 sentences) is slightly shorter than "My Favorite Season" (6-8 lines), which could make it marginally easier to complete.

Given that students often struggle with English and complex tasks, but can perform reasonably well on personal, guided writing prompts:
*   It's more complex than simply naming two rights (66%) or recalling three questions (50%).
*   It's less abstract than finding a poem's theme (5%) or differentiating academic concepts (15%).
*   It sits squarely in the range of basic paragraph writing about a personal topic, similar to "My favorite season."

The examples for "My favorite season" show that even very limited English can score, as long as the core prompts are addressed. Many students, even with limited English, can string together simple sentences like "My hobby is playing cricket. I play in the evening. I like it because it is fun."

Therefore, I anticipate it will perform similarly to, or slightly better than, "My favorite season."

**Final Estimate:**

ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 35%
