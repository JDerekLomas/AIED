Here's my calibrated estimate for the "Battle of Plassey" question, along with my reasoning:

**ESTIMATED PROPORTION CORRECT: 18%**

Here's why I landed on 18%, significantly lower than what one might initially guess:

*   **Content Specificity and Recall (Low Score Anchor: 5% "The Last Bargain" theme):** The question requires specific historical knowledge (Battle of Plassey, 1757) and an understanding of its *consequences* for British power. This isn't just about recalling facts, but connecting cause and effect. Many students might know *of* Plassey but struggle to articulate its *contribution to British expansion* in a clear, concise way that hits the rubric's "political dominance/control over Bengal" point. The 5% anchor shows how few students can extract and articulate a theme, which is a similar level of conceptual understanding and articulation to explaining a historical consequence.

*   **English Language Barrier (General Observation from Anchors):** Even in questions with higher pass rates (e.g., "My favorite season" at 30%), the quality of English is very basic. For a historical question, students need to string together more complex sentences to explain a causal relationship. Words like "contribute," "expansion," "dominance," "puppet nawab" are not basic vocabulary. A student who struggles with "Happiness is find in innocence" (a 5% correct response) will likely struggle to explain the intricacies of political control.

*   **Abstract Concept (Relative to other anchors):** Explaining "political dominance" or "puppet nawab" is more abstract than naming fundamental rights (66%), identifying questions a king asked (50%), or even describing favorite seasons (30%). It's closer to differentiating historical sources (15%) which requires conceptual clarity, but even that is more definitional than explanatory of a complex historical process.

*   **Curriculum Coverage and Depth:** While the Battle of Plassey is a significant event, the depth to which its *contribution to British power* is explained in a way that matches the rubric might not be universal, especially for struggling learners who might have missed lessons or not grasped the nuances.

*   **Likelihood of Partial or Irrelevant Information:** Many students might write something about the battle itself (who fought, when) but fail to link it directly to the *expansion of British power* or the specific outcome in Bengal (e.g., Mir Jafar). The rubric is quite specific about needing to explain "political dominance/control over Bengal." Just saying "British won" wouldn't be enough.

*   **"Differentiate between archaeological and literary sources" (15% anchor):** This requires specific definitions and examples. The Plassey question similarly requires specific historical explanation of a consequence. The 15% anchor suggests that even for two distinct categories, a significant portion of students struggle. The Plassey question, while about a single event, demands a similar level of precise explanation of impact.

**Why not lower than 15%?** The Battle of Plassey is a very prominent event in Indian history curricula. Even if the explanation is rudimentary, some students will recall enough to get the gist of British control. It's likely more universally taught than the theme of a specific poem.

**Why not higher than 15%?** The bar for getting full credit ("explaining that the victory at Plassey led to the establishment of British political dominance/control over Bengal") is quite high given the English proficiency and the conceptual nature of the answer. Many will miss the "political dominance" or "Bengal control" aspect.

Considering the specific nature of the historical explanation required, the English language demands, and the pattern of difficulty shown in the calibration anchors, 18% seems a realistic estimate for the proportion of students who would provide a satisfactory answer according to the rubric.
