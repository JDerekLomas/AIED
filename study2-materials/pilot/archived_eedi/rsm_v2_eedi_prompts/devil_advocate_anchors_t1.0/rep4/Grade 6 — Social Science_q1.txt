This question asks students to recall two major mountain ranges in India.

Let's consider the calibration anchors:
*   **66% pass rate:** "Name any two Fundamental Rights provided by the Constitution of India." This is a straightforward recall question from Civics, a subject they would have covered. It requires memorization of specific terms.
*   **50% pass rate:** "What were the three questions the king wanted to answer?" This is a recall question about a story, likely from their English textbook. It's direct but requires memory of a specific plot point.
*   **30% pass rate:** "Write a short paragraph (6-8 lines) on "My favorite season."" This requires sentence construction and descriptive writing, which is significantly more complex than simple recall, even for a familiar topic.
*   **15% pass rate:** "Differentiate between archaeological sources and literary sources of history by giving one example for each." This requires understanding a concept and providing examples, a higher-order thinking skill than simple recall, and involving more specific academic vocabulary.
*   **5% pass rate:** "Write a theme or central idea of the poem "The Last Bargain."" This is a very high-level analytical task, requiring interpretation and articulation of abstract ideas, which is extremely difficult for these students.

The target question "Name any two major mountain ranges located in India" is a direct recall question, similar in structure to the 66% and 50% pass rate questions.

Key considerations:
*   **Subject Matter:** Geography. Mountain ranges are fundamental geographical features, likely covered in primary school geography.
*   **Recall vs. Comprehension/Analysis:** It's pure recall, like naming Fundamental Rights or a king's questions. This is generally easier than explanation or analysis.
*   **Specificity:** India has several prominent mountain ranges (Himalayas, Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats). Students don't need to know all of them, just two. "Himalayas" is almost universally known.
*   **English Proficiency:** The question is straightforward English ("Name any two major mountain ranges located in India"). The names of the ranges are proper nouns, not complex vocabulary.
*   **Rubric:** The rubric gives a 0.5 score for naming *one* correct mountain range. This means even if they only remember one, they get partial credit. The question asks for two, but the rubric implies getting *one* is sufficient for a "correct" response (or at least partial credit which is likely what "proportion correct" refers to in this context, meaning getting at least some points). If "proportion correct" means getting *full* points (i.e., naming two), the percentage would be lower. Assuming it means getting *any* points (0.5 or 1), then remembering one is enough.

Comparing to anchors:
*   It's simpler than the 50% anchor (three questions vs. two ranges, and mountain ranges are perhaps more foundational geography than specific story details).
*   It's perhaps a bit easier than the 66% anchor because "Himalayas" is arguably more common knowledge for a primary student than specific "Fundamental Rights," which require more formal memorization of civics terms. However, both are recall.

Let's assume "proportion correct" refers to getting at least 0.5 points (naming one range).
Himalayas is almost a guaranteed name for many students. Even if they struggle with a second, getting the Himalayas would yield partial credit.

Given the direct nature, the common knowledge of at least one major range (Himalayas), and the partial credit for just one, this question should perform relatively well for a recall-based item. It's less abstract than Fundamental Rights and about a more concrete, visually representable topic.

I'll lean towards the higher end of recall questions. While not everyone will know two, a significant portion will know at least "Himalayas," and many might know a second one like Aravalli or Vindhya/Satpura.

Challenging my assumption:
*   Limited English: The question is simple. "Mountain ranges" might be unfamiliar to *some*, but "mountain" is very common.
*   "Basic" concepts aren't basic: While "Himalayas" feels basic, other ranges might not be universally known. But only one is needed for partial credit.
*   Anxiety/blank responses: This affects all questions, but a straightforward recall task might trigger fewer blanks than a complex one.
*   Never practiced: While not this *exact* question, naming geographical features is a common school activity.

Given the partial credit for just one, and the common knowledge of the Himalayas, I anticipate a relatively high pass rate for these students, likely above the
